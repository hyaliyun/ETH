Mivar (Multidimensional Informational Variable Adaptive Reality) was developed by combining production and Petri nets. The Mivar-based approach was developed for semantic analysis and adequate representation of humanitarian epistemological and axiological principles in the process of developing artificial intelligence. The Mivar-based approach incorporates computer science, informatics and discrete mathematics, databases, expert systems, graph theory, matrices and inference systems. The Mivar-based approach involves two technologies: * Information accumulation is a method of creating global evolutionary data-and-rules bases with variable structure. It works on the basis of adaptive, discrete, mivar-oriented information space, unified data and rules representation, based on three main concepts: ‚Äúobject, property, relation‚Äù. Information accumulation is designed to store any information with possible evolutionary structure and without limitations concerning the amount of information and forms of its presentation. * Data processing is a method of creating a logical inference system or automated algorithm construction from modules, services or procedures on the basis of a trained mivar network of rules with linear computational complexity. Mivar data processing includes logical inference, computational procedures and services. Mivar networks allow us to develop cause-effect dependencies (‚ÄúIf-then‚Äù) and create an automated, trained, logical reasoning system. Representatives of Russian association for artificial intelligence (RAAI) ‚Äì for example, V. I. Gorodecki, doctor of technical science, professor at SPIIRAS and V. N. Vagin, doctor of technical science, professor at MPEI declared that the term is incorrect and suggested that the author should use standard terminology.  History  While working in the Russian Ministry of Defense, O. O. Varlamov started developing the theory of ‚Äúrapid logical inference‚Äù in 1985. He was analyzing Petri nets and productions to construct algorithms. Generally, mivar-based theory represents an attempt to combine entity-relationship models and their problem instance ‚Äì semantic networks and Petri networks. The abbreviation MIVAR was introduced as a technical term by O. O. Varlamov, Doctor of Technical Science, professor at Bauman MSTU in 1993 to designate a ‚Äúsemantic unit‚Äù in the process of mathematical modeling. The term has been established and used in all of his further works. The first experimental systems operating according to mivar- based principles were developed in 2000. Applied mivar systems were introduced in 2015.  Mivar  Mivar is the smallest structural element of discrete information space.  Object-property-relation  Object-Property-Relation (VSO) is a graph, the nodes of which are concepts and arcs are connections between concepts. Mivar space represents a set of axes, a set of elements, a set of points of space and a set of values of points. A = \\\\\\\\{a_n\\\\\\\\}, n = 1,\\\\ldots,N, where: * A is a set of mivar space axis names; * N is a number of mivar space axes. Then: \\\\forall a_n \\\\exists F_n =\\\\\\\\{ f_{{ni}_n}\\\\\\\\}, n=1,\\\\ldots,N, i_n = 1, \\\\ldots, I_n, where: * F_n is a set of axis a_n elements; * i_n is a set F_n element identifier; * I_n = |F_n|. F_n sets form multidimensional space: M=F_1\\\\times F_2\\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times F_n. m = (i_1, i_2,\\\\ldots ,i_N), where: * m \\\\in M; * m is a point of multidimensional space; * (i_1, i_2,\\\\ldots, i_N) are coordinates of point m. There is a set of values of multidimensional space points of M: : C_M=\\\\\\\\{c_{i_1,i_2,\\\\ldots,i_N} \\\\mid i_1 = 1,\\\\ldots,I_1, i_2 = 1,\\\\ldots,I_2, \\\\ldots , i_n = 1,\\\\ldots,I_N\\\\\\\\}, where: * c_{i_1,i_2,\\\\ldots,i_N} is a value of the point of multidimensional space M is a value of the point of multidimensional space (i_1,i_2,\\\\ldots,i_N). For every point of space M there is a single value from C_M set or there is no such value. Thus,C_M is a set of data model state changes represented in multidimensional space. To implement a transition between multidimensional space and set of points values the relation \\\\mu has been introduced: C_x=\\\\mu(M_x), Mivar information space where: * M_x\\\\subseteq M; * M_x = F_{1x}\\\\times F_{2x} \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times F_{Nx}. To describe a data model in mivar information space it is necessary to identify three axes: * The axis of relations ¬´O¬ª; * The axis of attributes (properties) ¬´S¬ª; * The axis of elements (objects) of subject domain ¬´V¬ª. These sets are independent. The mivar space can be represented by the following tuple: : \\\\langle V, S, O\\\\rangle Thus, mivar is described by ¬´VSO¬ª formula, in which ¬´V¬ª denotes an object or a thing, ¬´S¬ª denotes properties, ¬´O¬ª variety of relations between other objects of a particular subject domain. The category ‚ÄúRelations‚Äù can describe dependencies of any complexity level: formulae, logical transitions, text expressions, functions, services, computational procedures and even neural networks. A wide range of capabilities complicates description of modeling interconnections, but can take into consideration all the factors. Mivar computations use mathematical logic. In a simplified form they can be represented as implication in the form of an \\"if‚Ä¶, then ‚Ä¶‚Äù formula. The result of mivar modeling can be represented in the form of a bipartite graph binding two sets of objects: source objects and resultant objects.  Mivar network  Mivar network representation in the form of a bipartite directed graph Mivar network is a method for representing objects of the subject domain and their processing rules in the form of a bipartite directed graph consisting of objects and rules. A Mivar network is a bipartite graph that can be described in the form of a two-dimensional matrix, in that records information about the subject domain of the current task. Generally, mivar networks provide formalization and representation of human knowledge in the form of a connected multidimensional space. That is, a mivar network is a method of representing a piece of mivar space information in the form of a bipartite, directed graph. The mivar space information is formed by objects and connections, which in total represent the data model of the subject domain. Connections include rules for objects processing. Thus, a mivar network of a subject domain is a part of the mivar space knowledge for that domain. The graph can consist of objects-variables and rules-procedures. First, two lists are made that form two nonintersecting partitions: the list of objects and the list of rules. Objects are denoted by circles. Each rule in a mivar network is an extension of productions, hyper-rules with multi-activators or computational procedures. It is proved that from the perspective of further processing, these formalisms are identical and in fact are nodes of the bipartite graph, denoted by rectangles. = Multi-dimensional binary matrices = Mivar networks can be implemented on single computing systems or service-oriented architectures. Certain constraints restrict their application, in particular, the dimension of matrix of linear matrix method for determining logical inference path on the adaptive rule networks. The matrix dimension constraint is due to the fact that implementation requires sending a general matrix to multiple processors. Since every matrix value is initially represented in symbol form, the amount of sent data is crucial when obtaining, for example, 10000 rules/variables. Classical mivar-based method requires storing three values in each matrix cell: * 0 ‚Äì no value; * x ‚Äì input variable for the rule; * y ‚Äì output variable for the rule. The analysis of possibility of firing a rule is separated from determining output variables according to stages after firing the rule. Consequently, it is possible to use different matrices for ‚Äúsearch for fired rules‚Äù and ‚Äúsetting values for output variables‚Äù. This allowsthe use of multidimensional binary matrices. Binary matrix fragments occupy much less space and improve possibilities of applying mivar networks.  Logical and computational data processing  To implement logical-and-computational data processing the following should be done. First, a formalized subject domain description is developed. The main objects-variables and rules-procedures are specified on the basis of mivar-based approach and then corresponding lists of ‚Äúobjects‚Äù and ‚Äúrules‚Äù are formed. This formalized representation is analogous to the bipartite logical network graph. The main stages of mivar-based information processing are: * Forming a subject domain matrix; * Working with the matrix and designing the solution algorithm for the task; * Executing the computations and finding the solution. The first stage is the stage of synthesis of conceptual subject domain model and its formalization in the form of production rules with a transition to mivar rules. ‚ÄúInput objects ‚Äì rules/procedures ‚Äì output objects‚Äù. Currently, this stage is the most complex and requires involvement of a human expert to develop a mivar model of the subject domain. Automated solution algorithm construction or logical inference is implemented at the second stage. Input data for algorithm construction are: mivar matrix of subject domain description and a set input of object-variables and required object-variables. The solution is implemented at the third stage. = Data processing method = Firstly, the matrix is constructed. Matrix analysis determines whether a successful inference path exists. Then possible logical inference paths are defined and at the last stage the shortest path is selected according to the set optimality criteria. 230x230px Let m rules and n variables be included in the rules as input variables activating them or as output variables. Then, matrix V(m\\\\cdot n), each row of which corresponds to one of the rules and contains the information about variables used in the rule, can represent all the interconnections between rules and variables. * In each row all the input variables are denoted by x in the corresponding positions of the matrix, all the output variables are denoted by y. * All the variables that have already obtained certain value in the process of inference or setting input data ‚Äì z. * All the required (output) variables, that is, the variables that should be obtained on the basis of input data ‚Äì w. One row and one column are added in the matrix V to store service information. 564x564px So, the matrix V of dimension (m+n)\\\\times(n+1), is obtained, which shows the whole structure of the source rule network. The structure of this logical network can change, that is, this is a network of rules with evolutionary dynamics. = Example = To search for a logical inference path the following actions are implemented: # Known variables are denoted by z and required variables are denoted by w in the row (m+1). For example, z denotes positions: 1,2,3 in the row (m+1)), the variable w denotes the position (n-2). # The search of such rules that can be fired, that is, all the input variables of which are known, is implemented successively, for example, top-down. Absent such rules, no logical inference path exists and input data refinement (addition) is requested. Rules that can be fired, are labeled in the corresponding place of service row. For example, we can write 1 in the matrix cell, which is illustrated in the cell (1, n+1). # Given several such rules, the choice of rules to fire first is implemented according to previously determined criteria. Several rules can be fired simultaneously if sufficient resources are available. # Rule (procedure) firing simulation is implemented by assigning the values ‚Äúknown‚Äù to the variables inferred in this rule, that is, z in this example. A fired rule can be marked additionally, for example by number 2 for convenience of further work. For example, the corresponding changes are made in the cells (m+1, n-1), (m+1, n) and (1, n+1). # After rule firing simulation, goal achievement analysis is carried out, that is, required value acquisition is analyzed by comparing special characters in the service row. Given at least one ‚Äúunknown‚Äù (w) value in the service row (m+1), logical inference path search is carried out. Otherwise, the task is considered to be solved successfully and the rules fired in a corresponding order form the logical inference path searched. # The availability of the rules that can be fired after defining new values at the previous stage is assessed. Absent firearable rules, no inference path exists and actions are taken analogous to step 2. Given fireable rules the inference path search continues. In this example such rules exist. In cell (2, n+1) the number 1 is obtained as an indication that this rule can be fired. # At the next stage, analogous to stage 4, the rules are fired (rule firing simulation), analogous to stages 5 and 6 necessary actions are performed to obtain the result. Stages 2‚Äì7 are implemented until the result is achieved. A path may or may not be found. # Deducibility of the variables 4 and 5 in the cells (m+1, 4) and (m+1, 5) is obtained, and indication that the rule has already been fired in the cell (2, n+1) is formed, that is, the number 2 is set. After that the analysis of the service row is carried out, which shows that not all the required variables are known. Thus, it is necessary to continue processing matrix V of dimension (m+n)\\\\times(n+1). The analysis of this matrix demonstrates the possibility of rule m firing. # When rule m is fired, new values are obtained for required variables as well. # Thus, no required rules are in the service row and new values are obtained in the cells of the matrix: 2 appears in the cell (m, n+1)-2, and we got the value z instead of w in the cell (m+1, n-2). So, positive result is obtained, consequently, a logical inference path exists with given input values.  References   External links  * ¬´Mivar¬ª official website.

Description eIDAS defines several tiers of electronic signatures that can be used in conducting public sector and private transactions within and across the borders of EU member states. A qualified digital certificate, in addition to other specific services provided by a qualified trust service provider, is required to elevate the status of an electronic signature to that of being considered a qualified electronic signature. Using cryptography, the digital certificate, also known as a public key certificate, contains information to link it to its owner and the digital signature of the trust entity that verifies the authenticity of the content that has been signed. According to eIDAS, to be considered a qualified digital certificate, the certificate must meet the requirements provided in Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, including, but not limited to: * Identification that the certificate is a qualified certificate for electronic signature * Identification of the qualified trust service provider who issued the qualified certificate, including such information * Corresponding electronic signature validation data and electronic signature creation data * Indication of the certificate‚Äôs period of validity * Unique certificate identity code of the trust service provider * Qualified trust service provider‚Äôs advanced electronic signature or electronic seal Vision The need for non-repudiation and authentication of electronic signatures was originally addressed in the Electronic Signatures Directive 1999/93/EC to help facilitate secure transactions, specifically those that occur across the borders of EU Member states. The eIDAS Regulation later replaced the Directive and defined the standards to be used in the creation of qualified digital certificates by trust service providers. Role of a qualified trust service provider A qualified digital certificate can only be issued by a qualified trust service provider that has received authorization from their member state‚Äôs supervisory body to provide qualified trust services for creating qualified electronic signatures. The provider must be listed upon the EU Trust List; otherwise, they are not permitted to provide qualified digital certificates or other qualified trust services. The trust service provider is required to abide by the guidelines established under eIDAS for creating qualified digital certificate, which include: * Providing a valid date and time stamp of when the certificate was created, * immediate revocation of any signature that has an expired certificate, * providing appropriate training to all their employees who are involved with providing trust services, * any equipment or software that is used for trust services must be trustworthy and capable of preventing certificates from being forged. Legal implications of electronic signatures with qualified digital certificates In court, a qualified electronic signature provided the highest level of probative value, which makes it difficult to refute its authorship. A qualified electronic signature, along with its qualified certificate is given the same consideration as a handwritten signature when used as evidence in legal proceedings. The validity of a qualified electronic signature that has been created with a qualified certificate must be accepted by other EU member states regardless of which member state the signature was produced in. Global perspective In other parts of the world, similar concepts have been created to define standards for electronic signatures. In Switzerland, the digital signing standard ZertES has comparable standards that address the conformity and regulation of trust service providers who product digital certificates. In the United States, the NIST Digital Signature Standard (DSS) does not provide a comparable standard for regulating qualified certificates that would address non-repudiation of a signatory‚Äôs qualified certificate. An amendment to NIST DSS is currently being discussed that would be more in-line with how eIDAS and ZertES handle trusted services.

Some sources state that she was the first American woman to receive a patent, however others state that Mary Kies, in 1809, was the first. Early life Slater grew up in a Quaker family in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, with two sisters, five brothers and parents Lydia and Oziel. Her father was a successful businessman and business partner of Moses Brown, who was in turn in business with Samuel Slater, an industrialist. Brown recommended the Wilkinson home as a suitable place for Samuel Slater to board when he arrived in the area in early 1790. At the time, Hannah was 15 years old. Oziel and Lydia were initially against Hannah marrying someone who was not a Quaker; however they relented and on October 2, 1791, Hannah and Samuel were married. In the same year, Samuel opened his own mill in the area and began to build machinery for manufacturing textiles, modeled after the machines he was familiar with in England. This mill has been preserved as a historical site and is known as the Slater Mill Historic Site. Slater Mill Historic Site, 2010  Adult life  = Invention = In 1793, Samuel Slater showed Hannah some very smooth yarn he had spun from long staple Surinam cotton. He intended to use it to produce cloth; however, Hannah and her sister used a hand spinning wheel to spin it into thread, and the resultant thread proved to be stronger than linen thread. The same year, Hannah applied to the U.S. Patent Office for a patent for an invention - a new method of producing sewing thread from cotton. The patent was issued in the name of \\"Mrs Samuel Slater\\". = Community work = Slater was active in religious and welfare organisations in the Pawtucket community, such as the creation of a village Sunday School, and in 1809 a Female Beneficent Society. Slater was treasurer for the society and her sister Lydia was one of its directors. = Family = Slater gave birth to 10 children, four of whom died in infancy or childhood. The known children and their years of birth are William (b. 1796), Elizabeth (b. 1798), Mary (b. 1801), Samuel (b. 1802), George (b. 1804), John (b. 1805), Horatio (b. 1808), William (b. 1809) and Thomas (b. 1812). Slater died in 1812 about two weeks after the birth of her last child, from complications of childbirth. She was 37 years old. Her husband wrote in his memoirs that after her death \\"the poor lamented her, whose charities and kindness they had experienced\\". Slater was buried at Mineral Spring Cemetery.

It was first published in the United Kingdom on 26 February 2015 through Gollancz and was published in the United States through Titan Books later that same year. The book was nominated for the August Derleth Award for Best Horror Novel for 2016. Synopsis The book centers on Toby, a young boy living in England at some point in the future. Until recently he had led a normal, peaceful existence, something that ended after a blood test marked him as a \\"Defective\\". He's quickly sent away to the Death House, a boarding school for children whose blood has marked them as different from those around him. Toby is terrified, as he's given little information about what is going on or what exactly is going on with his body. All he knows is that the nurses and staff monitor him and his fellow students closely for any changes in their health, bodies, and behaviors. Anyone who begins to show changes are sent away in the night to places unknown, never to return. Toby tries hard to avoid notice, even going so far as to sleep during the daytime so he can wander around at night undisturbed, as the others take sleeping pills in order to slumber the night away. It's only when Clara arrives that his makeshift routine is disrupted, causing him to seek more out of life. Reception Critical reception has been mostly positive and the work has received comparisons to Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go and William Golding's Lord of the Flies. Praise for the book typically centered upon the characters, their relationships with one another, and the work's themes of life and death, with SFF World writing that it \\"makes the reader think about the joys of discovery and the simple wonders that are around us, that we sometimes take for granted.\\" SciFiNow praised the work, stating that \\"The Death House is shocking and gripping, albeit ultimately hopeful and utterly moving, and it‚Äôs Pinborough‚Äôs finest novel to date.\\" Tor.com was more mixed, stating that \\"Though it‚Äôs never less than completely competent, and occasionally, yes, exceptional, in the final summation The Death House proved too formulaic to truly move me.\\" = Awards = * August Derleth Award for Best Horror Novel (2016, nominated) References 2015 British novels Novels by Sarah Pinborough English science fiction novels 2015 science fiction novels ","title":"The Death House"},{"id":"51291236","text":"Sovijja Pou (born 18 July 1995) is a Cambodian competition swimmer who competes mainly in the freestyle and butterfly events.

Administratively the range is part of the Sermersooq Municipality. History The range was observed and mapped in 1933 by Lauge Koch during aerial surveys made in the course of the 1931‚Äì34 Three-year Expedition to East Greenland. Koch named it after pioneering aviator Charles Augustus Lindbergh (1902‚Äì1974), who reportedly had seen these tall nunataks previously during an eastward flight across the Greenland Ice Sheet and had discussed the matter with him when they met in Ella Island. Although not as high as the Watkins Range to the east, the Lindbergh Range is popular among mountaineers because it has some of the finest and tallest peaks in Greenland. The quality of the rock, however, is poor. A number of the main summits of the nunataks have been climbed in recent years, but the range is still relatively little explored.Alpine Journal - North America, Greenland, Northeast, Lindbergh Fjelde Geography The Lindbergh Range is an up to 3,171 m high cluster of nunataks, some of which are extensive ridges rising above the ice. It is located west of the Christian IV Glacier and east of the Upper Frederiksborg Glacier (√òvre Frederiksborg Gletscher), an ice cap west of which lie the Frederiksborg Nunataks, located north of the Frederiksborg Glacier. The Isfald Glacier is a smaller glacier located at the southern end. The vast Greenland Ice Sheet lies to the northwest. The Watkins Range rises to the east of the Lindbergh Range, beyond the Christian IV Glacier, the Gronau Nunataks lie to the northeast, and the Lemon Range to the southwest.

As a handcyclist she is a two time UCI Para-cycling World Champion. Personal history Reppe was born in Dresden in 1987. In 1992 a tumor was discovered in her right leg. The resulting treatment saw her leg amputated. Sporting career =Swimming= Reppe's first major international competition was the 2002 IPC Swimming World Championships in Mar del Plata in Argentina. Still a youth, she entered five events winning bronze in the 400m freestyle. Reppe was 17 years-old when she first represented Germany at a Summer Paralympics; the 2004 Games in Beijing. There she took part in six events, three individual and three relay events. She won two bronze medals, in the 100m freestyle (S9) and the 400m freestyle (S9). For her Paralympic achievements in Beijing she was awarded the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt (Silver Laurel Leaf). In 2006, she took part in her second World Championships, this time in Durban, South Africa. Reppe entered eight events and won her third World bronze when she was part of the German women's 4 √ó 100 m relay team.

She only managed to qualify for one final, the 400m freestyle (S9), where she finished sixth in a time of 4:51.59. Reppe took part in both the 2010 IPC Swimming World Championships in Durban and the 2011 IPC Swimming World Championships in Berlin, but failed to medal in either of the Championships. At the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London she entered three events, the 100m and 400m freestyle (S9) and the 100m backstroke (S9). She managed to qualify for both the 100m backstroke and 400m freestyle finals, finishing 8th and 5th respectively. =Cycling= After London, Reppe and her coach disagreed on her future direction in swimming, and Reppe left the sport. She left sport completely and joined her family's business, but the calling to compete and travel were too strong and she looked for a sport outside swimming that she could join. Initially she tried track and field events, specifically the javelin and shot put, but she had a preference for endurance events and contacted a cycling club in Dresden. She attended a trial biking weekend where she was introduced to handbiking, and she decided to take up the sport. While Reppe was competing at the London Paralympics she was followed by German film director Niko von Glasgow, who used her experience of the Games as part of his documentary Mein Weg nach Olympia. Through the film she was contacted by German Paralympian Errol Marklein, who was now at the forefront as a coach for handbiking in Germany. In 2013, after the premier of Mein Weg nach Olympia in Essen, Marklin surprised Reppe on the stage with a custom built handbike which was the beginning of a new career for Reppe as a professional rider. Now classified as a H4 rider, Reppe first represented Germany at a major international when she attended the 2014 UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships in Greenville in the United States. She won her first UCI World title, taking the women's Road race title and followed this with the bronze medal in the time trial. She successfully defended her road race title the following year in the 2011 Championships in Nottwil and improved on her time trial event by taking home the silver medal.

The company, established by Eduardo Depietri, also built the port of San Pedro. The railway (whose main activity was the transport of grains) run from 1936 until 1948, when the entire Argentine network was nationalised and the FCED expropriated by the government. History Kil√≥metro 42 station. Uruguayan engineer and entrepreneur Eduardo Depietri (1893‚Äì1970)Ferrocarriles Econ√≥micos Eduardo Depietri on San Pedro Hist√≥rico, 14 Apr 2009 had conceived a metre gauge railway line that run through the Buenos Aires Province from west to east, connecting with other lines such as C√≥rdoba Central and Central Argentine. Depietri came up with a project that received approval from the Government of the Province.La curiosa historia del Ferrocarril Depietri by Por Carlos A. P√©rez Darnaud - Portal de Trenes, 17 Dec 2006 The project was to built two economic railway networks, the first from Necochea to Olavarr√≠a (connecting with the Provincial Railway). The other one would connect the ports of San Pedro, San Nicol√°s and Obligado with Ramallo, Pergamino, Arrecifes, Salto and Ingeniero De Madrid. That network would also connect with Compa√±√≠a General de BA and Midland railway lines. In case of being carried out, the project included access to all the ports of the province ‚Äìwith the exception of Bah√≠a Blanca‚Äì and the construction of Grain elevators in each one of them. From 1925 the company got permissions from the provincial government to built the lines but the British-origin companies (led by the Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway) refused to the project alleging that the Depietri railway would compete with their own lines. The line Necochea‚ÄìLa Dulce began to be built in 1929 but the BAGSR objected to the construction and works were interrupted. When Depietri realised that the government had also bowed to pressure from the British company, he decided to focus on the north rail line that began in the port of San Pedro and works began there. Depietri built not only the railway line but a port in San Pedro that was inaugurated in 1933. Immediately after the port was concluded, Depietri began to built the grain elevator.Historia del puerto on Puerto San Pedro Therefore, the railway line began to be built in San Pedro in 1932, including the grain elevator near the terminus. The line to Arrecifes was completed in 1934 but the Central Argentine Railway refused to Depietri's railway crossed its tracks although a viaduct had been built near CAR's San Pedro station. One year later both companies reached an agreement so the trains could run as planned. In 1935 the Depietri railway reached km. 30 station where it connected with the CCR's at km. 158, starting its activities in 1936.Ferrocarriles y Elevadores Depietri by Fab√≠an Pesikonis on Plataforma 14 - Dec 2007 The FCED's rolling stock were second-hand locomotives and wagons acquired to other companies. The stock included 7 locomotives (from Midland); 5 passenger coaches, 111 freight wagons and one crane (from CAR). From 1936 the line carried cereals and other cargo between San Pedro and Arrecifes (covering a total distance of 68 km). With the railway Nationalisation in Argentina of 1948, the FCED remained as the only private railway companyFerrocarriles de Eduardo Depietri on San Pedro website but soon after the government expropriated the FCED's grain elevators of San Pedro, which caused material injury to Depietri considering that no compensation was paid. On November 14, 1949, a decree stated the concession was revoked alleging breach of contract from the concessionary. Trains would never run again because the Provincial Railway was not interested in the line, which was located 200 km distant from its own network. Recently created General Belgrano Railway (which had taken over the Central Norte railway, among other 1000 mm gauge railways) was not interested either. From then on, the tracks, rolling stock and signals were abandoned and deteriorated as time went by. The company was dissolved in late 1960s and Depietri died in 1970. Some years later, the tracks were lifted and the lands and installations were sold to confectionery company Arcor.

The story centers on a fictional television series titled Candle Cove, that could only be viewed by a small group of people, predominantly children, who later recall the disturbing show on a web forum. Straub has stated that he was inspired to write the creepypasta after reading \\"Area 36-Year-Old Still Has Occasional Lidsville Nightmare\\", an article published via the satirical news outlet The Onion. Straub's story quickly became popular, inspiring numerous YouTube videos, and fan fictions. In 2015 Straub self-published Candle Cove in a collection of short stories entitled Candle Cove and Other Stories. The Verge commented that Candle Cove differed from other creepypastas in that while most creepypasta have an \\"anonymous folkloric quality\\", Candle Cove's originated from a known source and author. The story was adapted for the first season of the Syfy anthology series Channel Zero, which aired in 2016. Additionally, Straub began the spin-off YouTube series Local 58 centered around strange broadcasts from the fictitious public access television channel where Candle Cove originally aired. Synopsis The story is told via a thread on a forum called the \\"NetNostalgia Forums\\", where a group of users discuss an unusual low-budget children's television show, Candle Cove, that they all remember watching on Channel 58 when they were children. The show is about a young girl named Janice, who imagines herself to be friends with pirates. The pirate characters are said to be portrayed by string marionettes. As the users continue to reminisce they begin to recall more disturbing details about the show, such as a character known as the \\"Skin-Taker\\", a skeleton pirate who wears clothing made out of children's skin, and an episode that consisted entirely of the puppets flailing and screaming while Janice cries. It develops that there are no external records of the show's existence, and that even those who say they remember seeing it have different memories of certain episodes. The story closes with a user stating that he recently asked his mother if she remembered the show. She responded that every time \\"Candle Cove\\" came on, there was only static on the screen. Television adaptation In 2015 the SyFy Channel announced their intent to adapt the Candle Cove story as the first season of a newly-announced series, Channel Zero. The season, named after the creepypasta, expands on the story and centers on a child psychologist who has returned home in order to investigate the 1980s disappearances of his brother and other children. Channel Zero: Candle Cove stars Paul Schneider and Fiona Shaw, and premiered on October 11, 2016. Reception Will Wiles of Aeon wrote that Candle Cove was \\"among the best creepypastas out there\\" and a good example of using the messageboard and forum format as a storytelling tactic. The Verge has written praise for the creepypasta, stating that it was \\"a perfectly dark spin on our nostalgia for the half-remembered stories of our childhood, that realization that the things we liked as kids were much, much creepier than we thought.\\" References External links *Candle Cove at the author's website, Ichor Falls 2009 short stories Fakelore Fictional television shows Horror fiction Horror short stories Internet memes introduced in 2009 Urban legends Web fiction Works adapted into television shows Works by Kris Straub Creepypasta ","title":"Candle Cove"},{"id":"51291582","text":"Rockdale Plaza is a medium-sized shopping centre located in the suburb of Rockdale, a suburb in the south of Sydney.

The film was written by Sel√ßuk Aydemir and produced by BKM. Ahmet Kural, Murat Cemcir, Rasim √ñztekin, Devrim Yakut and Barƒ±≈ü Yƒ±ldƒ±z star in the film. The plot of the movie is about Ismail's (who lives in Sivas) efforts to help his son Tarƒ±k with his wedding, and the comedic escapades that ensues from it. The film was released in 258 theaters in Turkey on 6 December 2013. In the first 3 days it was watched by 572,838 people and made 5,947,213 in revenue. In the first quarter of 2014, it took the \\"most watched film of the past 30 years\\" title from Fetih 1453. The film mostly got good feedback but some of the reviewers thought the chemistry between Murat Cemcir and Ahmet Kural was forced and the move was a slapstick comedy that was hard to be taken seriously.  Plot  In a voice-over, Tarik, Ismail's son, comes home from abroad to visit his parents' home in Sivas. When he comes back to Sivas to receive his father's blessing, Ismail decides to have a wedding for his son; as the village tradition is for a man to have his son circumcised, joined the Turkish Army, and give his son a wedding. Ismail takes it as a matter of pride that the wedding is big and grand, and makes magnificent wedding plans with his odd-ball friends: T√ºp√ß√º Fikret (a \\"gas-man\\" owner), √áetin (a boxing instructor to children), and the teacher of the village (Saffet). They have ten days to make the wedding happen. Fikret said he has an old Army friend who now owns a ritzy hotel that they can host the wedding at, but it does not go as planned. Saffet claims to be related to a Turkish star, Emel Sayƒ±n and can get her for the wedding entertainment, but she ignores his calls; and √áetin volunteers his old mother to make the dresses and food, but each assigned task by the four friends fall through one-by-one; including a scheme that involves the village conman, Yƒ±lmaz, making fake currency. However, Ismail's wife, Hatice and the other women of the village all come together after the friends realize that they need help. Hatice also persuades Ismail to invite his estranged older brother to the wedding, despite having a falling out with each other. The preparations for the wedding starts at the center of the village, with everyone helping out as a community. On the wedding day, Ismail requests a camel for the bride, Marika, to ride on, as he says it's part of the village tradition, so Yƒ±lmaz gets a camel somehow to the surprise of everyone. The camel takes off with the bride though, and gets accidentally knocked out when she falls off of it. The men bring the unconscious Marika back to the wedding celebration, where they hide her away from the guests and the groom. The wedding ceremony is about to begin and Marika is still unconscious, so Yƒ±lmaz wears her gown and veil to pretend to be the bride, because he's the only one who fits in the dress. All is going well until Ismail's brother dies after eating a piece of √áetin's cake that he made. He gets carried into the same room that Marika is in, as does his deceased wife, who also drops dead after learning from Saffet that her husband just died. √áetin wonders if his cake is poisonous because two people died after eating it. Marika's friend/bridesmaid calls her boyfriend, Victors, in Latvia to tell him everything worked out as planned, and it is revealed that Marika is actually engaged to someone else and eloped with Tarik instead. The real fiance and Marika's brothers goes to Sivas to bring Marika back. Upon finding out what happened, Yƒ±lmaz, Tarƒ±k and the bridesmaid escapes the wedding when the group shows up. Yilmaz reveals his identity, which causes the bridesmaid to start freaking out and Yƒ±lmaz knocks her unconscious; eventually the three of them are able to escape the group when √áetin shows up and beats everyone up with his boxing skills. They return to the celebration, now with two unconscious women and two dead bodies in a room, and Yƒ±lmaz in a wedding gown. Hatice shows up and deduces everything that has happened and tells everyone to handle it and not cause a scene in front of the guests. The police arrive because of Yƒ±lmaz's fake currency, which Ismail had thrown out to the children during the wedding celebration. Everyone is taken in for questioning and Tarƒ±k reads out bits of his statements, which is the voice-over in the beginning of the movie. The movie ends with Ismail saying goodbye to Tarƒ±k and handing him an envelope with money, telling him to have another wedding since the one Ismail gave him was such a disaster. He also gives him the key to his lime green car. They embrace each other and Tarƒ±k and his friends drive off.  Release  The film released in 258 theaters and with 229 copies in Turkey.

While accommodation is available, bottled water, alcoholic drinks, medicines etc. are not available, and all tourists are to carry their own requirements. All payments for food and accommodation are to be made in cash (NO credit cards). Most of the mobile operators cover Kolakham, but signals are often low. However, the trip can be greatly rewarding with a visit (jeep or trekking). There are many rare birds and animals and luckier ones are those who can sight wild animals. Changi Falls is just 3 km jeep drive plus 1.5 km walk down over 250 well built stairs. One can also move around a little to Lava and visit the Lava Monastery and Neora Valley Interpretation Cente. Rishap offers a great view of the snow capped peaks. Charkhole, 32 km away, also has interesting views of the snow- capped peaks. Summer temperatures vary from 5-200C, winter temperatures are around 0-80C.

His work includes two operas and symphonies. Life and education Van Hemel was born in 1892 in Antwerp, Belgium, where he studied with August de Boeck and Lodewijk Mortelmans at the Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp. During World War I he was wounded at the Battle of Halen. With the help of the Red Cross, he fled in May 1915 to Roosendaal in the Netherlands during the bombardment of Antwerp. He subsequently played violin in the orchestra of the Dutch National Opera in Amsterdam. In 1918 he moved to Bergen op Zoom, where he became a teacher of violin, piano, and music theory at the municipal music school. Here, he also met his future wife, Annie Wouters, whom he married in August 1923. Together they eventually had 10 children. From 1931 to 1933 he studied music composition with Willem Pijper in Rotterdam. In 1949, van Hemel and his family moved to Hilversum, where the Katholieke Radio Omroep (Catholic Radio Broadcasting) commissioned an opera, Viviane on a libretto by Louis Lutz, to celebrate its 25th jubilee. Works and reception Van Hemel composed chamber music, sacred music, songs and choral music, music for orchestra, including symphonies, and for concert band, and two operas, Viviane and De prostitu√©e (The Prostitute). Van Hemel's music was at times praised as \\"lovely\\" and spontaneous, albeit at times \\"constructed\\". His Pianokwartet was praised as \\"powerful, quirky interbellum music\\". Others were more critical and lamented a lack of originality. Nevertheless, in the 1950s, van Hemel's music was very popular in the Netherlands. In 1962, van Hemel received the for his Quartetto di strumenti ad arco no. 6. In the same year, he was knighted in the Order of Orange-Nassau.

Biography Born in Utah but raised in Riverside, California, Boren was interested in both underwater diving and photography. He built his own helmet as a teenager and in 1943 became a member of the San Diego Bottom Scratchers Diving Club. Membership of the club required Boren to dive 30 feet, capture three abalone in one dive, grab a five-foot horn shark by the tail and bring up a \\"good sized\\" lobster.p. 327 Hanauer, Eric Diving Pioneers: An Oral History of Diving in America Aqua Quest Publications, Inc., 1994 He constructed a case for his 16mm camera to film underwater and in 1952 built a 35mm underwater camera that led him to begin his feature film career shooting the undersea sequences for Underwater! (1955).pp.92-95 Hartley, William and Ellen Adventures of an Underwater Cameraman Popular Mechanics September 1966 His next film Underwater Warrior (1958) was about a fellow diver Commandeer Francis Fane who Boren had known in Coronado. The film introduced him to Ivan Tors leading him to photograph Tors' underwater television series Sea Hunt. The success of the show enabled him to co-write and produce an unsuccessful television pilot Sea Divers and shoot underwater sequences for Tors' The Aquanauts. Boren enjoyed shooting in the clear water of Weeki Wachee Springs, Florida that not only featured clear water and exotic scenery but was more accessible, more economical, and safer than shooting overseas.p.49 Pelland, Maryan and Dan Weeki Wachee Springs Arcadia Publishing, 2006 Boren worked with Tors and often director Andrew Marton on a number of popular films such as Flipper (1963), Flipper's New Adventure (1964), two films set in Africa, Rhino!

The book's criticisms of Chomsky are outlined in an article in Harper's Magazine.Tom Wolfe, 'The Origins of Speech: In the beginning was Chomsky'; Buffalo list of reviews. In the book, Wolfe criticises Darwin and his colleagues for taking partial credit from Alfred Wallace for the theory of evolution and ignoring Wallace's later work on the theory. Wolfe then criticises Noam Chomsky for dismissing Daniel Everett, who disputes Chomsky's claim that all languages are based ultimately on a hard-wired mechanism known as the language acquisition device (LAD). Wolfe argues that speech, not evolution, sets humans apart from animals and is responsible for all of humanity's complex achievements.  Critical response  In The Guardian, Steven Poole criticises Wolfe's whole approach to Darwin and dismisses his suggestion that Darwin had no evidence for his theory of evolution by natural selection, saying that Darwin 'adduced a lot of evidence at the time, including the geographical distribution of species, comparative anatomy, fossils and the existence of vestigial organs. Today, of course, evolution is observed in real time in the laboratory, among microbes or insects'. In The Washington Post, Jerry Coyne agrees that Wolfe 'grossly distorts the theory of evolution'. He also notes that 'Everett didn't slay [Chomsky's theory of] universal grammar: Later linguists found that the Pirah√£ language indeed had recursion (e.g., \\"I want the same hammock you just showed me\\"). Finally, the technical notion of \\"recursion\\" was never the totality of Chomsky's theory anyway. He highlighted the idea in a brief paper in 2003, but his theory always consisted of operations for merging words into bigger and bigger phrases, something no one disputes.' In concluding his review, Coyne states that 'I'm not sure why Wolfe bears such animus against evolution and the use of evidence rather than bluster to support claims about reality. Perhaps his social conservatism has bred such a discomfort with the implications of modern science - that the universe works by natural rather than supernatural or divine laws - that he's compelled to snicker at one of the foundations of modern science: He's called another one, the big bang, \\"the nuttiest theory I've ever heard.\\"' In The Times, Oliver Kamm is equally critical, pointing out that Wolfe doesn't appreciate that Chomsky himself 'is sceptical that the language organ is a product of natural selection' and that, indeed, some 'scholars believe that Chomsky underestimates the explanatory power of evolutionary theory.' Harry Ritchie in The Spectator says 'Wolfe is at his best when describing Chomsky's almost religiously cultish, charismatic hold over linguistics', but that Wolfe's 'version of Chomsky's downfall is as wrong as Chomsky certainly is.'. David Z. Morris's in the Washington Independent points out that Wolfe 'has proven his enduring ability to choose the right moment. Our views of language and human nature are shifting radically and quickly ... The Kingdom of Speech is traversing the right territory' but he then concludes that the book 'is too loose, too glib, and, in a few places, too glaringly flawed.' In some contrast to these opinions, Peter York in The Sunday Times, claims that the geneticist Steve Jones admires Wolfe's grasp of both the Darwin literature and the \\"real weaknesses\\" of Chomsky's view of language origins. While Everett himself has said Wolfe's book is 'the opinion of someone who has looked carefully at the field for years. Some mistakes are likely his fault. Others are the fault of the field for having been unsuccessful in making itself understandable to the public.' (Although Everett has also tweeted that: 'Chomsky's view of [language] origins is nearly identical to Wolfe's view of evol[ution]. Both simplistic.')Victor H. Mair, Language Log, 24/7/16; DanielEverett@amazonrambler, 9/9/16. In The Chronicle of Higher Education, Tom Bartlett interviews both Wolfe and Chomsky, and compares and contrasts Wolfe's book with anthropologist Chris Knight's more 'in-depth' investigation, Decoding Chomsky: Science and revolutionary politics. In Bartlett's interview, Chomsky criticizes Wolfe saying his 'errors are so extraordinary that it would take an essay to review them.'Tom Bartlett, 'The Chomsky Puzzle', The Chronicle of Higher Education, 25/8/16. In his review in the journal Counterpunch, Chris Knight writes that although Wolfe's book is 'awash with screaming errors' , it is beautifully written and the author is correct to point out that where language is concerned, evolutionary scientists still have little idea as to how it could possibly have evolved. On the other hand, Knight continues, Wolfe gets things bizarrely wrong when he describes Noam Chomsky as a ‚Äòheavyweight evolutionary theorist‚Äô. Wolfe seems unaware that throughout his career, Chomsky has consistently opposed Darwin‚Äôs view that language gradually evolved. According to Knight, this elementary mistake is a sobering example of Wolfe's hopeless grasp of who adopts which side and why in the various scientific debates about language which he attempts to cover.Chris Knight, 'The Tom and Noam Show', Counterpunch. John McWhorter observed in his Vox review that Wolfe revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of the Chomsky-Everett controversy, and concluded that the author \\"ultimately misses the essence of the debate from various angles.\\" According to McWhorter's account, Wolfe misidentified both the topic of the discussion (which doesn't revolve around the origin of language, but cognitive mechanisms of language production) and its still inconclusive outcome by wrongly depicting Chomskyan linguists as clear losers and Everett as a \\"victorious gladiator in this scholarly clash\\".

History In the 1880s the South Eastern Railway appointed Sir Alexander Rose Stenning, a commercial architect who later became president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, to examine various development opportunities for the railway. These included proposals for the Cinque Port's Light Railway. It is likely that, had it been built, the gauge would have been 3 ft 6 in, allowing it to run through the Isle of Thanet Electric Tramways and Dover Corporation Tramways. In 1871, a proposal to run a tramway between Dover and Ramsgate was refused by the Board of Trade. A similar proposal in 1872, to operate between Dover and Margate, was given official go-ahead but failed to raise sufficient finance. Subsequently, a proposed order was made by the Light Railway Commissioners under the 1896 Light Railways Act in 1899 for of track, marking this scheme as the most ambitious light rail proposal at the time. The scheme had developed sufficiently by 1899 that a Mr. Parker had been appointed as resident engineer and plans were presented to Hastings Borough Council in November 1899. The scheme floundered because of opposition from the people of Dover. A.R. Stenning was also the surveyor for the Guilford Tramway, and it is possible that the intention was to incorporate that tramway into the overall route of the Cinque Ports Light Railway as the Guilford Tramway was built to this gauge.

He was a painter under the patronage of King Rama IV (Mongkut). Khrua In Khong and King Rama IV developed their friendship when they were in the monkhood during the reign of King Rama III. The King was very fond of him. Therefore, once he ascended the throne, he frequently ordered Khrua In Khong to paint murals in numerous temples that he built or restored. His style had been greatly influenced by Western painting, thus distinguishing it from other conventional Thai paintings. He is well known as the first artist to introduce linear perspective to Thai traditional art.Antoinette, M., & Turner, C. (2014).

The works of Khrua In Khong served under the king's desire to modernize Thailand in order to survive the Western colonialist aspiration. His best- known works are mural paintings in the ubosoth (chapel) of Wat Bowonniwet and Wat Borom Niwat.Thongmitr, W. (1979). Khrua In Khong's Western School of Thai Painting. The Ancient City Company Ltd.  Early life  Khrua In Khong's birth date and origins are uncertain. He was born in Bang Chan, Phetchaburi province, Thailand in the reign of King Rama III. He ordained at Wat Ratchaburana (Wat Liap) and stayed as a monk for the rest of his life. His original name was ‚ÄúIn‚Äù not ‚ÄúKhrua In Khong‚Äù, ‚ÄúKhrua‚Äù and ‚ÄúKhong‚Äù were a prefix and postfix words to specify his personal identity. The word ‚ÄúKhrua‚Äù often refers to an elder monk or a person who has strict or moody character. It also meant a teacher who specialized in difficult subjects, and the word ‚ÄúKhong‚Äù quoting Saan Somdet (Princes‚Äô Correspondence) ‚Äú‚Ä¶he stayed in monkhood as a neophyte for too long; hence he was called In Khong (falling tone). At first, I thought had mispronounced Khong (low tone) for Khong, I now realize there is no mistake. Taking Hoi Khong for example, it means big snail. ‚Ä¶ Therefore, Khong and Khong are the same. \\" It was also known that Khrua In Khong was not very sociable. He was an introvert and always stayed alone by himself in order to avoid being interrupted by visitors during his work process. He went as far as entering and leaving his kuti (a monk's residence) through the windows.  Education  There is no evidence of when and where Khrua In Khong practiced his drawing and painting skill. According to his sketchbook, he started drawing in a conventional Thai artistic style which puts much effort into an outline. All shapes and forms have to be drawn properly, very carefully and precisely. When Siam started exchanging culture with Europe, Khrua In Khong absorbed and learned western style drawing despite never visiting the west even once.Meer, J. H. (2010, June).

When King Rama IV reigned, the friendship still remained. Khrua In Khong became a painter under the patronage of the king and was frequently ordered to paint murals in temples that he built or restored. It was mentioned in the royal chronicles ‚Äú‚Ä¶the king demanded the service of Phra Achan In in Painting murals depicting the royal chronicles of the Bangkok period.‚Äù Khrua In Khong's early work was not yet departed from Thai traditional artistic motifs. The murals in Ratchakoramanuson pavilion and Ratchaphongsanuson Pavilion at Wat Phra Kaew (Temple of the Emerald Buddha) both reflect Thai conventional style. The subject is also mainly about Buddha. Murals in Wat Mahasamanaram do not depict stories of Buddha, but still closely relate to Buddhism. The murals in Wat Phra Ngam, Ayutthaya are the depictions of the life of Buddha. The most renowned works of Khrua In Khong are the depictions of Buddhist teachings (Dharma) in Wat Bowonniwet and Wat Borom Niwat which have the figures and buildings in western style. The murals represented Buddhist dharma in the form of allegories. It required a high mental capability to understand the context of the Dharma, for example, the pictures of water lotuses in a pond, horse- racing, and a man pointing the way of virtue. The themes of the murals in Wat Bowonniwet and Wat Borom Niwat were not only related to Buddhism, but also political subjects such as the murals that portray George Washington‚Äôs residence and the United States Congress.Thawatchai Ongwutthiwet, and Wilairat Yangrot.

In the era of King Rama IV, Western colonialism flourished. The king was concerned with the threat of European countries and urged to modernize Siam in a western way - both technologically and culturally, hence the works of Khrua In Khong were serving his demand.Wongplai, T.

Thai artistic tradition before the time of Khrua In Khong was unrealistic. The water waves were drawn as overlapping fish scales, the trees look artificial and the figures stood in unnatural poses. In contrast, Khrua In Khong preferred to paint realistic gestures. The scenario, trees, and figures became more natural and realistic like a western painting. Thai artistic motifs depended on the use of lines and flat color without using light and shade, the objects were the same size regardless of their relative distances making the figures and buildings only two dimensions not three dimensions like the western painting. Khrua In Khong was the first Thai artist to use the three-dimensional perspective technique. In the meantime, people began exchanging culture and art with European countries. Color materials also began to be imported from abroad. Thus the painting in this period became more vivid and colorful. Khrua In Khong, however, still remained using low saturation, bright objects among dimmed gray and dark background colors. Khrua In Khong was famous for his use of monochromic colors that give harmonious satisfaction, unlike complementary colors. He often used dark shades of blue and green along with light shades of blue, pink and white and avoided contrasting colors. He painted the background with dark colors, male outfits with dark blue and white, while female dresses were light blue or pink making the figures look soft and gentle among shady background that appears like a dreamy landscape.Ruxpaitoon, K., Naokazu, A., & Hiroyuki, K.

Retrieved September 23, 2016, from http://www.research.rmutt.ac.th/?p=9149 Despite the fact that he departed from traditional Thai painting style, the works of Khrua In Khong were still mostly related to Buddhism since he himself stayed in the monkhood for life. Moreover, he had been greatly influenced by the king's religious beliefs as a painter under the King's patronage. In addition, the works of Khrua In Khong were not entirely about Buddhism. They were also important as historical records of political events and social conditions during the reign of King Rama III.

He was the abbot of Wat Thong Nopphakhun, who painted murals in Wat Thong Nopphakhun. His murals were allegoric paintings, same as the Dharma Paintings of Khrua In Khong, but the figures were Thai style instead of western.  Later life and death  It is unclear what caused Khrua In Khong's death and when it was.

It was founded in 1962, by David Morris and remains family owned. Throughout its 50-year history David Morris has produced a number of notable works, including the Miss World crown, jewellery for the James Bond film franchise and various pieces commissioned by royal families. History David Morris began his career at the age of 15 as an apprentice in London's jewellery quarter, Hatton Garden. Having just graduated as a goldsmith from London's Central School of Arts and Crafts (now part of the Central Saint Martin School of Arts and Design), David Morris opened his first Hatton Garden store in 1962. He and his design partner successively claimed the 9th and 10th De Beers Diamonds International Awards held annually in New York, in 1963 and 1964. Jeremy Morris took over the helm of David Morris from his father in 2003 and is now David Morris' managing director and principal designer. Jeremy studied fine art in London, with 5 years apprenticing with Place Vend√¥me jewellers and an Antwerp diamond supplier. Jeremy Morris has been commissioned to create jewels for the late Gianni Versace and Barbra Streisand while Keira Knightley, Oprah Winfrey, Yasmin Le Bon, Catherine Deneuve, Kate Winslet, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Adele are amongst many to have appeared on the red carpet in David Morris jewellery. Locations In 1969, David Morris moved to its first Mayfair location on Conduit Street and in 1996 relocated to its current headquarters at 180 New Bond Street. David Morris has one of the last workshops on Bond Street, above the boutique. The London flagship is a townhouse dating from 1908 and is one of the few historically Grade II* listed buildings on Bond Street. It was designed by Scots architect William Flockhart. In addition to the New Bond Street flagship, David Morris has further boutiques in Harrods - London, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha and Hong Kong. The brand is also represented through partners in Baku, Riyadh and Jeddah. Notable Works =Royal Connections= David Morris' first royal connection came in the form of a commission from the Government of Liechtenstein for a bespoke sapphire and diamond tiara which was presented to Countess Kinsky of Austria by Crown Prince Hans Adam on the occasion of their marriage in July 1967. More recently, a David Morris creation was seen around the world on the bonnet of the vintage Aston Martin car driven down the Mall in London by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their wedding day. The car, which belongs to the Prince of Wales, was a gift from his mother the Queen and is mounted with a small dragon, a commission from David Morris for the prince's 21st birthday. =Miss World crown= In 1972 David Morris was approached by Miss World founder Eric Morley to redesign the existing crown. David Morris conceived a creation of turquoise, lapis lazuli and diamonds that is still in use today. =James Bond= According to an interview with Country & Townhouse magazine, a friendship between producer Albert \\"Cubby\\" Broccoli and David Morris led to a long running association with the James Bond films. Beginning in 1971, David Morris gems were used in the title sequence of Diamonds are Forever, while in 1974 Maud Adams appeared in David Morris jewels on the set of The Man with the Golden Gun. Most memorable was the scalloped diamond \\"Bond\\" riviere necklace worn by Teri Hatcher in 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies, while Denise Richards wore David Morris gems in 1999's The World Is Not Enough. David Morris jewels now feature in the travelling exhibition, \\"Designing 007 - Fifty Years of Bond Style\\", which opened in 2012 at the Barbican in London. =Victoria and Albert Museum= David Morris jewellery was selected to be included in the permanent exhibition of the Jewellery Room at the Victoria & Albert Museum.

He resigned from his episcopal see to dedicate the remainder of his life to peaceful solitude though his reputation for personal holiness prompted countless people to seek him out for his counsel. The formal ratification to his local 'cultus' - or popular devotion to the late bishop - allowed for Pope Pius IX to confirm his beatification on 1 October 1868 while dispensing the requirement for miracles as cultus confirmation allows for. Life Guala de Roniis was born in 1180 in the Bergamo province and belonged to a famed Roman house. His parents oversaw his initial education and his excellent progress caused his parents to entertain great hopes for his future while neglecting to entertain the thought that perhaps God had a surprise in store for their son and the course of his life. He heard Dominic of Osma preach in 1219 and - like others - was so enchanted with Dominic's character that he was one of the first to seek him out for enrollment into his new Order of Preachers; he soon received the habit from Dominic himself and later received ordination as a priest. Dominic soon called the priest to Bologna in order to appoint him as one of four entrusted with the building of Saint Agnes' convent for Dominican nuns but the project suffered a brief failure with the opposition of the parents of Diana degli Andal√≤. This slight setback caused him to return for a brief period to Bergamo. He served as one of the saint's first disciples and received the latter's appointment as the first prior of the order in Brescia where Dominic founded a convent for the town. Both Theoderic of Apolda and Jordan of Saxony were his fellow contemporaries. De Roniis learnt of Dominic's death with tremendous grief in Brescia after seeing a vision. He had fallen asleep with his head against a church bell tower and saw a friar ascending a ladder into heaven where angels surrounded him - that friar was Dominic unbeknownst to him at the time. He was about to depart for Bologna when he learned that Dominic had died at the time of his vision. The priorship of Saint Nicholas - now titled as Saint Dominic - in Bologna became vacant and the people there elected him to the position in 1226. But his tenure became difficult with tensions between Bologna and rival Mantua which prompted Pope Honorius III to appoint him as the papal nuncio to the two cities so that he might secure reconciliation between the warring towns; he managed to negotiate peace terms set for a decade. The new Pope Gregory IX then appointed him as the papal legate to Frederick II in order to induce him to keep his often broken promise to march on a crusade for the relief of the faithful in Jerusalem. On 20 July 1225 he oversaw the successful Treaty of San Germano in Cassino. Brescia longed for his return and when the bishop of the diocese died the people pushed hard for the priest's appointment as the new bishop. De Roniis received his appointment in 1229 as the Bishop of Brescia from Gregory IX (he was reluctant to accept) and he received his episcopal consecration not long after this appointment was made public. A core objective of his episcopate was the temporal care of children. But the pontiff also made him an apostolic delegate to both Treviso and Padua when the two were at odds with each other - despite putting the new bishop far from his flock - and it was he who conducted successful peace negotiations. He resigned from his episcopal see in 1242 (after receiving papal approval to do so) due to civil unrest and then retreated to San Sepolcro d'Astino where - despite his retreat into peaceful solitude - people still flocked to see him in order to seek his wise counsel. De Roniis died on 3 September 1244. His remains are now under the altar of Saint Martin in a Benedictine church. Beatification The formal ratification of the local 'cultus' - or popular devotion - for the late bishop allowed for Pope Pius IX to issue formal confirmation of his beatification on 1 October 1868.

The crew had dispersed two months earlier after their failure to qualify but reconvened, travelled at the last minute to Rio and borrowed a shell. They finished last in their heat, last in the repechage and were eliminated. Albert was one of nine Australia athletes arrested in Rio as part of the 'ticket-gate' scandal. The athletes were arrested after tampering with their passes to gain access to a basketball semi-final. They were charged with falsifying a document. AOC officials needed to drive interstate to pay the 90,000 real fine ($36,000) before passports would be returned to the athletes so they can leave the country. The fine was paid to prevent imprisonment. Australia officials said it was an innocent mistake however it is common practice for athletes to tamper with accreditation.

They raced at the World Rowing Cup I in Sydney and then at WRC III in Lucerne before taking the pair to the 2014 World Rowing Championships in Amsterdam where they placed fifth. Sutherland regained a seat and was selected at stroke in the Australian senior women's eight in 2015 and raced at two Rowing World Cups in Europe and then up the stern end of the eight for the 2015 World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette. They failed to make the A final and finished in overall eight place. Sutherland was the stroke of the Australian women's eight who initially missed qualification for the 2016 Rio Olympics but received a late call up following the Russian drug scandal. WADA had discovered Russian state sponsored drug testing violations and the IOC acted to protect clean athletes and set strict entry guidelines for Russian athletes resulting in most of their rowers and nearly all of their crews being withdrawn from the Olympic regatta. The crew had dispersed two months earlier after their failure to qualify but reconvened, travelled at the last minute to Rio and borrowed a shell.

History Patience Constance Joan Hawker was a granddaughter of George Charles Hawker (1818‚Äì1895) and Elizabeth \\"Bessie\\" Hawker n√©e Seymour ( ‚Äì1901), and daughter of Edward William Hawker MHA (1850‚Äì1940) and Mary Letitia Hawker n√©e Stawell (1870‚Äì1938). The family had a property and residence at East Bungaree, where they were closely associated with the Wachenappee people. Patience was educated at home, then boarded at Yoothamurra school in Glenelg,Yoothamurra school (1894‚Äì1926), at Pier Street or Saltram Road, Glenelg was founded by Kathleen Pittar Kingston, n√©e Stanton ( ‚Äì1929), married to Strickland Gough \\"Pat\\" Kingston, brother of Charles Kingston. The school was taken over by her assistant Mary Martha Dow (1860‚Äì1943) around 1902. followed by the Geelong Grammar School, then Frensham School at Mittagong, New South Wales. She gained her BA at Bedford College, University of London, then returned to the family home \\"Wachenappee\\" in Stirling, near the Mount Lofty Railway station (later named \\"Olivet House\\"). In 1925 she was employed at Woodlands Girls Grammar School in Glenelg, South Australia, where she found a friend in second mistress Mabel Hardy, with whom she shared ideas about teaching. But she was not happy with the rather spartan staff accommodation and after a discussion with headmistress Dora Gillam left at the end of the year. She served for a few months at Girton School, then received a note from Mabel Hardy, who was enjoying a year in England and on the Continent, proposing a partnership to found a girls' school in the Adelaide Hills.Barbara Wall A Short History of Stawell School: The forgotten school on Mount Lofty published for Mount Lofty Districts Historical Society by Peacock Publications 2012 Fired with enthusiasm, Patience purchased \\"Arthur's Seat\\" a large bungalow on near the summit of Mount Lofty and overlooking the Adelaide Plains. It was largely financed with a loan from her mother, and the school was named in her honour, she having been born Mary Stawell. A company, Stawell School Ltd., was incorporated on 21 December 1926 with Patience Hawker as managing director. The two women made the mansion their residence, with rooms for boarders, and had classrooms built away from the residence. They modelled Stawell School on her happy memories of Frensham, which had so inspired Patience. Part of their philosophy of teaching was Helen Parkhurst's Dalton system which gives the student a great deal of control over her own work, where the teacher is a resource and adviser rather than a lecturer, and students are encouraged to aid one another's learning. Patience was not to remain long at Stawell School. She married (Charles) Roy Howard (1891 ‚Äì 17 August 1935), a grandson of W. R. Cave, at Bungaree on 19 September 1928. They settled in a house on Charlick Road, some 3 km south-west of the School, and henceforth she had little to do with teaching or day-to-day decisions, though she retained the title and responsibilities of managing director. They had two daughters, Lucinda (1929‚Äì ) and Virginia (1 October 1931 ‚Äì ). In 1935 her husband died of pneumonia and she sold their Crafers property and returned with her two children to East Bungaree, where she lived with her brother and father. Her daughters attended Stawell School until 1940, when it closed, and were enrolled at Girton. After her father died she returned to the city, purchasing a house in Kensington. She joined the Labor Party and stood for the seat of Burnside at the 1946 by- election and for the Legislative Council (the first woman contender) in the 1953 election, Central No.2 but was unsuccessful on both occasions. She was a member of the Adelaide Lyceum Club and a keen bridge player. She helped found the Norwood branch of Meals on Wheels and worked with that organisation for some thirty years. She maintained a close relationship with her daughters and, later, grandchildren. She changed houses one more time, to Rosslyn Park.

Hyperloop Makers UPV) is a team of students from the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Val√®ncia (Valencia, Spain) with the aim of designing Hyperloop, a proposed future means of transport. With renewable energies, the vehicle will levitate inside a vacuum tube, being able to reach . The concept developed by Hyperloop UPV is distinguished by the use of magnetic levitation based on attraction to the top of the tube thanks to its levitation units located at the top of the pod, instead of air-bearing systems based on repulsion to a rail located at the bottom of the tube. Moreover, its aerodynamic design allows to a compensation of inertial forces that permit a higher radius of curvature, a lower cost for the air-evacuation and up to a 30% savings in infrastructure, with respect to other proposals. This revolutionary concept of Hyperloop is powered by detachable batteries and is propelled through compression and expansion of the air with a nozzle. A turbine recovers energy from the flow allowing a more efficient journey. With all these features it is pretended to reach velocities up to 1200 km/h, in a totally efficient manner, due to the use of renewable energies and prescinding from the use of fossil fuels. The initial team in Design Weekend was composed of five students from the student community Makers UPV: √Ångel Benedicto, Daniel Orient, David Pistoni, Germ√°n Torres and Juan Vic√©n, together with advisor Vicente Dolz, assistant Professor at CMT- Motores T√©rmicos, Universitat Polit√®cnica de Val√®ncia. They were awarded Top Design Concept and Propulsion/Compression Subsystem Technical Excellence Award at SpaceX's Design Weekend, the first phase of the Hyperloop Pod Competition 1 held in Texas in January 2016. The team was expanded to more than 30 students in September 2016 in order to build a full-size prototype for SpaceX's Pod Competition, and in April 2017 the team was selected by SpaceX to participate in the Hyperloop Pod Competition 2, which was held in Los Angeles days 25‚Äì27 August 2017 in collaboration with Purdue University, becoming the world's first transatlantic student collaboration in the history of the development of the Hyperloop. They ranked amongst the best ten teams of the world in the Hyperloop Pod Competition 2. Nowadays, being a team of more than 40 people and with the support of many institutions and enterprises, the team is designing an improved prototype with the aim of winning the Hyperloop Pod Competition 3, scheduled in summer 2018.http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop  History  The project has its origins in August, 2015, when a team of five students of the Makers Community of the Polytechnical University of Valencia decided to take part in a competition organized by Elon Musk, the Hyperloop Design Weekend. This decision was taken as a result of a piece of news that one of them read, in which was said that with Hyperloop, airplanes would be useless for medium- range journeys (about 600 km) and all the universities worldwide were invited to participate in this competition in order to make Hyperloop a reality. The Hyperloop Makers UPV team was created in August 2015 when Daniel Orient, aerospace engineering student, read in a piece of news that with Hyperloop, airplanes would be useless for medium-range journeys (about 600 km). When he discovered that Elon Musk was organising a contest to make Hyperloop a reality and that it was open-source, he decided to ask for help to Makers UPV, a local community of makers from Valencia, Spain. That's when √Ångel Benedicto, David Pistoni, Germ√°n Torres and Juan Vic√©n decided to take part on the project and build together their own Hyperloop concept. The team was selected to take part on the contest by SpaceX, and during this time until the competition was held, in January, 2016, these five UPV students worked very hard to write the \\"Hyperloop Makers UPV Technical Report\\", a scientific report that groups all the specifications and the design of its concept of Hyperloop. Once the competition arrived, thanks to the support given by the UPV, the team had the opportunity to travel to Texas and compete against the best universities of the world. Hyperloop UPV obtained Top Design Concept Award and Propulsion/Compression Subsystem Technical Excellence Award. Time after the competition, the team gained international attention worldwide because they were the smallest team and they obtained the highest \\"awards-to-team size\\" ratio, with 2 awards for a team of 5 students plus their university advisor. All these leads to a huge media impact, appearing on Spanish TV and radio shows besides the talks they performed through the whole Peninsula. A few months later, in September, 2016, after obtaining the support of many institutions and companies (ISTOBAL, Nagares S.A. a Spanish company focused on research, development, manufacturing and sales of electronic systems mainly for the automotive sector., Marca Espa√±a.), the team grew until being more than 30 members, recruiting the most brilliant and motivated students of the Polytechnic University of Valencia. During the time passed until the next competition, this new and expanded team worked on the design and construction of the prototype that will compete in the USA next summer, in the Hyperloop Pod Competition 2. Furthermore, Hyperloop UPV started a collaboration with the Purdue University (Indiana, USA), and thanks to the help given by all the companies that decided to trust in the great potential of these students, they build the Atlantic II, a prototype resulting from the world's first transatlantic student collaboration in the history of the development of the Hyperloop. The team got to be amongst the best 10 teams of the world with one of the most complete prototypes. After the competition, the team expanded until being 35 members that will work hand in hand in order to make the concept of Hyperloop a reality. In October, 2017 the team got the necessary support in order to install the Hyper-Track, a vacuum tube similar to the one used in SpaceX. Being one of the first in Europe, the Hyper-Track allows to carry out all the necessary tests to develop the technologies used in the new design of the prototype. Nowadays, Hyperloop UPV works everyday in order to design a new improved prototype with the aim of presenting it in the next competition, scheduled in August, 2018. Team Nowadays, Hyperloop UPV team is formed by 35 members plus advisors. The team has a horizontal organization it is led by a project manager, that is responsible for the management all the sub-teams, being a total of six, each led by its respective manager. These sub-teams are: Propulsion, Structures, Avionics, Energy, Partners & Economics and Creative. All of them work together in order to make Hyperloop a reality.

It has a deep stratified archaeological sequence of human presence, occupation and hunter- gatherer/herder acculturation dating back 80,000 years. The site's documentation contributed to the reconstruction of palaeo-environments in the context of changes in climate within periods of the Late Pleistocene (12,000 - 80,000 years BP) and the Holocene (since 12,000 years BP). The cave has served multiple functions during its occupation, such as a kraal (enclosure) for animals, a place for the storage of oil rich fruits and as a hunting camp. Circular stone hearths and calcified dung remains of domesticated sheep as well as stone adzes and pottery art (painted stones) were excavated indicating that humans lived at the site and kept animals. Excavation The excavation conducted by H.J. Deacon from 1974 to 1979 was part of an archaeological and palaeo-ecological study (including the Klasies River Caves) to provide information on changes in vegetation and fauna, the cultural sequence and the function of the cave in the area. Together the sequences of the Boomplaas Cave and the Klasies River have established a unique record of the last 125,000 years for the region and southern Africa. Faunal remains are preserved in all layer that include bone accumulated through human occupation and the bones of rodents, accumulated by owls roosting in the cave when humans were absent. Comparative faunal samples were collected from carnivore lairs (hyena and leopard) in the valley and from other owl roosts and a vegetation survey of the surroundings was undertaken. Records provided a base for the interpretation of charcoal and plant remains and to assess the effects of climate fluctuations on vegetation and animal life. Analysis of the artifacts in the Upper Pleistocene sequence suggest that the boundary between the Middle and Later Stone Age traditions is placed here between 30,000 and 40,000 years BP. and that while the Middle Stone Age populations may have been anatomically modern, their behaviour patterns do not show comparable continuity with the ethnographic present. Deposits The stratigraphy of the deposits is very distinct and clearly visible and is documented in terms of sets of broadly contemporary layers (members), individual layers (units) and parts of layers (sub-units). The members recognised in the Boomplaas sequence are described as follows, from the top to the bottom. * CBM Member - late 18th century and early 19th century * DGL Member - around 1,700 years ago * BLD Member - 2,000 years ago * BLA Member - 6,500 years ago * BRL Member - 10,000 years ago * CL Member - between 14,500 and 12,000 years ago. * GWA/HCA Member - 17,500 years ago * LP Member - around the Last Glacial Maximum * LPC Member - almost 22,000 years ago * YOL Member - between 22,000 and about 32,000 years ago * BP Member - 32,000 years ago * OLP Member - 42,000 years ago * BOL Member - suggested age 65,000 years * OCH Member - 80,000 years * LOH Member - bedrock layer Notable artifacts * The oldest artifacts (BOL) are triangular stone flakes with facetted platforms. * The stone artifact assemblage of the BOL Member and of the BP Member are made primarily of quartzite and include long flake blades (longer than 100 mm ) with lateral retouch on the main flake surface. * At the YOL Member most objects are typical Middle Stone Age artifacts. * The artifacts associated with the CL Member are classified within the Robberg industry (LSA) (bladelet industry of southern Africa), characterized by numbers of small blades (bladelets) and the small conical cores that produced them. * The artifacts from BLA is assigned to the Wilton industry (Late Stone Age culture in southern Africa) with a higher frequency of backed tools than in BLD and DGL, associated with small scrapers and adzes. * Several mammal species disappear during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition and a shift from hunting larger bodied animals like zebra and wildebeest to hunting or trapping smaller grysbok-sized antelope occurs. * Ancestral Khoekhoen settlers account for leftovers of stone tools, ornamented pottery and seed storage pits in the most recent layers.

The station never opened for civilian traffic.  Origins In 1882 the Bala and Ffestiniog Railway opened the line from to a temporary terminus at , Trawsfynydd was one of the stations opened with the line. At Festiniog passengers had to transfer to narrow gauge trains if they wished to continue northwards. To do this people travelling from Trawsfynydd to Blaenau or beyond walked the few yards from the standard gauge train to the narrow gauge train much as they do today between the Conwy Valley Line and the Ffestiniog Railway at . The following year the narrow gauge line was converted to standard gauge, but narrow gauge trains continued to run until 5 September 1883 using a third rail. Standard gauge trains first ran through from Bala and Trawsfynydd to Blaenau Ffestiniog on 10 September 1883. The line was taken over by the Great Western Railway in 1910. Military usage The line through Trawsfynydd had been established for around twenty years when an artillery training camp was set up at Bryn Golau, on the southern outskirts of Trawsfynydd. It was replaced in 1906 by a larger camp further south at Rhiw Goch,Rhiw Goch house, via National Library of ScotlandBronaber army camp, via heneb which was more widely referred to as being at Bronaber, after the nearby settlement of that name. Artillery of the period required the transportation of men, horses, field guns and ammunition, together with supplies such as fodder. As a training camp the turnover of men in particular was considerable, many attending for two week \\"camps\\". The area is remote and roads remain few, so the railway was the obvious means to move men and materials. For a few years military traffic was handled at , but it was not well suited to the sharp and growing peaks of arrivals and departures. In 1910 the railway decided to build additional, specialised platforms and ramps on the northern side of the bridge which was at the northern end of the conventional station; these were opened in Summer 1911 and became known as \\"Trawsfynydd Camp station\\", though that name does not appear on documents such as Working Timetables.1960 Working timetable, via 2D53 The station had no need of ticket offices or waiting rooms. All traffic was by booked special trains exclusively for military personnel, though the locomotives, rolling stock and crew were all Great Western. The only buildings were a corrugated iron warehouse, a guards' room and two lavatories. Three unusual features were provided: * several water troughs on the wide and gently sloping approach road * a wooden \\"screen\\" made of fencing material with all vertical timbers edge to edge. This was placed between the single track running line and the military station. Its purpose was said to be to prevent horses being frightened by the sight of passing locomotives. * a \\"Gun Wharf\\" which consisted of a bay platform where open- ended vehicles carrying equipment such as artillery pieces could be wheeled straight off the end onto the platform Personnel disembarked onto the \\"Troop Platform\\", which was an island with the screen to one side. Horses detrained onto the \\"Horse Landing\\" which led straight to the water troughs and the road to the camp. Guns and other large equipment was unloaded at the Gun Wharf, also known as the Gun Platform. The trains shown in published photographs often mixed carriages, horse boxes and wagons. They were routinely much the longest trains to use the line and needed double-heading or the use of more powerful locomotives normally excluded from the route. Traffic was heavy during the World Wars and considerable between. The Harlech Military Railway article mentions connections with the Trawsfynydd camp, but it is unlikely that this involved rail traffic, because the distance by road is short, but by rail is very long. Traffic reduced after 1945, but was considerable for some time as the camp was used to dispose of unused artillery shells by firing them on the range.The legacy of firing live ammunition, via Natural Resources Wales Military traffic had petered out by the late 1950s and the camp was closed as a military establishment in 1957 or 1958, only to reopen \\"almost overnight\\" to house workers building Trawsfynydd nuclear power station. These people were bussed to work, bringing no custom to the railway except when coming to or leaving from their distant homes. The line from Bala north to Trawsfynydd was designated in the restrictive \\"Blue\\" weight limit, with the section from Trawsfynydd to Blaenau limited even more tightly to \\"Yellow\\". The literature conjectures on overweight classes being used on troop trains, but no solid claim or photograph has been published. Photos of heavy troop trains show 0-6-0STs double-heading, Only four steam age photos of the line show anything other than an 0-4-2 or 0-6-0 tank engine, three being of GWR 2251 Class 0-6-0s taken in the 1940s on ordinary civilian workings. The only one of anything larger is of a \\"43XX\\" 2-6-0 on a military train at Trawsfynydd Camp station. That class were nevertheless classified as \\"Blue\\". As the 1950s passed \\"5700\\" and \\"7400\\" 0-6-0PTs stole the show, exemplified by 9610 at Festiniog in the 1950s. 0-4-2T engines \\"..suffer[ed] from limited tank capacity and power.\\" In 1907 an accident occurred involving a military train in which both drivers and two soldiers were injured. With the camp closed the station had no residual purpose except for siding space.  Closure  The line through the station closed to passengers in January 1960 and to freight a year later. In 1964 the line was still technically \\"operational\\" northwards from the station in case it reopened for freight or military traffic, but none materialised and the tracks were lifted northwards to the site of . Tracks north of that halt sprung back to life in 1964 to serve Trawsfynydd nuclear power station. By 2017 the site had been put to agricultural use and was hardly recognisable as a former station.

At one time it was patronised by the elite of Buenos Aires. Later it became run down, and in 1944 it was sold, subdivided and rented for commercial use. The hotel building was torn down in 1974. The name survives in the Playa Bristol, the most popular beach in Mar del Plata. Background The Basque immigrant Pedro Luro (1820‚Äì90) was responsible for development of Mar del Plata, a village founded in 1874. He had made his fortune in ranching, and envisioned developing the village as a port for shipping hides, meat, wool and grain to Buenos Aires. This would avoid the difficult land route through the swampy area of the Salado River. Construction of the dock and supporting buildings began in the summer of 1878‚Äì79. By 1881 there were several large warehouses, mills and factories, dominating the economy of Mar del Plata. As well as the wooden dock, by 1883 there was a stone wall on both banks of a stretch of the Chacras creek so it could act as a port of shelter. Luro completed the Grand Hotel by around 1883 in anticipation of the arrival of a railway. It was successively enlarged to 110 rooms. With his health failing, Luro left Mar del Plata in April 1886 and was taken to Paris, where he died in 1890. In the summer of 1886‚Äì87 a total of 1,415 passengers arrived by train. That season the Grand Hotel was full of visitors. Jos√© Luro, Pedro Luro's third son, and Gast√≥n Sansinena organized the \\"Sociedad An√≥nima Bristol Hotel\\" in April 1887 to build a large casino hotel. Within a few years the Grand Hotel and the Bristol Hotel would displace the industrial activity, which soon disappeared as Mar del Plata became a sea bathing spa. Construction The first building of the Bristol Hotel, the casa vieja (\\"old house\\") of 1888, was a three-story building in area with 67 rooms, built in mock-Tudor style on the block between Entre R√≠os, Corrientes, San Mart√≠n and Rivadavia. The ground floor was of masonry and the upper floors of wood frame with brick panels. The roof, with several gables, was of slate. It had two square towers with pyramidal roofs. Other chalets with the same design were built along Rivadavia in 1904 and San Mart√≠n in 1908. The group of buildings was connected through gardens and paths. The Dining Hall was built in 1890 in the block bounded by San Mart√≠n, Rivadavia, Boulevard Mar√≠timo and Entre R√≠os. This is the block where the Bristol Center building stands today. It was a U-shaped building in Italian style, facing the sea. The ceiling of the dining room was considered the most luxurious in Latin America. In addition to the dining room it contained the festival room and the roulette room. It also held the large Pueyrredon Club Lounge. Over the years the building was modified with the addition of corridors, terraces, balconies and basements. To accommodate the many visitors to the grand hotel an annex was built later in the triangular block between Buenos Aires, Belgrano and Boulevard Mar√≠timo. The annex originally had two floors, and another two were added later. The three blocks were linked by tunnels used by guests and staff. One ran under Calle Entre R√≠os and connected the original hotel with the dining hall, and another joined the dining center with the annex. Opening Residential building The Bristol Hotel opened on 8 January 1888, with invitations to attend the ceremony given to leading members of Buenos Aires society and national leaders. Many of the leading citizens of Buenos Aires came to the opening of the Hotel Bristol by overnight train. According to a contemporary report the guests arrived in what was then the village of Mar del Plata on a rainy and windy day, but all marvelled at the seascape. There was a great soiree at 21:30 in the salon of the Bristol, presumably in the first chalet. Dr. Carlos Pellegrini, vice-president of Argentina, gave the welcoming speech. Other guests at the opening were Dardo Rocha, the Buenos Aires Governor M√°ximo Paz and Bartolom√© Mitre. The first dinner had a menu prepared by 24 chefs hired from Europe. After the dinner the guests were entertained by the children and wives of the distinguished guests. History Playa Bristol in 1910 The great dining hall The Bristol was patronised by wealthy families of Buenos Aires and other parts of the country who would come to bathe in the sea. On the same year that the hotel was opened a large number of wooden casillas, or bathing machines, were erected on the Playa Bristol, and began to be joined by a platform covered in awnings. This was the start of the early Rambla de Madera. The rambla was about wide, resting directly on the sand. In January 1888 Pelusso, Narduzzo and La Cava began fishing for the hotel in the boat Lucaro. In March 1888 a French company was authorised to build the Rambla Bristol. On 15 December 1888 the Sociedad An√≥nima Bristol Hotel was authorised to construct a pier to provide access to the bathing machines. The first wooden ramblas (promenades) were opened, and the first residences began to be built. The Bristol was followed by La Perla Hotel in 1892, to the north, then the Hotel Royal in 1907 and the Saint James and Centenario hotels in 1910 on the Playa de Ingleses. When Mar del Plata was declared a city in 1907 the resort was called the \\"Biarritz of Argentina\\". In 1913 the French rambla was opened, with ceramic pavements from Belgium, balustrades and Greco-Roman statues. In the late 1920s wealthy families began to build chalets and mansions near the Hotel Bristol, and spent their days at the beach, named the Playa Bristol. More affordable hotels began to appear. Statistics from 1935 record six categories, not counting rooming houses. They catered to the new, broader social classes, who wanted a way to enjoy their newly earned leisure. Between 1930 and 1945 there was strong growth in the number of tourists visiting the town, while the duration of their holidays became shorter. Traditional hotels had to compete with vacation apartments and state-run lodgings. Working class tourists could use government grants to stay at holiday camps and union hotels, while the new middle-classes had a chance of acquiring a small property by the sea. The new government that emerged from the 1943 Argentine coup d'√©tat took moves to reduce rents and make eviction much harder, and set up a vacation office. The closing of the Bristol in June 1944 symbolized the end of the belle √©poque. Later uses of the building After the hotel was closed in 1944, all the installations were auctioned. Objects auctioned included furniture, vehicles, porcelain fittings and even towels. It took eight consecutive weeks to dispose of them all. The property was purchased by a company of Capital Federal. The annex was demolished in 1945. By 1964 the hotel building was being operated by the Galer√≠a Gran Central Empire State limited company, which had divided it into units rented for commercial use. The building had of space with 42 store fronts, 38 internal spaces, 24 stands and three cinemas. An auction was held on 22 February 1964 before an audience of 1,000 people, but the floor price of 290 million pesos was too high, and there were no buyers. After a second attempted auction and a foreclosure judgement the property was purchased for 100 million pesos by the Atarasico company. The Hotel Bristol was demolished in the mid-1970s in several stages as construction of the 30-story Bristol Center advanced. On 3 May 1974 sanitation workers performing an excavation in Calle Buenos Aires rediscovered the tunnel between the annex and the dining hall. It had been built of bricks laid on edge painted lime yellow. The floor had mosaics, apparently Italian. The passage was soon sealed again. The final stage of the demolition began in August 1974 with removal of the dome at San Mart√≠n and Entre R√≠os.

Kepler has successfully launched two 3U CubeSat technology demonstrator satellites: * KIPP (aka Kepler-1 COSPAR 2018-008Dhttps://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/kepler-1.htm), launched 19 January 2018 on a Long March 11 rocket; it was the first Ku-band commercial Low-Earth Orbit satellite ever launchedhttps://www.keplercommunications.com/network and the first Canadian satellite launched by Chinaspaceq.ca/in-a-first-china-launches-canadian- satellite-for-kepler-communications/. * CASE (aka Kepler-2 COSPAR 2018-096L), launched 29 November 2018 on a PSLV-CA rocket. Both are in Sun-Synchronous polar orbits. Company officials have stated a goal of growing their constellation up to 140 units, all located in Low Earth Orbit, approximately 575 km above the Earth‚Äôs surface. Their third satellite, TARS, is expected to launch before the end of 2019. The names KIPP, CASE, and TARS are taken from the fictitious US Marine Corps robots of the same name in the 2014 film ‚ÄúInterstellar‚Äù. The launch of Kepler's first satellite, KIPP, in January 2018. The company hopes to grow their business around data backhaul services that will serve remote business operators, shippers, research stations, and entities engaged in resource exploration and gathering (mining, oil and gas) in remote locations. Their units are capable of high-bandwidth transfer, allowing them to move data that is too cumbersome for existing real-time satellite communications systems. Additionally, Kepler is working to establish, using the same platform of satellites, an Internet of Things (IoT) communication system that will ease the problems caused by a global disparity between established communications methods and protocols across regions (no antenna currently exists which can communicate across all existing cellular networks). This solution is designed to be a low-power, low-bandwidth, and low-cost connectivity platforms for IoT devices around the globe. Kepler‚Äôs key technology is a high-capacity, high-throughput software-defined radio (SDR) that can provide 200 MHz of bandwidth, allowing for data throughput of 500 megabits/second (Mbps) in communication speed. All of Kepler‚Äôs satellites to date have been built by √ÖAC Clyde, a company based in Glasgow, Scotland that specializes in CubeSat and SmallSat production. Kepler Communications was founded in 2015 by four graduate students from the University of Toronto, who previously worked together on various design projects through the University of Toronto Aerospace Team. The startup was incubated at University of Toronto's Entrepreneurship Hatchery, the Creative Destruction Lab, Ryerson University's DMZ, and was part of the Techstars Seattle 2016 cohort. Kepler was able to raise $5M in a seed round financing at Techstars, and in the span of 12 months was able to take KIPP from design to orbit. In 2018, the company successfully completed their Series A financing round, raising a total of $16M USD. The round was led by Costanoa Ventures, with participation by Deutsche Bahn‚Äôs (DB) Digital Ventures as a strategic investor. The company is named in honour of Johannes Kepler, a pioneer in the discovery of the way in which objects in space interact. He is best known for his Laws of Planetary Motion.

The focus of her work is on the social history of the Jewish minority in Germany, and the relationships between the Germans and the Jews. In talking about her area of expertise, she likes to explain that there is a whole lot more to \\"Jewish history\\" than Auschwitz (\\"...j√ºdische Geschichte weit mehr umfasst als Auschwitz.\\"). Between 1993 and her retirement in 2001 she was the director of the Hamburg based \\"Institute for the History of German Jews\\" (\\"Institut f√ºr die Geschichte der deutschen Juden\\"). Life =Childhood in wartime= Monika Richarz was born in Berlin, and spent the first part of her childhood in the relatively quite Zehlendorf quarter. Her father (like his father before him) was a mechanical engineer. When war came, slightly more than two years after Monika's birth, he avoided conscription because of his health. He worked, instead, for the Technical Emergency Assistance Service (\\"Technische Nothilfe\\"), which involved reinstating gas, electricity and water supplies after air-raids on the city. He never joined the Nazi Party, although his daughter later described her parents as Nazi \\"fellow travellers\\", not actively involved in Nazi crimes, but not actively distancing themselves from the government either. Monika's mother was a teacher of domestic sciences, and was also involved in teacher training. In 1943 she and her mother were evacuated to Neuruppin, a small town a short distance to the north of Berlin. Later they moved again, going to live with her grandmother at Meiningen in Thuringia. It was therefore not in bombed out Berlin, but in small town Germany that at the age of 7 the child first experienced the horror of air-raids, first saw dead bodies being pulled out of rubble, and was first terrified by dive bombers on the walk to school. When war ended in 1945 Monika was summoned back to Berlin by her father. Back in Thuringia her sister was born soon afterwards, and in 1946 the family were reunited in Berlin-Zehlendorf. Although much of Berlin and the surrounding countryside were by now administered as the Soviet occupation zone, the western part of the city was subdivided into occupation zones controlled by British, US and French forces. Zehlendorf was in the US zone. Although she would participate in the student riots of 1968, Monika Richarz nevertheless retained many positive memories of the US occupation forces. She wore clothes donated by American Quakers and, with other children, became accustomed to asking \\"chocolate please\\" after gathering in front of a house in the neighbourhood that had been commandeered, and identified itself with a \\"No loitering\\" sign. During the next few years, within Berlin, the family were obliged to relocate frequently. Economically, however, as the rubble was cleared away, her father's skills were much prized, and he worked on reconstruction of the energy infrastructure in the eastern part of Berlin, not yet separated by the political, economic and physical barriers that would later divide the city according to the occupation zones established in 1945. After October 1949 the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as the German Democratic Republic and political differences between the two new Germanys became progressively harder to ignore. Monika's father resigned abruptly from his work in East Berlin after deciding he no longer wished to be placed under sustained pressure to join the recently created Socialist Unity Party (SED) which by this time was well on the way to becoming the ruling party in a new kind of one-party dictatorship, under Soviet sponsorship and subject to Soviet political and social constraints. He appears to have had no difficulty finding well paid work in West Berlin, where he later obtained a position as the director of a gas works. Monika was educated at a private school in the city. There were no books, and history was taught using hectograph copied sheets. The twentieth century was carefully excluded from the syllabus, but various earlier periods were studied intensively. She passed her school final exams (\\"Abitur\\") in 1956, which in principal cleared the way for admission to university level education. However, her father had died in 1954 and her mother had thereby become acutely aware of the need for women to be able to support themselves financially. Monika Richarz was persuaded to apply to train as a school teacher. Inwardly Richarz was not keen on this plan, and it was probably as a result of what today would be termed \\"passive resistance\\" that she successfully avoided being accepted as a trainee teacher. =Student= Instead she enrolled at Bonn University. After an \\"orientation term\\" she switched from Bonn to the Free University of Berlin where she studied History and, in particular, Medieval History. Shortly after embarking on her student career, in 1958, Richarz undertook a student exchange visit to Poland. The trip included Warsaw, Krakow and the nearby former concentration camp at Auschwitz. She was much affected. One of the things that most struck her, in 1958, was the contrasting approaches in Poland and in West Germany to the residuum from the destruction of the war and the murder of the Jews. The Free University, where she studied till successfully completing her degree in 1962, had an unusual, albeit brief, history, reflecting Berlin's wider political postwar tensions. Berlin's Humboldt University had ended up in the Soviet occupation zone in 1945, and was hurriedly but thoroughly modernised along Soviet principals. Following a series of student arrests and even, some said, executions, in 1947 students at the Humboldt demanded a university free from political influence. After several more months of largely low level confrontation between the students and the Soviet-backed authorities, a number of Berlin academics and politicians, eventually with the necessary backing of the US governor, General Clay, created of an alternative free university in the US administered sector. The Free University's first lectures were delivered in November 1948. By the time Monika Richarz enrolled there were already 10,846 students. The recent date of the university's foundation meant that, unusually in Germany, it was institutionally unencumbered by the shadows of a Nazi past. Its pioneering spirit attracted large numbers of overseas students and a number of returning high profile German academics who had been forced into exile for reasons of politics and race during the Nazi years. One of these was Adolf Leschnitzer (1899-1980), who after 1939 had built a successful academic career in New York, but who combined this, after 1952, with a post as a visiting professor at the Free University of Berlin, where he taught for one term each year over a period of twenty years. Between 1957 and 1972 Leschnitzer was Honorary Professor for Jewish History and Culture. One of his students was Monika Richarz. Indeed, she would continue to attend his seminars till 1972, one of just two women in his (never large) seminar group. Accurately summarizing Leschnitzer's career progression, she later described him as \\"a mixture of German secondary school teacher and American professor\\", while going on to add that for her, and for post war fellow students of Jewish provenance, he had unlocked the door to a completely new way of understanding Jewish culture. In August 1961 Richarz was still studying for her history degree. That month the sudden appearance of the \\"Anti-fascist protection wall\\" had an immediate personal impact on fellow students from East Berlin who found their route to the Free University being blocked. Spontaneously the members of Prof. Leschnitzer's seminar group became people smugglers, organising false identity papers and smuggling friends, hidden under cars, into West Berlin. It was, Richarz later reflected, \\"all very very dramatic\\". The next year she completed her exams and embarked on a probationary year as a trainee teacher. Her mother's imprecations on the need financial security had had their effect. However, after the excitement of university life, she found her days in school \\"deadly boring\\", and the pro-Nazi nostalgia (\\"braune Gesinnung\\") displayed by several colleagues she accompanied on a school expedition to Obersalzberg, \\"scandalous\\".The area around Obersalzberg had included Adolf Hitler's summer home/office at Berchtesgaden till 1945. Because of a concern that it might become a political pilgrimage destination for any remaining unreformed Nazi supporters, it was closed to Germans until 1949. However, by 1962/63 West German citizens were as free as anyone else to visit the area. =Academic and scholar= In 1964 she managed to negotiate a part time post at the Berlin Historical Commission (\\"Historische Kommission zu Berlin\\"), where she remained as a researcher till 1969. Monika Richarz submitted her doctoral dissertation in 1969. She had visited no fewer than 26 archives. She was not always well received. Many archivists suspected that anyone researching German Jewish history was simply bent on gathering evidence of anti-semitism. She received her doctorate in 1970 for a piece of work on the entry of Jews into the academic professions (\\"Eintritt der Juden in die akademischen Berufe\\"). The qualification, awarded by the Free University of Berlin, came with a coveted \\"magna cum laude\\" citation. After this, for two years between 1970 and 1972, she was employed by the West German Bundestag (national parliament) as a researcher in connection with an exhibition being staged in West Berlin in the \\"old Reichstag building\\" (as it was known at that time). The exhibition, presented under the title \\"Questions on German history\\" (\\"Fragen an die Deutsche Geschichte\\"), was timed to coincide with the centenary of German unification. This was followed by relocation to New York City, where Richarz worked as a research fellow at the Leo Baeck Institute between 1972 and 1979. She quickly found she had integrated herself into three contrasting worlds: she lived in the city's Lower East Side, \\"more or less a Puerto Rican slum\\" (Richarz) with empty houses, collapsed buildings, high crime and a developing fashion in the neighbourhood for Voodoo cult practices; she was also soon participating in a long string of animated discussions with members of the New York feminist movement, and each day she commuted to Upper West Side for her work at the institute. One major result of her eight years in New York was a volume entitled \\"Jewish life in Germany: memoirs from three centuries\\" / \\"J√ºdisches Leben in Deutschland: Selbstzeugnisse zur Sozialgeschichte\\" which, reflecting the trends in social history at the time, comprised a large collection of autobiographical memoirs. (The institute holds additional memoirs that she collected which never made it into print.) Collecting the many testimonies sometimes involved unconventional research methods, as she sought out written records inherited by their writers' heirs. She cultivated excellent relations with the book keeper of a firm of undertakers that numbered, among its clients, the families of a large number of German Jewish emigrants. Each of the three volumes in which the work eventually appeared included a lengthy introduction by Richarz, setting out her methods with clarity and providing readable insightful summaries which covered each of the three epochs of German Jewish history into which the volumes were arranged. The collection also highlights the extent to which many of the people whose writings it features lived in rural Germany which, as Richarz was quick to point out, comprehensively refuted the stereotyping of German Jews as inhabitants only of the large cities. That theme was one to which she returned after moving back to Germany. In 1993, working jointly with , and again under the auspices of the Leo Baeck Institute, she produced a compilation entitled \\"Jewish life in the countryside: studies on German Jewish history\\" (\\"J√ºdisches Leben auf dem Lande: Studien zur deutsch-j√ºdischen Geschichte\\"). In 1983 Richarz took over as director of the Germania Judaica in Cologne, a library concerned with the history of German Jews. She arrived at a difficult time, shortly after Prof. Hermann Greive had been shot dead by a firearms-obsessed former student called Sabine Gehlhaar, while delivering a seminar in the library. This had a traumatising impact on the institution. Richarz nevertheless acquired a new zest for teaching, taking on roles as a guest lecturer at the Academy for Jewish Studies in Heidelberg and at Z√ºrich university. She retained her post at the Germania Judaica till 1993. On 1 December 1993 she took up an appointment as director of the \\"Institute for the History of German Jews\\" (\\"Institut f√ºr die Geschichte der deutschen Juden\\"), in Hamburg, and was able, with the support of younger colleagues, notably Stefan Rohrbacher, Andreas Br√§mer, and Beate Meyer, both to improve its hitherto precarious finances and to raise significantly the level of activity. Richarz used her formidable network of contacts to raise the institute's profile internationally. She herself also continued with her teaching activities and, on 27 November 1996 accepted a professorship from the university. Monika Richarz retired from her directorship of the institute formally in 2001, to be succeeded by Stefanie Sch√ºler-Springorum.

At the turn of the last century, international Latin American students began traveling to the United States for an education in larger numbers. English began replacing French as the second language to learn in Latin America so instead of traveling to Europe for an education, wealthy Latin American families began to send their sons to the United States. As a result, Latin American students began to establish student organizations that would cater to their needs. Lehigh University has the distinction of having the first Latino student organization in the United States, the Club Hispano Americano. The Club Hispano Americano was founded in 1887, 13 years before Psi Alpha Kappa was established.

Namely, he argued that Maxwell and his followers focused on 'effortless gating' a molecule at a time, but overlooked simultaneous interference of other chaotic molecules, while the demon exorcists tried to justify impossible processes with misplaced 'compensations' by work of measurements and gate operation, and information storage and memory erasure with entropy generation.. Some other unjustified claims, fundamentally misplaced and dramatized, like ‚Äúheat flowing from cold to hot without external intervention,‚Äù have been critically analyzed and demystified by Kostic .

He credited his brother Simcha with saving his life, since when he arrived at the camp Simcha said he was a pharmacist and that Philip was his assistant. He was given the role of \\"working Jew\\", doing menial tasks such as shaving prisoners while avoiding being executed. The prisoners often believed they were merely being deloused instead of sent to extermination chambers. One day his task was to empty piles of dead bodies from train cars. He tried to pull a woman from the train but her skin stuck to his hands, amusing his Nazi overseer. He and his brother joined a rebellion on October 14, 1943 which overpowered the Nazis and freed 300 of their prisoners. He heard one of the revolt's leaders say as they stood on a table, \\"If you survive, bear witness! Tell the world about this place!\\" Russian prisoners of war showed the Jews how to fight. Bialowitz served as the messenger, telling SS officers that they had boots and leather coats for them. When they came, the resisters killed eleven of them with knives and axes. Bialowitz recalled jumping over the barbed wire to run towards German officers quarters in order to cut off the electricity. After escaping the extermination camp, he wandered Lublin District with his brother and other survivors. They eventually found shelter with a Catholic couple named Micha≈Ç and Maria Mazurek, who hid them in their barn until the Red Army arrived. Only about 50 escapees survived to the end of the war. He was trained by a former Nazi doctor to be a dental assistant. After the war he married and had children while pushing for the prosecution of Nazi war criminals. Bialowitz moved to Columbus, Ohio. He eventually settled in New York and worked as a jeweler. Along with fellow survivor Thomas Blatt, he was one of the witnesses for the prosecution at the trial of John Demjanjuk in 2010.Demjanjuk-Prozess: ‚ÄûWir h√∂rten die Schreie aus den Gaskammern‚Äú. S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, May 17, 2010, Retrieved August 8, 2016. He wrote the acclaimed book, A Promise at Sobibor, which detailed his early life growing up in Poland, his experience during World War II, and his postwar life. Later in life he traveled around the world lecturing about the Holocaust and his personal experiences. Bialowitz often said that he had \\"a mission to perform.\\" He died in Florida on August 6, 2016, at the age of 90.

It was published under the title The Wise-Woman of Hogsdon in 1638, though it was probably first performed c. 1604 by the Queen's Men company (of which Heywood was a shareholder), either at The Curtain or perhaps The Red Bull.Massai (2002, xi‚Äìxii) and McLuskie (1994, 2). The location is spelt both \\"Hogsdon\\" and \\"Hogsden\\" in the text published in 1638. The play is set in Hoxton, an area that at the time was outside the boundaries of the city of London and notorious for its entertainments and recreations.Massai (2002, 98). Hogsdon was an alternative spelling of Hoxton that was in use until the first half of the eighteenth century. References to the area in other early modern plays include Ben Jonson's The Alchemist (5.2.17‚Äì20) and Francis Beaumont's The Knight of the Burning Pestle (4.1.446‚Äì447). The Victorian critic F. G. Fleay suggested that Heywood, who was also an actor, originally played the part of Sencer.Massai (2002, xiv). It has often been compared with Ben Jonson's comic masterpiece The Alchemist (1610)‚Äîthe poet T. S. Eliot, for example, argued that with this play Heywood \\"succeeds with something not too far below Jonson to be comparable to that master's work\\".Quoted by Massai (2002, xii‚Äìxiii). Characters * Young Robin Chartley, a wild-headed gentleman * Boyster, a blunt fellow * Sencer, a conceited gentleman * Haringfield, a civil gentleman * Luce, a goldsmith's daughter * Luce's father, a goldsmith * Joseph, the goldsmith's apprentice * Old Master Chartley, Robin Chartley's father, a country gentleman * Serving- man 1, Young Chartley's man * Giles, Old Chartley's man * Sir Harry, a knight who is no piece of a scholar * Gratiana, Sir Harry's daughter * Tabor, Sir Harry's man * Sir Boniface, an ignorant pedant, or schoolmaster * The Wise Woman of Hoxton, who bears the name of the drama * A Countryman, client to the Wise Woman * A Kitchen Maid, who comes to the Wise Woman for counsel * Two Citizen's Wives, who also come to the Wise Woman for counsel * Luce 2, a young country gentlewoman * Serving-man 2, Gratiana's man Text and composition Frontispiece to the 1638 edition =Printing= The play consists of thirteen scenes divided into five acts, the longest of which is the final d√©nouement.Act five, scene two consists of 276 lines (12 percent of the whole); the play in total has 2,282 lines; see Heywood (2002). This segmentation seems to be authorial, since Heywood appears to have been involved in the preparation of the play for publication in quarto in 1638, in which the act divisions appear.The editor of the modern Globe edition, Sonia Massai, concludes that \\"[i]nternal evidence supports the theory of Heywood's involvement with the printing\\"; see Heywood (2002, 133‚Äì134). Henry Shepard, who had a shop \\"at the sign of the Bible\\" in Chancery Lane between Sergeant's Inn and Fleet Street (according to the play's title-page), published this first edition, on whose behalf \\"M. P.\\" printed it (the printer is assumed to be Marmaduke Parsons).According to Massai, Parsons had been appointed as a \\"master printer\\" in 1637; see Heywood (2002, 131). The . =Dramatic composition= The play employs both blank verse and prose, with a character's speech often switching between modes during a scene as its dramatic function changes. It also makes substantial use of audience contact and direct address. Many characters adopt disguises‚Äîparticularly Luce 2, who is cross-dressed as a male (the page, \\"Jack\\"), who is subsequently cross-dressed again as a female for the pivotal masked wedding in the middle of the play.The secret wedding- ceremony is enacted just offstage, in the \\"withdrawing-room\\" in the Wise Woman's house in Hoxton, during the first scene of act three (3.1.79). When Boyster meets Luce 2 on the street outside in the confusion of its immediate aftermath, he asks her (mistakenly thinking that this is the person he has just married) \\"What art thou, girl or boy?\\", to which she/he replies: > Both and neither: I was a lad last night, but in the > morning I was conjured into a lass, and being a > girl now, I shall be translated into a boy anon. Here's > all I can at this time say for myself. Farewell. (3.2.35‚Äì38) As with the majority of female roles on the public stages of the early modern English theatre, Luce 2 would have been played by a boy player when the play was first performed.Orgel qualifies the claim that no women appeared onstage in England in this period, by pointing to non-professional participation in court masques, the records of professional female performers in the Lord Mayor of London pageants of 1523 and 1534, and various foreign professional female performers on the London stage in this period (1996, 4‚Äì9). =Structure and presentation of space= With only three exceptions, the scenes alternate between interior and exterior dramatic locations.After act two, scene one, which takes place on the street outside the Wise Woman's house in Hoxton, the following two scenes are both indoors (in Sir Harry's house on Grace Street and inside the house of the Wise Woman in Hoxton, respectively); after that, there are two exterior scenes (one outside the Wise Woman's house again and the other presumably on the street near to Luce's shop); two exterior scenes also follow the interior setting of act four, scene one. The interior of the Wise Woman's house in Hoxton is shown only twice‚Äîthough, in each case, they are the most theatrical and significant scenes in the play (act three, scene one and act five, scene two). The central crisis in the play's dramatic structure is staged there (the secret wedding-ceremony, in which two pairs of disguised participants are married by the pedantical scholar and deacon, Sir Boniface, only to be abruptly dispersed when the Wise Woman interrupts with a false alarm).The pairs of characters who are married in act three, scene one are: Luce and Boyster; Chartley and Luce 2. At the time, the first member of each pair thinks that they are marrying one another. The Wise Woman ensures that she waits long enough for the ceremony to be completed before disrupting it with her repeated cries (attempting to sound \\"like a madwoman\\") of \\"Shift for yourselves, warrants and pursuivants! Away!\\" (3.1.36‚Äì38). It is also the site of the complex d√©nouement in the final scene (whose sophisticated patterning of comic revelations from all sides has drawn the praise of many critics). =The Wise Woman= The play delineates the social identities of its characters clearly and locates them within a hierarchical system of relations with one another.McLuskie (1998, 132). The two aristocratic fathers are distributed according to the traditional opposition of the rural and the urban, since one of them lives in the country and the other in the city. Gratiana's father, Sir Harry, lives on Grace Street in London. The protagonist's father, Old Master Chartley, is introduced at the beginning of act five with his exclamation that \\"London is a stranger grown and out of my acquaintance\\", since for \\"seven years I have not seen Paul's steeple or Cheap Cross\\" (5.1.1‚Äì3). The old cathedral of St Paul's was known at the time as a site frequented by beggars, thieves, and prostitutes, where one would go to pick up gossip, topical jokes, or the latest news of current affairs, war, religion, parliament, and the court. The conspirators of the Gunpowder plot were executed in front of the cathedral in 1605. Its steeple was destroyed in a fire on 4 June 1561 and was never rebuilt‚ÄîOld Chartley's familiarity with the city may be more out-of-date than he admits. Cheap Cross was a landmark in Cheapside that was removed in 1643 by Puritans; see Massai in Heywood (2002, 121). The illiterate Wise Woman's \\"cunning\\" ignorance, which \\"can fool so many that think themselves wise\\" (as Luce 2 puts it in one of her frequent deflationary asides to the audience), is contrasted with the impenetrable learning of the \\"ignorant pedant\\" Sir Boniface, whose habit of conversing in Latin generates the significant comic action of the subplot.Sir Boniface is described in the dramatis person√¶ as \\"an ignorant pedant, or schoolmaster\\" and as \\"a deacon\\" by the Wise Woman (3.1.30). The liminality of the Wise Woman's house, located in the disreputable suburbs outside the jurisdiction of the city of London, is also expressed in the marginality of the character herself and in her dramatic function. She is the enabling figure who steers the play towards its comic resolution, driven by the antagonistic action of the play's crossed-dressed heroine, Luce 2, which tempers and contains the disruptive forces released by the dissolute and intemperate protagonist, Young Chartley. At the end of act four, scene three‚Äîhaving whispered her plan for the complex climax of the drama to Luce, Sencer, and Boyster, each in turn‚Äîthe Wise Woman encourages them all to place responsibility for their fates in her ability to manage what she has called \\"a plot to make a play on.\\"See (3.1.157) and (4.3.81‚Äì83). She promises that \\"if I fail in any of these or the rest, I lay myself open to all your displeasures.\\"(4.3.81‚Äì83). The Wise Woman functions as the comedy's stage-manager, master of ceremonies, or book-holder. =The two Luces= That the only two female characters to appear in act one share the same name‚ÄîLuce‚Äîis not revealed to the audience until act three, just before the secret wedding, when Luce 2 explains as much in an aside.Luce 2 remarks that \\"it happens so luckily, that my name should be Luce too, to make the marriage more firm!\\" (3.1.88‚Äì90). Despite this, the two are also clearly distinguished, both in social terms and in terms of the dramatic functions each serves. Luce 2 has disguised herself as a page and offers herself as a servant to the Wise Woman, though in reality she is an aristocrat. The first appearance of her namesake, Luce 1, shows her at work, sewing.(1.2.1‚Äì12). The stage direction at the beginning of the scene indicates that Luce is on display \\"in a sempster's shop\\" (1.2.1 SD), though she is described as the daughter of a goldsmith (2.1.149). Presumably this is the same goldsmith from whom Gratiana, later in the play, orders her servant Tabor to fetch her fan (3.3.28). In Luce's first long speech to Joseph, she suggests that her father is forcing her to sit in public view while she works. The line \\"Do you attend the shop, I'll ply my work\\" (1.2.7) indicates that Joseph is her addressee, though McLuskie misidentifies it as audience address; see McLuskie (1998, 129). When her father arrives to endorse her precipitous proposed marriage to the aristocratic protagonist, Young Chartley, the older man is identified as \\"a plain citizen\\".(1.2.134 SD). Luce 1's father explains that he rejoices to hear that his daughter \\"is preferred / And raised to such a match\\" with a gentleman who, as Chartley claims, is worth ten thousand pounds.See (1.2.143‚Äì144; 171‚Äì172). Throughout the play, the citizen Luce [1] frequently stresses her lack of agency and self-determination. She is presented as a patient to the actions of others. She passively endures the pathos of the paradoxical state that the secrecy of the marriage creates, in which the meaningful social distinction between \\"maid\\" and \\"wife\\" is suspended for her. For the aristocratic Luce [2], in contrast, her disguise‚Äîand its ability to 'conjure' and 'translate' appearance‚Äîallows her far greater scope than her poorer namesake enjoys. At the end of act one, when Luce 2 occupies the position of close contact with the audience, having eavesdropped on Young Chartley's plot to marry Luce 1, she reveals her disguise and the play's particular point-of-attack within a broader sequence of events: Young Chartley is in flight from a previous scene of matrimonial jilting, she explains, and she comes in pursuit of her wayward husband-to-be. Entering the drama, in this sense, in media res, she is fleeing a situation similar to that which her citizen namesake will soon experience‚Äîthe suspension of the distinction \\"maid\\"/\\"wife\\". The trajectory of the aristocratic Luce 2's active pursuit of the praxis of dramatic agency counters and contains the flow of betrayals that emanates from the protagonist's desire and drives the action towards its comic resolution. =The protagonist's desire= Young Chartley, the play's aristocratic protagonist, frequently relates to the objects of his desire (Luce 1, then Gratiana) by means of imagery involving wealth, commodities, or sexual possession and objectification.For example, in act one, scene two, Luce threatens to leave until Chartley swears to \\"keep your tongue within more moderate bounds\\" (1.2.110). He swears \\"as I am virtuous, I will\\", only to turn immediately to the audience to rail against the labyrinthine constraints of marriage and to reaffirm his desire to possess her (for which he mobilises the ribald metaphor of Luce as a shoe that he must set \\"on the last, though it cost me all the shoes in my shop\\" (1.2.119‚Äì120)). He first refers to her as \\"this dandiprat\\" (1.1.139) and in the next scene welcomes her acceptance of his marriage proposal as a \\"bargain\\" (1.2.132). A \\"dandiprat\\" was a sixteenth- century coin that was worth about three and a half pence, whose small size invited metaphorical usage. There is a character called Dandiprat in Blurt, Master Constable (1602), possibly by Thomas Middleton and/or Thomas Dekker. See Massai in Heywood (2002, 100). When his marriage to the citizen Luce [1] has become an inconvenience to be discarded in act three, scene three, he regrets having made a match with \\"so beggarly a kindred\\" and having \\"grafted in the stock of such a choke-pear\\", when the far superior attractions of \\"a goodly popering\\" as the knight's daughter, Gratiana, are on display (an image which bawdily regards Gratiana as a popering pear, whose shape is associated with that of a penis and scrotum and a coital pun on \\"pop-her-in\\", in relation to the folk-song \\"Pop Goes the Weasel!\\").A popering was a delicious variety of pears imported from Poperinge, according to Massai's gloss; see Heywood (2002, 112). Partridge, however, identifies the bawdy sense, citing Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (2.1.37‚Äì38); see Partridge (1968, 213). In the first scene, when Chartley teases Sencer (his friend and competitor for the affections of Sir Harry's daughter and who is also identified as a gentleman) about his attempts to court Gratiana (before he sees her for himself in act three, scene three, when her brief appearance precipitates his decision to abandon Luce 1), Chartley claims that he has heard: > That she hath..., as other women have; > That she goes for a maid, as others do The elision was to be filled extemporaneously in performance, presumably. As well as omitting a bawdy word from the printed text, the quarto of 1638 includes the stage direction \\"etc.\\", implying additional spontaneous elaboration by the player.(1.1.118‚Äì119). In her 2002 edition of the play, Massai omits the quarto's stage direction \\"&c.;\\" (short for et cetera) at the end of \\"That she hath..., as other women have\\", noting in the textual commentary that this indication \\"might suggest something too bawdy for print\\"; see Heywood (2002, 135). The idea of virginity as a deceptive disguise that women commonly adopt forms a refrain that is heard several times, which relates to the paradoxical position in which the secrecy of the marriage places Luce, as simultaneously \\"[a] maid and a wife\\" (4.3.26)‚Äîwhich Luce 2 recognises as her own position, too.Luce 2 remarks in an aside to the audience: \\"I know that by myself\\" (4.3.28); the paradox is also felt in her \\"[b]oth and neither\\" gender (3.2.35‚Äì38). When Luce 1 finally acquiesces to Chartley's demands near the end of the first act, the proposal of marriage is inextricably yoked to the question of her virginity‚Äîthe question he actually asks is not \\"will you marry me?\\" but rather \\"I hope thou art a maid, Luce?\\"‚Äîand, given his dominance up until this point of the register of audience contact (his displacement from this position by Luce 2 brings the first act to a close; he doesn't occupy it again until the end of act three), a comic moment of ironic counterperspective, expressed when Luce responds in the affirmative through audience contact, seems implicit.See (1.2.127‚Äì130). Performance history The play was given a staged reading at Shakespeare's Globe theatre on 4 November 2001, as part of their Read, Not Dead programme.Heywood (2002, vii). This is a script-in-hand staging that the actors rehearse for the first time on the same day as the performance. When The Wise Woman of Hoxton was presented, one cast-member recalled how, at the beginning of act four, scene three, Alex Harcourt-Smith, in the role Sencer (who has a soliloquy to the audience at this point in the play), missed his cue: \\"After what seemed an eternity (but was probably only a minute or so of dead stage time) the realisation dawned on the actor that it was his ‚Äúturn‚Äù and he exploded on to the stage with a line gifted beautifully to him in the text, ‚ÄúNow or Never!‚Äù You can imagine that this brought the house down!\\"Chalmers (2016). The soliloquy reads: \\"Now or never! Look about thee, Sencer; tomorrow is the marriage day, which to prevent lies not within the compass of my apprehension. Therefore I have disguised myself, to go to the looming woman's, the fortune-teller's, the anything, the nothing. This over against Mother Redcap's is her house. I'll knock\\" (4.3.1‚Äì7). The performance was staged by Alan Cox, with Jeanne Hepple as the Wise Woman, Rebecca Palmer as Luce 2, Alexis Karne as Luce 1, and Katarina Olsson as Gratiana; James Wallace played Chartley, James Chalmers played Boyster, and Jean-Paul van Cauwelaert was Haringfield, with Bryan Robson as Sir Harry and Liam McKenna as Sir Boniface.Heywood (2002, x). Analysis and criticism Writing in 1888, John Addington Symonds argued that despite the play's superficial resemblance to Ben Jonson's comic masterpiece The Alchemist (1610), insofar as it also focuses on \\"the quackeries and impostures of a professed fortune-teller\\", nevertheless \\"to mention it in the same breath\\" as the latter work \\"would be ridiculous.\\"Symonds (1888, xiii). Algernon Charles Swinburne, writing in 1908, suggested that the play evidenced Heywood's dramatic powers at their height and was one of the best examples of a comedy of intrigue.Swinburne (1908, 245). The dramatic structure of the first and last scenes in particular drew his admiration: > The culmination of accumulating evidence by which the rascal hero is > ultimately overwhelmed and put to shame, driven from lie to lie and reduced > from retractation to retractation as witness after witness starts up against > him from every successive corner of the witch's dwelling, is as masterly in > management of stage effect as any contrivance of the kind in any later and > more famous comedy: nor can I remember a more spirited and vivid opening to > any play than the quarrelling scene among the gamblers with which this one > breaks out at once into life-like action, full of present interest and > promise of more to come.Swinburne (1908, 248). He was less convinced, though, by the way in which the end of the play allows \\"the triumphant escape of a villanous old impostor and baby-farmer from the condign punishments due to her misdeeds\\"; he regarded this failure to punish the Wise Woman as a violation of the sense of poetic justice, which had been perpetrated, he argued, for the sake of a satisfying conclusion.Swinburne (1908, 249). He noted a similarity between the protagonist Chartley and that of How a Man May Choose a Good Wife from a Bad (1602), which he offered in support of the claim of Heywood's authorship of the earlier comedy.Swinburne (1908, 246). Chartley was, in his estimation, \\"an abject ruffian of unredeemed and irredeemable rascality.\\" M. C. Bradbrook, writing in 1955, didn't judge Chartley so harshly‚Äîhe is \\"not a serious character\\" and his \\"repentance is boyish and unabashed\\".Bradbrook (1955, 135). She, too, admired the ingenuity and \\"exceptionally fine sense of construction\\" achieved in the final scene. She considered the play to be a particularly farcical treatment of the device of the prodigal son, the prototype for which is found in How a Man May Choose a Good Wife from a Bad.Bradbrook (1955, 133). This device usually involves the prodigal \\"having to choose between a faithful wife and a wanton mistress, choosing wrongly at first and later being brought to repentance.\\" In Bradbrook's account, the play belongs to a more general shift within English popular comedy away from adventure stories and towards a greater interest in those focused on love.Bradbrook (1955, 133‚Äì137). Kathleen E. McLuskie also draws attention to the final scene, which she compares with the complex staging involved in the eavesdropping scene in Shakespeare's romantic comedy Love's Labour's Lost (c. 1595) and the brothel scene in Thomas Dekker and John Webster's city comedy Westward Ho (1604).McLuskie (1994, 109, 189). The eavesdropping scene in Love's Labour's Lost is act four, scene three. That play also contains a pedantic schoolmaster, Holofernes. Massai also compares the final scene of The Wise Woman of Hoxton with Love's Labour's Lost (2002, xiii). She links the dramatic strategy of The Wise Woman of Hoxton with Dekker's The Honest Whore (1604), insofar as both transpose the marriage- problem plot from domestic tragedy into a city comedy setting.McLuskie (1994, 128‚Äì129). The resolution in Heywood's play, though, arises from the cross- dressed heroine, rather than the \\"supervisory men\\".McLuskie (1994, 129). She detects a contrast between a familiar urban morality at work throughout the first act and the setting of act two, where the resolution will be effected‚Äîoutside the Wise Woman's house in Hoxton, \\"in which the dangerous and transgressive potentialities of the city comedy world are offered and avoided.\\"McLuskie (1994, 129‚Äì130). McLuskie argues that this morality informs Haringfield's call to temperance in scene one and Luce's reluctance to be on display as she sews a handkerchief in scene two, which signals her virtue and suitability to function as the heroine. The play attempts to navigate significant distinctions within the culture of Jacobean London, McLuskie argues, insofar as it seeks to relate to and to distinguish itself from both popular culture and cultures of learning.McLuskie (1994, 130‚Äì131). The exuberant thread of a \\"celebration of the potentialities of the new London\\" and its commercial values complicates the traditional moral scheme of the play, she suggests.McLuskie (1994, 131‚Äì133). She notes that the play does not focus on any use of magic by the Wise Woman, but rather on the more familiar comic conventions of disguise.McLuskie (1994, 131). Disguises are adopted by Chartley, Sencer (as a schoolmaster, as a servant), Boyster, Luce, and Luce 2. Luce 2 arrives cross-dressed as a male, then later adopts an additional layer of disguise as a woman. Cross-dressing, in particular, \\"released the heroine for a more active role in the plotting, making her the subject as much as the object of action\\", since it \\"removes the character from both the domestic arena, where her action would be restricted to the roles of a wife, and the world of city comedy where her sexuality would be at issue.\\"McLuskie (1994, 133). McLuskie relates this dramatic strategy to Thomas Middleton and Dekker's The Roaring Girl (c. 1607). Sonia Massai identifies Heywood's use of stock characters familiar from his other plays, such as the dissolute youth, the pedantic schoolmaster, and the foolish old father, as well as relating The Wise Woman of Hoxton to a number of other contemporary plays that included a Griselda-type heroine: All's Well That Ends Well, Measure for Measure, and How a Man May Choose a Good Wife from a Bad.Massai (2002, xii; xiv). The play also frequently makes use of references to specific geographical locations in London, she notices, which gives it a sense of immediacy and presence in the city. Notes Sources * Bradbrook, M.

She participated in an engagement and a campaign that earned her crews clasps to the Naval General Service Medal. She was lost with all hands in 1814 when she capsized in the West Indies. Capture On 16 December 1805 captured the French privateer schooner Elisabeth after a 12-hour chase. Elizabeth, which was out of Guadaloupe, was armed with ten 6-pounder guns and four 9-pounder carronades. She had a crew of 102, but 11 men were away in the Cambrian, which Elizabeth had captured after Cambrian had left a convoy on 28 October. Cambrian had been carrying a cargo of coal from Cork to Jamaica; HMS Melville recaptured Cambrian. Cochrane noted that Elizabeth was a fine vessel, well worth taking into the Royal Navy, which advice the Navy took. Service Lieutenant Charles Finch commissioned HMS Elizabeth in Antigua in 1808. Elizabeth sailed on 15 December 1809 from Basse-terre, Guadeloupe, with a small squadron in search of a French squadron reported to be in the area. Over the next two days two frigates and two sloops joined them.James (1837), Vol. 5, pp.189-91. The squadron sighted two French ships on 17 December and gave chase. These were the fl√ªtes Loire and Seine. The two fl√ªtes evaded the pursuing British and anchored under a shore battery in a cove at Anse √† la Barque, Guadeloupe. On 17 December 1809 Elizabeth joined the squadron at Anse la Barque. Captain Volant Vashon Ballard of Blonde sent Elizabeth to try for an anchorage. Blonde then followed to provide support. Once they had determined that British frigates could anchor, they withdrew. Late that afternoon Blonde and came in, anchored, and engaged the two French ships. The 74-gun and the frigate (also Freija) cannonaded the batteries. , , , and Elizabeth, in the meantime, towed in the boats of the squadron to land seamen and marines to storm the batteries. Loire and Seine struck, but Seine caught fire when her crew fired their guns into her hold to scuttle her, and exploded. This set fire to Loire. The result was that both were destroyed. British accounts state that the landing party succeeded in capturing a battery; French accounts state that Battery Coupard, of four guns, repelled them. In all, the British lost nine men killed, and 22 wounded, but Elizabeth herself apparently sustained no casualties. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasp \\"Anse la Barque 18 Decr. 1809\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. Still under Finch's command, Elizabeth participated in the capture of Guadeloupe in January and February 1810. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasp \\"Guadaloupe\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. On 24 March 1810, the inhabitants of St Thomas presented Lieutenant Edward F. Dwyer with a gift of 140 guineas to purchase a sword or such other object of his choosing as a token of their appreciation for his service as commander of Elizabeth while she served as a guardship there.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 24, pp.103-4. At some point the Navy converted Elizabeth from a schooner to a brig. The letter from the inhabitants of St Thomas refers to Elizabeth as a schooner. However, a listing of vessels on the Leeward Islands station as of 1 July 1812, shows the gun-brig Elizabeth, of 10 guns and 55 men, under the command of Lieutenant E.F. Dwyer. On 24 November 1812 Elizabeth captured the schooner Laura. Elizabeth, , , and were in company on 13 March 1813 when they captured Lark. Loss By 1814 Elizabeth was under the command of Lieutenant Jonathan Widdicombe Dyer. She capsized in the West Indies on 31 October 1814 while pursuing an American privateer.

It is known to the public under the last name of one of its creators‚ÄîIrina Yarovaya. Among the amendments included an expansion of authority for law enforcement agencies, new requirements for data collection and mandatory deciphering in the telecommunications industry, and increased regulation of evangelism, including a ban on the performance of \\"missionary activities\\" in non-religious settings.  Legislative history  In April 2016 Irina Yarovaya, together with Aleksei Pushkov, and Nadezhda Gerasimova and senator Victor Ozerov introduced a project of legislation that would toughen penalties for extremism and terrorism. On 13 May 2016, the act passed after the first reading. Prior to that, it had received support from the prime minister's cabinet. On 7 July it was signed by the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin. Most of the act's amendments came into effect on 20 July 2016. Amendments that require telecom operators to store recordings of phone conversations, text messages and users' internet traffic up to 6 months were announced to come into place on 1 July 2018; however, senator Anton Belyakov has submitted a proposal to move the regulations' start date to 2023, because of the extreme amount of data storage technology needed to make fulfilling the requirements possible.  Content  = Penal provisions = The amendments of the Yarovaya law include lengthening of prison terms for a number of criminal activities, introduction of new reasons to deny entry or departure to and from Russia, and the introduction of criminal liability for failure to report to law enforcement authorities that someone else \\"has been planning, is perpetrating, or has perpetrated\\" terrorist activity. =Surveillance provisions= The Yarovaya amendments require telecom providers to store the content of voice calls, data, images and text messages for 6 months, and the metadata on them (e.g. time, location, and sender and recipients of messages) for 3 years. Online services such as messaging services, email and social networks that use encrypted data are required to permit the Federal Security Service (FSB) to access and read their encrypted communications. Internet and telecom companies are required to disclose these communications and metadata, as well as \\"all other information necessary\\" to authorities on request and without a court order. =Anti-evangelism provisions= The amendments also include new restrictions on evangelism and missionary work. The amendments add a new provision to Russia's Religion Legislation, stating that \\"missionary activity\\" may only be performed \\"without hindrance\\" at churches and other religious sites designated by the chapter. It is explicitly banned from residential buildings. \\"Missionary activity\\" is defined as > The activity of a religious association, aimed at disseminating information > about its beliefs among people who are not participants (members, followers) > in that religious association, with the purpose of involving these people as > participants (members, followers). It is carried out directly by religious > associations or by citizens and/or legal entities authorised by them, > publicly, with the help of the media, the internet or other lawful means\\". Missionary activities may not be used to pursue violations of public safety, \\"the motivation of citizens to refuse to fulfil their civic duties as established by law and to commit other illegal acts\\", suicide, or the refusal of medical treatment on religious grounds as aims. Missionary activities may only be performed by authorized members of registered religious groups and organizations. A group becomes ineligible to perform missionary activities if they have been banned under a court order for practicing extremism or terrorism, or have been liquidated. Foreign missionaries may only perform missionary activities after registering for a permit from a recognized religious organization. Citizens are also required to report unauthorized religious activity to the government or face fines.  Implementation  =Surveillance provisions= Because of unprecedented data storage requirements, implementation of the law has been described as impossible and extremely expensive. The Russian Post estimated that the implementation of the law would cost the organization 500 billion rubles for initial purchases of equipment and 100 billion rubles yearly. Implementation of the law by other delivery and freight services was estimated to cost around 180 billion rubles, which is projected to cause 30‚Äì40% drop in online number of purchases. Cell service operators will need 2.2 trillion rubles to comply, which will cause a two- or threefold rise in the cost of mobile services for the consumer. Edward Snowden estimated the combined cost of implementation to be 33 billion dollars and predicted that the overall security levels will be unaffected, despite giant affiliated costs. After Putin signed the law, it turned out that equipment that is needed to store all the data is non-existent not only in Russia, but in the world. Because of that Putin has issued a call for government contracts to Russian companies for the required hardware and software. =Anti-evangelism provisions= A number of missionaries have been subject to arrest for violating the law and, upon conviction, have been fined. Donald and Ruth Ossewaarde, independent missionaries working in Oryol, were fined 40,000 rubles (around $700), prompting the couple to leave the country; Sergei Zhuravlyov, a Ukrainian Reformed Orthodox Church of Christ representative, was arrested for engaging in preaching in St. Petersburg; and Ebenezer Tuah of Ghana, the leader of the Christ Embassy church, was arrested and fined 50,000 rubles for conducting baptisms at a sanatorium.Mark Woods, US missionary's work ended by Russia's anti-evangelism law, Christian Today (September 2, 2016). On 9 July 2016, Jim Mulcahy, a 72-year-old American pastor who is the Eastern European coordinator for the U.S.-based Metropolitan Community Church, was arrested and deported under the prohibition of missionary activities at non-religious sites, after advertising and holding a \\"tea party\\" in Samara with an LGBT group. Authorities had targeted Mulcahy under suspicions that he was planning to organize a same-sex wedding.  Criticism and protests  Russia's largest telecommunication and internet companies expressed their concerns regarding the negative impacts of the law on their businesses and on the Russian economy on the whole. A Change.org petition to completely cancel Yarovaya's Act collected over 600,000 signatures. Russian Public Initiative petition has been signed more than 100,000 times. A number of protests were organized in cities, including in Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Ufa, Kazan and Volgograd. A 9 August protest in Moscow has seen over 2,000 participants. =Criticisms of anti-evangelism provisions= The anti-evangelism provisions of the legislation prompted an outcry of concern and opposition from Russia's Protestant minority, which makes up about 1% of Russia's population. According to experts, the law is likely to be interpreted in a way so as to block churches other than the Russian Orthodox Church evangelizing to ethnic Russians. Religious denominations with a smaller presence in Russia have long been viewed with hostility from government officials and Russian Orthodox religious authorities. The harsh new restrictions on minority religious groups were in addition to requirements under a 1997 law that mandated registration and administrative procedures which many religious groups found onerous and expensive to comply with. Thomas J. Reese, the chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, said that \\"Neither these measures nor the currently existing anti-extremism law meet international human rights and religious freedom standards\\" and that the Yarovaya Law \\"will make it easier for Russian authorities to repress religious communities, stifle peaceful dissent, and detain and imprison people.\\" Faith McDonnell of the Institute on Religion and Democracy in Washington, D.C., said: \\"The law doesn't do that much to defend from terrorism and only prevents Christians and others who are not [Russian] Orthodox from preaching and proselytizing.\\" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Nicole Thompson wrote that: \\"We believe that these new amendments will not better protect Russia‚Äôs citizens, but are rather part of a troubling Russian trend of intimidation and harassment of civil society and political activists.\\" The law exempts the government-allied Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church from the measures that it applies to all other religious groups. The autonomous Russian Orthodox Church opposed the law; Archbishop Andrew Maklakov, administrator of the Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church of America, stated: \\"As the Russian Federation has drifted back to its Soviet roots more and more over the past 25 years, it has increasingly sought to harass, persecute, and destroy any religious organization that it might consider competition to its own 'state church.'\\" =Criticisms of expanded surveillance provisions= The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that aims to defend civil liberties in the digital world, opposed the Yarovaya package, noting that \\"opposition to the Yarovaya package has come from many quarters. Technical experts have been united in opposing the law. Russia‚Äôs government Internet ombudsman opposed the bill. Putin's own human rights head, Mikhail Fedotov, called upon the Senators of Russia‚Äôs Federal Council to reject the bill. ISPs have pointed out that compliance would cost them trillions of rubles.\\" The EFF wrote that because Russia's ISPs, messaging services, and social media platforms \\"cannot reasonably comply with all the demands of the Yarovaya package, they become de facto criminals whatever their actions. And that, in turn, gives the Russian state the leverage to extract from them any other concession it desires. The impossibility of full compliance is not a bug‚Äîit's an essential feature.\\" Human Rights Watch noted the lack of judicial oversight and stated that \\"these provisions would ultimately jeopardize security, while being ineffective at preventing terrorists from using encryption\\" as well as \\"unjustifiably expand surveillance while undermining human rights and cybersecurity.\\"  See also  * Mass surveillance in Russia * SORM  References   External links    2016 in law 2016 in Russia Russian law Censorship in Russia Internet law Internet access Internet censorship in Russia Political scandals in Russia 2016 scandals ","title":"Yarovaya law"},{"id":"51294493","text":"Quebo Airport is an airstrip serving the adjacent towns of Quebo and Aldeia in the Tombali Region of Guinea-Bissau.

Language Assessment  From the 1970s to the 1990s, all undergraduate students at the University of Ottawa were required to pass a second language proficiency test in order to meet their graduation requirements.Livret du professeur. Ottawa, Canada. 1978. These language tests had been developed and administered by the Centre for Second Language Learning to more than 3,000 students a year. Up until 1993, those who did not succeed in passing the test were required to take a second language course, also run by the Centre.La Rotonde. Ottawa, Canada. September 7, 1993. Although second language proficiency is no longer a graduation requirement at the University of Ottawa, the Official Languages and Bilingualism Institute still administers English and French language tests and evaluations to thousands of students and external organizations each year.

Then, when her tour of duty finished and she returned to Earth, time dilation would mean that she was barely two years older; meanwhile, twenty years would have passed for him, during which he could become a wealthy lawyer, so that he could take her as a trophy wife.

His books have become part of Hungary's national school curriculum in literature. 300pxOver the past forty years, Nogradi has become Hungary's best-selling modern children's author. His work is noted for its \\"realistic storytelling\\", humor and surprising twists. His novels are frequently themed around the fears and struggles children have to face in their formative years at difficult times, such as divorce, falling in love, fear of failure and conflicts at school or in the family. His books are published by MORA, the biggest publisher in Hungary for children literature. He is also an accomplished scriptwriter, playwright, television writer and publicist. He wrote six scripts for motion pictures, each of which made it to the big screen, including the comedy-drama We Never Die (Hungarian title: \\"Sose Halunk Meg\\"), which was selected as the Hungarian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 66th Academy Awards (but was not nominated).  Early life  Born in 1947 to Jewish parents in poverty-stricken Hungary and growing up in the darkest age of communism in Eastern Europe, Nogradi looks back on his childhood as harrowing and unhappy, given his family's difficult economic status and the inexorable antisemitism of the communist regime. He had a very close, loving relationship with his mother, Katalin Hoffman, a survivor of Auschwitz. She was a literate and thoughtful woman who loved poetry and classical music. Gabor's mother died from cancer when he was seven. She had taught him how to read. He became a fervent reader and devoured every book he could find in the local library. He read at night, hiding under the bed cover with a flashlight, because his father, a woodworker, viewed reading books as \\"utterly useless\\" and \\"a waste of time\\". Although he did very well in school, he was refused admission into the Gymnasium (academic high school), and therefore was denied the chance to go to university. He was forced to go to technical school for high school, where he learned how to operate machinery, but he never worked as a technician. He aspired to become a poet - an idea that both his family and his environment regarded as utterly insane. His life mirrors his philosophy on survival: \\"The deeper one finds himself at the bottom of the pool, the bigger push he can give to himself, as long as he is determined enough to get to the surface.\\" Nogradi credits his early childhood experiences with much of his success in writing, as he says it helped him to \\"develop an extreme layer of toughness to handle rejections.\\"  Career  His first book of poems titled K√©th√°t√∫ √©let√ºnkben (\\"In Our Double- Back Life\\") was published in 1973. His first job was selling books of classics door-to-door. He later became a journalist for a Hungarian cultural weekly, √öj T√ºk√∂r (\\"New Mirror\\") and worked there as a reporter and publicist for fifteen years. He also worked as editor of the national daily Kur√≠r. He wrote over seven radio plays for the Hungarian Radio and wrote series for the Hungarian TV. He was thirty-five when he decided to start writing novels for children.  Trademark  He transposed his tumultuous childhood experiences into the characters of his novels - hence the birth of the recurring hero in most of his books: the rebellious, warring child who fights against injustice, fights for his rights and for the preservation of his or her individuality. Whether it is the cheeky little girl Emma, who drives her father nuts with her world- changing ideas and her constant desire for free spirit, or twelve-year-old Emily, who one morning wakes up realizing she had switched bodies with her mom - they all have one thing in common: an undeterred fighting spirit to understand the world around them and to make the world understand them. His goal is to help his readers \\"to identify their own dreams and conflicts in the adventures of the heroes and heroines in my novels, who must face realities and choices, not always easy or happy ones.\\"  Books  Hetcheky and The Little Kidnappers Gabor Nogradi wrote his first book for children (original title: Hetcheky and the Little Kidnappers) about a young boy who stages his own kidnapping with his circle of friends in an attempt to reunite his divorced parents. A jolly detective figures out the truth and finds the boy hiding in an attic, but instead of exposing the kids, he decides to come to the aid of the desperate children. A provocative and enticing plot, a police investigation, mischievous twins, humor, love, friendship, loyalty, courage, a tumultuous family, oddball neighbors, an evil mother-in-law, and a Hollywood- style happy ending - all parts of an exciting and whimsical novel. The book was made into the children movie Kidnapping on Palank Street (Gyerekrabl√°s a Pal√°nk utc√°ban) in 1986. Nogradi wrote the script to the movie. = Granny Halle and the Cheeky Burglars = The sequel titled (original title's translation: Hetcheky and the cheeky burglars), is a humorous novel about a bunch of vivacious kids who steal from crooked entrepreneurs, 'Robin Hood style', under the direction of the brassy granny in order to help their parents overcome some financial difficulties. The hearty detective, known from the first novel, appears again, investigates and naturally, comes to the aid of the little rascals once again. Help, It's a Human! His next book, \\"Help, It's a Human! (\\"Seg√≠ts√©g, Ember!\\") was inspired by his younger son, Benjamin, an animal enthusiast who kept all kinds of pets in his room from hamsters to parrots and a dozen aquariums full of tropical fish. The book explains how to look after pets and exotic animals, written in a humorous and sarcastic style from the point of view of the animals, revealing how silly humans can be with their pets when they have no clue how to care about them. The book was a critical success, became a bestseller and never went out of print since it appeared. It was also made into a musical and its chapters have become a common choice for school children attending recital and speaking competitions. The story of Pie In this amusing and thought-provoking book, father and son wake up one morning and find that they had swapped bodies. For a few days, therefore, they have to live each other's lives: the father goes to school, the boy must go to work at a television studio. Trading places gives them the opportunity to learn more about each other, understand themselves and their relationship better. The novel was awarded the Children's Book of the Year Prize in 2002 and was on the IBBY Honor list and was voted as one of the best- loved 100 novels in the Hungarian 'Big Book contest. (Big Book was the Hungarian version of the BBC‚Äôs Big Read in Britain in 2003. Over 1400 libraries, 500 bookshops and 1300 schools participated in the competition. It proved to be far more popular in Hungary (with a population of 10 million) than in the UK (with a population of 60 million), with 400,000 votes sent in, almost three times the participation in the UK competition (140,000 votes). Being My Mom This time it is daughter and mom who switch bodies, following the successful intervention of the somewhat wacky and eccentric scientist grandpa, whose constant desire to improve the world resembles the enthusiasm of Christopher Lloyd's character (Dr. Emmett Brown - 'Doc') from the movie \\"Back to the Future.\\" The confusion that ensues creates a funny and exciting novel. About the book, Nogradi said, \\"The idea of mom and daughter swapping bodies was an idea raised by children at one of the book signings. At first I was hesitant to write the book, because writing a story about the inner feelings and thoughts of a small girl and her mother seemed a bit scary, but it became one of the most cherished books I ever wrote.\\" The book was made into a comedy and was premiered in theaters in Hungary. How to Teach...? Want to know how to discipline your school buddy, your math teacher, your cat, and the housefly? How to educate your family members‚Äîyour little brother, your uncle, your grandma? How to turn your Dachshund into a pit bull and yourself into a top- of-the-class student? No problem! Just read the 50+ humorous guidance and playful instructions in this book that will tell you exactly what to do and how to do it. As the author suggests, \\"When I was a kid, everybody believed that disciplining a child will create miracles. And sometimes it does. This book is about the fact that everything and everyone can be disciplined. (Except, of course, ourselves, because our personality is as sturdy as the icebergs at the North Pole. When I wrote the first instructions on how to discipline our family members, I suddenly realized: I can discipline anyone from a UFO to the police and the ghost in the attic. And I did, with no mercy!\\" Beyond The Seven Seas Miracles happen when you really believe in them. And if you do all you can to make them happen. Benedict knows that his mom could not have disappeared forever when she went to swim in the sea. He believes that she is still alive and one day she will return. The weeks and months can pass, there can be a bunch of doubters around him and even grandma can make arrangements to bring a new mommy to Dad, but Benedict knows that Mom is alive! Maybe the UFOs took her. Maybe Mickey the monkey from the fairy tale picked her up will bring her back in his boat. Maybe smugglers picked her up in that sudden sea storm on that fateful day, took her far away, beyond the seven seas, but one day, someone picks up the phone and calls a number at home‚Ä¶ This is the most personal novel by the author and his favorite one, by his own admission. Anna Moll Inspired by one of his favorite childhood poets, Edgar Lee Masters, and his \\"Spoon River Anthology,\\" he wrote a series of poems titled \\"We Lived Here among You,\\" under the pseudonym Anna Moll. These are witty epitaphs from a fictional pet cemetery of an American town in the Midwest, Billingstone, in which the animals tell their stories from beyond the grave.  Book tours  Gabor Nogradi has become famous for personally reaching out to his readers in the form of lectures and author/reader meetings in primary schools and local libraries across Hungary, Austria, Slovakia and Slovenia. He is willing to travel to \\"any village with a zip code,\\" when he is invited to a school or library to deliver his message. His talks include overcoming obstacles in life, exploring talents, and the importance of reading literature for pleasure in the growth of a child. Over the past decade, he has conducted 800+ lectures and personally met over 40,000 of his loyal readers, an accomplishment that has never been done by any other children's book writer before. Gabor Nogradi is giving lecture to schoolchildrenLecturing children about the importance of reading  Personal life  Nogradi now lives near Budapest, the capital of Hungary, with Krisztina, in a house overlooking the curve of the Danube. He has two sons by his ex-wife, Judit Varhalmi. Both followed his path with their literary endeavors, although his older son, Gregory, became an opera singer, while his younger son Ben has pursued a career in public speaking.  Reception and awards  Nogradi won the Janikovszky-Eva award in 2003, but he has never received any national awards. As he says, \\"They look at me as an outsider, because the people who give the awards in our country do not fully understand what I have been trying to accomplish with my work and my projects. Fortunately, my readers, the children (and their parents) do, so as long as they love and read my books, I am happy. As a famous Hungarian poet, Sandor We√∂res, once said, a writer, if he is any good, must live a sort of life that the powers that be do not even consider him for an award.... I agree.\\"  Beliefs and philosophy  Quotes by Gabor Nogradi On the role of the children book writer \\"Every adult who works with children has an enormous responsibility. Just as one must put extra care into nurturing a growing tree or a puppy compared to dealing with an old tree or a fully-grown dog. An author writing for youth can help his readers open the door to a new world, the mystery of social encounters, the secret of human relations. He can reassure the strengths of the child's personality, he can decrease his anxiety and fears, he has the ability to deepen his knowledge, he can help him better understand the world. He can direct him to good or bad directions. The right book can be the best therapy, friend and teacher for the distressed child.\\" On exploring talent \\"Everybody is born to be a genius. If a child's talent cannot blossom the way it should, that is not the child's fault, but the school system and the environment he lives in. The responsibility of the parent is tiny, because most parents have never been trained to be teachers. When something is wrong with our car, our watch or our house, we call a professional to fix it. No one wants to repair these himself. In modern society, it is not enough to love the children. No seed will become a flower just because it gets love. It also needs professional care and nursing to bloom. So if we do not nurse and protect the child's talent, he will become a gloomy adult and the whole world will be poorer. The true values of a nation are in the souls and minds of its people, not in the vaults of the National Bank.\\" On the importance of reading literature for pleasure \\"Books have vital roles in man's life just like any other art forms: they cure the soul, they educate us with the knowledge and the message within the lines, they improve self-knowledge, they enhance the imagination, sharpen the creativity. It is like medicine for the soul. It helps us to relief pain, to get rid of fears, lessen our depression. The significance of the right literature for the right person is downright more effective than any other form of guidance, including religion or parenting. It is therefore paramount that the child reads for his own pleasure from an early age. And the way to do this is to show him the type of books that he would likely enjoy, which is not necessarily the book the school or society considers as valuable. To do that, of course, his family members and those who are entrusted with the child's care must consider his personality and interest. My younger son, Ben, was infatuated with wildlife and the animal world. So what did I do? I lavished him with books by Gerald Durrell and David Attenborough and Jane Goodall, and any book I could find on the animal kingdom, no expense spared. And before he knew it, he finished two books a week and soon began reading books, by own choice, like 'The Jungle Book' and 'Treasure Island' and the works of Mark Twain.\\"Recorded speech, 08.09.2010 On the pursuit of happiness \\"For each of us a different path leads to happiness. Nobody can be forced to a particular direction with the idea that he finds pleasure there, if he does not. The child must be allowed to find his own way, just like the root grows in the ground, avoiding stones, seeking nutrients. Even if we find his interests a bit odd, we must support him in whatever he finds pleasure. We cannot make someone happy just out of sheer desire, but we can help him in his quest for it, and hope for the best.\\" On his legacy \\"I believe that future readers of my books will find more and more of the 'subliminal messages' between the lines. Today's fads, trends, shortsightedness, ignorance can disguise a deeper understanding of what I try to get through to minds. This is natural. For generations to come it is common sense what is hard to fathom today for many. In my life I have reached a significant number of people compared to the masses I will teach after I am gone for decades to come.\\" Biography To date he has written 28 novels, four poem-anthologies, nine movie scripts, eight radio-plays and three musicals.

Produced by Buzz Potamkin and directed by Mordicai Gerstein and Al Kouzel, the program made its debut on NBC on April 14, 1981.Shaw, Jane. \\"Christmas tree is focus of Berenstain Bears' newest adventure.\\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 1980-12-02, p. 32. Development Stan and Jan Berenstain's first animated holiday special aired on NBC in December 1979. The Berenstain Bears' Christmas Tree was the first of five annual animated specials that would air on NBC, produced by Joe Cates and the Joseph Cates Production Company. The Berenstain Bears Meet Bigpaw was the second in this series. The Berenstains utilized rhyming couplets in the script - for both the narrator and the character dialogue. This element had also been used in the Christmas Tree special and was familiar to audiences since a similar type of writing was used in the Berenstain Bears Beginner Books series. Production and casting The 25-minute special was created and written by Stan and Jan Berenstain and featured original music composed and conducted by Emmy-winning musician Elliot Lawrence, with lyrics provided by Stan Berenstain. The score included three original songs. The Berenstain Bears' Easter Surprise starred Ron McLarty, Jonathan Lewis, and Pat Lysinger as Papa, Brother, and Mama Bear, respectively. McLarty also voiced the show's narrator. Three of the four actors reprised their vocal roles from The Berenstain Bears' Christmas Tree. This is the first (and only) of the five specials that Sister Bear's voice actress Gabriela Glatzer does not voice Sister Bear. (However, this special featured the debut of Sister Bear in a silent cameo as a baby towards the conclusion of the film.) It was the third of five Berenstain Bears animated specials that aired on NBC from 1979 to 1983. Plot The story takes place before Sister Bear was born and Brother Bear was the only cub on the block. During fall, when he isn't playing with his friends down by the bog, he enjoys asking Papa different questions about life. Papa Bear, although he has no idea how to answer most of his son's questions, plays along anyway. During the long cold winter, no one has any explanation for why it doesn't seem (to want) to end. Both Mama and Papa Bear are especially anxious for Spring, as they had a special Easter Surprise planned, which neither of them want to disclose (although Brother Bear does notice that he can't sit on Mama's lap anymore, and it's not because he's getting bigger or taller). When Brother Bear asks \\"What's Easter, Papa?\\" Papa Bear tells him all about candy and the Easter Bunny, but Mama Bear sings about new life and miracles. The family decides to pay Boss Bunny a visit. Boss Bunny is bear Country's official Easter bunny and the one responsible for the beginning of Spring. However, to their shock, they find out that he has quit. Papa Bear, while initially just as depressed as Brother is about the loss of Easter, decides to be \\"the Easter Bunny\\" (\\"I'll Be the Easter Bunny/If You Want Something Done, Then Do it Yourself\\") and create his own candy and egg factory, but it ultimately ends in disaster. Brother Bear eventually decides to take matters into his own hands and begins a search to find Boss Bunny on his own. He encounters his friend Bill Bunny, who turns out to be Boss Bunny's son. Bill takes him to a factory no bear has ever been before. The two then enter the (abandoned, and in a dilapidated state) Easter Factory and find Boss Bunny who is asleep, and later complains that the workload, and being in charge of the seasons has become too much for him to handle in his old age and he is simply too burnt out to continue. Despite Brother's pleading, Boss Bunny refuses to reconsider until he sees a large rainbow and glistening sun that relieves his ailments, jumpstarts his energy, and he gladly puts his factory back in business. On Easter morning, Brother finds his Easter candy, but Mama Bear has an additional Easter surprise for him: (\\"Brother, Meet your new baby Sister.\\") When Brother asks where she came from, Papa Bear is left speechless, but Mama reminds Brother about the miracle of new life (and Brother quickly notices that he can sit on Mama's lap again). Book adaptation Home media releases In 1984, Embassy Home Entertainment released the special on LaserDisc as a double- feature with The Berenstain Bears' Christmas Tree, called \\"A Berenstain Bears Celebration.\\" In 1987, the special was made available on VHS by Embassy Home Entertainment as part of their Children's Treasures series. In 1989, the special was distributed on VHS by Kids Klassics. The special was re-released in 1992 by GoodTimes Home Video, in a double-feature with The Berenstain Bears' Christmas Tree.

Abloh is also the chief executive officer of the Milan-based label Off-White, a fashion house he founded in 2013. A trained architect, Abloh, who also worked in Chicago street fashion, entered the world of international fashion with an internship at Fendi in 2009 alongside rapper Kanye West. The two then began an artistic collaboration that would launch Abloh's career into founding Off-White. The first American of African descent to be artistic director at a French luxury fashion house, he was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2018. Early life and education Virgil Abloh was born on September 30, 1980, in Rockford, Illinois, to Ghanaian immigrant parents. His mother was a seamstress and his father managed a paint company. Abloh was raised in Rockford, where he attended Boylan Catholic High School, graduating in 1998. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 2002 with a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering. He received his Master of Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in 2006. When Abloh was attending IIT there was a building on campus under construction designed by the architect Rem Koolhaas which helped spark his interests for fashion. While studying architecture, he designed t-shirts and wrote on fashion and design for a well known blog, The Brilliance. Abloh first met popular musician Kanye West while working on his designs at a Chicago print shop. Career = 2009‚Äì2013: Rise to prominence = After graduating from university, Abloh interned at Fendi in the same class as rapper Kanye West in 2009. Placed in the company's Rome, Italy office, the two began a collaborative relationship. During his collaborative work with the rapper and designer, he caught the eye of the Louis Vuitton CEO, Michael Burke, through his work at Fendi. Later that year, Abloh and West's companion, Don C, launched a retail store, called the RSVP Gallery, located in Chicago. Their founded retail space became known for carrying a mixture of fashion apparel, and for its reflection of Virgil's style on his design for the store interior. A year later, West appointed Abloh the creative director of his creative agency, DONDA. In 2011, West asked him to serve as the artistic director for the 2011 Jay-Z/West album Watch the Throne. In 2012, Abloh launched his first company, Pyrex Vision. Abloh purchased deadstock clothing from Ralph Lauren for $40, screen-printed designs on them and sold them for prices upward of $550. The stated goal of Pyrex Vision was to represent the importance of youth culture, by centering the designs around a garment that most youth would notice from gym class. Virgil's ideas could be clearly geared around the importance of the now. He closed the company down a year later as he did not intend it to be a commercial enterprise but an artistic experiment. = 2013‚Äì2017: Off-White and mainstream success = Abloh founded his first fashion house and second business overall in 2013 with the high-end streetwear brand Off-White, designing a logo inspired by Ben Kelly. Based in Milan, Italy, the company was described by Abloh as \\"the gray area between black and white as the color off-white\\" to investors and fashion critics. During the launch of his brand, he received help from the New Guards Group, who also assisted many other designers and brands, such as Palm Angels, Heron Preston, and Marcelo Burlon. Abloh's brand lead towards a widespread gain of attention for his apparel beginning in Paris, then expanding to China, Tokyo, Japan and the United States. The clothing line can be identified through its use of quotation marks, zip-ties, capital letters and barricade tape. He launched the company's women's wear line in 2014 and showed the collections at the Paris Fashion Week. His line was selected as a finalist for the LVMH Prize, an industry award, but lost to Marques'Almeida and Jacquemus. Abloh launched his first concept store for Off- White in Tokyo, Japan, where he started the company's furniture arm, Grey Area. In 2017, he was asked to design a new collection in conjunction with Nike entitled \\"The Ten\\" where he re-designed a variety of the company's best- selling shoes. Through Abloh's re-designing he exercised his self-made rule of only editing the shoes 3% of the way because he was intrigued by still maintaining the original design of the shoe.  2013‚Äì2018: Off-White and collaborations  Virgil also partnered up with the Swedish furniture company IKEA to design furniture for apartments and houses also easy to carry tote bags imprinted sculptures in the middle. The collection was named Markerad, which is a Swedish word meaning \\"clear-cut; crisp; pronounced\\", and was released in 2019. Virgil envisions the collection to include practical furniture that features contemporary designs. Abloh has worked towards fulfilling his vision for the collection by sketching out drafts of generic pieces of furniture, while adding his own aesthetics to the designs by using a doorstop to level out furniture items. Abloh worked on designs for chairs, coffee tables, beds, storage cabinets, mirrors and carpets apart of his collaboration with IKEA. Abloh uses quotation marks to convey detachment from society and social norms. During the rise in neo-nationalism in 2017 Abloh worked with conceptual artist Jenny Holzer to create a line emphasizing the positive aspects of immigration, cultural integration, and globalization. In December 2017, he worked with Holzer again to design T-shirts for Planned Parenthood in response to the Women's March on Washington. = 2018‚Äìpresent: Louis Vuitton = Abloh incorporated the LV logo in his debut menswear collection for the brand. On March 25, 2018, Abloh was named artistic director of Louis Vuitton's menswear ready wear line, marking him the first person of African descent to lead the brand's menswear line, as well as one of the few black designers at the helm of a major French fashion house. Upon his acceptance of the position, he stated, \\"It is an honor for me to accept this position. I find the heritage and creative integrity of the house are key inspirations and will look to reference them both while drawing parallels to modern times\\". Abloh showed his first collection for Louis Vuitton at the 2018 Men's Fashion Week at the Palais-Royal gardens in Paris.Virgil Abloh Debuts First-Ever Louis Vuitton Men's Collection At Fashion Week in Paris Omari White, newsweek.com 6/21/18V is for Virgil: Abloh makes debut for Louis Vuitton in Paris Scarlett Conlon, theguardian.com 21 June 2018Virgil Abloh Writes New Chapter at Louis Vuitton Joelle Diderich, Women's Wear Daily, June 20, 2018.

Abloh has since been in high demand for his designs, creating an original outfit designed for Serena Williams to wear throughout the 2018 US Open, a collaboration with Nike. On June 5, 2018, Virgil Abloh released a special collaboration with the luggage manufacturer Rimowa, a transparent suitcase in limited edition. In March 2019, Abloh collaborated with Ikea to start making furniture for millennials, ranging from cabinets, rugs, coffee tables, and chairs. Abloh has incorporated different elements of style, such as his quotation marks around certain words and putting it on different articles of clothing, and in this case different types of furniture. For example, Abloh created a ‚ÄúDoor Stop Interruption‚Äù on a chair by adding a doorstop on one of the chair legs to make it elevated. One of Abloh's most popular items is the Frakta Bag. It is beige with the text \\"SCULPTURE\\" imprinted on the side. Virgil teamed up with SSENSE to release a workout collection on March 29, 2019 . This collection contains a variety of workout clothes ranging from; matching leggings and sports bras, athletic sweaters and crop tops. This collection incorporates some of Virgil's signature designs by including the Off-White yellow sign wrapping around the waist of the pants and bottom of the sports bras. Virgil also includes a three-dimensional addition of his four-way arrows, creating a cross, on the front of the tops and pants. Abloh was featured in conversation with his friend and frequent collaborator Takashi Murakami on the cover of the fall 2018 issue of Cultured magazine. In 2019, Abloh was appointed to the board of directors of The Council of Fashion Designers of America. The council seeks to promote the American fashion industry. Abloh created a custom Off-White gown and veil for Hailey Bieber's wedding day. On the veil, he included his famous quotation marks design around the words \\"till death do us part\\" = Art = Virgil Abloh has been working with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, whom he met in 2010 while designing the cover for West's Graduation album. Abloh was given a solo art show in Murakami's Kaikai Kiki art gallery in Tokyo, Japan. On numerous occasions their artwork has been showcased together such as the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago and Mukarkami's shop Oz Zingaro in Tokyo. In 2018, Abloh and Murakami also collaborated on a series of exhibitions at Gagosian Gallery's outposts in London,Murakami & Abloh: future history, February 21 ‚Äì April 7, 2018 Gagosian Gallery. Paris and Beverly Hills. Abloh's first solo museum art exhibition occurred at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago in 2019. After Chicago, Virgil Abloh: Figures of Speech travels to the High Museum of Art, the Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston, and the Brooklyn Museum. The exhibition offers a mid-career retrospective of Abloh's endeavors in art, design and music. = Music = Abloh's interest in music led him to DJing beginning in his teens. He DJ'd at house parties throughout high school and college. His influences included DJ's A-Trak, Benji B and Gilles Peterson. Over the years, Abloh gained recognition as a DJ and started playing shows internationally. He has played at Hi Ibiza and also been booked for Tomorrowland's 2019 edition. Abloh released his first single \\"Orvnge\\" with German DJ/producer Boys Noize in January 2018. In June 2019, Abloh was named to a DJ residency at Wynn Las Vegas's XS Nightclub, with Wynn also agreeing to open an Off-White store. In May 2019 Pioneer, maker of DJ consoles, announced its collaboration with Abloh in design of its transparent CDJ-2000NXS2 and DJM-900NXS2 models. The consoles were displayed at Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art in the Figures of Speech Exhibition In June 2020, Abloh designed the original cover for Pop Smoke album, Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon. The original cover came under heavy criticism from fans. On July 2, a new cover was revealed along with the album's release. The new cover was designed by Ryder Ripps. Controversy Abloh has noted that one of his principles is that a new design can be created by changing an original by only three per cent. Abloh has described his approach as being \\"ironic detachment\\" and that Duchamp's precedence \\"gives him the grounds to copy and paste, to take and to re-apply.\\" This philosophy has caused Abloh to be accused of plagiarism and appropriation. The originality of Off-White's logo design with its alternating parallel diagonal lines has been contested by a number of parties, including Ben Kelly, who popularized this graphic in the early 1980s. Fashion blog Diet Prada has compared several of Abloh's designs, from chairs to apparel, with existing designs. Abloh's FW 2019 collection was based on his \\"ultimate muse\\" Michael Jackson. The launch occurred one week prior to the release of Leaving Neverland at the Sundance Film Festival. In response, Louis Vuitton announced they would not produce any items that directly featured Michael Jackson elements. Abloh also received criticism in early 2019 when images of his Off-White team suggested a lack of cultural diversity at his head office. In 2019, LVMH recorded a 20% growth in sales that were in part attributed to Abloh's appointment. However, in December 2019 Abloh predicted that streetwear would die in 2020 as people moved to vintage clothing. On the March 2020 launch of his collaboration with streetwear designer Nigo, Abloh retracted his earlier comments clarifying that he was only riffing, describing himself as a novice. During the George Floyd protests in mid-2020, Abloh attracted criticism after posting on social media a screenshot showing that he had made a $50 donation to Miami-based art collective (F)empower to go towards protesters' legal costs, adding that he was \\"crazy inspired\\". He later said on Instagram that \\"I can understand your frustration if you think my contributions were limited to $50... [that is] purely false when it comes to the total. I have donated $20,500 to bail funds and other causes related to this movement\\", and continued, \\"I will continue to donate more and will continue to use my voice to urge my peers to do the same\\". Abloh also subsequently commented that the looting of businesses during the George Floyd protests was an example of why streetwear is dead.  Personal life  Abloh met his wife, Shannon Sundberg, in high school. They married in 2009.https://www.insideweddings.com/weddings/purple-hued-timeless- wedding-in-chicago-illinois/299/ He lives in Chicago with his wife and two children.

Gerber is often credited and praised for creating shows that deal with blended families, breaking gender stereotypes, difficulty fitting into society and representation of Latin culture.  Early life  Gerber was raised in outer suburban New York. His mother and father divorced when he was eight years old. His father remarried and had another son while his mother had a boyfriend who had a daughter of his own. Having a family that was not ‚Äútogether‚Äù made Gerber feel like uneasy, but after he discovered that these kinds of families were more common than he thought, he was inspired to create Sofia the First.  Education and early career  Gerber graduated from University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts. His career skyrocketed after he entered a screenwriting showcase at his school, which led to a major Hollywood studio displaying his first screenplay. Gerber has also won awards for directing his comedic short ‚ÄúFilm Time‚Äù and won Best Narrative Short at the Sonoma Valley Film Festival and Best Digital Short at the Sedona Film Festival in 2003. Before branching off into children's television, Craig Gerber previously worked at Pixie Hollow Games and wrote screenplays for Rogue Pictures, Radar Pictures, and Intrepid Films.  Creation of Sofia the First  Gerber was approached by Nancy Kanter, a writer at Disney Junior who asked him for an idea for a children's show revolving around a princess during her childhood. He was determined to give a modern spin of the classic ‚Äúfairy tale‚Äù element of the pitch. Thus, in November 2012, Sofia the First was created. When Gerber was stuck in traffic while driving in Los Angeles, he immediately looked at his childhood and found inspiration with his own home life to create a show with a family that many children could identify with. Growing up in a Stepfamily, he wanted to emulate how it is normal this type of situation is for people. In the program, he provides the young princess with a stepsister, stepbrother, and stepdad; something that is a new territory for her. Gerber's then three-year-old son, Miles, was also an influence for him, constantly making believe, sometimes even as a princess, which led him to provide a character that he could relate to. The character that Gerber created, Princess Sofia, was designed to be a role model for both boys and girls. Gerber stated in an article ‚ÄúIn a world where many young girls want to dress up as princesses, Sofia could serve as a positive role model, displaying traits and learning lessons that young girls (or boys) will retain long after they trade in their gowns for other costumes.‚Äù Kind, courageous, bold, and curious are just a few of the qualities Gerber wanted to give Princess Sofia in order to make a positive character. He explains ‚ÄúTo that end, Sofia is very adventurous, and bold, and courageous, and curious. She has a big heart, and she‚Äôs always ready to try new things, and she‚Äôs always ready to stand up for what she believes in or what she thinks is right. By the way, I think these are good qualities for both girls and boys to follow. And so there‚Äôs a feminist message. There‚Äôs also a message for both boys and girls, saying you can do anything you set your mind to if you keep trying and don‚Äôt give up ‚Äì that life is an adventure.‚Äù Another important element he wanted to provide her with was to make her flawed. Sometimes she could mess up dealing with issues of sibling rivalry, sharing, or trying a new thing. This was a very important message Gerber wanted to provide to his young viewers. Gerber describes Sofia's faults as ‚ÄúSofia‚Äôs biggest flaw is that she is too trusting. It will take her a long time to learn this lesson.‚Äù Along with creating the show, Gerber has also co-authored many of the program's storybooks. These books include Sofia the First: The Curse of Princess Ivy, Sofia the First: The Floating Palace, and Sofia the First: The Enchanted Feast. He has also co- authored a book based on his new program Elena of Avalor called Elena and the Secret of Avalor.  Creation of Elena of Avalor  With a heavy focus on exploring Latin and Hispanic culture, magic, mythology, folklore, music, food, and customs, following his success with Sofia the First, Gerber went on to create Elena of Avalor in June 2016. He was aware that there had been many Disney princesses of color, but not one of Hispanic roots. Gerber was careful not to state what country she is exactly from, but rather incorporate the ‚Äúinfluence‚Äù of the location. He stated ‚ÄúWhat Disney really does well is create fairytale kingdoms,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIt makes it very inclusive‚Äîyou don‚Äôt have to pick just one nationality. No one really asked if Arendelle was Norway or Sweden, it‚Äôs just inspired by a Scandinavian country. The idea for us was that we wanted Avalor to be more broadly accessible.‚Äù When Sofia the First had first launched, there was some confusion as to whether Princess Sofia was the first Latina Disney princess or not. This derived from Sofia's mother, Queen Miranda, appearing to be Hispanic with darker skin and features. This was a false statement made by a producer which has since been disproven by Gerber and a few more members of the Sofia the First crew. Gerber explains in an interview with ABC news: ‚ÄúWhat the experience from Sofia showed me was what a demand there was for a Latina princess,‚Äù Gerber said. ‚ÄúThat a misstatement that was made by a producer could snowball virally into this announcement that was never made. And Sofia was not Latina and never meant to be the first Latina princess. But it did really illustrate the fact that people really wanted a Latina princess, and I think it certainly bubbled in my mind and was part of what inspired me to come up with this idea.‚Äù  Critical reception  Gerber has been noted for his representation of many different relatable situations children and individuals can go through. Marjorie Galas of Variety 411 praises his view on Princess Sofia's home life in Sofia the First, stating ‚ÄúA child of divorce himself, Gerber knew the blended family life and the adaptation to new surroundings and routines was relatable to a vast majority of the population, and the lessons that come from adaptation were bountiful.‚Äù  Personal life  A native of New York City, Gerber currently resides in Los Angeles with his wife and three sons, Miles, Desmond, and Beau.

The area of Ulcinj had been handed over to Montenegro by the Ottomans after the Albanians previously fought against the annexations of Hoti and Grude. The Great powers instead pressured the Ottomans to hand over the area of Ulcinj, but also here the Albanians refused. Eventually the Great powers forced the Ottomans to take actions against the League of Prizren, ending the resistance and successfully handing over the town of Ulcinj to Montenegro.  Background  Montenegro accepted the propositions made at the meeting of the Great powers in Istanbul, in 1880 in order to exchange the regions of Hoti and Grude with Ulcinj. Officially, the Porte did not resist the decision but explained that the Albanians would resist. The Ottomans had intention to delay cession of Ulcinj to Montenegro hoping to eventually avoid it, but Great powers were not ready to accept any delay and threatened to use force against the Ottomans. The Ottomans supported Prizren League as long as their interest corresponded with the interests of the League.: \\"Ako se vratimo pitanju odnosa izmeƒëu Lige i Porte, iz navedenih napisa mo≈æemo zakljuƒçiti da je Porta pomagala Ligu sve dok su se njeni interesi poklapali sa interesima Lige.\\" According to some reports, the Ottomans actually armed Albanian irregulars with 3,000 rifles and 1,000 cases of ammunition in the coordinated actions of Shkoder vali Izet Pasha, commander of Ottoman forces in Tuzi Osman Pasha and Odo Beg Sokoloviƒá who was appointed as commander of the forces of Prizren League. Ulcinj had been the main port of Shkodra in order to get access to the Adriatic sea. The Albanians vehemently protested towards this, calling it injustice. The Great powers did however nothing to take into consideration the demands of the Albanians. The Ottomans, expecting trouble, sent their forces in Ulcinj to clear it from resistance. The Albanians, under the leaders of Isuf Sokoli, Haxhi Mehmet Beci and Mehmet Gjyli responded with an armed uprising. The Ottomans were unable to get to the Albanians as they had surrounded the city. The Great powers threatened with a naval demonstration if the Ottomans did not overrun the Albanians. The Ottomans, frightened by the Great powers, sent Riza Pasha with 3000 soldiers to Shkodra to crush the League of Prizren. Riza Pasha warned that anyone who stood in the way would suffer the consequences. Riza Pasha proceeded to declare a total isolation of the city of Shkodra, banning all merchandise in order to starve the Albanians of Ulcinj. 2000 Albanians, commanded by Muftar Aga Reci positioned themselves in Kraje, at the mountains of Mozhura, in order to make the transportation of Riza Pashas forces as difficult as possible. The Great powers, hearing that Riza Pasha had failed to siege Ulcinj, sent their naval armadas outside the bay of Ulcinj, consisting of English, French, German, Russian, Italian and Austro-Hungarian along the coast of Dalmatia. This, however did not frighten the Albanians.  Pre-war  17 battalions of Ottoman forces, commanded under Riza Pasha, surrounded the city of Shkod√´r in order to capture Ulcinj. The Albanian forces, however, halted that march. The Albanian embassy in Shkod√´r declared the annexation of Ulcinj to be \\"unjustified\\". The Great powers gave Riza Pasha three days to hand over the city to Montenegro. 6000 Ottoman soldiers occupied the city but were unable to pass through. British and Austrian forces came close to the coast of Ulcinj to try and compensate the Ottoman defeats. The Ottomans appointed Dervish Pasha, previous vali of Salonika Vilayet, as new vali of Shkoder Vilayet. Istanbul sent him to capture the city, however, the Montenegrin forces under General Bozo Petrovic, decided to try and occupy Ulcinj. The European naval forces made port outside the Bay of Kotorr but the Albanians were not frightened. Navy officers, such as Kapitan Sale, Lieutenant Caillard, Captain Gambler and Sir Arthur Evans, author of two books, described the situation. Ulcinj had been sieged by Montenegrin forces three years earlier during a twelve-month-long attack. During the offense many Albanians were expelled. The Congress had no intentions of returning Ulcinj to the Albanians, and the Sultan watched did not bother with the requests and demands of the League of Prizren. Dervish Pasha came by boat (Stamboul) to Ulcinj on 1 November 1880 together with 1,300 Ottoman infantry who came by other boat (Medjidie) but failed to disembark due to the resistance of the irregulars garrisoned in Ulcinj. Before his takeover of Ulcinj by land, Dervish Pasha disbanded the local committee of the Prizren League.  Resistance  The Diber assembly began working for the Albanian demand of Ulcinj in the 1880s with 300 delegates. They gathered around five thousand irregulars from the Vilayet of Kosovo and from the Vilayet of Manastir. Together with Ali Pash of Gusinje, Illiaz Pash Dibra and Abdyl Frasheri they proposed for a vilayet within the Ottoman Empire. The Porte, however, refused to accept any other demands and the Sultan demanded the city to be handed over. The vote for the Albanian state to become a Vilayet within the Ottoman Empire received 120 votes. Other proposed that the Porte would decide what was to happen with Albania with support from the Congress of Berlin. The vilayet would be given an autonomy with its own borders. The delegates sent a message to the Sultan to approve of their request. Eventually, the Porte ordered General Riza Pasha to leave Shkodra and instead sent Dervish Pasha with 21 battalions. Dervish Pasha arrived in Shkoder on 4 November 1880. When he arrived with a ship he gave an ultimatum to the irregulars who refused to surrender Ulcinj. Thousands of irregulars continued to arrive at the city to defend it, with around 800 from Ulcinj, and another two thousand from Tuzi. Others came from Tetovo, Shkreli, Dibra, Kelmendi, Prizren and Gjakova. The ultimatum gave no result however. British and Hungarian consultants in Shkod√´r made an agreement with Dervish Pasha to try and persuade the Albanians to surrender the city. The consultants also recommended the Sultan to give the Albanians an autonomy in order to satisfy their demands. The confusion amongst the Albanian leaders weakened them in their try to organize troops in the fight with the Ottoman forces. After 3 days, Dervish Pasha ordered his army to march in the city. On 22 November 1880 Ottoman forces under command of Dervish Pasha crossed river Bojana near village Klezna and near ≈†as lake came to small unit of Albanian irregulars that blocked the road. The Ottomans first fired their guns into air, wounding several irregulars by wandering bullets who fired back and the battle began. During the night Albanian irregulars received reinforcements of 500 men. According to works of Montenegrin king Nikola I Petroviƒá, Albanian irregulars fled as soon as Ottomans entered Ulcinj district, with public statements claiming that they did not surrender Ulcinj without a battle.: \\"–¢–µ–∫ —ò–µ –î–µ—Ä–≤–∏—à –ø–∞—à–∞ –ø—Ä–µ- —à–∞–æ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü—É –æ–∫—Ä—É–≥–∞ —É–ª—Ü–∏—ö—Å–∫–æ–≥, –≤–æ—ò—Å–∫–∞ –∞—Ä–±–∞–Ω–∞—à–∫–µ –ª–∏- –≥–µ —Ä–∞–∑–±—ò–µ–∂–∞–ª–∞ —Å–µ –Ω–∞ —Å–≤–µ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ, –æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏–ª–∞ –∏ –£–ª—Ü–∏—ö –∏ —à–∞–Ω—á–µ–≤–µ –Ω–∞ –ú–æ–∂—É—Ä–∏. –û–Ω–∏ —Å—É –ø–æ –Ω–∞—Ä–µ–¥–±–∏ —Å—ò–µ–¥—ò–µ–ª–∏ –æ–Ω–¥—ò–µ, –ø–æ –Ω–∞—Ä–µ–¥–±–∏ —Å—Å –∏ —Ä–∞–∑–∏—à–ª–∏. –ü—Ä–µ–¥ —Å–≤–∏—ò–µ—Ç–æ–º —Ç—Ä–µ–±–∞–ª–æ —ò–µ –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç–∏ –¥–∞ \\"–ê—Ä–±–∞–Ω–∞—à–∫–∞ –ª–∏–≥–∞\\" –Ω–µ –¥–∞ –±–µ–∑ –±–æ—ò–∞..\\" The Albanians clashed with the Ottomans at the Kodra e Kuqe, near the village of Klesna. The Albanians managed to defeat the first wave of Ottoman forces but when reinforcements arrived the Albanians were temporarily defeated and returned. The commander Isuf Sokoli was wounded and died later that day. In 1880, 23 November, the Ottomans continued to march in the city and surrendered the city to the Montenegrin army. The city had officially been handed over to Montenegro and after a 30-month-long negotiation process, with European powers involved, the battle ended. Although Dervish Pasha tried to inspire population of Ulcinj to emigrate from Ulcinj to Ottoman Empire, nobody emigrated before Montenegrin army arrived because they already had experienced being Montenegrin citizens in period January 1878 ‚Äî February 1879. The population of Ulcinj came out on the streets to welcome Montenegrins taking control of the city advancing 500 meters after retreating Ottoman forces.:\\"–°—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–∏—Ü–∏ –£–ª—Ü–∏—ö–∞ –∏–∑–∞—à–ª–∏ —Å—É –¥–∞ –∏–∑—Ä–∞–∑–µ –¥–æ–±—Ä–æ–¥–æ—à–ª–∏—Ü—É –¶—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–æ—Ä—Ü–∏–º–∞\\" On the following day voivode Bo≈æo Petroviƒá was greeted with acclamation of the whole population of the city. A delegation of notable citizens met with voivode Bo≈æo Petroviƒá who instructed them to organize election for the City Assembly and court, which they did and elected the same people who held these positions in the first year of Montenegrin government over Ulcinj. A Montenegrin military unit of 200 Catholics from Bar was ordered to place Montenegrin flag on the top of Ulcinj fortress.  Casualties  The Ottoman forces suffered certain casualties.: \\"–¢—É—Ä—Å–∫–∞ –≤–ª–∞–¥–∞ —ò–µ —Ç–∞–¥–∞ –ø–æ—Å–ª–∞–ª–∞ –î–µ—Ä–≤–∏—à-–ø–∞—à—É –∫–æ—ò–∏ —ò–µ, –Ω–∞—ò–∑–∞–¥, —É–º–∏—Ä–∏–æ –ê—Ä–Ω–∞—É—Ç–µ –ø–æ—à—Ç–æ —ò–µ –∏ —Å–∞–º –ø—Ä–µ—Ç—Ä–ø–µ–æ –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å–Ω–µ –≥—É–±–∏—Ç–∫–µ —É —Å–≤–æ—ò–æ—ò –≤–æ—ò—Å—Ü–∏\\" The fight resulted in around 7800 casualties, with a majority of elderly, women and children who died and a territorial loss for the Albanians.  Aftermath  The cession of Ulcinj to Montenegro caused additional animosity of Albanian population toward the Ottoman policy. After the border with Montenegro was agreed, all attention of Albanians was focused to the relations with Porte. The Ottomans interned notable Albanian leaders from Shkoder who objected to decisions of the Ottoman Government. In the Spring of 1881 the Ottoman forces under Dervish Pasha undertook a military campaign and crushed the Prizren League without much resistance.: \\"–ü–æ—Å–ª–µ –≤–æ—ò–Ω–æ–≥ –ø–æ—Ö–æ–¥–∞ –î–µ—Ä–≤–∏—à-–ø–∞—à–µ —É –ø—Ä–æ–ª–µ—õ–µ 1881, –õ–∏–≥–∞ —ò–µ –±–µ–∑ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ—Ç–ø–æ—Ä–∞ —É–≥—É—à–µ–Ω–∞.\\" Montenegrin newspapers mocked with lack of serious resistance of the League of Prizren, emphasizing that Ottoman Porte was behind the whole of these events, concluding that: \\"Today's surrender of Ulicnj proves that all that so-called Albanian resistance and that terrible Albanian League with which Turkey operated and deceived the whole world was actually nothing...\\" mocking with the texts in media sympathetic to position of League who wrote about \\"the tragic fall of Albanian lions although the uprising and surrender were actually only one ridiculous comedy.\\" See also *Battles for Plav and Gusinje  References   Sources     Further reading   Ulcinj (1880) Conflicts in 1880 Rebellions in Montenegro Albanian rebellions 1880 in the Ottoman Empire November 1880 events ","title":"Battle of Ulcinj (1880)"},{"id":"51294759","text":"Hans Struzyna (born March 31, 1989) is an American rower.

Report On August 2, 1914 several German special edition newspaper leaflets - claiming to cite military sources - reported that French aircraft had dropped bombs near Nuremberg without a French declaration of war, thus violating international law. According to Max Montgelas bombings of the railway lines W√ºrzburg- Nuremberg and Ansbach-Nuremberg had been reported at the Nuremberg railway headquarters. The report was passed on to the III. Bavarian Army Command who conditionally informed the General Staff. After the message had turned out to be false a clarification note was issued. However, the Nuremberg railway headquarters who had initially reported to the railway department of the General Staff failed to deliver the clarification.Altenh√∂ner: Kommunikation und Kontrolle. 2008, p. 171 Otto Gessler, then mayor of Nuremberg stated that the message was based on incorrect observations of a group of Home Guard men (Landsturm) who had confused the interplay of cloud shadows with enemy aircraft and then reported to their superiors.

The German Ambassador to Belgium used the allegations to claim to the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that France would not respect the Belgian neutrality guaranteed by the Treaty of London, and that it must therefore must agree to Germany's ultimatum to allow troops to enter and temporarily occupy the country to repel a French invasion. Since Germany had already invaded Luxembourg and since Germany's ultimatum in itself was a violation of international law, the Belgian government rejected the claim, and the German invasion of Belgium commenced. Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg refers to the alleged attack on August 4: \\"Gentlemen, we are now in self-defense; and necessity knows no law.\\" \\"Nuremberg\\" was, however, not explicitly mentioned in his Reichstag speech.

Structure The virus has a polyhedral head with a diameter of around 61 nm. The contractile tail is 100 nm long, and is attached to the head via a tail capital. The neck region bears fibres. The mature virus particle contains at least 19 proteins.Sarma 2012, p. 423 Genome The linear, double-stranded DNA genome is 64,960 base pairs in length ‚Äì only half the size of most phages with contractile tails, which typically fall in the range 161‚Äì231 kb. It has a GC-content of 35.4%. Of the 91 open reading frames (ORFs), only 33 show similarity to other known sequences. Remarkably, the genome of Cyanophage N1 encodes a functional CRISPR array, which has been suggested to protect the host against infection by competing viruses. Life cycle and interaction with the host The optimal pH for viral adsorption to N. muscorum is 7.6‚Äì8.1. The rate of adsorption is reduced with increasing age of the host cells. The viral latent period is 7 hours, which is similar to cyanophages of the LPP-1 group. The burst size is 100 plaque-forming units per cell.Sarma 2012, pp. 427, 429 Host photosynthesis is required for the virus to replicate, with photosynthesis being required throughout the life cycle, rather than at any particular point.

Career Rainer Millar Blanchaer and Jeff Crake met at Mississauga based recording school Metalworks Institute in 2013. Whilst attending class the two discovered their mutual appreciation for club music. Finding a common ground, the duo set forth completing the Live Forever EP under the alias We Were Born Electric, which was released on the label Dirty Duck Audio in 2013. WWBE was awarded a MuchFACT grant to direct and produce the video for Live Forever, featuring Saidah Conrad. In 2014, Rainer and Jeff decided to rebrand their project as Rainer + Grimm. The rebrand was launched with various bootleg remixes, released on SoundCloud. The most prominent, a bootleg remix of Sam Smith's Stay With Me was widely received in the blogosphere, hitting #1 on Hype Machine's most popular list twice and was listed as one of 2014's most blogged tracks on Hypem.com. This success lead to Carson Daly playing the remix for Sam Smith during his first radio interview in LA. The next day Capitol Records decided to make the remix official and it was subsequently sent to Dance Radio in the US. It has since been shazaamed over 250k times and streamed over 5 million. The follow up remix to Sam Smith's Stay With Me was their official take on Golden Coast's Break My Fall, which also hit #1 on Hype Machine's most popular chart in 2014. Rainer + Grimm's Break My Fall remix has since been streamed over 3 million times. Since then, Rainer + Grimm have been commissioned to remix various artists including Years & Years, Jessie Ware, Gregory Porter, and Kideko. In 2015, Rainer + Grimm went on the 6 date Feel Something US Tour and saw them sign to Universal Music Canada. Their first release on UMG Canada, Talk To Me, was launched in November 2015 and hit #1 on Hype Machine's most popular chart. Talk To Me was licensed to Casablanca Records for the USA. R+G were awarded a MuchFACT grant to direct and produce the music video for Talk To Me, which - when released - hit heavy rotation on MuchMusic. 2015's traction and raise in profile lead to Spotify naming them a 2015 Spotlight Artist for Canada.

Early and family life Shaffer was born in Page County, Virginia and educated in its public schools. He married Mary Leah Stover (1885‚Äì1973) and they lived in Maurertown, Virginia in the Shenandoah Valley region. They had at least two sons: William Robert Shaffer (1916-pre-2001) and John Vernon Shaffer (1924‚Äì2001). Career A chicken farmer and Republican, Shaffer was president of the Shenandoah Commercial Hatchery, Inc. He also served on the Virginia World War II Memorial Commission. His eldest son William Robert Shaffer of Woodstock, Virginia represented Shenandoah County in the House of Delegates from 1942 until 1947, when fellow Republican (and poultry dealer) William C. Lambert took over for a term. His younger son John Vernon Shaffer continued the family business and civic traditions, but joined the Presbyterian church. Shenandoah County voters elected Vernon S. Shaffer their delegate to the Virginia General Assembly in November 1949, so he assumed that office in January. He was re-elected in 1951, 1953, 1955 and 1957. During his last three terms, the Massive Resistance crisis embroiled Virginia because the Byrd Organization (to which most state Democrats belonged, unofficially) followed the lead of U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd, who refused to allow desegregation of Virginia's schools despite the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 and 1955. Although greatly outnumbered by Democrats (especially Byrd Democrats), Shaffer's and Republican state senator Ted Dalton's voices were among the few moderates during the 1956 legislative session that narrowly rejected an interposition resolution and later in the special legislative session that ultimately adopted the Stanley Plan.Frank B. Atkinson, The Dynamic Dominion (Rowman and Littlefield, 2006) at p. 96 By 1956, Shenandoah County had decided to integrate its schools (which had educated both Shaffer's sons), and the Byrd Organization's Stanley Plan proposed to close all schools that integrated.Mays, David J. (Sweeney, ed.), Race, Reason and Massive Resistance: The Diary of David J. Mays (University of Georgia Press 2008) at p. 70 Shaffer and Democratic (but anti-Byrd) delegates Kathryn H. Stone of Arlington (which had also decided to integrate) and John C. Webb of Fairfax (another then fast-growing suburb of Washington, D.C.) became the only three delegates to oppose all seven anti-NAACP laws also contained in the Stanley Plan.Benjamin Muse, Virginia's Massive Resistance (Indiana University Press 1961) p. 33. Archived at the Internet Archive Death and legacy Shaffer died on May 3, 1958 and was buried at Massanutten cemetery in Woodstock, where his wife joined him in 1973. On January 19, 1959 both the Virginia Supreme Court in Harrison v. Day and a three judge federal panel declared parts of the Stanley Plan unconstitutional, and just over four years later the United States Supreme Court would declare the anti-NAACP laws unconstitutional in NAACP v. Button. Fellow RepublicanWilbur O. Riley replaced Shaffer for the remainder of his term. However, W. Howard Ellifrits, a Republican banker who had served as elected Court Clerk of Shenandoah County (a position similar to many Byrd Democrats), won election as Shenandoah county's delegate in the next general election in 1959.Cynthia Miller Leonard, The General Assembly of Virginia 1618‚Äì1978 (Richmond: Library of Virginia 1978) pp. 721note, 727 References 1916 births 1958 deaths Members of the Virginia House of Delegates Virginia Republicans 20th-century American politicians People from Page County, Virginia People from Shenandoah County, Virginia ","title":"Vernon S.

Schema-agnosticism is the property of a database of mapping a query issued with the user terminology and structure, automatically mapping it to the dataset vocabulary. The increase in the size and in the semantic heterogeneity of database schemas bring new requirements for users querying and searching structured data. At this scale it can become unfeasible for data consumers to be familiar with the representation of the data in order to query it. At the center of this discussion is the semantic gap between users and databases, which becomes more central as the scale and complexity of the data grows.  Description  The evolution of data environments towards the consumption of data from multiple data sources and the growth in the schema size, complexity, dynamicity and decentralisation (SCoDD) of schemasA. Freitas, \\"Schema-agnostic queries over large-schema databases: a distributional semantics approach\\" PhD Thesis, 2015Pat Helland, [\\"If you have too much data, then 'good enough' is good enough\\"], Commun. ACM 54(6): 40‚Äì47, 2011.M. L. Brodie and J. T. Liu, [\\"The power and limits of relational technology in the age of information ecosystems\\"], Keynote, On The Move Federated Conferences, Heraklion, Greece, October 25‚Äì29, 2010. increases the complexity of contemporary data management. The SCoDD trend emerges as a central data management concern in Big Data scenarios, where users and applications have a demand for more complete data, produced by independent data sources, under different semantic assumptions and contexts of use, which is the typical scenario for Semantic Web Data applications. The evolution of databases in the direction of heterogeneous data environments strongly impacts the usability, semiotics and semantic assumptions behind existing data accessibility methods such as structured queries, keyword-based search and visual query systems. With schema-less databases containing potentially millions of dynamically changing attributes, it becomes unfeasible for some users to become aware of the 'schema' or vocabulary in order to query the database. At this scale, the effort in understanding the schema in order to build a structured query can become prohibitive.  Schema-agnostic queries  Schema-agnostic queries can be defined as query approaches over structured databases which allow users satisfying complex information needs without the understanding of the representation (schema) of the database. Similarly, Tran et al.T. Tran, T. Mathaess, P. Haase, [\\"Usability of Keyword-driven Schema-agnostic Search ‚Äì A Comparative Study of Keyword Search, Faceted Search, Query Completion and Result Completion\\"], In Proceedings of 7th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC'10). Heraklion, Greece, June, 2010. defines it as \\"search approaches, which do not require users to know the schema underlying the data\\". Approaches such as keyword-based search over databases allow users to query databases without employing structured queries. However, as discussed by Tran et al.: \\"From these points, users however have to do further navigation and exploration to address complex information needs. Unlike keyword search used on the Web, which focuses on simple needs, the keyword search elaborated here is used to obtain more complex results. Instead of a single set of resources, the goal is to compute complex sets of resources and their relations.\\" The development of approaches to support natural language interfaces (NLI) over databases have aimed towards the goal of schema-agnostic queries. Complementarily, some approaches based on keyword search have targeted keyword-based queries which express more complex information needs. Other approaches have explored the construction of structured queries over databases where schema constraints can be relaxed. All these approaches (natural language, keyword-based search and structured queries) have targeted different degrees of sophistication in addressing the problem of supporting a flexible semantic matching between queries and data, which vary from the completely absence of the semantic concern to more principled semantic models. While the demand for schema-agnosticism has been an implicit requirement across semantic search and natural language query systems over structured data, it is not sufficiently individuated as a concept and as a necessary requirement for contemporary database management systems. Recent works have started to define and model the semantic aspects involved on schema-agnostic queries.A. Freitas, J. C. Pereira Da Silva, E.

Springer 2014. = Schema-agnostic structured queries = Consist of schema-agnostic queries following the syntax of a structured standard (for example SQL, SPARQL). The syntax and semantics of operators are maintained, while different terminologies are used.  Example 1  SELECT ?y { BillClinton hasDaughter ?x . ?x marriedTo ?y . } which maps to the following SPARQL query in the dataset vocabulary: PREFIX : PREFIX dbpedia2: PREFIX dbpedia: PREFIX skos: PREFIX dbo: SELECT ?y { :Bill_Clinton dbpedia:child ?x . ?x dbpedia2:spouse ?y . }  Example 2  SELECT ?x { ?x isA book . ?x by William_Goldman . ?x has_pages ?p . FILTER (?p > 300) } which maps to the following SPARQL query in the dataset vocabulary: PREFIX rdf: PREFIX : PREFIX dbpedia2: PREFIX dbpedia: SELECT ?x { ?x rdf:type dbpedia:Book . ?x dbpedia2:author :William_Goldman . ?x dbpedia:numberOfPages ?p . FILTER(?p > 300) } = Schema-agnostic keyword queries = Consist of schema-agnostic queries using keyword queries. In this case the syntax and semantics of operators are different from the structured query syntax.  Example  \\"Bill Clinton daughter married to\\" \\"Books by William Goldman with more than 300 pages\\"  Semantic complexity  As of 2016 the concept of schema-agnostic queries has been developed primarily in academia. Most of schema-agnostic query systems have been investigated in the context of Natural Language Interfaces over databases or over the Semantic Web.Unger et al., [\\"Introduction to Question Answering over Linked Data\\"], In Proceedings of the 2014 Reasoning Web Summer School, 2014 These works explore the application of semantic parsing techniques over large, heterogeneous and schema-less databases. More recently, the individuation of the concept of schema-agnostic query systems and databases have appeared more explicitly within the literature. Freitas et al.A. Freitas, J. E. Sales, S.

Grain size, shape, and shade vary. Ofada rice is unpolished. As African rice is more difficult to mill and polish, some or all of the rice bran is left on the grain, strengthening the flavour and making it more nutritious. Brown ofada rice is often very highly aromatic, whereas white ofada rice is typically non-aromatic. They are also known for swelling in size when cooked. It is sometimes processed using fermentation, which adds an aromatic quality to the product. Ofada rice is typically priced higher compared to other available rice, and it has been regarded as a sign of status symbolism by some people. In contemporary times, it is sometimes served at classy parties. History Ofada rice has been grown in Ogun State since the 1940s. It is not indigenous to Africa. It is purported to have been smuggled by a soldier into Nigeria when the soldier returned from Asia and planted the rice in Ofada. Etymology Ofada rice is named after the town Ofada, where its cultivation first occurred. Ofada is located in Ogun state. Preparation Ofada rice is traditionally served in an uma leaf (Thaumatococcus daniellii), with a sauce of ‚ÄòAtarodo‚Äô (spicy) and 'Tatase‚Äô (sweet) pepper, onion, locust beans, palm oil, and meat. It is a festive meal rather than an everyday type of food for most Nigerians but is everyday Street food for the towns of Ikenne and Ilisan in Ogun state.

As an actor, he appeared in music hall, Victorian burlesques and Edwardian musical comedy. He was perhaps best known for starring in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane's annual Christmas pantomimes, alongside Dan Leno and Herbert Campbell and as the author of long-running musicals at the Gaiety Theatre. Biography Nicholls was born in London and was educated at The City of London School.\\"Harry Nicholls\\", The Stage, 2 December 1926, p. 22 As a youth he worked as a clerk in a railway office and spent some time as an apprentice auctioneer. He became interested in acting and made his stage debut in 1870, acting in provincial theatre where he achieved little success. His London stage debut followed on 3 October 1874, when he played the part of Honeybun at the Old Surrey Theatre in Joseph Stirling Coyne's farce Did You Ever Send Your Wife to Camberwell? Nicholls remained at the theatre for two years. Early in his career, he also played Don Andres in La Perichole with Selina Dolaro's company. He next moved to the Royal Grecian Theatre in Shoreditch.

Salt poisoning sufficient to produce severe symptoms is rare, and lethal salt poisoning even rarer; the median lethal dose of table salt is roughly 3,000 mg per kg of body weight. In medicine, the circumstance of salt poisoning is most frequently encountered in children or infants who may be made to consume excessive amounts of table salt. At least one instance of murder of a hospitalized child by salt poisoning has been reported.Saunders, Russell (2016), \\"A Mother Accused\\"; CBS News (16 September) Too much salt intake in adults can also occur from the drinking of seawater in survival situations or the drinking of soy sauce. Salt poisoning has also been seen in a number of adults with mental health problems. Symptoms and physiology Salt poisoning typically results in a feeling of confusion and jitteriness; more severe degrees of intoxication can cause seizures and coma. Death can result if medical intervention is not forthcoming. These symptoms are generally a consequence of hypernatremia‚Äîan abnormally high sodium level in the blood. (There are myriad causes of hypernatremia, which is frequently encountered in medical practice; salt poisoning is not a common cause.) Early on, the intoxicant will cause a strong feeling of thirst, followed by weakness, nausea, and loss of appetite. More severe symptoms ensue, including confusion, muscle twitching, and bleeding in or around the brain. Death results by the swelling of the brain against the skull. (Normal serum sodium levels are 135 ‚Äì 145 mEq/liter (135 ‚Äì 145 mmol/L). Severe symptoms typically only occur when levels are above 160 mEq/L.) The human renal system actively regulates sodium chloride in the blood within a very narrow range around 9 g/L (0.9% by weight) . Accidentally consuming small quantities of clean seawater is not harmful, especially if the seawater is taken along with a larger quantity of fresh water. However, drinking seawater to maintain hydration is counterproductive; more water must be excreted to eliminate the salt (via urine) than the amount of water obtained from the seawater itself. In most open waters concentrations vary somewhat around typical values of about 3.5%; drinking seawater temporarily increases blood's NaCl concentration, which signals the kidney to excrete sodium. However, seawater's sodium concentration is above the kidney's maximum concentrating ability. Eventually the blood's sodium concentration rises to toxic levels, removing water from cells and interfering with nerve conduction, ultimately producing a fatal seizure and cardiac arrhythmia. Sea water poisoning Survival manuals consistently advise against drinking seawater. A summary of 163 life raft voyages estimated the risk of death at 39% for those who drank seawater, compared to 3% for those who did not. The effect of seawater intake on rats confirmed the negative effects of drinking seawater when dehydrated. (In contrast to humans, pelagic birds and other sea animals can (and must) drink sea water without ill effects.) =Historical experiences= Some historians have suggested that the mysterious sicknesses afflicting the early English colonists at Jamestown, Virginia (1607‚Äì1610)‚Äîwhich nearly extinguished the settlement‚Äîreflect sea water poisoning. The settlers arrived in the spring, when the James River water was relatively fresh, but by summer a drought of historical magnitude had rendered it much more brackish. The historical geographer Carville Earle, among others, holds to this view.\\"Cohen, Jennie (17 Oct 2011), \\"Did Jamestown's Settlers Drink Themselves to Death?\\"; History.com. The temptation to drink seawater was greatest for sailors who had expended their supply of fresh water, and were unable to capture enough rainwater for drinking. This frustration was described famously by a line from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's epic poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798): ::: \\"Water, water, everywhere, And all the boards did shrink; Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink.\\" Although humans cannot survive on seawater alone‚Äîand, indeed, will sicken quickly if they try‚Äîsome people have claimed that up to two cups a day, mixed with fresh water in a 2:3 ratio, produces no ill effect. During the 18th century, British physician Richard Russell (1687‚Äì1759) advocated the practice as part of medical therapy in his country. In the 20th century, Ren√© Quinton (1866‚Äì1925), in France, would also endorse the practice. Currently, the practice is widely used in Nicaragua and other countries, supposedly taking advantage of the latest medical discoveries. In his 1948 book, Kon-Tiki, Thor Heyerdahl reported drinking seawater mixed with fresh in a 2:3 ratio during the 1947 expedition.Heyerdahl, Thor; Lyon, F.H. (translator) (1950). Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific by Raft. Rand McNally & Company, Chicago, Ill. The French physician Alain Bombard (1924‚Äì2005) survived an ocean crossing (1952‚Äì53) in a small Zodiac rubber boat using mainly raw fish meat, which contains about 40 percent water (like most living tissues), as well as small amounts of seawater and other provisions harvested from the ocean. His findings were challenged, but an alternative explanation was not given. A few years later, an American sailor and adventurer, William Willis (1893‚Äì1968), claimed to have drunk two cups of seawater and one cup of fresh per day for 70 days without ill effect when he lost part of his water supply.

Background In 2008, after Joe Calzaghe had moved up in weight to challenge Bernard Hopkins, his WBC super middleweight title became vacant. This meant that challengers Carl Froch and Jermain Taylor were in line to fight for the vacant title. However, Taylor opted to fight former IBF champion Jeff Lacy instead, which meant Jean Pascal would challenge Froch for the title on 8 December 2008. Both men went into the fight with an unbeaten record, but this would be their toughest test to date. The Fight A hard fought and intense encounter was entertaining from the off, with both men landing heavy blows and showing great toughness and determination. This continued throughout yet it was Froch who was able to take control in the second half of the fight and edge the closely fought rounds, and went on to win by unanimous decision with scores of 116-112, 117-111 and 118-110 to win his first world title. It was later revealed that Froch had suffered a perforated eardrum and cracked rib in his final sparring session ten days before the fight, but refused to pull out. Froch went on to hold multiple titles in the division, while Pascal moved up to light- heavyweight and also became champion. The two men became friends after the fight.

His parents were Alexandru Ralet, a spƒÉtar of Boto»ôani, and Maria, the daughter of baron Teodor Musta»õƒÉ, a wealthy merchant from Bukovina. He reportedly studied in Poland, and his first published work, the short volume of translations PlƒÉcerea s√¢m»õirei, appeared in 1837. In 1841, he became president of the Boto»ôani tribunal, but soon abandoned a career for which he did not have a calling. He was director of the Justice Department under Grigore Alexandru Ghica in 1849, Minister of Religious Affairs and Education in 1854 and secretary of the ad-hoc divan in 1857. A prominent supporter of the Moldavian Revolution of 1848, he joined the unionist committee in 1856. He died in Boto»ôani, of tuberculosis. Ralet was a talented dilettante who wrote an enjoyable prose in which the sharpness of his observations is made more powerful by the moralist's indulgent irony: Suvenire »ôi impresii de cƒÉlƒÉtorie √Æn Rom√¢nia, Bulgaria, Constantinopole (1858).Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic»õionarul biografic al literaturii rom√¢ne, vol.

The work covers a journey he took between July 1855 and March 1856; he and Costache Negri were sent on what turned out to be a successful diplomatic mission to Constantinople.

The siblings both perform lead vocals, lead guitar, drums and other instruments. Their first release was the cassette What We Know, issued in a limited edition of 100 copies (with digital download) in 2015 by Winspear. = 2016‚Äì2018: Do Hollywood = On their first generally released album, Do Hollywood, each brother took the lead on vocals and guitar on the songs he composed; during live performances, this setup was preserved, with the remaining D'Addario playing the drums, and fellow schoolmates Megan Zeankowski and Danny Ayala (who have played with the D'Addarios on and off since their youth) playing bass and keyboards, respectively. Ayala also sang backing vocals. The album, produced by Jonathan Rado of Foxygen, was recorded in the spring of 2015, with the members being only 15 and 17 at the time of its creation. The Lemon Twigs served as opening act for fellow New York City/Long Island-based alt-rockers Sunflower Bean on their East Coast tour in late 2016 and performed on television programs like The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, CBS This Morning \\"Saturday Sessions\\" and Conan along the way. In early 2017 it was announced that the band would play on day one of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California on April 14, 2017. This performance saw the Twigs joined by one of the band's \\"favorite musicians ever, in the whole world\\", Todd Rundgren, to play \\"Couldn't I Just Tell You\\" from Rundgren's classic 1972 double album, Something/Anything?. The Lemon Twigs released the Do Hollywood tracks \\"These Words\\" and \\"As Long As We're Together\\" as a double-A-side single, and made videos for both songs. The third single was the album opener, \\"I Wanna Prove to You\\", with a video directed by Nick Roney. The band played at several major festivals in the summer of 2017, such as Glastonbury, Outside Lands, Lollapalooza, Austin City, and the Montreux, in addition to opening for Phoenix across the United States. These 2017 shows saw the band covering songs such as \\"Fish and Whistle\\" by John Prine, \\"I Walked with a Zombie\\" by Roky Erickson, \\"You Can't Talk to the Dude\\" by Jonathan Richman, \\"I've Begun To Fall In Love\\" by R. Stevie Moore, \\"Love Stepped Out\\" by their father, Ronnie D'Addario, and \\"I Can Feel the Fire\\" by Ronnie Wood; they notably performed the latter song with Thomas Hedlund of Phoenix on drums while supporting Phoenix at the Hollywood Bowl alongside Mac DeMarco.

Her oil and mixed media paintings explore themes such as gender, sexuality, femininity, and power dynamics, in a style that weaves together realism, abstraction, and classical influences.  Biography and education  Fraleigh was born in 1976 in Beaufort, SC, and raised in rural Hyde Park, New York where she attended Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School. She later received her BFA in painting from Boston University, where she graduated magna cum laude, and her MFA in painting from the Yale University School of Art. Fraleigh is an associate professor and the department chairperson of the Moravian College art department. She currently resides and works in New York, NY, and Allentown, PA, where she lives with her husband, artist Wesley Heiss, and their daughter, Tuesday and Sagan.  Work  Fraleigh works primarily in the medium of paint, although she has exhibited artworks in a variety of additional mediums, including drawing and sculpture. The process of creating these painted works varies and often involves a balance between control and chance. One such process used by Fraleigh involves rendering the figures using a traditional approach, then placing the canvas horizontally, introducing the element of chance through pours of mediums over the surface of the painting. Fraleigh has been described as a \\"Artistic painter,\\" creating tactile and flowing surfaces in her paintings. Most of Fraleigh's paintings are figurative, depicting forms that are often obscured by \\"brushy, smeared or poured areas of color\\" or exist in an abstract or flattened space. Fraleigh's decisions regarding what to display and what to leave hidden both facilitates narrative and disrupts it. Heavily influenced by literature and narrative structure, narrative has become the focus of Fraleigh's more recent bodies of work. Through a combination of representational figures and abstract elements, many of Fraleigh's painting have touched upon autobiographical elements, while others have focused on moments of sexual and physical tension, violence and desire, and underlying themes of power, class, gender, and identity. Fraleigh's 2014 body of work, displayed in the show Ghosts in the Sunlight at the Inman Gallery, continues to explore many of the themes established in her earlier work. Further sharpening a feminist lens through the destruction and reinvention of traditionally male-dominated art historical narratives, in her recent paintings, Fraleigh \\"reconsiders the classic female nude by taking figures from Baroque and Rococo paintings and reexamining their surroundings, attire and gaze.\\" By creating a new painted environment and context for the female figures, appropriated from old masterworks, Fraleigh gifts her female protagonists with a new identity and importance that is no longer dependent upon their objectification or submissiveness. These themes are also apparent in Fraleigh's 2015 painting series Lost in the Light, wherein the female figure is not obscured by abstract forms, but is instead hidden by the cropping and positioning of the figures. These unconventional portraits show women turned away or otherwise cut off from view, hiding their identity and thwarting the desire of the viewer to see or know more. In her essay on Fraleigh's work, \\"Erotic Power and the Subversion of Myth,\\" feminist writer and educator Jennifer Tyburczy writes that Fraleigh's work may be seen as a response to the prevalence of the eroticized female nude in art, as highlighted in John Berger's Ways of Seeing. Tyburczy posits that Fraleigh's work \\"takes the limitations of the archive, the museum, and the discipline of art history to task and exposes the structure and logic of these sites as social fields that manage the circulation of ideas and feelings on sexual display and spectatorship.\\" The subversion of the male gaze is a common theme in Fraleigh's paintings, yet sexuality is never entirely absent in these works, and is explored alongside \\"other kinds of desire that can exist between women, like friendship, love, camaraderie, and tenderness.\\" Connections have been drawn between the all-female communities and relationships present in Fraleigh's artwork and the utopia depicted in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 1915 novel \\"Herland.\\" Of this connection, writer and curator Kelly Baum notes that, like the citizens of Gilman's utopia, \\"the citizens of Fraleigh's utopia prioritize exchange and sociability.\\" By freeing her female protagonists of their original contexts, Fraleigh explores not only how women relate and interact with one another and the environments they reside in, individually or in groups, but also the roles women play in an artistic space. Fraleigh is represented by Inman Gallery in Houston, TX.  Other media  Lost in the Light is a book collaboration between Fraleigh and writer Jen Werner on the occasion of Fraleigh's solo exhibition at the Vanderbilt Mansion in Hyde Park, NY.

It is the official sequel to the 1991 film American Kickboxer. Plot Professional kickboxing champion Rick Quinn has announced his retirement from the sport. Willard, the one time reporter he could not stand, has now become good friends with him and Quinn plans to live quietly with his pregnant wife Carol. However, one person unhappy with the retirement is Jacques Denard, who has wanted revenge on Quinn from their previous fight in which Quinn defeated him. Denard wanted to fight Quinn for the championship and now he finds that chance gone as Quinn has retired. When Denard shows up at Quinn's house to confront him, he is forced to leave at gunpoint by Carol. Meanwhile, Quinn has attracted the attention of Dominique Le Braque, a rich businessman and lover of fights. However, as a fight promoter, he stages underground fights in which the loser finds himself shot in the head by the referee after the match is over. When Le Braque attempts to woo Quinn to fight for him, Quinn refuses as he tells him he is done as a professional. To ensure Quinn does join him, Le Braque hires some men to plant a car bomb, killing Carol and their unborn child. The incident has really destroyed Quinn mentally to the point where despite help from Willard, Quinn has turned to alcoholism. He thinks Denard was the one who is responsible for killing Carol and in a drunken rage, confronts him and serves a three-month jail sentence for drunken assault. Le Braque bails Quinn out. Deciding with nothing left to lose, Quinn takes up Le Braque's offer and is forced to stay at his mansion and land, where he begins to train. He also gets attention from Le Braque's wife Angelica, who slowly begins to tire of her husband's business overshadowing their marriage. When Quinn has his first fight and wins, he learns the horrid truth about what happens to the losers and he demands to leave. However, knowing he has been trapped, Quinn has no choice but to continue winning to keep himself alive. Eventually, he begins an affair with Angelica, which much to Le Braque's chagrin, gives the businessman a good idea. Quinn soon finds he has a familiar face as an opponent: Denard. Quinn attempts to snap some sense into Denard about what happens to the loser. Finally realizing it himself, Denard helps Quinn and together, they begin to take on Le Braque's men. When Le Braque points his gun at Quinn, Angelica shoots Le Braque, killing him.

He was among the founders of the Bethel Literary and Historical Society and the American Negro Academy, both based in the capital. He worked for decades in administration of the US Post Office. He also was a founder, editor, or contributor to a number of newspapers and journals, including most prominently the People's Advocate. In the later half of his career, he wrote articles and manuscripts and gave speeches, establishing himself as a leading scholar of African-American history. In 1887, he was described as the \\"best English scholar in the United States.\\"William J. Simmons, Henry McNeal Turner, Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising, G. M. Rewell & Company, 1887, p 898-907 Cromwell was also successful as a lawyer late in life and was the first black lawyer to appear before the Interstate Commerce Commission.  Early life  John Wesley Cromwell was born into slavery on September 5, 1846 in Portsmouth, Virginia. He was the youngest of twelve children. His parents were Willis H. and Elizabeth (Carney) Cromwell. Cromwell's father worked as a ferryman on the Elizabeth River and was allowed to keep some of his wages.Kirby, Jack Temple. Poquosin: A Study of Rural Landscape and Society. UNC Press Books, Dec 1, 2014, page 178 One brother, Levi, later became well known as a caterer in Washington, DC. In 1851, their father purchased freedom for his family, and they moved to Philadelphia in the free state of Pennsylvania. John attended school there from 1851 to 1856. He moved to a teaching school, the Preparatory Department of the Institute for Colored Youth, where Ebenezer Bassett was the principal. Cromwell graduated in the summer of 1864. He moved to Columbia, Pennsylvania that fall in October 1864 to begin his career as a teacher. When the school in Columbia closed, Cromwell returned to Portsmouth, Virginia in April 1865 in the closing days of the American Civil War, starting a private school where he worked until the fall. By the end of 1865 Cromwell returned to Philadelphia; he taught at the Baltimore Association for the Moral and Intellectual Improvement of the Colored People. In March 1866, the school was attacked and burned to the ground and Cromwell was shot at. He continued to work for the organization until May. That month he returned to Virginia, working for the American Missionary Association at Providence Church in Norfolk County, Virginia. It was establishing schools across the South. At this time, he became more active in politics. He also briefly worked in the grocery business.  Public career  In Virginia, Cromwell became involved in public affairs. In 1867, Cromwell was in the US District Court Jury Pool and served in the jury on a number of cases of government officials. On April 17, 1867, he was a delegate to the Republican convention in Richmond, Virginia and again to the Republican State convention in Richmond, Virginia in August. Later that year, he attended the Virginia Constitutional Convention, where he was elected clerk. In 1869, Cromwell returned to teaching, working with the Quaker group, the Philadelphia Friends. That year, Cromwell was an eyewitness to the assassination of Joseph R. Holmes, a fellow member of the Constitutional Convention and a candidate for the Virginia House of Delegates. In 1869 and 1870, he taught at a grade school in Withersville, Virginia. In 1870 he returned to the capital Richmond, where he was principal of a black school held in Dill's Bakery. In the summer of 1871, he taught a term in Southampton County. This experience influenced his later writings on Nat Turner's slave rebellion of 1831, which had occurred nearby. In the fall of 1871, Cromwell moved to Washington DC and enrolled in the Howard University Law Department. He graduated in March 1874 and was admitted to the bar before the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. In the meantime, in 1872, Cromwell passed the civil service exam to qualify for an appointment in the federal government. He took a position as a government clerk. In this exam, he had the highest score of his cohort. He also took a merit exam to qualify for teaching, and scored at the top. He accepted a teaching appointment for a time in Washington County, Virginia. In 1873 and 1874, Cromwell was twice promoted in his clerkship and, along with Robert William Waring, was one of the first two black clerks to receive such an office. He was promoted to chief examiner of the division of the money order department, and was register of money order accounts until his retirement from the civil service in 1885. In April 1875, federal clerks took part in two spelling bees, which were covered by newspapers across the country. Cromwell was a finalist in both. He was successful as a lawyer and was the first black lawyer to appear before the Interstate Commerce Commission. In 1875, Cromwell was a part of organizing the Virginia Educational and Historical Association; he served as its president until 1883, when it closed. Cromwell was also active as a journalist. In 1876, he organized a journal, the People's Advocate in Alexandria, Virginia, which moved to Washington DC the next year. He ran it until 1884. In 1883, he was president of the Bethel Literary society. He was a member of the Odd Fellows and of the Metropolitan AME Church. He represented the District in the 1884 World's Fair, also known as the Cotton Centennial Exhibition, at New Orleans. In 1881 Cromwell and Daniel Alexander Payne founded the Bethel Literary and Historical Association, and he served as president of that lyceum in 1883. In 1897, Cromwell was a part of the formation of the American Negro Academy founded by Alexander Crummell. He served as the organization's corresponding secretary until 1919. In 1919, he served as the fourth president for a short period.Alfred A. Moss. The American Negro Academy: Voice of the Talented Tenth. Louisiana State University Press, 1981. From 1901 to 1909 he was editor of the Washington weekly, the Washington Record. In 1910, he and James Robert Lincoln Diggs established the American Negro Monograph Company, a publishing company which lasted for eleven months. From 1901 to 1909 he taught and served as principals of several District schools, including Briggs, Garnet, Banneker, and Crummell schools.Hall, Steven Gilroy. \\"Cromwell, John Wesley,\\" in Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience, eds. Anthony Appiah, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Oxford University Press, Mar 16, 2005  Thought and legacy  Beyond his work as an educator, Cromwell played a significant role in the direction of black American thought. The Bethel Literary Organization, which he helped create and direct, and his speeches at other lyceums in the capital were highly influential. In 1900, Cromwell made a substantial donation of materials to the Howard University Library now called the Cromwell Collection.Moore, 1999, page 121 Cromwell was a strong advocate of black-owned businesses and encouraged black economic success. He believed black people should try to frequent black- owned businesses. Cromwell was considered an important statistician and historian in the later part of his life. He had great contempt for efforts to minimize the cost of slavery to blacks in America and focused significant attention on slave insurrections. Cromwell wrote that Nat Turner's revolt was an example of black people working to \\"help himself rather than depend on the other human agencies for the protection which could come through his own strong arm.\\"Smith, John David. \\"A Different View of Slavery: Black Historians Attack the New Proslavery Argument, 1890-1920,\\" in eds Charles H Stone, John David Smith, Slavery, Race and American History: Historical Conflict, Trends and Method, 1866-1953. Routledge, Mar 4, 2015, page 75 Cromwell wrote many papers and a number of book-length pieces. Cromwell's 1914 book, The Negro in American History: Men and Women Eminent in the Evolution of the American of African Descent, influenced Carter G. Woodson to create the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History in 1915.Karen Juanita Carrillo, African American History Day by Day: A Reference Guide to Events, ABC-CLIO, Aug 22, 2012, page 262-263 Cromwell later published articles in the Journal of Negro History.  Family  In 1873 Cromwell married Lucy A. McGuinn of Richmond and had seven children with her. The couple stressed the importance of education for all their children, who included Otelia, Mary E., Martha, Lucy, John Wesley Jr., and Brent.Obituary: John Wesley Cromwell, Evening Star (Washington (DC), District of Columbia), Friday, April 15, 1927 Page: 9 Otelia Cromwell, born in 1874, became the first black graduate of Smith College. She was a teacher and professor at Miner Teacher College, and received a PhD from Yale in 1926. Mary E. Cromwell was born in 1876 and taught mathematics.

The city was defended by Frederik van den Bergh who had been commissioned for the defence by King Philip II of Spain. A Spanish relief force under Francisco Verdugo and Crist√≥bal de Mondrag√≥n attempted to relieve the Spanish garrison. However a failed attack on the besiegers as well as desertions and disease meant the Spanish relief force had to retreat leaving Coevorden to its fate. As a result, on 2 September 1592, the garrison of Coevorden surrendered.Le√≥n p 100 Background In 1591 Maurice of Orange, the Dutch Republics military commander had led a successful campaign, in which he had captured several important cities culminating in the capture of Nijmegen in October that year.Knight, Charles Raleigh: Historical records of The Buffs, East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot) formerly designated the Holland Regiment and Prince George of Denmark's Regiment. Vol I. London, Gale & Polden, 1905, pp 37-38 During that campaign he had also captured Delfzijl, and meant Groningen the capital of Drenthe, being stripped of its main transit port. The ultimate goal of Maurice was to take that city in 1591 but the defensvies looked too strong. Therefore, in 1592 he began by besieging and taking Steenwijk so that Grongingen would grow weaker.Markham p 84 Maurice then wanted to move immediately to Coevorden, but the States-General did not want this to proceed. Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, although wounded from his unsuccessful campaign in Northern France had returned to the Netherlands, near Zeeland and the States General wanted to recall Maurice there. (Dutch) However, the Republic's army consisting of 8,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry was well complemented by the addition of newly-recruited German mercenaries as well as the English army under Francis Vere - fourteen companies of infantry and five troops of cavalry.Motley p 161-63 Parma convalescing from his wound at the same time was in no fit condition to lead an army and the army itself was not at full strength. Coevorden itself was an important five bastion fortress in the east of the country and lay between two large marshes; the Bourtange swamp which was thirty miles to the bay at Dollart and the other spread as far as the Zuider Zee.Duffy p 83-4 The only hard ground was the road heading towards Coevorden on a natural barrier of sand a half mile wide. At the time Coevorden was named as the third strongest fortress in Europe (after Antwerp and Milan), designed and built by Francesco Paciotto, the architect of the famous citadel of Antwerp.van der Hoeven p 117 (2004): Oorlog, mijn arme schapen p 289 Uitgeverij van Wijnen. (Dutch) The Spanish commander Francisco Verdugo had reported to Parma and the Governor ad interim Ernst von Mansield the immense importance of Coevorden and claimed the city was far more important than any others that had been taken that year by the Anglo-Dutch. Verdugo having been positioned in Groenlo and prepared with the veteran Spanish general Crist√≥bal de Mondrag√≥n to launch a strike against any potential siege. Maurice in the meantime conducted training with the troops at Giethoorn learning how to turn, advance, retreat, and double their lines.Hart p 22 Once the Spanish pressure in the East had relaxed, on 21 July the Anglo-Dutch army with approval from States General marched to Coevorden. Siege Siege of Coevorden in 1592 from the Atlas van Loon On 26 July, Maurice's forces arrived at Coevorden and began the siege; the garrison had a thousand veterans as well as 900 militia all under the command of Frederik van den Bergh. Maurice put his cousin William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg in charge of the siege whilst he ventured to Ootmarsum to counter any relief attempt by the Spanish. Meanwhile, Francis Vere did the same with some of the English troops and fell back to Doesburg, on the IJssel river. William Louis ordered trenches to be dug towards the fortress, and sconces to be built around the city. As a result, all the roads that were administered to the city were thus cut off from the outside. The siege lines around Coevorden were virtually complete except on the East part of city which was marshy and no siege work could be done. Engineers and pioneers were sent to the city moat so that a cover trench could be made on the fortress.Motley p 164-66 Digging begun and soon the trench itself was four to five feet deep (about 1.5 meters) and twelve feet wide (approximately four meters). An attack by pioneers and soldiers on a village suburb was attempted whilst the siege lines got closer. However, the attack was repulsed by the garrison in the city, but determined, they attacked again the next day and managed to occupy the suburb. On August 12, seeing no threat of relief Maurice returned to the siege. Mining and sapping continued for the besiegers - their pioneers and engineers constructed dams that cut off the canal that fed the ditch lines which were dug up to it from which the water was drained. This resulted in the problem of lack of fresh water for the garrison in the city. Some of them thought it best that they should make terms with Maurice but van den Bergh refused. He had the confidence that Francisco Verdugo together with other Spanish commanders would provide the relief of the city. Francisco Verdugo by Hillebrant van Wouw By mid-August wet weather had impeded operations further but for the besieging force it was thought that it would impede any army of relief. =Relief= However, after learning of the besiegers fragile communication lines, Verdugo and Mondrag√≥n's force marched from Grol with a relief force to Coevorden. By August 23 the veteran Tercio regiments of Mondragon, Gonzaga, Mansfield, and Arenburg; a force of 5,000 men had crossed the Rhine at Rheinberg. By 3 September, Verdugo's force was within a league of the city at Emblichen, having reached within ten miles of Coevorden. News reached Maurice of this force soon after, and he prepared for a confrontation with Verdugo, and as a result several forts were built in strategic places around the siege positions.Motley p 167 The city was informed of the relief force by the distant lighting of the fires and torches. Part of Vere's English army meanwhile had also heard of Verdugo's relief; they broke camp at Doesburg and immediately marched back to Coevorden. Verdugo decided to launch a camisado, an attack on the camp at night with the Spanish soldiers dressed in white shirts without their armour so that they couldn't be distinguished in the night. Just before daybreak, the Spanish assaulted one of the besiegers' camps which was under Count Hohenlo's command. Barely before the fight had begun however, English soldiers under Vere struck at the Spanish assault ranging within cannon-shot of the trenches just as some of the Dutch were falling back. Vere having arrived just in time, led an assault whilst the Spanish attacked saving a critical situation - Count John of Nassau, writing to his father, said: > \\"Vere fought with the Spanish like a man. He came up half an hour after the > fight began. Soon after the English arrived, the Dutch joined in on the assailants who eventually were repulsed. The Dutch and English had suffered fifty casualties, including William Louis who was wounded in the abdomen, but the wound was not as serious as was first thought. Verdugo having been repulsed and having lost 300 men, then tried to attempt to enter into an open field pitched battle with Maurice. Maurice refused to be tempted there, and the sapping and mining continued followed by a heavy bombardment. Van den Bergh had to undermine a wall, and behind it in desperation a new wall was built which caused some surprise, but for the Dutch and English it had little effect. Verdugo could not force his way past the tough Anglo-Dutch resistance; disease was high among his troops and had a high desertion rate meant that he could not make a further attempt to relieve the place. (1842): History of Holland, from the Beginning of the Tenth to the End of the Eighteenth Century Parker, 1844 p Verdugo then tried to starve the surrounding area so as to make sure the town held out longer but the besiegers however, had ensured a sufficient supply of food and ammunition. Verdugo and Mondrag√≥n' could not attempt any further actions that could save Coevorden and to save losses of his own troops he therefore ordered a retreat. When Van den Bergh noted that the relief force no longer attempted to relieve the city, he sent a drummer to Maurice with the request for negotiations of terms of surrender Van den Bergh had prepared various conditions, most of which were granted and thus Coevorden was surrendered to Maurice.Black p 112 Maurice of Nassau, by Michiel Jansz. van Mierevelt Aftermath The garrison was allowed to leave with full honours of war and could go wherever they wanted. Soon after the victorious Anglo-Dutch marched in but were too weak to enable any further sieges for the rest of the year. The army went into winter quarters and news of the Duke of Parma's death was received in the camp. During the greater part of the winter Vere shipped off companies which he had drilled and trained, to serve under other commanders in France and Ireland. Still there were 4,000 effective English and Scots troops in all of the Netherlands on 1 January 1593. After the conquests of Steenwijk and Coevorden by the States, Frisians troops demanded that Groningen should be besieged. The army of Maurice moved on to Groningen but the States-General had decided otherwise to press on to Geertruidenberg; the Frisians as a sign of protest sent no troops to the siege but regardless the Spanish garrison there surrendered after a three-month siege. Groningen fell finally on May 6, 1594 after a siege by Maurice and Vere. (1994): Rondom de reductie: vierhonderd jaar provincie Groningen, 1594-1994 pp 80-83 Uitgeverij Van Gorcum.

This species is caught commercially by trawling, as bycatch in the prawn fishing industry and by recreational anglers. Description The maximum length of this squid is about , with a maximum weight of around . The mantle is robust and tapers bluntly to a point. The eight arms have three rings of suckers with up to thirty hooks, and the two tentacles have long clubs with moderate-sized suckers and further hooks around the suckers. The diamond-shaped fins, which extend for almost the whole length of the mantle are widest in the middle, and are more than half as wide as they are long. The colour of this squid in life is semi-transparent, but if caught and removed from the sea, it will soon change to a uniform orangish- brown or rust colour. The base of the fin has a white or bluish luminescent streak. Distribution and habitat The southern reef squid is native to the subtropical Indo-Pacific region where it is found between 16¬∞S and 42¬∞S, and between 112¬∞E and 179¬∞E. It is a benthopelagic species with a depth range between . It occurs in southern Australia, its range extending from the Ningaloo Coast in Western Australia along the south coast as far as Tasmania and the Great Barrier Reef, as well as around North Island in New Zealand. Typical habitats include sandy areas, seagrass beds and reefs. Ecology This squid is mainly nocturnal and often forms small groups. It feeds on crustaceans and small fish and is itself preyed on by larger fish. If attacked, it can emit a cloud of purple ink and escape while the water is opaque. It is a common species and is of interest to fisheries over much of its range. It is caught commercially by trawling, and is also taken as bycatch in the prawn fishing industry and by recreational anglers using trolled jigs over seagrass meadows. Breeding takes place at different times of year in different parts of the range; there is typically an annual cycle, with the lifespan being about a year. Courtship occurs with males displaying to females, and males are antagonistic towards other males at this time. While a male is jostling and trying to drive off an interloper, \\"sneaker\\" males often get a chance to approach the female and copulate by depositing a spermatophore in her mantle cavity. When the female spawns, the egg strand most commonly contains eggs fertilized by three different males. Each strand typically consists of six to nine eggs and is attached to seaweed or seagrass fronds. Sometimes aggregations of hundreds of eggs occur with many females spawning at one site.

It can be found at all levels of Bolivian society. Citizens of the country perceive the judiciary, police and public administration generally as the country's most corrupt. Corruption is also widespread among officials who are supposed to control the illegal drug trade and among those working in and with extractive industries. Many Bolivians are uneducated and thus unaware of their rights as citizens or of laws against corruption. Background Ever since Bolivia was freed from Spanish rule in 1825, the country has experienced considerable instability. The government has been overthrown over 200 times and the constitution rewritten. Widespread poverty has been a major factor in the country's poor development and poor governance. In the latter half of the 20th century, the government was passed back and forth between civilian and military control repeatedly, some of them notorious for corruption. In 1980-81, when Luis Garc√≠a Meza Tejada was dictator, several thousand civil servants were prosecuted for embezzlement; in 1986, Garc√≠a Meza was charged with treason, sedition, and many other crimes, along with 55 of his associates; he fled the country in 1989. Victor Paz Estenssoro‚Äôs government (1985-89) introduced a degree of stability and democracy. Under Gonzalo ‚ÄúGoni‚Äù Sanchez de Lozada, president from 1993 to 1997 and from 2002 to 2003, however, witness the selling off state industries in a process that was widely viewed as corrupt, with many of the purchasers being firms with whom he had close ties. Evo Morales, elected Bolivia's president in December 2005, convinced poor and middle-class voters that his promised social revolution would overcome establishment corruption. Increased revenues from the exploitation of Bolivia's rich natural resources helped improve macro-economic performance during the decade between 2002 and 2012. Transparency has also improved under Morales. Nonetheless, Bolivia remains the poorest nation in South America, with real GDP lower than it was a generation ago and most of the population still living below the poverty line. Indicators, perceptions, and attitudes Transparency International's 2016 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 113th place out of 176 countries Similarly, the World Bank gave Bolivia a score of 38.9 for corruption on the Worldwide Governance Indicators scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), a decline from 2007 (43.7) but an improvement over 2009 (29.2). From 2007 to 2011, 80% of citizens thought corruption had worsened or stayed constant. A 2010 report suggested that citizens‚Äô perception of the level of public-sector corruption was worse than the actual scale of such corruption. Business executives, by contrast, saw the situation as having improved since 2009. Inhabitants of Bolivia tend to consider the state ‚Äúhopelessly corrupt,‚Äù yet under Morales, paradoxically, have allowed it to control an ever-greater portion of the economy, greatly expanding opportunities for corruption. A 2015 report found that while Bolivians do not consider Morales personally corrupt, and re-elected him handily in October 2014, they do think there is more corruption than ever and that it is the fault of the government. There is a degree of tolerance toward government corruption in Bolivia, a belief that it is acceptable given the ‚Äúgood things‚Äù the government does for the people. Many Bolivians subscribe to the traditional belief that only a fool does not take advantage of every opportunity to enrich himself, whether illicitly or not; others believe that with the ascent of Morales, who is an indigenous person, it is now the turn of that group to reap the benefits of corruption as other groups have done before. Indeed, a belief in the importance of group identify, and consequently a tendency to embrace the attitudes of the collective, often trumps individual ethics in Bolivian society. Government corruption Government bureaucracy is seen as inefficient, bloated, and full of clientelism, and is considered (along with the police) one of the most corrupt sectors in the country. Hiring and promotion are politically driven and lacking in transparency. Government officials tend to treat public financial data as their own property and tend not to grasp their obligation to provide information to the public. In 2010, Bolivia scored 13 out of 100 on the Open Budget Index, the worst performance for any Latin American country, but an improvement on its 2008 score of 7. Some reports suggest that rampant corruption within the government and elite perpetuate poverty and make it impossible for advancement. The Bertelsmann Foundation stated in 2012 that despite laws and safeguards, local government partakes in illicit enrichment schemes. In 2011, Flores Roberts, governor of Pando, was accused of establishing front companies. A former employee who reported him to the police, Claudia Silvana Salas, was later arrested and imprisoned on extortion charges and was receiving ‚Äúanonymous threats.‚Äù Over 200 individuals, including government officials and friends and members of Morales's MAS party, ended up being accused of corruption in connection with the fund's disbursements. It was noted that the first person to draw attention to corruption at the fund, back in 2012, was Jacobo Soruco Cholima, head of a Rural Workers‚Äô Union, who was murdered in June of that year, apparently in retaliation for his whistleblowing. In February 2016, Morales was accused of influence-peddling involving a Chinese construction firm, CAMC, for which his ex-girlfriend, Gabriela Zapata, worked and which received lucrative government contracts. Journalist Carlos Valverde, who made the relationship public, charged that Morales had used his position to help advance Zapata‚Äôs career. Valverde noted that the value of Bolivia's contracts with the firm rose from $214 million to over half a billion dollars after the firm hired Zapata. Zapata was arrested in late February. Also in February 2016, six people died when protesters set fire to the municipal offices in the indigenous city of El Alto. The fire was blamed on former officials who allegedly sought to destroy documents relating to a probe into their own corrupt activities. =Private property= Although the constitution guarantees the right to private property, this right is often infringed, with expropriation occurring frequently. =Customs= Bolivia's customs service is highly corrupt and inefficient, with more than one in three respondents in a survey saying that they had paid a bribe to customs officers during the previous year. =Taxation= The complexity of Bolivian tax law provides opportunities for corruption. A 2009 report stated that improved inspection control, involving the use of a so-called ‚Äúprocess flow approach,‚Äù has helped reduce corruption in the tax service and reduced loss of public funds. =Elections= Elections themselves are generally considered free and fair, although campaign financing safeguards are highly inadequate. In 2009 elections, EU observers reported widespread abuse of the public budget by incumbents, with campaigns being partly financed by civil servants' salaries. A 2010 report found Bolivia the weakest of all Latin American countries in this regard and noted the lack of limits on political donations and the absence of any law requiring disclosure thereof. =Bribery= Bribery is a crime in Bolivia, but a 2011 survey found that one of every three Bolivians had to pay a bribe in that year. The worst offenders were the judiciary, police and customs service. =Impunity= Officials charged with corruption are very often given immunity from prosecution in violation of the constitutional. Congress must approve in advance of any legal action against the executive. In 2014, Ever Moya, the former president of the Human Rights Committee, resigned after several corruption complaints he had submitted met with official indifference. Judiciary The judiciary is viewed as Bolivia's most corrupt sector. It is weak, inefficient, short on resources, and subject to interference by politicians, with court decisions often being influenced by bribery. Its independence was challenged in 2010 when Morales appointed five judges to the Supreme Court, Constitutional Court, and Judicial Council. Prosecutors are not independent, and they have often targeted opposition-party politicians and their supporters. Also, the 2009 Constitution placed indigenous courts on a par with the mainstream judicial system, which causes conflicts, confusion, difficulties, and delays. In 2015 Morales ‚Äúcalled for a referendum designed to root out corruption in the judicial system.‚Äù In 2014, the Senate called on the attorney general to suspend 300 of Bolivia's 508 public prosecutors for corruption and other offenses. Between January and August 2014, 45 prosecutors were disbarred, twice the number disbarred in 2013. Police and narcotics trafficking Police corruption is a major problem, owing partly to low wage and poor training. The police are generally viewed as the nation's third most corrupt institution, and corruption is widely seen as the main impediment to legitimate crime-fighting. In six years, three police chiefs have been fired for corruption or abuse of power. Many police officers have ties to organized crime, mainly drug traffickers, and many are appointed to senior positions, a power that is exclusively exercised by the president, because of their political connections. The narcotics police and secret police have been involved in cocaine trafficking since the late 1950s, with cocaine producers and traffickers being treated as respectable businessmen and coexisting peacefully with one government after another. Large-scale drug-related corruption in Bolivia's military and police force dates back to the 1970s and intensified in 1980-81, when dictator Luis Garc√≠a Meza Tejada's ‚Äúinner cabinet‚Äù was packed with persons involved in cocaine trafficking, notably Colonel Ariel Coca and Colonel Luis Arce G√≥mez. In 1988, Bolivia's foreign minister charged that narcotics traffickers were trying to influence policy, and a secret videotape of politicians and military officers socializing with a drug kingpin, Roberto Su√°rez G√≥mez, was shown on television. In the same year it was reported that police and prosecutors were returning large drug finds to narcotics traffickers and turning only small caches over to the authorities. President Jaime Paz Zamora (1989‚Äì93) was friendly with two ‚Äúdrug barons,‚Äù Carmelo ‚ÄúMeco‚Äù Dom√≠nguez and Isaac ‚ÄúOso‚Äù Chavarr√≠a. Over the decades there have been repeated scandals concerning official involvement in trafficking, and they have resulted in many firings but not very many prosecutions; also, those removed from their positions because of such involvement have tended to be lower-level people, while guilty higher-ups have generally been left alone to continue operating. Bolivia has become a regional drug-trafficking hub through which narcotics are funneled to Argentina and Brazil. One reason for this is the corruption and incompetence of the police. Many police officers are directly involved in trafficking, while others accept payoffs to facilitate shipments. In 2011, Rene Sanabria, then head of a police intelligence center, and former national police commissioner pled guilty to U.S. cocaine trafficking charges. In 2011, the reputation of the police was damaged by a probe of forty officers suspected of ties to drug trafficking. Also, the former anti-drug czar, Ren√© Sanabria, was arrested in Panama and tried in the U.S. on drug-trafficking charges. In January 2015, 20 prosecutors, 18 judges, and 12 police officials who had handled corruption and drug- trafficking cases were investigated for irregularities in their declarations of assets. One police colonel, for example, had accumulated nearly $145,000 over ten years on a salary of about $400 a month, and had reported the purchase of five properties while omitting the purchase of two additional properties. In May 2015, the problem of police corruption in Bolivia was highlighted by the case of Mart√≠n Belaunde Lossio, a Peruvian politician and businessman, whose escape from house arrest in Bolivia was believed to be made possible by paid-off police officers. ‚ÄúSome groups within our institutions, such as the police,‚Äù commented Morales, ‚Äúare creating a bad image of Bolivia.‚Äù The national police's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) investigates cases of police corruption and may sanction officers for minor infractions. Major violations are prosecuted by the Attorney General. An observer has stated that Bolivia's police force needs a ‚Äúcomplete overhaul‚Äù in order to combat drug trafficking and other international crime. One study suggested that government intervention allowed for corruption, and therefore taking a less hands-on approach would decrease corruption significantly. Business Companies consider corruption a major obstacle for business in the country. About a fifth of them expect to pay bribes to civil servants to do business. Bureaucratic procedures are complex and burdensome, and often involve illegal ‚Äúfacilitation payments.‚Äù Several sectors, notably public procurement and natural-resources extraction, are characterized by extensive patronage networks and clientelism. The risk of corruption is especially high when business must deal with the justice system, where bribes often must be paid in exchange for favorable decisions. One example of favoritism was the courts' refusal to take a 2015 case involving a catering company owned by a sister-in-law of the vice-president. Companies are also likely to encounter corruption when dealing with the public services sector, in which bribes are often required in exchange for licenses and permits. The same is true of the land administration sector, because property rights are not often protected in practice and expropriation is common, with compensation amounts being determined by negotiations rather than through consistent and transparent processes. Corruption in the tax bureau and customs sectors also impact companies doing business in Bolivia; in the latter sector, corruption occurs more often importing goods, rather than when exporting goods. =Product procurement= The product procurement sector is especially corrupt, with bribes being exchanged for government contracts and public funds often being diverted to favored companies and individuals. =Natural resources= Bolivia is rich in natural resources, a sector that is highly prone to corruption worldwide. The country is very dependent on extractives, with revenues making up almost a fifth of the national budget. The 2009 Constitution nationalized all hydrocarbon resources; oil and gas production is now under the purview of the government firm YPFB. The fact that the government controls both operation and regulation in this sector is widely seen as increasing opportunities for corruption. Scandals involving nepotism, kickbacks, and other forms of corruption have plagued the YPFB for years and led to the firing and imprisonment of several individuals. Corruption played a key role in the nationalization process, with leaders of YPFB being sent to prison in 2011 for bribery and influence-peddling. These events intensified the widespread sense that the government's claim to be fighting corruption is insincere. In 2009, an executive of a Bolivian-Argentine hydrocarbon firm, Cartler Uniservice, was shot in La Paz while allegedly delivering a large kickback to the family of the then president of YPFB, Santos Ramirez, and a close friend of Morales's. Ramirez was fired and given a 12-year prison sentence. In 2012, in a case called ‚ÄúSantos Ramitez II,‚Äù two other YPFB officials were charged with bribery, abuse of public resources, and illicit enrichment. In 2014 four top officials at YPFB were arrested for corruption, and two more for influence peddling. Local communities officially control their own natural resources, but are not protected from federal intervention, and are susceptible to corruption by government agencies or corporations. Citizens' constitutional right of access to financial information about extractive industries is not always respected. Organized crime As noted, police and customs authorities often collude with organized criminals, although other sectors are also affected by this sort of activity. Money-laundering Laws against money laundering are considered insufficient and ineffective. Media Bolivia ranks 108th of 179 countries for press freedom. Although freedom of expression and of the media are technically permitted, the government controls the allocation of licenses for print and broadcasting media. However, it is said that the state does not censor internet media. Media firms are not mandated to disclose ownership information, which makes possible conflicts of interest and erodes transparency. Morales has placed legal, political, and economic pressure on opposition media, and such pressure has led to journalistic self- censorship. The government did not investigate the 2012 murder of two journalists. The media are considered ‚Äúpartly free.‚Äù A law forbidding expression of ‚Äúracism‚Äù in the media is considered an attempt by the ruling regime to silence opposition criticism of pro-indigent government actions. Anti-corruption efforts The Law against Corruption, Illicit Enrichment, and the Investigation of Assets criminalizes most forms of corruption. The Anti-Corruption Law of 2010 which applies to all public officials and has no statute of limitations, does not specifically address narcotics-related corruption, but was used in 2011 to bring narcotics charges and to indict judges for dismissing narcotics charges. A law adopted in 2004 requires all executive-branch institutions to make their budget information public and respond in a timely way to information requests. There are several more laws in place to prevent corruption in its various forms. None of these laws, however, is adequately enforced. Transparency International stated in 2012 that Bolivia has made ‚Äúsignificant efforts‚Äù to improve transparency, and noted Morales's declaration of ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù of corruption, but acknowledged that anti-corruption laws continue to be poorly enforced and that corruption therefore remains a serious problem. The Ministry of Anticorruption and Transparency, founded in 2009, is tasked with promoting anti-corruption policies and investigating corruption cases at every level in every government branch. In March 2010, Congress passed a law that gives the state broad authority to prove private and public corruption. An April 2011 law seeks to reduce corruption in the police force. The National Council Against Corruption is charged with monitoring the National Plan against Corruption's progress. In 2005, Bolivia ratified the UN's 2003 anti-corruption convention, although it neglected to join an initiative to inhibit the bribing of public officials. Bolivia is also part of the Organization of American States‚Äô Inter-American Convention against Corruption, with an ombudsman appointed to protect human rights and guard against government abuse. Bolivia is not a member of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, but is a signatory of the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. The Red Participaci√≥n y Justicia is an anti-corruption coalition that is made up of more than one hundred organizations. Several CSOs address transparency and corruption. A 2016 OAS report called for greater anti-corruption efforts in Bolivia and praised certain best practices, such as the ‚ÄúMi Plataforma‚Äù initiative at the Ministry for Institutional Transparency and Fight against Corruption and the Executive Branch Ministries Master Salary Scale instituted by the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance. The UNODC's Bolivia Country Programme 2010-2015 includes an anti-corruption component. Along with other ministries, the UNODC developed seven educational games to raise awareness about corruption which have been used in schools, parks, and fairs to encourage civic involvement in fighting corruption. A September 2015 article in Foreign Policy described how La Paz ‚Äúfreed itself from a ubiquitous culture of corruption.‚Äù This took place thanks to Juan Del Granado, elected mayor in 1999 on a platform of ‚Äútransformation.‚Äù When he ordered fuel for municipal vehicles and the supplier handed him a check for $1,000, the usual kickback, he expelled the man from city hall. He set in place a zero-tolerance policy on graft. Former mayors, including Gaby Candia, Lupe Andrade, and Germ√°n Monroy Chazarreta, were prosecuted and jailed. In 2004, Del Granado established a Transparency Unit, which provided a special telephone tip line, email address, and online complaints procedure for reporting corruption, and whose staffers posed as public-service users to ferret out officials who demanded irregular fees and bribes. Del Granado also instituted rewards for good practice, giving out awards to ‚Äúefficient, transparent, cordial, and honest‚Äù city employees. In addition, he vigorously enforced the 1990 Financial Administration System and Governmental Control Act (SAFCO) and encouraged citizen participation in neighborhood governance.

It is an important species for fisheries in some parts of the Mediterranean where its population may have suffered from overfishing. Description Sepia elegans is a small species of cuttlefish which has and elongated mantle which is oval in shape and has a length that is more than two times greater than its width, with a maximum mantle length of 80mm. It has a short, broad tentacular club which is blunt towards its tip and has 6-8 suckers in oblique, crosswise rows. with three very enlarged suckers in the central part of the club. It has short arms and these are less than half the total length of the head and arms, each arm has two rows of suckers. The edge of the dorsal margin of the mantle protrudes at its anterior end in a lobe between the animal's eyes. The fins have their origin a short distance from the anterior edge of the mantle gut do not extend beyond mantle's anterior margin and they do not get wider towards the rear. The underside of the mantle has a longitudinal row of 6 narrow ridges along each side near the fins; the middle 2 pairs being larger than the posterior 2 pairs and the posterior 2 pairs. It is coloured red through to brown on its back, however, other describers give the overall colour as reddish brown. The head has a small number of scattered chromatophores, the arms are unmarked and the pale dorsal mantle is mottled with purple-black chromatophores. The fins and the underside of the mantle are paler with the ventral mantle ridges being whitish. The arrangement of the suckers on the arms are sexually dimorphic, in the males, arm I has two series of suckers for a few rows with the remainder being arranged in four series as are all the suckers on arms II and III on each side except for those at the arm tips which are in two series. The suckers on arms IV vary in their arrangement with 2 to 4 rows if suckers in two series. In the females most of the arms have two series of suckers near the head and four series towards the tip, there are 5 rows of suckers in two series on arms I to III, 2 to 4 rows on arms IV. The suckers of the males are larger in the middle of the arm than those at the sides. The hectocotylus is situated on the left ventral arm and has 1 or 2 rows of normal size suckers near the head, 9 to 11 rows of highly reduced very small suckers in the middle part of the arm and then it has normal sized suckers towards the tip of the arms. These suckers are in 2 dorsal and 2 ventral series which are laterally displaced. Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.MOL.311304 - Sepia elegans De Blainville, 1827 - Sepiidae - Mollusc shell The cuttlebone is lanceolate in shape and has a very small spine, resembling a small calcareous ridge rather than a true spine. Males have a cuttlebone which is 23-33% of its length whereas in females it is 26-35 % its length. The posterior portion of the bone narrows before a blunt, rounded posterior tip. Distribution Sepia elegans is found in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea from the Shetland Islands, Scotland in the north south along the eastern shore of the Atlantic in Europe and Africa to 15¬∞S and possibly to the Agulhas Bank. In the Mediterranean Sea its range encompasses the Ligurian Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea, Aegean Sea, Sea of Marmara and Levantine Sea. The habitat of the elegant cuttlefish is extensive as it has been found in the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, as well as the northeast, southeast, and eastern central areas of the Atlantic. Diet While crustaceans are the main food source of Sepia elegans, they also eat bony fish, as well as marine worms, such as Polychaeta. The preferred prey of this species of cuttlefish tends to remain constant throughout its lifetime.Castro, BERNARDINO G., and A. N. G. E. L. Guerra. \\"The diet of Sepia officinalis(Linnaeus, 1758) and Sepia elegans(D'Orbigny, 1835)(Cephalopoda, Sepioidea) from the Ria de Vigo(NW Spain).\\" Sci. Mar. 54.4 (1990): 375-388. Habitat and ecology Sepia elegans occurs offshore on sandy and muddy substrates, as deep as 500m but it is very rare at depth greater than 450m. It is a sublittoral cuttlefish which spebs the winter months in deeper water, at depths between 200m and 400m and in the spring it migrates into shallower water to spawn. Like other cuttlefish it is an opportunistic predator and its main prey are molluscs, small crustaceans, fish and polychaete worms. There does not appear to be any difference in prey choice between the sexes but the males and females feed at different rates. It can tolerate a wide range of salinities, occurring in brackish waters on the Sea of Marmara. Mature males and females are recorded all year in the Mediterranean Sea and this suggests that in this sea spawning is continuous with a resultant continuous recruitment of adult cuttlefish, with distinct peaks in some areas. The smallest sexually mature males recorded have been 20mm in mantle length and mature females at 30mm, off West Africa maturity is reached at around 1 year of age. In the Aegean Sea however the minimum mantle length for mature males and females was 41mm and 42mm respectively. The females lay eggs in clusters of 12-25 eggs which are attached to sea fans, shells and other hard objects in areas with a muddy substrate. The newly hatched juveniles have a benthic habit and, in the Sicilian Channel estimated grow rates measured by the increase in mantle length was recorded as roughly 2.8mm a month for males and 3.0mm for females. Females are usually heavier than males of similar mantle length and they have longer tentacular clubs and a greater weight of stomach contents. In the Atlantic off west Africa they also spawn throughout the year in shallow inshore waters, but there are peaks of spawning in the summer and autumn. Males bear 95 spermatophores while the females hold approximately 250 eggs. These cuttlefish spawn when the water temperature reaches 13¬∞ to 18 ¬∞C. In Portuguese waters there are mature cuttlefish found throughout the years although numbers reduce during the summer. In the eastern Mediterranean S. elegans adult individuals were smaller than those in the western part of the sea where lower productivity and higher temperatures cause the cuttlefish less metabolic cost. S. elegans lives for between 12 and 18 months. Chromidina elegans is a species of parasitic ciliate and is a parasite of Sepia elegans. Reproduction Females tend to carry approximately 250 eggs, and have a potential fecundity (reproductive rate) of 513 to 1190, while males can have about 95 spermatophores. Eggs are released in shallow watered sea fans, shells, and rocks within small bundles. The elegant cuttlefish are sexually dimorphic, the females have more body weight per given length, while males tend to be slightly larger in size. The females of this species also have longer tentacular clubs. Fisheries and other human uses Sepia elegans is sometimes caught as bycatch high numbers in parts of its geographic range. In the Mediterranean Sea it can be an important species in local markets and it is fished for intensively in the Sicilian Channel whilein the south-western Adriatic it as bycatch in a multi-species trawl fishery together with Sepia orbignyana. The catch of these cuttlefish was reduced between 1984 and 1999 and almost none were caught in a day's fishing in 2003, the decline being attributed to overfishing. This species, mixed with S. orbignyana and smaller sized S. officinalis in both fresh and frozen forms. The primary threat for all cuttlefish species is ocean acidification, which directly affects the density of the developing cuttlebone. The higher concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is found to increase the density of a cuttlebone which then negatively affects the buoyancy of the cuttlefish. It is also common for the cuttlefish to be caught as bycatch, often in significant numbers. A specific threat to Sepia elegans, is overfishing, especially in the Sicilian Channel where they are often used as a food source and their cuttlebones used for metal casting.

It was discovered by German- British astronomer William Herschel on March 14, 1784 and cataloged as VI-7. In his abbreviated notation, he described it as, \\"an extremely faint cluster of extremely small stars with resolvable nebula 8 or 10‚Ä≤ diameter, verified by a power of 240, beyond doubt\\". Danish-Irish astronomer John Louis Emil Dreyer reported in 1888 that the cluster appeared, \\"very faint, pretty large, irregular round shape, growing very gradually brighter at the middle\\". This is a metal-poor cluster, meaning the stars have a low abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium‚Äîwhat astronomers term metallicity. As recently as 1995, it was considered the most metal-poor globular cluster in the Milky Way. The chemical abundances of the stars in NGC 5053 are more similar to those in the dwarf galaxy Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy than to the Milky Way halo. Along with the kinematics of the globular cluster, this suggests that NGC 5053 may have been stripped from the dwarf galaxy. There are ten known RR Lyrae variable stars in this cluster with masses ranging from 68% to 78% of the solar mass. Nine of these variables were reported by German astronomer Walter Baade in 1928, and the tenth by American astronomer Helen Sawyer in 1946. The cluster hosts 27 known blue stragglers, of which five are short period SX Phoenicis variable stars. NGC 5053 is a relatively low mass cluster with a low core concentration factor of 1.32. It sports a stream of tidal debris to the west with a projected length of 1.7 kpc. This stream may have been created through shock-induced processes. The cluster is located less than 1¬∞ from Messier 53 and the two have nearly the same distance modulus, which corresponds to a spatial separation of around 2 kpc. There is a tidal bridge joining M53 to NGC 5053, suggesting the pair may have interacted in the past. The cluster is following an orbit through the Milky Way that has a perigalacticon distance of 9 kpc and an orbital eccentricity of 0.84. At present, it is 18.4 kpc from the Galactic Core, with a radial velocity of .

Map of Occitan Countries The Partit Nacionalista Occitan, more simply, \\"PNO\\" (in English: Occitan Nationalist Party) is a political party of Occitania, founded in 1959 by Fran√ßois Fontan (1929‚Äì1979). The current name is \\"Partit de la Nacion Occitana\\" (in English: \\"Occitan Nation Party\\").  Fran√ßois Fontan and the Ethnism  Author of \\"Ethnism\\" (in French : \\"Ethnisme\\"), Fran√ßois Fontan argues that the language is indicating the nation. Thus, Occitan nationalism draws its sources from the F√©librige of Frederic Mistral, who since the second half of the 19th century worked for the recognition of the Occitan language in the southern part of France: before that, \\"la langue d'oc\\" was just considered as a degenerate form of French (\\"patois\\"). Then, the Occitan national conscience has woken up from the feeling of speaking a vernacular language different from the French administrative language. Fontan tried to proclaims an Occitan Republic for the first time in Agen in 1948.  The Occitan flag  National flag of Occitania (the cross of Toulouse with the seven-pointed star of the Felibrige) The Cross of Toulouse (Arms of the medieval Counts of Toulouse) is used to symbolize the South French region of Occitania. For the Occitan national flag, Fran√ßois Fontan proposes to associate a star with 7 points, reference to the F√©librige who already used this symbol (\\"Lo Lugarn\\") with this number \\"7\\" for the 7 Occitans poets \\"F√©libres\\" founders of this movement. In fact, Occitania is also divided into 7 historical counties too: Guyenne, Gascony, Provence, Dauphin√©, Auvergne, Limousin, Languedoc.

In 1935, Muse ran for the state senate seat in 21st District, then representing Roanoke City and Roanoke County and represented by Abram P.

Upon finishing school in time for the six-week Christmas holiday season, Grant catches a train to the mining town of Bundanyabba ‚Äì known by the locals as \\"The Yabba\\" ‚Äì to await a flight home to Sydney, where he hopes to spend his vacation swimming at the nearby beach. While passing time in a pub, Grant encounters the local policeman, Jock Crawford, with whom he drinks several glasses of beer and visits the local two-up school to get dinner. Deciding to try his luck at the game, Grant makes two hundred pounds in a winning streak, but in a bid to win enough money to pay off his bond and impress Robyn ‚Äì a wealthy and attractive woman he briefly encountered in Sydney ‚Äì he loses all but two shillings of his cash in two rounds, leaving him without means of buying a plane ticket. The next morning, Grant visits another pub, where he is befriended by mining director Tim Hynes, who invites him to have dinner with his wife and their adult daughter, Janette, and drink with two of his colleagues, boxers-turned-miners Dick and Joe. During the night, Janette attempts to seduce the virgin Grant, who drunkenly vomits during the encounter. He awakens the following afternoon in the ramshackle cabin of \\"Doc\\" Tydon, a vagrant medical practitioner, war veteran and associate of the Hynes. Grant quickly takes a disliking to Doc when he expounds upon his open relationship with Janette. They are joined by Dick and Joe in a violent, drunken kangaroo hunt that rages into the night. Upon awakening the next morning, Grant faintly recalls being on the receiving end of a homosexual encounter initiated by Doc. Taking the rifle gifted to him by Dick and Joe and leaving Doc's cabin, he is encountered by Crawford in the street, who returns his belongings that were left behind during his rendezvous with the Hynes. Resolving to hitchhike to Sydney, Grant buys some provisions and begins walking eastward through the desert, and is eventually driven to the town of Yelonda. At a truck depot near a hotel, he notices a truck bearing the word \\"Sydney\\". Interpreting this as the driver's destination, he successfully convinces the driver to give him a lift; although he offers his rifle and ammunition as payment, the driver allows him to keep the former. After a shorter-than-expected drive through the night, Grant realises that they have returned to The Yabba; the \\"Sydney\\" markings simply referred to where the driver acquired his truck. Realising that he has no further means of leaving The Yabba and that his own actions ‚Äì beginning with his initial encounter with Crawford ‚Äì have led to his continued suffering and demise, Grant descends into a stupor of self-loathing and collapses in a nearby park, where he discovers that he has one remaining bullet for his rifle. After considering his options, he shoots himself in the head, the impact of which scars but fails to kill him. Grant spends the remainder of his holiday recovering in hospital, where he signs a statement from Crawford explaining that his suicide attempt was an accident, and briefly encounters Janette working as a nurse. After receiving a twenty pound loan from an almoner to pay for his hospital fee and promising to himself to \\"never get drunk again... except in good company\\", he returns to Tiboonda to begin the new school year. As he prepares to greet Charlie, the local hotelier and publican, Grant thinks to himself: See also * 1961 in Australian literature  Notes  The novel takes its title from an old curse: \\"May you dream of the Devil and wake in fright.\\" The novel was re-issued by Text Publishing as a part of their Text Classics series in 2012. It contained an introduction by Peter Temple.Text Classics - Wake in Fright by Kenneth Cook Warm Vellum bookshop listed the novel as having one of the best opening lines in literature. That line reads: \\"\\"He sat at his desk, wearily watching the children file out of the room, reflecting that, this term at least, it was reasonable to assume that none of the girls was pregnant.\\" Critical reception In his introduction to the 2012 Text Publishing edition, Peter Temple said: \\"Wake in Fright is a young writer's work: romantic, at times naive. It also suffers from some uncertainty of character and there are problems of balance. These are flaws, but they are outmuscled by the writer's strengths. Cook can make us feel the heat, see the endless horizon, hear the sad singing on a little train as it traverses the monotonous plain... And Cook has range too. He captures the icy, flooding charm of a first beer on a heat-struck day. He knows what it feels like to catch luck's eye and hold the gaze across a smoky room, to feel the irrational deservedness of it, to hear fortune singing sweet in the veins. And he knows dark things‚Äîthe frightening chasm that opens when certainty disappears, the savagery in the human heart. Wake in Fright has the power to disturb, a rare thing in any novel.\\"  Adaptation  The novel was adapted for the screen in 1971. The film was directed by Ted Kotcheff, from a script by Evan Jones, and featured Gary Bond, Donald Pleasence and Chips Rafferty in the lead roles.

Rich died about an hour and a half after receiving two gunshot wounds to the back. He was murdered by unknown perpetrators for unknown reasons, but police suspected he had been the victim of an attempted robbery. The 27-year-old Rich was an employee of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and his murder spawned several right-wing conspiracy theories, including the false claim that Rich had been involved with the leaked DNC emails in 2016, contradicted by the law enforcement branches that investigated the murder. It was also contradicted by the July 2018 indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence agents for hacking the e-mail accounts and networks of Democratic Party officials and by the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion the leaked DNC emails were part of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Fact-checking websites like PolitiFact, Snopes, and FactCheck.org stated that the theories were false and unfounded. The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post wrote that the promotion of these conspiracy theories was an example of fake news. Rich's parents condemned the conspiracy theorists and said that those individuals were exploiting their son's death for political gain, and their spokesperson called the conspiracy theorists \\"disgusting sociopaths\\". They requested a retraction and apology from Fox News after the network promoted the conspiracy theory, and sent a cease and desist letter to the investigator Fox News used. The investigator stated that he had no evidence to back up the claims which Fox News attributed to him. Fox News issued a retraction, but did not apologize or publicly explain what went wrong. In response, the Rich family sued Fox News in March 2018 for having engaged in \\"extreme and outrageous conduct\\" by fabricating the story defaming their son and thereby intentionally inflicting emotional distress on them. The judge initially dismissed the suit in August 2018, but the court of appeals later allowed the case to proceed. Seth Rich's early life and career Rich grew up in a Jewish family in Omaha, Nebraska. He volunteered for the Nebraska Democratic Party, interned for Senator Ben Nelson, was active in Jewish outreach, and worked with the United States Census Bureau. Eulogy given by Rabbi Steven Abraham of Beth El Synagogue at the service on July 13, 2016. In 2011, he graduated from Creighton University with a degree in political science. He moved to Washington, D.C., to work for pollster Greenberg Quinlan Rosner. In 2014, he began working for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) as the voter expansion data director. One of his tasks at the DNC was the development of a computer application to help voters locate polling stations. Shooting and death On Sunday, July 10, 2016, at 4:20 a.m., Rich was shot about a block from his apartment at the southwest corner of Flagler Place and W Street Northwest in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Washington, D.C.(August 5, 2016). Mother, Police Seeking Tips on Killing of DNC Staffer Seth Rich, WRC- TV. retrieved August 22, 2016. Earlier that night he had been at Lou's City Bar, a sports pub from his apartment, in Columbia Heights, where he was a regular customer. He left when the bar was closing, at about 1:30 or 1:45 a.m. Police were alerted to gunfire at 4:20 a.m. by an automated gunfire locator. Within approximately one minute after the gun shots, police officers found Rich conscious with multiple gunshot wounds. He was transported to a nearby hospital, where he diedKhan, Mariam. DNC Employee Shot Dead in DC Over the Weekend, ABC News, July 11, 2016. more than 1 1/2 hours after being shot. That he was not shot in the head is seen as evidence against an \\"assassination\\". According to police, he died from two shots to the back and may have been killed in an attempted robbery. Residents noted the neighborhood had been plagued by robberies. Rich's mother told NBC's Washington affiliate WRC-TV, \\"There had been a struggle. His hands were bruised, his knees are bruised, his face is bruised, and yet he had two shots to his back, and yet they never took anything ... They didn't finish robbing him, they just took his life.\\" The police told the family they had located a surveillance recording showing a glimpse of the legs of two people who could possibly be the killers. Aftermath On the day after the shooting, DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued a statement mourning his loss and praising Rich's work to support voter rights. Two days after the shooting, Hillary Clinton spoke of his death during a speech advocating limiting the availability of guns. Bike rack and plaque outside the DNC headquarters In September 2016, Rich's parents and girlfriend appeared on the syndicated television show Crime Watch Daily to speak about the murder case. In October 2016, a plaque and bike rack outside the DNC headquarters were dedicated to Rich's memory. In February 2017, the Beth El Synagogue in Omaha named after Rich an existing scholarship that helps Jewish children attend summer camps. The Rich family accepted the pro bono public relations services of Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman in September 2016. The Rich family and Burkman held a joint press conference on the murder in November 2016. In January 2017, Burkman launched an advertising campaign in Northwest D.C. searching for information regarding Seth's death. This included billboard advertisements and canvassing with flyers. In late February, Burkman told media outlets he had a lead that the Russian government was involved in Rich's death, and the Rich family then distanced itself from Burkman. On March 19, 2017, Rich's brother, Aaron, started a GoFundMe campaign to try to raise $200,000 for private investigation, public outreach activities, and a reward fund. The Rich family was approached by Ed Butowsky (a friend of Trump advisor Steve Bannon and a frequent Fox News contributor), who recommended having Fox News contributor and former homicide detective Rod Wheeler investigate Seth's murder. Butowsky said Wheeler had been recommended to him. The family gave Wheeler permission to investigate, though they did not hire him. When questioned by CNN, Butowsky denied involvement in the case, but later admitted he was involved and had offered to pay Wheeler's fees. After Wheeler asserted links between Rich and Wikileaks in a Fox affiliate interview on May 15, 2017‚Äîan assertion he later backpedaled from‚Äîthe family spokesman said that the family regretted working with Wheeler. Wheeler then sued Fox News on August 1, 2017, for mental anguish and emotional distress, alleging that he had been misquoted in a story that was then published on the urging of Trump. Rewards The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) posted its customary reward of $25,000 for information about the death. On August 9, 2016, WikiLeaks announced a $20,000 reward for information about Rich's murder leading to a conviction, which was subsequently increased to $125,000. Rich's family said they were unable to verify this reward offer. WikiLeaks stated that this offer should not be taken as implying Rich had been involved in leaking information to them. In November 2016, Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman said he was personally offering a $100,000 reward in addition to those announced by the police department and WikiLeaks, and he added another $5,000 to his offer in December and another $25,000 in January. Burkman said he hoped the money would help \\"get to the truth of what happened here and will either debunk the conspiracy theories or validate them.\\" In total, these 3 rewards add up to $280,000. Conspiracy theories =Origins= Beginnings on social media Political conspiracy theories and racially charged comments started to appear on social media the day after Rich's death. Within days, right-wing conspiracy theories began circulating, including false claims that his murder was connected to the DNC email leak of 2016, or the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation. A post on Twitter before Rich's memorial service spread the idea that his killing was a political assassination. Subsequently, the conspiracy theory was spread on the subreddit /r/The Donald, and on July 29, 2016, the website Heat Street reported on these Reddit posts. Reddit users attempted to tie the homicide to prior \\"Clinton Body Count\\" conspiracy theories. The conspiracy theory was later popularized by Donald Trump political adviser Roger Stone via his Twitter account. According to British journalist Duncan Campbell, the Russian intelligence agency, GRU, tried to implicate Rich as the source of the stolen DNC emails, in order to draw attention away from themselves as the real perpetrators of the theft. Datestamps on the DNC files were altered to show the data had been obtained on July 5, 2016, five days before Rich's death, and the time zone was changed to Eastern Time, within which Washington, D.C., falls. Guccifer 2.0, the alleged GRU front that provided the emails to Wikileaks, then reported that Rich had been their source. Based partly on their acceptance of the false dates, some experts then concluded that the emails had been copied in the DNC offices, and had not been hacked from outside.Tucker, Patrick (August 2, 2018). \\"A new report claims that Russian hackers altered dates in stolen documents to frame the DNC staffer for the theft.\\" Defense One. Retrieved August 25, 2018. WikiLeaks statements Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, fueled the speculation in an interview with Nieuwsuur published on August 9, 2016, which touched on the topic of risks faced by WikiLeaks' sources. Unbidden, Assange brought up the case of Seth Rich. When asked directly whether Rich was a source, Assange nodded, then said \\"we don't comment on who our sources are\\". Subsequent statements by WikiLeaks emphasized that the organization was not naming Rich as a source, as they do with other leaks. It subsequently came to light that WikiLeaks communicated with the Trump campaign over other issues, casting doubt on Assange's motives. According to the Mueller Report, WikiLeaks had received an email containing an encrypted file named \\"wk dnc link I .txt.gpg\\" from the Guccifer 2.0 GRU persona on July 14, which was four days after Seth Rich died.Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 46: On July 14, 2016, GRU officers used a Guccifer 2.0 email account to send WikiLeaks an email bearing the subject \\"big archive\\" and the message \\"a new attempt.\\"163 The email contained an encrypted attachment with the name \\"wk dnc link I .txt.gpg.\\" In April 2018, Twitter direct messages revealed that even as Assange was suggesting publicly that WikiLeaks had obtained emails from Seth Rich, Assange was trying to obtain more emails from Guccifer 2.0, who was at the time already suspected of being linked to Russian intelligence. BuzzFeed described the messages as \\"the starkest proof yet that Assange knew a likely Russian government hacker had the Democrat leaks he wanted. And they reveal the deliberate bad faith with which Assange fed the groundless claims that Rich was his source, even as he knew the documents' origin.\\" Mike Gottlieb, a lawyer for Rich's brother, noted that WikiLeaks received the file of stolen documents from the Russian hackers on July 14, four days after Rich was shot. Gottlieb described the chronology as \\"damning\\". Propagation by right wing media and venues The conspiracy theories were promoted by Mike Cernovich, Sean Hannity, Geraldo Rivera, Kim Dotcom, Paul Joseph Watson, Newt Gingrich, Jack Posobiec, and others. The same venues that fomented the false Pizzagate conspiracy theory helped to promulgate the Seth Rich murder conspiracy theories, and each shared similar features. Both were promoted by individuals subscribing to far-right politics, and by campaign officials and individuals appointed to senior-level national security roles by Donald Trump. After prior coordination on Facebook, each theory was spread on Twitter by automated bots using a branded hashtag, with the goal of becoming a trending topic. Both the Pizzagate conspiracy theory and the Seth Rich murder conspiracy theory were spread in the subreddit forum /r/The_Donald. In both conspiracy theories, the promoters attempted to shift the burden of proof -- asking others to attempt to disprove their claims, without citing substantiated evidence. Slates Elliot Hannon called the claims about Seth Rich a \\"PizzaGate-like conspiracy theory surrounding Rich's death\\", The Huffington Post described it as \\"the 'alt-right' idiocy of Pizzagate all over again\\", NPR's David Folkenflik said Fox News coverage of it \\"evokes the pizza-gate terrible allegations utterly unfounded\\", and Margaret Sullivan wrote for The Washington Post: \\"The Seth Rich lie has become the new Comet Ping Pong ... Crazy, baseless and dangerous.\\" On July 9, 2019, a Yahoo! News article stated that an alleged Russian Foreign Intelligence Service bulletin dated July 13, 2016, was the original source of the conspiracy theory. An analysis by the Washington Post disputed the conclusion while crediting the report for highlighting the roles played by InfoWars, FoxNews, and Hannity in promoting the misinformation. =Debunking= Law enforcement stated that the conspiracy theories were unfounded, while fact-checking websites like PolitiFact.com, Snopes.com, and FactCheck.org came to the conclusion that the theories were false and baseless. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia described the murder as related to a bungled attempted robbery, and said \\"the assertions put forward by Mr. Wheeler are unfounded.\\" The FBI told PolitiFact.com that the MPD was investigating the homicide. Assistant Police Chief Peter Newsham said the police had no information suggesting a connection between Rich's death and data obtained by WikiLeaks. People who worked with Rich said he was not an expert computer hacker helping to leak information to foreigners. Andrew Therriault, a data scientist who had mentored Rich, said although he had recently been working as a programmer, this \\"wasn't his background\\", and another co-worker said Rich was very upset when he heard hackers associated with Russian intelligence services had broken into the DNC computers and could be interfering with the election. Rich family representative, Brad Bauman, responding to the conspiracy theorists' claim that the FBI was investigating the case said, \\"The FBI is not now and has never been a party to this investigation.\\" FactCheck.org analyzed statements by Newt Gingrich related to the conspiracy theory, where Gingrich said Rich \\"apparently was assassinated\\" subsequent to \\"having given WikiLeaks something like ... 53,000 [DNC] emails and 17,000 attachments\\". FactCheck.org determined this claim was \\"unsupported\\" and determined \\"there's no evidence for his claim.\\" PolitiFact.com said the assertion that Rich gave emails to WikiLeaks is a \\"baseless claim\\", concluding \\"Gingrich and others are talking about an unfounded conspiracy theory as if it's a matter of fact. It is far from it. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.\\" In a separate analysis, PolitiFact.com concluded: \\"There's no evidence there's any link between Rich and WikiLeaks. The FBI has indirectly denied investigating the case, which Washington police consider a robbery gone wrong.\\" Snopes.com looked into the matter and stated: \\"We were able to confirm the FBI is not investigating Rich's murder it is an MPD investigation.\\" Snopes contacted a spokesman for the Washington, D.C., mayor's office, who said, \\"All claims made by Mr. Wheeler are false and take fake news to a whole new level. The family deserves better and everyday MPD continues to work diligently to solve this case.\\" Snopes rated the claim \\"DNC staffer Seth Rich sent 'thousands of leaked e-mails' to WikiLeaks before he was murdered\\" as \\"False\\". The fabrications were described as fake news and falsehoods by The New York Times. The New York Times cited the conspiracy theories as an example of the persistence of false claims, concluding: \\"fake news dies hard\\". The Los Angeles Times called the conspiracy theories \\"unsubstantiated rumors\\". The Washington Post cited the conspiracy theories as an example of the power of fake news to spread virally online. The paper used the example as a case study of the persistence of fake news, and found that television news media can be a soft target for such false stories. The Washington Post further found that the proliferation of fake news via Facebook had decreased, but remained powerful on Twitter due to spread via online bots. They found that the conspiracy theories with the largest potential to spread on the Internet were those that held attraction for both the alt-right movements and the political left wing. The Washington Post concluded that even if a particular false story had been sufficiently debunked, such fact-checking was unable to stop the spread of the falsehoods online. = Fox News retracted reporting = Uncorroborated story On May 15, 2017, Fox 5 DC (WTTG) reported the uncorroborated and later largely retracted claims by Rod Wheeler, a Fox News contributor and former homicide detective, that there was evidence Seth Rich had contacted WikiLeaks and that law enforcement were covering this up; claims that were never independently verified by Fox. The next day, Fox News published a lead story on its website and provided extensive coverage on its cable news channel about what it later said were Wheeler's uncorroborated claims about the murder of Seth Rich; in the lead story Fox News removed from their website a few days later, they stated that Wheeler's claims had been \\"corroborated by a federal investigator who spoke to Fox News.\\" In reporting these claims, the Fox News report re-ignited conspiracy theories about the killing. According to NPR, within a day of the original Fox report, \\"Google searches for Rich had overtaken searches for James Comey, even amid continuous news about the former FBI director's conversations with Trump.\\" The Washington Posts Callum Borchers noted Fox News chose to lead with this story at a time when most other media outlets were covering Donald Trump's disclosure of classified information to Russia. Other news organizations revealed Wheeler was a Donald Trump supporter, a paid Fox News contributor, and according to NBC News had \\"developed a reputation for making outlandish claims, such as one appearance on Fox News in 2007 in which he warned that underground networks of pink pistol-toting lesbian gangs were raping young women\\". The Washington Post noted it is \\"rare for a news organization to have such a close relationship with the people it is covering\\", as Wheeler was \\"playing three roles at once: as a Fox source, as a paid contributor to the network and as a supposedly independent investigator of the murder\\". When Wheeler appeared on Sean Hannity's Fox News shows, these multiple roles were not disclosed to viewers. After Wheeler's Fox News interview on May 15, 2017, Brad Bauman, a communications professional and spokesman for the Rich family, said the family was asking Fox News and the Fox affiliate to retract their reports and apologize for damaging their son's legacy. The family spokesperson, the Washington, D.C., police department, the Washington, D.C., mayor's office, the FBI, and law enforcement sources familiar with the case all disputed Wheeler's claims. The family said, \\"We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers.\\" Bauman criticized Fox News for its reporting, saying he believed that the outlet was motivated by a desire to deflect attention from the Trump-Russia story: \\"I think there's a very special place in hell for people that would use the memory of a murder victim in order to pursue a political agenda.\\" Later that day, Wheeler told CNN he had no evidence that Rich had contacted Wikileaks. Wheeler claimed that Fox had presented his quotes misleadingly and that he only learned about the possible existence of the evidence from a Fox News reporter. Despite this, Sean Hannity's show and Fox & Friends continued to promote the conspiracy theory for the remainder of the week. On May 18, 2016, Hannity's guest on the show was Jay Sekulow who said that Rich's killing \\"... undercuts this whole Russia argument;\\" neither one mentioned that Sekulow had just been hired as one of Trump's lead lawyer in the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Geraldo Rivera took part in spreading the conspiracy. Hannity had on his program Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch, who said the organization filed Freedom of Information Act requests for documents from Washington, D.C., mayor Muriel E. Bowser, and from the Metropolitan Police. Sean Hannity furthermore promoted the uncorroborated claims of Kim Dotcom, a New Zealand resident sought by the United States on fraud charges who claimed without evidence that Rich had been in contact with him before his death. Fox News host Julie Roginsky was critical of the conspiracy theory peddlers, stating on Twitter and on her television show: \\"The exploitation of a dead man whose family has begged conspiracy theorists to stop is really egregious. Please stop.\\" Fox News was also criticized by conservative outlets, such as the Weekly Standard, National Review, and Red State, and conservative columnists, such as Jennifer Rubin, Michael Gerson, and John Podhoretz. In September 2017, NPR noted that Fox News had yet to apologize for its false story or explain what went wrong; \\"When a story of this scale crumbles, most news organizations feel obligated to explain what happened and why. Not so far at Fox.\\" By August 2020, Malia Zimmermann, the reporter behind the retracted Fox News story, was still working at Fox News, although no stories had appeared under her byline since August 2017. Cease and desist letter and retraction On May 19, 2017, an attorney for the Rich family sent a cease and desist letter to Wheeler. Fox News issued a retraction of the story on May 23, 2017 and removed the original article, and did not apologize or specify what went wrong or how it did so. Despite this, Hannity, who pushed the theory, remained unapologetic, saying \\"I retracted nothing\\" and \\"I am not going to stop trying to find the truth.\\" In their May 23 statement, Fox News said, \\"The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting. Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.\\" Media ethics writer Kelly McBride criticized the retraction as \\"woefully inadequate\\", writing that it did not specify exactly what was inaccurate, or provide correct information in place of the retracted story. The same day, Hannity stated on his show that he would cease discussing the issue. Hannity said his decision to cease commenting on the matter was related to the family of the murder victim: \\"Out of respect for the family's wishes, for now, I am not discussing the matter at this time.\\" In the same statement wherein he promised to cease discussion of the topic, he vowed to pursue facts in the future: \\"I promise you I am not going to stop trying to find the truth.\\" Several advertisers including Crowne Plaza Hotels, Cars.com, Leesa Mattress, USAA, Peloton and Casper Sleep pulled their marketing from his program on Fox News. Crowne Plaza Hotels later said that it was not their policy to advertise on political commentary shows, and that they had not been aware of their sponsorship of the show. USAA soon returned to advertising on Fox News after receiving customer input. =Wheeler lawsuit= On August 1, 2017, Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Butowsky who was the first to claim links between Seth Rich's murder and the DNC hack on Fox, but who later appeared to retract his claims, filed a lawsuit (Case 1:17-cv-05807 Southern District of New York), in which 21st Century Fox, the Fox News Channel, Fox News reporter Malia Zimmerman and Ed Butowsky are named as defendants, stating that quotes attributed to him in the original Fox News piece were fabricated. The lawsuit also alleges that the fabricated quotes were included in the Fox News story at the urging of the Trump White House. Text messages and audio apparently supporting this assertion were included in the filing of the lawsuit. About a month before the story was aired on Fox News, Wheeler and Butowsky met at the White House with the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, to review the planned story on Seth Rich's murder. After talking to Wheeler and Butowsky, Zimmerman sent Wheeler a draft of a story without any quotes from Wheeler on May 11. On May 14, Butowsky texted Wheeler saying \\"Not to add any more pressure but the president just read the article. He wants the article out immediately. It's now all up to you. But don't feel the pressure.\\" Butowsky also left a voicemail for Wheeler which said \\"We have the full, uh, attention of the White House on this. And tomorrow, let's close this deal, whatever we've got to do.\\" Butowsky said Seymour Hersh confirmed a link between Rich and the FBI. Hersh confirmed the conversation with Butowsky but told NPR the link was \\"gossip\\" and that Butowsky exaggerated its significance. In an email to Fox News, Butowsky also wrote about the purpose behind the Seth Rich story: \\"One of the big conclusions we need to draw from this is that the Russians did not hack our computer systems and ste[a]l emails and there was no collusion (between) Trump and the Russians.\\" He also instructed Wheeler that \\"[T]he narrative in the interviews you might use is that you and [Zimmerman's] work prove that the Russians didn't hack into the DNC and steal the emails and impact our elections ... If you can, try to highlight this puts the Russian hacking story to rest.\\" When the story aired on Fox News, it included supposed quotes from Wheeler and was written as if the accusations against the DNC came from him. Wheeler alleges that the quotes were fabricated and should not have been attributed to him. In later recordings Butowsky told Wheeler that the claims being attributed to him were false but says that \\"One day you're going to win an award for having said those things you didn't say.\\" He also says \\"I know that's not true, if I'm under oath, I would say I never heard him say that.\\" =Family's reactions= In May 2017, Seth Rich's brother Aaron Rich issued a statement saying, \\"We simply want to find his killers and grieve. Instead, we are stuck having to constantly fight against non-facts, baseless allegations, and general stupidity to defend my brother's name and legacy.\\" The family spokesperson said \\"At this point, only people with transparent political agendas or sociopaths are still perpetuating Seth Rich conspiracies.\\" His parents authored a piece in The Washington Post on May 23, 2017 titled: \\"We're Seth Rich's parents. Stop politicizing our son's murder,\\" in which they wrote: In March 2018, Rich's family filed a lawsuit against Fox News, Fox reporter Malia Zimmerman, and Fox contributor Ed Butowsky, for publishing a news report about Seth Rich. The suit alleges that the report fueled conspiracy theories about Rich's death and caused the family emotional distress. Judge George B. Daniels dismissed the lawsuit in August 2018, ruling that, although it was reasonable for plaintiffs to believe their son's death was being used for political purposes, the plaintiffs failed to allege \\"intentional infliction\\" of emotional distress on the part of defendants, as that standard is determined under New York state law: \\"defamatory statements to news outlets 'fall well short of meeting the high standards for extreme and outrageous conduct.' They would have had to prove more extreme and persistent distress under the law.\\" The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned the dismissal in September 2019 saying, \\"the Riches plausibly alleged what amounted to a campaign of emotional torture.\\" Also in March 2018, Aaron Rich filed a lawsuit against Butowsky, Couch, America First Media, and The Washington Times for suggesting he had played a role in the purported theft of emails from the DNC. On October 1, 2018, as part of a settlement they had reached with Aaron Rich, The Washington Times retracted the relevant articles and issued an apology to Rich and his family.

The show is the biggest show of the year for CMLL, considered their version of the Super Bowl or WrestleMania. The CMLL Anniversary Show is the longest-running annual professional wrestling shows. The main event was a Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", between Dragon Lee and La M√°scara where both wrestlers put their mask on the line, in the end Dragon Lee pinned La M√°scara, forcing La M√°scara to unmask and reveal his birth name, Felipe de Jes√∫s Alvarado. A second Lucha de Apuesta took place, with Rey Bucanero defeating Super Crazy forcing Super Crazy to be shaved bald as a result. The show featured four additional matches, including a match for the CMLL World Trios Championship Production =Background= Arena M√©xico, CMLL's main venue and location of the 83rd Anniversary Show The Mexican Lucha libre (professional wrestling) company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) started out under the name Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (\\"Mexican Wrestling Company\\"; EMLL), founded by Salvador Lutteroth in 1933. Lutteroth, inspired by professional wrestling shows he had attended in Texas, decided to become a wrestling promoter and held his first show on September 21, 1933, marking what would be the beginning of organized professional wrestling in Mexico. Lutteroth would later become known as \\"the father of Lucha Libre\\" . A year later EMLL held the EMLL 1st Anniversary Show, starting the annual tradition of the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Anniversary Shows that have been held each year ever since, most commonly in September. Over the years the anniversary show would become the biggest show of the year for CMLL, akin to the Super Bowl for the National Football League (NFL) or WWE's WrestleMania event. The first anniversary show was held in Arena Modelo, which Lutteroth had bought after starting EMLL. In 1942‚Äì43 Lutteroth financed the construction of Arena Coliseo, which opened in April 1943. The EMLL 10th Anniversary Show was the first of the anniversary shows to be held in Arena Coliseo. In 1956 Lutteroth had Arena M√©xico built in the location of the original Arena Modelo, making Arena M√©xico the main venue of EMLL from that point on. Starting with the EMLL 23rd Anniversary Show, all anniversary shows except for the EMLL 46th Anniversary Show have been held in the arena that would become known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". On occasion EMLL held more than one show labelled as their \\"Anniversary\\" show, such as two 33rd Anniversary Shows in 1966. Over time the anniversary show series became the oldest, longest-running annual professional wrestling show. In comparison, WWE's WrestleMania is only the fourth oldest still promoted show (after CMLL's Arena Coliseo Anniversary Show and Arena M√©xico anniversary shows). EMLL was supposed to hold the EMLL 52nd Anniversary Show on September 20, 1985 but Mexico City was hit by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. EMLL canceled the event both because of the general devastation but also over fears that Arena M√©xico might not be structurally sound after the earthquake. When Jim Crockett Promotions was bought by Ted Turner in 1988 EMLL became the oldest still active promotion in the world. In 1991 EMLL was rebranded as \\"Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\\" and thus held the CMLL 59th Anniversary Show, the first under the new name, on September 18, 1992. Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, replacing their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. The 2016 show will commemorate the 83rd anniversary of CMLL. On July 29 CMLL announced that the 83rd Anniversary would take place on September 2, but did not announce any matches at that point in time. They did suggest several potential featured matches, hinting at matches between √öltimo Guerrero and Volador Jr., Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. and Guerrero Maya Jr. for the CMLL World Middleweight Championship, Rey Bucanero and S√∫per Crazy potentially facing off in a Lucha de Apuestas , or \\"bet match\\", and finally highlighting the ongoing storyline between La M√°scara and the Mu√±oz family (Rush, M√≠stico, Dr√°gon Lee and Comandante Pierroth) that could also end with a Lucha de Apuestas match. The CMLL 83rd Anniversary Show was one of three major shows held within a week of each other, produced by the three biggest lucha libre promotions in Mexico, CMLL, AAA and International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG). The first major show will be AAA's Tripleman√≠a XXIV, slated to take place on Sunday August 28 in Arena Ciudad de M√©xico ‚Äì AAA's biggest show of the year. CMLL's 83rd Anniversary Show will take place five days later on September 2 and finally the third largest Mexican lucha libre promotion, IWRG will hold IWRG La Hora de la Verdad in Arena Naucalpan two days later on September 4, headlines by a Lucha de Apuestas, mask vs. mask match, between Trauma I and Canis Lupus. =Storylines= alt=Masked wrestler La M√°scara posing on the ring ropes prior to a match. The 83rd Anniversary Show featured six professional wrestling matches scripted by CMLL with some wrestlers involved in scripted feuds. The wrestlers portrayed either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that play the part of the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they perform. During the summer of 2014 luchadors Rush, La M√°scara and La Sombra formed a group known as Los Ingobernables (Spanish for \\"The Unruly\\"), a trio that declared that they were neither rudo nor t√©cnico, but only loyal to Los Ingobernables. When Rush was injured the group brought in Marco Corleone to take his place as part of Los Ingobernables, when Rush returned Corleone would still team with Los Ingobernables on a regular basis. Through the rest of 2014 and into 2015 the group would main event several major CMLL shows, including Rush defeating Negro Casas in a Lucha de Apuestas match at the 2014 Juicio Final show, La Sombra being a finalst in the 2014 Universal Championship tournament, and La Sombra losing to Atlantis in the main event of the CMLL 82nd Anniversary Show. In late 2015 La Sombra left CMLL to work for WWE, reducing the group to three members in total. During the February 19 Super Viernes show, Rush, La M√°scara and Corleone faced Atlantis, Valiente and Rush and Corleone's former Bufete del Amor partner M√°ximo Sexy in a six-man tag team match. After failing to get along with his partners throughout the match, Corleone stood up for M√°ximo as he was being brutalized by Rush and La M√°scara, leading the two to turn on him and kick him out of Los Ingobernables. On March 18 at the 2016 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas, Rush defeated M√°ximo Sexy in a Hair vs. Hair Lucha de Apuestas with help from his father Pierroth. The anticipated feud between Rush and Marco Corleone never happened, instead, the remaining two original Ingobernales split up. On May 13, Los Ingobernables members were defeated by TGR (Rey Bucanero, Shocker and El Terrible) in a six-man tag team match, after which Rush and Pierroth turned on La M√°scara and attacked him. After being saved by TGR, La M√°scara announced he was quitting Los Ingobernables and challenged Rush to a Lucha de Apuestas match, although Rush did not respond at the time. In the following months La M√°scara started to feud with the entire Mu√±oz family, Rush, Pierroth and Rush's brothers M√≠stico and Dr√°gon Lee. The various Mu√±oz family members challenged La M√°scara to put his mask on the line against them, but each time he turned them down. On July 15, 2016 La M√°scara and Dr√°gon Lee faced off in the final moments of the 2016 Leyenda de Plata tournament. Rush entered the ring during the match, attacking La M√°scara to cause a disqualification loss for his younger brother. After the Leyenda de Plata tournament the feud began to focus on La M√°scara and Dr√°gon Lee more so than the original issues between La M√°scara and Rush. After Dr√°gon Lee finally managed to defeat La M√°scara he repeated his Lucha de Apuestas challenge, with La M√°scara finally accepting the challenge. CMLL held a press conference on August 10, announcing the full anniversary show, including Dr√°gon Lee facing La M√°scara in the main event with their masks on the line. With the announcement CMLL also confirmed that Dr√°gon Lee, at the age of 21, would be the youngest wrestler to ever compete in a Lucha de Apuestas match at an anniversary show. Super Crazy, facing off against Rey Bucanero in a Lucha de Apuestas match where both wrestlers put their hair on the line. The issues between Rey Bucanero and S√∫per Crazy spun out of a feud between S√∫per Crazy and El Felino that took place in Lucha Libre Elite, a promotion closely related with CMLL. S√∫per Crazy and Felino faced off in the first ever Lucha de Apuestas match in Lucha Libre Elite on February 28, 2016. S√∫per Crazy won the match, forcing El Felino to have all his hair shaved off. Over the summer of 2016 CMLL regular Rey Bucanero voiced his displeasure with what he considered \\"S√∫per Crazy's bragging\\" about the Apuesta win. On the July 15 S√∫per Crazy made his return to CMLL after not working for the company directly for in 12 years. S√∫per Crazy, M√°ximo Sexy and Valiente defeated Rey Bucanero, El Terrible and Vangelis as the \\"war of words\\" turned physical in the ring. The following week S√∫per Crazy teamed up with Lucha Libre Elite representatives Golden Magic and Sharlie Rockstar to defeat Bucanero and CMLL representatives El Terrible and Shocker. Afterwards Luchas de Apuestas challenges were made but nothing was officially agreed to. The following week S√∫per Crazy's team won once again, frustrating Bucanero even further. On August 10 CMLL confirmed that the match between the two would be the second Lucha de Apuestas match on the 83rd Anniversary Show. Event The opening match of the 83rd Anniversary Show was a best two-out-of-three falls six-woman \\"Lucha Libre rules\\" tag team match between the tecnica trio of Lluvia, Marcela and Princesa Sugehit and the ruda team of La Amapola, Dalys la Caribe√±a and Zeuxis. The first fall was won by the tecnica team when Princesa Sugehit forced La Amapola to submit to an arm bar. The ruda team evened the falls when La Amapola pinned Princesa Sugehit after executing a Devil's Wings (Lifting double underhook facebuster). During the third fall Lluvia appeares to be injured, although it was unclear if it was a legitimate injury or part of the script. In the end Daly pinned Marcela to win the third and final fall. For the second match regular tag team partners Marco Corleone and M√°ximo Sexy were teamed up with Stuka Jr. to face two-thirds of Los Hijos del Infierno (\\"The Sons of the Inferno\\"; Ephesto and Mephisto) were teamed up with Shocker. The first fall lasted 5 minutes and 18 seconds before Ephesto pinned Stuka Jr. The second fall lasted around half the time of the first fall, 2:48 in total, before Marco Corleone pinned Shocker after leaping from the ramp into the ring to hit Shocker. In the break between the second and third fall the two factions attack each other, with Mephisto ending up getting his mask pulled off. The third fall lasted 3 minutes and 43 second before M√°ximo Sexy pinned Mephisto. For the first of the Lucha de Apuestas matches Rey Bucanero took the first fall in less than a minute, with Super Crazy taking the second fall even faster than that to tie the match for the third and deciding fall. The third fall lasted longer than the first two falls combined, with neither wrestler gaining a distinctive advantage during the final fall. The \\"home town\\" representative Rey Bucanero finally managed to lock on a Cross armbar on Super Crazy, forcing him to submit moments later. After the match Super Crazy knelt in the middle of the ring as he had his hair shaved off. The fourth match marked the first time that Car√≠stico wrestled at a CMLL Anniversary Show since the CMLL 77th Anniversary Show as he teamed up with Atlantis and M√°scara Dorada to take on the group known as La Peste Negra (\\"The Black Plague\\"; B√°rbaro Cavernario, El Felino and Negro Casas). Car√≠stico lost the first fall in 5:12 when Negro Casas landed a hard kick in the corner and then pinned his long time rival. The second fall, at only 2:30, was the shortest of the match and saw the tecnico team even the score. In the third and decisive fall Atlantis forced Negro Casas to submit, taking the victory for his team with a third fall that lasted 4 minutes, 23 seconds. The semi-final match of the night marked the seventh time that The Sky Team (M√≠stico, Valiente and Volador Jr.) defended the CMLL World Trios Championship since winning it on February 13, 2015. Their opponents, Los Guerreros Lagunero (\\"The Warriors of the Lagoon\\"; Euforia, Gran Guerrero and √öltimo Guerrero) won the first fall of the match with a triple submission on the Sky Team members. 59 seconds into the second fall M√≠stico pinned one of Los Guerreros to even the score amidst loud boos from the crowd. In the end Volador Jr. pinned long running rival √öltimo Guerrero to retain their championship. For the main event Dragon Lee had his brother Rush accompany him to the ring and working as his corner man, while La M√°scara was accompanied by Shocker, who had played a peripheral role in the storyline prior to the anniversary show. During the first fall Rush helped his younger brother win the fall, pulling La M√°scara's leg while the referee had his back turned. In the second fall Rush's interference was noticed by the referee causing Dragon Lee to lose the second fall of the match. After the disqualification the referee tried to make Rush leave the arena, but at first he refused. It was not until Dragon Lee pleaded with Rush to leave, fearing he would lose the match all-together if Rush did not leave, that Rush left the arena. The third fall was the longest of the match with both Dragon Lee and La M√°scara executing several of their signature moves and dives out of the ring. At one point Dragon Lee rolled La M√°scara up with a la Casita hold, but Rush ran back in the arena and distracted the referee to prevent the pinfall. The third fall was decided when Dragon Lee managed to execute his finishing move, the Phoenix Plex, and then pinned La M√°scara. After the match La M√°scara removed his mask and stated that his real name was Felipe de Jes√∫s Alvarado, that he had been a wrestler for 16 years and that he was 34 years old. Following the unmasking Rush and La M√°scara seemed to put their differences aside, putting their past rivalry behind them. After the match Dragon Lee celebrated with his other brother M√≠stico, who were both boo'ed by the crowd despite both of them being t√©cnicos. Backstage after the show Rush and La M√°scara met up with the third original Ingobernable, La Sombra, who was in attendance for the show.

He used pumping equipment to explore abandoned mines that had been flooded, formed various mining companies, and found and exploited rich seams of silver. The town of Pachuca holds various public buildings and monuments financed by Rule. Life Francis Rule was born in 1835 in Camborne, Cornwall. His parents were John Rule and Anne Mayne. At the age of 17 he decided to seek his fortune abroad and sailed from Penzance to Mexico. He reached the port of Veracruz in 1854, aged 18, and went on to the Pachuca mining district of Hidalgo where he first worked as a guard on the carriages that took the minerals to Mexico City. Rule's first job paid him 14 centavos a day. He was one of many Cornish miners who emigrated from England to other countries as the Cornish industry declined, taking with them their knowledge of modern techniques. The mining industry in Mexico, which had once been strong, had stagnated. Miners who understood how to use pumping machinery to work flooded mines were in demand. Rule advanced in his profession, and became a mine captain, spending most of his spare time exploring abandoned mines in search of veins that might still be productive. In 1875 Rule joined with William Stoneman, also from Camborne, and Christopher Ludlow from Penzance to form the Cia. De Sta Gertrudis company to exploit the Santa Gertrudis Vein. After the company found ore that was rich in silver, shares shot up from $80 to $5,000. The company imported a Harvey & Co. pumping engine and steam hoist from Cornwall in 1879, making it possible to mine down to . In 1890 the company bought a second pump to raise water from lower levels to the first pump. Rule was made manager and a board member of the Santa Gertrudis company in 1893. Santa Gertrudis, entirely managed by Cornishmen, was wildly successful. The mine returned profits of over $1 million in 1903. It was sold in 1910 for more than $9 million, an immense sum at the time. Monumental Clock of Pachuca Rule took the Spanish form of his name, Francisco Rule, and became extremely wealthy and very influential. He was known as \\"El Rey de la Plata\\" (the Silver King). Mining shares could rise or fall when he gave an opinion. The list of mines and companies Rule became involved with is impressive. He was the last Cornish administrator of Real del Monte. Rule was also involved in the Maravillas Anexas Mining Company, which extracted gold, silver, lead and zinc, and the Santa Ana Mine. He bought the La Blanca y Anexas concession in 1876, and made a major strike there in 1903. In 1896 Rule inaugurated a huge French Renaissance style house on Plaza General Pedro Maria Anaya in Pachuca, the Casa Rule. He entertained notables there at lavish meals, including Porfirio D√≠az, President of Mexico. He also owned a house in Mexico City, eight haciendas in Hidalgo and Quer√©taro, a special railway coach, the Hotel de los Ba√±os, the Gran Hotel Grenfell, the Rule Bank and many other properties. Rule married Mary Hoskings on 17 December 1864 at the British Consulate in Mexico City.Royal Cornwall Gazette, 17 Feb 1865. They had nine children (one died in infancy). Mary died on 11 April 1910 and is buried in the British Cemetery of Real del Monte. After Mary's death there were family squabbles over possession of the Casa Rule. Francisco Rule moved to Mexico City, where he married Mar√≠a Cristina C√°rdenas y S√°nchez Hidalgo, with whom he had another six children. After the chaos of the Mexican Revolution of 1911 the Cornish community in Pachuca shrank. Rule visited Cornwall in 1912, where he told a local paper he was \\"British to the backbone\\". When the Governor of Hidalgo told him he could not fly a Union Jack from his bank, he built a parapet on the building with the flag in open masonry. Francisco Rule died of pneumonia on 24 June 1925 at the age of 88. He is buried in the Spanish Pantheon of Mexico City. Casa Rule Casa Rule Rule used the ground floor of the Casa Rule for the offices of his mining businesses. There were windows on the Calle Morelos through which miners were given their pay. He lived on the second floor with his first wife, Mary Hoskin, and their eight children, Lucretia Ann, William Mayne, Frances Mary, John Charles, Frances Henry, Julia Alice, Lillian Bessie and Richard. The third floor held the servants' quarters. The roof was originally covered with imported slate. The mansion was decorated in the finest European style, with fine wood and velvet furniture, lamps, mirrors, curtains, gold objects, ivory, porcelain and fireplaces with inlaid Carrara marble. Above the fireplace were the flags of Mexico and Britain, showing his love for both countries. A large dining room could hold 40 people. Rule gave the Casa Rule to the State of Hidalgo when he retired. During the revolution seven state governors stood on the balcony of the Casa Rule to call for independence. The municipal government moved to the house in 1923. After Rule's death in 1925 there were legal arguments over ownership of the Casa Rule, which his widow Cristina C√°rdenas claimed for her six children. In 1944 Governor Jos√© Lugo Guerrero bought the house for 65,000 pesos as the seat of executive power. The \\"Casa Rule\\" is now the Pachuca Municipal Palace. The 2-story house surrounds a central courtyard, and has a European style. The entrance shows neo-classical influences, with pilasters supporting an entablature with a pediment, cornices and corbels. One of the leaded stained glass windows is in the office of the general secretary of the presidency, on the second floor, with a circular design of flowers and plant motifs. At the top it has the initials \\"FR\\" and the year 1896. Legacy In addition to the Casa Rule, Rule financed construction of the Methodist Church in Pachuca, which was still standing in 2012. He helped finance the Reloj Monumental, a large clock in Pachuca designed in Spanish Baroque style that has a mechanism and chimes that imitate Big Ben of London. The mechanism of the clock was Rule's gift to the city. The clock tower in French Neoclassical style was presented in 1910 on the centenary of Mexico's independence. In 2008 the mayor of Camborne visited Pachuca where she signed a friendship agreement between the two towns in the Pachuca town hall, Rule's former home.

With financial backing from Charles Gardiner, Joseph Wiggins ‚Äì an experienced sea captain who had already twice sailed to the north of Russia, once entering the Kara Sea ‚Äì purchased The Thames, a 120-ton screw steamer, with the intent of surveying the Gulf of Ob and the Yenisei River and returning with profitable cargo. The Thames left Vard√∏ in Norway on 26 July 1876. The ship entered the Yenisei River and reached the Kureika River on 18 October, too late to return home, so Wiggins secured the ship for the winter and traveled overland back to Britain. The Thames and its crew wintered 1876‚Äì1877 on the Yenisei, and Wiggins returned to her at the end of April 1877. But she was frozen to the bottom and suffered damage on being freed; headed downriver, she then ran aground on 3 July 1877. Despite the crew's effort, the ship could not be saved, and she was sold for scrap (her main value being her boilers). The crew refused Wiggins's proffered schooner as unsafe and returned with him to Yeniseysk and thence home overland. In 2016, the wreck of The Thames was found in the Yenisei River by Nikolay Karelin and Alexander Goncharov, researchers from Siberian State Aerospace University sponsored by the Russian Geographical Society and the Russian Fund for the Humanities.

The UDPF was created in July 1994. The law was amended in 2004 to create an independent agency, separate from the Bank of Uganda. Location The headquarters of UDPF are within the premises of the Bank of Uganda (BoU) at 37-45 Kampala Road, in Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. The coordinates of the UDPF headquarters are 00¬∞18'50.0\\"N, 32¬∞34'47.0\\"E (Latitude:0.313903; Longitude:32.579711). Overview As of 31 December 2015, the BoU administered the UDPF and held UGX:312.8 billion belonging to UDPF. The bank held another UGX:9.6 billion belonging to the Uganda Microfinance Deposit Protection Fund (UMDPF), which the bank also administered. Legislation passed in 2016 provided for the merging of the UDPF and the UMDPF, with the new agency being separate from the BoU. Those changes had not yet been implemented as of August 2016. The World Bank is assisting with the process of separating the functions of the new agency from those of the BoU. Operations The UDPF is funded by premiums charged to every licensed deposit-accepting financial institution in the country. Each account is protected up to UGX:10 million. The law provides for all depositors to be paid within 90 days of a bank failure and that the failing institution must be sold by auctioning its assets within six months of its seizure by the BoU. If the BoU determines that the failed institution will fetch a better economic return if sold as a whole, then it will re-open under new ownership and management, provided the new owners and managers meet the approval of the BoU. In September 2019, Uganda's Finance Ministry increased the amount of protected deposits from UShs3 million (US$830) to UShs10 million (US$2,760). As of that date, the fund covered deposits in 34 contributing financial institutions, including 24 commercial banks, 5 credit institutions and 5 micro finance deposit-taking institutions. History Following the collapse of Teefe Bank in 1993, the BoU lost money when it was forced to reimburse depositors from its own coffers. In July 1994, the BoU established the a fund as a department of the bank, with three objectives: * protect small depositors from losing their savings if and when banks failed * maintain the stability of Uganda's financial sector and payments system * enhance public confidence in the banking system and the financial sector of the country. The 2004 Financial Institutions Act provided for the formation of the UDPF. In 2003, the UMDPF was created to protect depositors in deposit-taking microfinance institutions in 2003.

Controversy Some would say Ammons left Widener with a cloud over her head following her sanction of Professor Lawrence Connell who used Ammons in his class hypotheticals. Ammons sanctioned Connell calling him a \\"racist\\" and a \\"sexist\\" and requiring him to undergo a psychological evaluation before being allowed to return to school. A faculty hearing panel subsequently cleared Connell to return. Ammons insisted Connell complete the psychological evaluation and not return to school until he apologized to the students who brought the original complaint and was cleared by professionals to return to work. Widener accepted Ammons suggestions in their entirety. Connell subsequently sued Widener and settled with the school for an undisclosed amount in 2012.\\"Widener law professor settles lawsuit with school\\" The National Jurist, Feb. 8, 2012.

The organization's interest concerns women's liberation, equality and social justice in Nigeria. WIN is different from early women's groups in Nigeria because it affirms the belief that women's rights cannot be secured without addressing the broader issue of human rights (for both men and women) in an oppressive society. At its inception, the organization had male members. WIN's feminist and militant publications and activities were notable in the 1980s and 1990s but in recent times, the activities of the organization have been more moderate. History The movement to form Women in Nigeria evolved out of a study group of university sociology and political science lecturers at ABU. The study focused on the life of women in Nigeria. As the ideas from other scholars and lecturers from various universities were added, the group began to grow. In 1982, the First Annual Women in Nigeria Conference was held in Zaria. It included presentations by Ayesha Iman, Bene Madunagu, Bilkisu Yusuf, Renee Pittin, Molara Ogundipe-Leslie and Therese Nweke.Douglas, C. A. (1987, Nov 30). Women in nigeria today. Off our Backs, 17, 18. Retrieved from Proquest WIN was formally launched thereafter, with attendees of the initial conference pledging to lend support. The primary mission of WIN is to bring awareness and change regarding the widespread oppression and exploitation of women in Nigeria.\\"Foundation for Women's Health, Research & Development.\\" Review of African Political Economy, no. 27/28 (1983): 139-43. Many of the participants of the first conference became WIN members. WIN seeks equality for men and women who are oppressed in Nigeria, but that women are particularly exploited. WIN linked oppression of women to the overall oppression witnessed by citizens of the society especially the poor and in the process introduced class and gender dynamics in the struggle for women's emancipation. Though it is a women's right organization, WIN also fights for social and economic justice. At inception, male members constituted 30% of members but over the years, the active participation of male members declined. Activities =Financing= The organization generates funding from grants provided by donors such as the Heinrich Boll Foundation and from membership dues. =1980s:Research and documentation= Most pioneer members of WIN had academic backgrounds which influenced some of its goals. A primary aim of WIN is the collection of data through research of the conditions of women in the country. The organization ended up publishing books and papers about its findings. Its first major book was Women in Nigeria published in 1985. Since then WIN has published other papers including Women in Nigeria-The First Ten years (1993), Child Abuse (1992) and Women and Violence:Breaking the Silence.Madunagu, Bene E. \\"The Nigerian Feminist Movement: Lessons from \\"Women in Nigeria\\", WIN.\\" Review of African Political Economy 35, no. 118 (2008): 666-72. Pp. 667-668 WIN also published a newsletter and held annual conferences in the 1980s. =1990s-Present= In 1991, WIN received a grant from the Heinrich Boll Foundation to initiate a credit and political empowerment scheme for rural women. The empowerment program granted loans to specific women's groups in five states of the federation. In addition to the loans, it engaged the local women organizations in seminars about rights, democracy and educational programs on self-reliance. In 1993, some members of WIN wrote a communique condemning the annulment of the presidential election. The organization also collaborated with Campaign for Democracy pressing for the release of the election results. WIN's activities have been tame since the late 1990s. The organization depends on a volunteer base for staffing and external donors for financial support. At one of its annual conventions which also the venue to elect a new leader, the election split the organization into two factions. But in time, the leaders of those factions and many of their supporters took on employment in other NGOs, or outside the country further weakening the organization. In addition, prior to the election, men, who were about two-thirds of its members, felt marginalized by the activities of the organization.

The Anglican Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham is a Church of England shrine church built in 1938 in Walsingham, Norfolk, England. Walsingham is the site of the reputed Marian apparitions to Richeldis de Faverches in 1061. The Virgin Mary is therefore venerated at the site with the title of Our Lady of Walsingham. History Richeldis de Faverches was an English noblewoman who is credited with establishing the original shrine to Our Lady at Walsingham. Before leaving to join the Second Crusade, her son and heir, Lord Geoffrey de Faverches left the Holy House and its grounds to his chaplain, Edwin, to establish a religious house to care for the chapel of Our Lady of Walsingham. The Priory passed into the care of Augustinian Canons somewhere between 1146 and 1174.\\"The Story so far\\", The Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham As travelling abroad became more difficult during the time of the Crusades, Walsingham became a place of pilgrimage, ranking alongside Jerusalem, Rome and Santiago da Compostella,\\"History of Walsingham\\", Walsingham Village, Norfolk, England until it was destroyed by Henry VIII in 1538.

From the first night that the statue was placed there, people gathered around it to pray, asking Mary to join her prayers with theirs. Throughout the 1920s the trickle of pilgrims became a flood of large numbers for whom, eventually, the Pilgrim Hospice was opened (a hospice is the name of a place of hospitality for pilgrims) and, in 1931, a new Holy House encased in a small pilgrimage church was dedicated and the statue translated there with great solemnity.\\"ACC Parishes in US and UK celebrate Walsingham Pilgrimage\\", Anglican Catholic News, June 15, 2015 In 1938 that church was enlarged to form the Anglican Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham.

Enid Chadwick contributed to the artwork in the shrine. Present day The shrine church was substantially extended in the 1960s. The church has a holy well known for its healing properties; pilgrims receiving water from the holy well is accompanied by the laying on of hands and anointing. Water from the well is often taken home by the faithful and distributed to their family, friends and parishioners. The grounds include the shrine church, gardens, several chapels, a refectory, a caf√©, a shrine shop, a visitors‚Äô centre, the Pilgrim Hall, an orangery, the College (home to priests-associate when in residence), and a large number of different residential blocks for the accommodation of resident pilgrims. Associated groups Beyond the staff (who include a resident community, and external day staff) a number of groups are officially associated with the life of the shrine. These include: * The Association of Priests Associate of the Holy House, founded in 1931, an association of priests who undertake to offer Mass for the shrine and who enjoy certain privileges at the shrine; the Superior General of the Association is, ex officio, the Priest Administrator of the Shrine; since December 2011 full membership has also been available to deacons, as Deacons Associate of the Holy House; it has around 2,000 members. Membership is open to male priests of any Church in communion with the See of Canterbury, and to both male and female deacons of those churches.

Toronto Star, August 9, 2016. Joy and Wan are also co-creators and writers for the series. Following its release in 2016, the series received mixed reviews. In 2018, Omni Television announced it had commissioned a second season.. It premiered on August 4, 2018. On February 8, 2019, the second season was nominated for Best Comedy Series by the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television.

Tired of auditioning for the same stereotypical Asian roles, they discussed creating their own work together. Joy and Wan stated that their show was originally rejected at an unnamed Canadian pitch contest. It later went on to win Best Television Pitch at NexTV L.A. in 2013, before being picked up for development with Rogers. Joy wrote the original pilot script,http://films.blanksuniverse.ca/2014/04/reelworld-film- festival-2014-identity.html with Wan directing alongside Joseph O'Brien.http://www.vmacch.ca/alpha/archives/documents/film2014.pdf The original spec pilot screened at Toronto's Reelworld Film Festival in 2014, as well as Toronto's Asian Heritage Month. Reception Prior to the release of the show, Tony Wong of the Toronto Star published an article declaring Second Jen \\"groundbreaking\\" in its depiction of two female Asian leads \\"as if we had already arrived in a post-racial world.\\" Brad Oswald of the Winnipeg Free Press praised Second Jen, calling it \\"Sharp, funny, slightly cheeky and smartly in tune with this country‚Äôs diverse demographic mix.\\" Oswald wrote that \\"while it‚Äôs fair to say that attitude plays a bit part in this likable series‚Äô early success, there are actually several elements that make Second Jen a must-see production.\\" Oswald also praised the strength of the cast noting that Joy and Wan are particularly \\"likeable and relatable\\" in the lead roles of Jen and Mo. Toronto Life's Will Sloan complimented the show's light- hearted tone. He noted that, while \\"not necessarily laugh out loud funny,\\" Second Jen is a pleasant watch, with strong moments carried by \\"the likability of its goofy cast, and the familiar streets, bars and houses of its Little Italy setting.\\" Sloan also praised Joy and Wan's performances, calling them breakout stars. Brad Wheeler of The Globe and Mail hailed the show as \\"A Laverne & Shirley for the Digital Age\\" as it stars \\"two sparky second- generation Asian-Canadian millennial women coming of age in an era so economically challenging that Laverne and Shirley would be crying in their beers instead of merrily goofing off at the bottling plant.\\" In contrast, John Doyle, also of The Globe and Mail, panned the show, calling it \\"light, slight, silly and only occasionally outright funny [...] Second Jen is notable for having two female Asian lead characters but it is not notable, nor funny, as a comedy.\\" The show was also viewed un-favourably by Quebecoise TV blog, Lady Teruki. The website noted its disappointment that despite the two leads being likeable and charming, and good ideas bubbling under the surface, Second Jen had clearly suffered from broadening, dated ideas, and an obvious lack of trust in its creators.

Macon was founded in 1823 in Bibb County on the bank of the Ocmulgee River. Many buildings reflect the 19th-century Greek Revival and Victorian styles of architecture. The district has commercial, government, educational, and residential buildings. The majority of their architectural features have been preserved. A total of 1047 buildings, two structures, and one object contribute to the Macon Historical District. Several of the contributing properties are separately listed on the NRHP. History What is now downtown is part of the original 1823 plan of James Webb. In 1836 Macon chartered the first college in the world to grant degrees only to women - originally named Georgia Female College, it is now called Wesleyan College. The original building is located on what is now College Street. Mercer University moved to the area in 1871. The original residential area is known as \\"College Hill\\". While many buildings were constructed after the American Civil War, the district includes one of the largest collections of antebellum Greek Revival architecture in the U.S. These still exist because William T.

In the November Uprising of 1830‚Äì31 Epstein took the part of his oppressed countrymen, and was an officer in the insurrectionary army; but later he seems to have completely regained the favor of the Russian government, as is evidenced by his appointment as banker of the treasury commission of the Kingdom of Poland in 1838.

The elevated mood is significant and is known as mania or hypomania, depending on its severity, or whether symptoms of psychosis are present. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard to the consequences. The need for sleep is usually reduced during manic phases. During periods of depression, there may be crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others. The risk of suicide among those with the illness is high at greater than 6 percent over 20 years, while self-harm occurs in 30‚Äì40 percent. Other mental health issues such as anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are commonly associated. Also known as manic depression.  What type of thing is bipolar disorder?  alt=A graph showing mood lability. A neurotypical experiences a variety that never reaches hypomania or depression. Bipolar type 1 involves a manic episode.

He previously served as the County Attorney for Maricopa County, Arizona from 2010 to 2019. Early life Montgomery is a West Point graduate and a Gulf War veteran. He graduated from the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law in 2001. Career highlights During Montgomery's tenure, the county attorney's office gained national recognition for its Restitution Specialist and Sex Assault Backlog programs. From 2010-2015, under Montgomery, Maricopa County sought a higher ratio of death sentences than 99.5 percent of counties in the United States. Montgomery has called for formal written protocols to address use of force incidents and serves as the Arizona State Director for the National District Attorneys Association. In August 2019, attorneys for Jodi Arias filed an ethics complaint against Montgomery, claiming he covered up misconduct and harassment by the lead prosecutor on the case. =Political views= In 2015, Montgomery refused to follow a state law and provide legal assistance for a gay couple who were adopting, even after a federal judge ruled that Arizona‚Äôs law banning same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. Montgomery later lobbied the state legislature to repeal the statute requiring that adopting couples receive free legal help, but Governor Ducey vetoed the legislation. Montgomery has been a leading opponent of cannabis reform efforts in the state of Arizona. He has made a number of controversial comments on the subject, including telling a military veteran who spoke in support of legalization: \\"I have no respect for you... because you're an enemy.\\" He has also sought to overturn the state's medical cannabis law that was approved by voters in 2010. Montgomery has lobbied against criminal justice and sentencing reform, including a 2017 bill that reformed the state's civil asset forfeiture policies. Elections =Arizona Attorney General= Montgomery at an event in Phoenix, Arizona. In 2006, Montgomery ran for Arizona Attorney General, losing to incumbent Terry Goddard. =Maricopa County Attorney= In the 2010 special election to replace Andrew Thomas who resigned to run for Arizona Attorney General, Montgomery defeated interim county attorney Rick Romley in the Republican Primary. Montgomery went on to defeat Libertarian Michael Kielsky in the general election. Montgomery won election to a full term in 2012 in a rematch against Kielsky. He won re-election again in 2016 against Democrat Diego Rodriguez. =Arizona Supreme Court appointment= In March 2019, Montgomery applied for an appointment to a vacancy in the Arizona Supreme Court. The commission did not pass Montgomery's name to the governor, which is required for a judicial apportionment, citing \\"concerns over the pattern of misconduct at the Maricopa County Attorney's Office and a lack of relevant professional experience\\". In June 2019, Montgomery applied for a second vacancy on the Arizona Supreme Court. After Governor Doug Ducey replaced several members of the state judicial nominating commission, Montgomery's name was sent to the governor, who selected him for the supreme court seat on September 4, 2019.

He ruled the Jejakabhukti region (Bundelkhand in present-day Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh). Devavarman was born to the Chandela ruler Vijayapala and his queen Bhuvanadevi. His titles included the usual Chandela titles such as Kalanjaradhipati (\\"Lord of Kalanjara\\") and Parama-bhattaraka Maharajadhiraja Parameshvara. He also called himself Parama-Maheshvara, which indicates that he was a Shaivite. Devavarman is known only from the two inscriptions issued by him: the 1051 CE Nanyaura inscription, and the 1052 CE Charkhari inscription. According to these inscriptions, he succeeded Vijayapala. The other Chandela records omit his name, and mention his brother Kirttivarman as the next king after Vijayapala. Such omissions suggest the possibility of a dynastic conflict, but there is no definitive evidence on this matter. Another possible reason for these omissions might have been the subjugation of the Chandelas by the Kalachuris of Tripuri during his reign. The allegorical play Prabodha-Chandrodaya, composed by Chandela court scholar Krishna Misra, suggests that the Kalachuri king de-throned the Chandela king. Another literary work ‚Äî Vikramanka-Deva-Charita by Bilhana ‚Äî states that the Kalachuri king Lakshmi-Karna was like the lord of death to the lord of Kalanjara. The later Chandela inscriptions credit Devavarman's successor Kirttivarman with resurrecting the Chandela power.

Knut Hamsun, Novelist: A Critical Assessment. New York: Peter Lang, p. 374. The novel portrays the wayfarers August and Edevart's experiences while they travel around in Norway for more or less random work. The trilogy continues with August three years later, and concludes with The Road Leads On in 1933. The events in Wayfarers take place between 1864 and the 1870s. The entire trilogy describes the conflict between a traditional subsistence economy and a modern commercial and industrial society, as it emerged in Norway in the second half of the 1800s and the early 1900s. August is the main character that ties the three novels together. He is introduced in Wayfarers in the following manner: ::\\"A wandering young man came back to the village, August by name, an orphan. He was in fact from another district, but he grew up here; now among other things he had been a sailor-boy for some years and had visited many countries, and there were miracles and wonders that he could tell about his life.\\"Hamsun, Knut. 2003.

He was the founder of Gai pied, the first mainstream gay magazine in France. He was a campaigner for Holocaust remembrance of homosexual victims. He was the author of several books about homosexuality. Early life Jean Le Bitoux was born on 16 August 1948 in Bordeaux, France. His father was an admiral. Career Le Bitoux worked as a substitute music teacher. Le Bitoux founded the Front homosexuel d'action r√©volutionnaire (FHAR) in Nice in the 1970s. By 1978, he ran for the National Assembly as a \\"homosexual candidate\\" alongside Guy Hocquenghem; they lost the election. In 1979, Le Bitoux founded Gai pied, the first long-running commercially published gay magazine in France. Its name, coined by philosopher Michel Foucault, literally means \\"gay foot,\\" but constitutes a multilayered pun in French: The two words pronounced together sound like \\"gu√™pier\\" (hornet's nest), while the word \\"foot\\" also evokes a \\"kick in the ass\\" (\\"un pied au cul\\") and sexual pleasure (\\"prendre son pied,\\" equivalent to \\"to get off\\"). Le Bitoux resigned from the publication in 1983 due to the magazine's increasingly consumerist orientation. Le Bitoux joined AIDES, an HIV/AIDS awareness non-profit organization, in 1985. He co-wrote many HIV prevention documents. He was the editor-in-chief of the Journal du Sida, a publication about HIV/AIDS. In 1989, Le Bitoux founded the M√©morial de la D√©portation Homosexuelle, a nonprofit organization for the remembrance of homosexual victims of Nazi Germany9. Initially, the organization was met with homophobia from some Holocaust survivors, who wrongly feared they were being smeared. In 1994, Le Bitoux co-authored the memoir of Pierre Seel, a French homosexual who was deported by the Nazis for being gay. By the 1990s, Le Bitoux argued that anti-homosexual legislation in France harked back to laws devised by Fran√ßois Darlan of the Vichy government to end same-sex prostitution in 1942, not Nazi Germany. However, Marc Boninchi, a Law professor at the University of Lyon, has argued that the first instance of legal discrimination dates back to prosecutor Charles Dubost's 1941 recommendations. Meanwhile, Le Bitoux's 2002 Les oubli√©s de la m√©moire led President Jacques Chirac to acknowledge the homosexual victims of persecution under the Nazi Regime. Le Bitoux was a co- founder of the Centre LGBT Paris-√éle-de-France in 1991. Personal life Le Bitoux was openly gay, and was rejected by his family for being gay. Drawn to Maoism in his early twenties, he also left due to homophobia. He contracted HIV/AIDS in the early 1980s. Death Le Bitoux died on 21 April 2010 in Paris, France. A memorial service conducted by Patrick Bloche was held in his honor at the city hall of the 11th arrondissement of Paris, with a performance by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. He was buried at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery.

In August 2017, Costa was loaned by Primeira Liga side Portimonense S.C. to Famalic√£o. In October/November of that year, he netted three consecutive braces in the league in as many wins. In January 2018, Costa had everything arranged to join FC Porto B. However, after it was discovered that he had been registered by Varzim five days prior to signing with Portimonense ‚Äì thus representing three clubs in the same season ‚Äì the move was declared void. Costa made his debut in the Portuguese top flight on 31 March 2018, coming on as a 75th-minute substitute in a 4‚Äì3 home victory over Moreirense FC. In July 2018, he was finally made a part of Porto B's setup. On 6 July 2019, Costa moved abroad for the first time in his career after agreeing to a one-year loan deal with AD Alcorc√≥n in the Spanish Segunda Divisi√≥n. He continued in the country in September 2020, signing a two-year contract with Deportivo de La Coru√±a who had just been relegated from the same league; Porto remained entitled to 50% of any future transfer.

He was born to a nobleman and served as a doctor in Ascoli Piceno before he was pressured into marriage in 1451 - the couple annulled their marriage after both entered the religious life. Father Marco is best known for establishing pawnshops for the poor across various Italian cities and for being a preacher of love. His beatification received ratification on 20 September 1839 after Pope Gregory XVI confirmed the late priest's local 'cultus' - or a spontaneous and enduring popular devotion on the part of the faithful. His feast is celebrated on 20 March rather than his death date of 19 March due to it being the feast of Saint Joseph. Life Tabula della salute, 1494 Libro dei comandamenti di Dio, 1494 Marco da Montegallo was born in 1425 in Montegallo - in the province of Ascoli Piceno - to a nobleman from the Marches of Ancona. Marco studied under the humanist Enoch d'Ascoli and later studied at universities in both Perugia and Bologna where he received his doctorate in both law and medicine. From 1448 he worked as a doctor in his home province. He married Chiara de Tibaldeschi in 1451 - with great reluctance - after his father pressured him to do so but his father later died in 1452 which prompted the couple to evaluate their marriage to discuss their true life callings. The pair later annulled their marriage and pursued their separate vocations into the Franciscans with him becoming a member of the Order of Friars Minor and she joining the Poor Clares as a nun. He joined the order in their branch in the convent of Santa Maria in Valle in Gallo at Fabriano and commenced his novitiate in 1452 - and concluded it in 1453 - at the convent of l'Eremita Valdisasso near Fabriano. Marco was ordained to the priesthood sometime in the 1450s and was at once made the superior of Santa Maria de San Severino and he held that position from 1454 to 1455. It was there that a voice said to him: \\"Go brother Marco and preach about love\\". He - alongside Blessed Bernardine of Feltre - established a wide range of charitable pawnshops for the poor that became known as the \\"Monti di Piet√†\\". To help the poor with loans he founded the Monte di Credito su Pegno di Vicenza, a bank in Vicenza which was completed in around twelve months after he received funds to establish it and next to the Franciscan's house in that town other banks and hospitals were established. A friend of his founded one in Fabriano and Saint James of the Marches co-established another Monte di Piet√† in Perugia. Marco founded stores in Fano in 1471 and in Arcevia in 1483. He knew Blessed Domenico da Leonessa. He preached across various Italian cities and in 1494 in Florence published a book while issuing another edition in Siena in 1495 while preaching for Lent. The plague ravaged Camerino and he assured the people that it would cease if all the people repented from their sins and confessed in a move that prompted them all to flock to him and confess - this caused the plague epidemic to stop. In 1480 he became a promoter and collector of tithes for the crusade against the Ottoman Empire after Pope Sixtus IV appointed him to that position. The priest decided to fast in Lent in 1496 and in the middle of the Lenten season grew ill. On his deathbed he asked a companion to provide him with the sacraments for the final time and asked another to read him the words: \\"He bowed His head and gave up the ghost\\" at which point the ailing Marco died from his illness on 19 March 1496 in Vicenza. His remains were interred though later relocated in 1522 in the church of Saint Biagio but were later interred in a chapel in the church of San Giuliano in 1797. Beatification Bones in an urn in Vicenza. The ratification for the late Franciscan's local 'cultus' - or popular devotion - allowed for Pope Gregory XVI to issue a decree that conferred beatification on the late friar on 20 September 1839. His feast is not celebrated on the date of his death as is the norm but rather on 20 March because 19 March is the feast of Saint Joseph.

Early manuscripts of such compositions are a major focus of the website, which provides access to high- resolution digitized versions of many of these. Scholarship on manuscripts and versions of compositions is summarized on separate pages, with references to scholarly sources and editions. The database portal has been online since 2010.  History  In 2000, two years after Uwe Wolf had suggested the possibility of supporting the publication of the New Bach Edition (NBE) with digital media, a project named Bach Digital started as an initiative of the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart, but without direct involvement of the then editor of the NBE, the Johann Sebastian Bach Institute in G√∂ttingen. After four years the project remained unconvincing: it lagged behind technically and came to nothing, and its www.bachdigital.org web address went up for sale. The first steps towards a new project, with the same name, were taken that same year. The aim of making images of autographs and original manuscripts available via the internet was continued from the former project, but aiming in the new project at high-resolution scans, for which the Zoomify application was going to be used. The project would cooperate with the Bach Institute in G√∂ttingen. As that institute was going to cease operations (which eventually happened in 2006), however, the idea arose to merge the institute and the project. With the input of the G√∂ttingen institute, the website was now going to not only display high-resolution digital facsimiles but also offer detailed descriptions of manuscripts and compositions which were drawn from Der G√∂ttinger Bach-Katalog / Die Quellen der Bach-Werke (The G√∂ttingen catalogue / The Sources of Bach's works), developed in G√∂ttingen since 2001. Funding for the project by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft was secured in 2007. With Uwe Wolf as a leading designer, the development of the website began in 2008, and the database went online in 2010. At the time, around 40% of the 697 manuscripts of Bach's works held in libraries in Berlin, Dresden, Leipzig and Krakau (which account for about 90% of his works) were made available in digital form. The site not only provides accessibility to the distributed documents but also helps their preservation. Several international libraries made their documents available, including libraries in Europe and the U.S. Works from the period of c. 1700 to 1850, in manuscripts, copies and early prints, have been collected and presented in high-resolution digitized form. New research has been added continuously, for example on watermarks and copyists.  Partners  Bach Digital is a collaborative project of the Leipzig Bach Archive (together with the University Computer Centre of Leipzig University), Berlin State Library (SBB), Saxon State and University Library Dresden (SLUB) and (SUB Hamburg). Apart from the sponsoring by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, funding for access to international documents has been granted by the national since 2013. An input of technical know-how was provided through a partnership with IBM. Bach Digital is part of the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek and Europeana platforms. Internationally, contributions of information came from the British Library in London, the Library of Congress in Washington, Harvard University Library in Boston, and the music libraries of Yale University and the Juilliard School. Libraries also contributing have included the Frankfurt University Library, Bachhaus Eisenach, Universit√§tsbibliothek Johann Christian Senckenberg, W√ºrttembergische Landesbibliothek, , Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Heimatmuseum Saalfeld, Herzogin Anna Amalia Bibliothek, and Stiftelsen Musikkulturens Fraemjande in Stockholm. Content and structure The website was designed to serve Bach scholars, performers of his works, especially in historically informed performance, and interested lay people. Information collected with scientific scrutiny is freely available, not only for works by J. S. Bach but also those of members of his family (Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Johann Christian Bach) and works found in the Altbachisches Archiv. Bach Digital aims at making Bach research easily available, and uses an implementation of the MyCoRe platform to do so. Its content is licensed under Creative Commons as Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0). =Work pages= The website hosts separate pages for compositions: the static URLs for these pages start with \`http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_\` and end with an eight-digit number (the first four being leading zeros for works in the 1998 version of the BWV catalogue). Each of these numbers thus identifies a work, e.g.:\\"3.2 Datenstruktur\\", pp. 16ff. in Bach digital Dokumentation, version 5.5 (12 February 2019) at Leipzig University website. * No. 00000001 ‚Üí http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00000001 = BWV 1 * No. 00000632 ‚Üí http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00000632 = BWV 552 * No. 00001524 ‚Üí http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00001524 = BWV Anh. 213 Apart from later additions and corrections, these numbers follow the collation of BWV numbers, but with alternative versions of the same composition inserted immediately after the BWV number of the composition to which they belong, e.g.: * BWV 80 = Bach Digital Work (BDW) No. * BWV 80a = BDW * BWV 80b = BDW * BWV 81 = BDW An example of a later addition/correction: * BWV Anh. 71 ‚Üí renumbered to BWV 1128 ‚Üí new Bach Digital Work number beyond the one for BWV Anh. 213: BDW Start of the music in Johann Sebastian Bach's autograph score of the Christmas OratorioDigitized image of D-B Mus.ms.

Bach St 345  Reception  Writing when the Bach Digital website was in its last stages of development, shortly before going online, Johannes Kepper of Paderborn University thought it would not only satisfy lay visitors feeling adoration for Bach but also had a role for scholars, for instance those initiating new critical editions of his music. According to Kepper, however, Bach Digital is not to be seen as a published edition of the composer's work but rather a collection of annotated sources: in itself it is not a critical edition of Bach's music. He sees another possible use of the website: it allows interested readers to check the quality of published editions of Bach's music and assess editorial choices by comparing such editions with the original manuscripts, displayed in high resolution on the website. According to , writing in 2016, databases such as Bach Digital have largely replaced printed scholarship, such as the Critical Commentary volumes of the NBE, as the first point of entry for Bach scholars. An analysis of database usage in 2016 observed a total of 101,598 views, mainly from European countries, the U.S. and Japan but also from countries such as China, Brazil, Mexico, Vietnam and the Arabian Emirates. In the month of December, 32,537 views were counted, 896 of them for the autograph of Bach's Christmas Oratorio, the manuscript creating the most interest.

In 1935, elections were held for the Mayor of Wellington plus other local government positions including fifteen city councillors. The polling was conducted using the standard first-past-the-post electoral method. Background Incumbent mayor Thomas Hislop stood for a third-term, the first mayor to do so since Sir John Luke in 1915. His opponent was Bob Semple, a Labour councillor and MP for . During the campaign Semple received slanderous allegations of being an Atheist, which he denied stating \\"If the people of the world followed the philosophy of Jesus there would be no poverty...\\". For the second election in a row Labour won a majority of the vote, but could not win a majority of seats. However Labour did win one more seat than in 1933 and then went on to win a by-election soon after increase their representation further.

It is the 6Œ±-brominated, 4-oxygenated, and 17Œ±-methylated derivative of the androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Along with benorterone, cyproterone (and its C17Œ± acetate ester, cyproterone acetate), and flutamide, BOMT was among the earliest antiandrogens to be developed and extensively studied, although it is less well-documented in comparison to the others. BOMT has been investigated clinically in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, though development for this use did not continue. There was also interest in BOMT for the potential applications of acne, pattern hair loss, and possibly prostate cancer, but it was not developed for these indications either. BOMT is a selective competitive antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), although it is described as an \\"only relatively weak competitor.\\" The relative binding affinity of the drug for the androgen receptor is about 2.7% of that of metribolone. BOMT shows no androgenic, estrogenic, or progestogenic activity even at high doses, nor any inhibition of 5Œ±-reductase, though it has been reported to possess weak antigonadotropic effects. Due to its selectivity for and competitive inhibition of the AR, BOMT has been described as a pure or \\"true\\" antiandrogen, similarly to benorterone, cyproterone, and flutamide. Like other steroidal antiandrogens, BOMT may actually be a weak partial agonist of the AR, as it appears to have the potential for weak androgenic effects in specific situations. On the basis of animal research, BOMT does not appear to act as an AR antagonist in central nervous system tissues, and in relation to this, does not disinhibit the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis or increase testosterone levels.

The episode was written by series creators Jim Kouf and David Greenwalt, and was directed by Norberto Barba. Plot Opening quote: \\"But if I stand at the sick person's feet, he is mine.\\" 15 minutes before the ending of the last episode, Eric (James Frain) leaves his hotel room to meet with Baron (Reg E. Cathey). He doesn't know that he is being followed by Renard (Sasha Roiz), who follows him to the harbor. In the harbor, while trying to flee in Nick's Toyota Landcruiser, Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) gets the SUV stuck so that he, Rosalee (Bree Turner) and Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) are forced to flee on foot. Renard arrives later and while inspecting a container, is attacked by two zombies. Monroe, Rosalee and Juliette get on the top of a container to fight the zombies that are beginning to reach them. Juliette calls Hank (Russell Hornsby) to send help, prompting him to send Wu (Reggie Lee) and a unit to go to the area. The police help Monroe, Rosalee and Juliette to escape from the zombies while Renard kills his attackers using his Wesen form. Realizing the Baron is planning to take Nick (David Giuntoli) to Vienna on a private plane, Hank calls airport officers to stop the flight. However, the Baron uses his powers to spit on them, starting their transformation into zombies and flees. Renard, Hank, Monroe, Rosalee and Juliette get to the airport but they are too late as the plane already left and as the plane will cross international waters, there's no justification to stop the flight. In the plane, the Baron is celebrating when Nick begins to slam his coffin. He breaks free of his coffin and attacks the Baron and the pilots. This causes the plane to lose control and crash in the woods, killing the Baron and wounding the pilots. In Vienna, Stefania (Shohreh Aghdashloo) takes out Frau Pech's heart and seals it in a box. She then calls Adalind (Claire Coffee) to tell her that they will need Frau Pech's body parts in order to bring back her powers. They cut her feet, hands and eyes and then go to a field of poppies. In the field, Adalind digs, and buries the body parts and the heart in the earth. This causes the poppies around them to die and the powers of Hexenbiest are restored to Adalind, but she needs to collect all the dead poppies. In the spice shop, while working to find a cure, Juliette suggests using the Williamson ether synthesis to lock a gas in a jar so the zombies can go back to normality. Wu and the other police officers have put the zombies in a container. They are convinced to allow Juliette and Rosalee to throw the glass jars of gas into the container, which cures all the zombies. Meanwhile, Nick wanders off into the woods. He stumbles into a bar and grill, and begins to attack some of the customers while others flee. Hank receives a call about the plane crash and goes to the site with Renard, Monroe, Juliette and Rosalee. Learning of the incident in the bar, Renard, Hank, Monroe, Rosalee and Juliette head there to find Nick. Renard, Hank and Monroe enter the bar but Nick has left. Monroe then uses his ability to scent to find Nick's path. While Hank and Monroe look for Nick, Nick has found a house in the woods with a family entering while he stares at the family, seemingly planning to attack them.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade and wrote, \\"Instead, 'The Ungrateful Dead' repeats the final moments of last season's premiere and picks up seconds after, as the Portland police round up the Cracher-Mortel's zombified creations in a shipping container, and the rest of the gang searches for Nick before he can be flown away to Europe to be used as some kind of caged, anti-Wesen assassin by the royals.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"The moment that stands out the most with Nick was when he looks in the mirror. On some level he recognizes what he's doing and what he's become. I don't think he's completely in control, however, since he breaks the mirror pretty quickly. It's going to be a fun ride to see how Nick ends up and what actions he takes as a zombie.\\" References External links  Grimm (season 3) episodes 2013 American television episodes ","title":"The Ungrateful Dead"},{"id":"51298778","text":"Precious Cargo may refer to: * Precious Cargo (film), a 2016 Canadian action film directed by Max Adams * \\"Precious Cargo\\" (Star Trek: Enterprise), a 2002 episode of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: Enterprise * Precious Cargo, a 1990 album by High Tide * \\"Precious Cargo\\", a track on the 2009 film score Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen ‚Äì The Score Charlotte the wonder lab ","title":"Precious Cargo"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:R},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},P={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your ETHü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",P,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const L=d(B,[["render",I]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/47.md","filePath":"people/47.md"}'),H={name:"people/47.md"},G=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{W as __pageData,G as default};
