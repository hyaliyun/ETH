In 1869, the first Sisters of Mercy in Louisville arrived from their community in St. Louis to run a struggling Federal Marine Hospital. They began a teaching ministry. By 1872, they had established St. Catherine Academy, and in 1885, they conferred the first high school diplomas under the name of The Academy of Our Lady of Mercy. The high school program continued to grow until a new facility was needed. The Sisters opened a new Academy building at 1176 East Broadway in 1901, where it was to remain until 2007.Mercy Academy History Mercy Academy is in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville, and is currently located on a campus at 5801 Fegenbush Lane in Southeast Jefferson County near the Hurstbourne Lane Extension, with General Electric's Appliance Park complex on the opposite side of Fegenbush Lane, though hidden from direct view by a wooded buffer zone. Mercy was named a Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education in 2000. Mercy was the first all-girls school in the nation, and first school in Kentucky, to receive STEM certification in 2016 from AdvancED.

The building is named for Columbia alumnus Marcellus Hartley Dodge, who donated $300,000 for its construction shortly after his graduation. The building was meant as a memorial to his grandfather, Marcellus Hartley, the owner of Remington Arms, who died during Dodge's sophomore year and who bequeathed him the family fortune. Dodge hoped to create ‚Äúthe commencement of a true dormitory system\\" at Columbia. Construction began on Hartley Hall in 1904 and it opened in tandem with Livingston Hall in 1905, welcoming students with its lobby of marble and oak. 200 students were housed in corridor-style rooms of various sizes. Lounges provided opportunities for social events such as teas with professors, although there was not yet an undergraduate dining hall on campus. Rooms of the period cost $3.30 per week, or $129 for the academic year, which, although more expensive than a roominghouse, ultimately allowed even poor students to afford berth there. University President Nicholas Murray Butler, who presided over the hall's opening, noted that \\"in the interest of true democracy,\\" rooms were arranged to allow \\"the poorer student to live in the same building and the same entry with him who is better off, and so avoids the chasm between rich and poor living in separate buildings, of which there is so much complaint at Harvard.\\" Subsequently, the building became home, among others, to authors Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, who noted its cockroach problem.Kerouac, Jack, Vanity of Duluoz, p.66Kerouac, Jack, Visions of Cody, p.198 Overhauled during a 1980s renovation, the dorm is now organized into mostly two-story suites, where up to 15 students live in single and double rooms. The suites' common space includes kitchens, bathrooms and living/dining areas. Along with neighboring Wallach Hall, it is currently part of the Living and Learning Center (LLC), home to suite-style housing that intermingles all class levels and features interactive events designed to draw them together. An application process is required to obtain housing in either of the LLC dormitories. Hartley also houses Columbia's undergraduate housing office. A small kosher deli used to be housed on the main floor. It was recently moved in 2007 to John Jay Hall.

Quarter for scale. A clastic dike is a seam of sedimentary material that fills an open fracture in and cuts across sedimentary rock strata or layering in other rock types. Clastic dikes form rapidly by fluidized injection (mobilization of pressurized pore fluids) or passively by water, wind, and gravity (sediment swept into open cracks). Diagenesis may play a role in the formation of some dikes.Richard J. Davies, R.J.; Huuse, M.; Hirst, P.; Cartwright, J.; Yang, Y., 2006, Giant clastic intrusions primed by silica diagenesis, Geology, 34, p. 917-920 Clastic dikes are commonly vertical or near-vertical. Centimeter-scale widths are common, but thicknesses range from millimetres to metres. Length is usually many times width. Clastic dikes are found in sedimentary basin deposits worldwide.

Yellow field book for scale. Willow Creek Valley at Cecil, OR. Tens of thousands of unusual clastic dikes (1 mm‚Äî350 cm wide, up to 50 m deep) penetrate sedimentary and bedrock units in the Columbia Basin of Washington, Oregon and Idaho. Their origin remains in question. The dikes may be related to loading by outburst floods. Other evidence suggests they are sediment-filled desiccation cracks (mudcracks). Some have suggested the dikes are ice wedge casts or features related to the melting of buried ice.Lupher, R.L., 1944, Clastic dikes of the Columbia Basin Region, Washington and Idaho, Geological Society of America Bulletin, 55, p. 1431-1462 Earthquake shaking and liquefaction is invoked by others to explain the dikes (i.e., sand blows).

As of 2013, Jackson High has three hundred and eighty seven students in seventeen sections of AP classes covering: *AP English Literature *AP Calculus *AP Statistics *AP Biology *AP Chemistry *AP Physics C: Mechanics *AP U.S. Government & Politics *AP U.S. History *AP Psychology *AP Microeconomics *AP Macroeconomics *AP French Language *AP Spanish Language *AP World History *AP Human Geography The building Originally built in 1927, the three-story tall building stands thirty three meters, or one hundred and nine feet tall. After Jackson High School received a $27 million renovation (one that also restored the building after many years of neglect due to budget constraints), a science wing was built. A highlight of this building is Britton Hall, commonly referred to as the Shakespeare Room, that is patterned after an old English hall in Stratford, England. Extracurricular Activities Fine and performing arts Band JHS has four concert bands as well as an orchestra. The Cadet band is composed of freshmen; varsity, varsity wind ensemble, and symphony band are sophomores through seniors. In addition to the four concert bands Jackson High has two after school jazz bands and a marching band. The marching band has performed at the Outback Bowl in Tampa, Florida. Choir The Jackson High vocal music program currently consists of two choirs, Varsity Voices and Euphony Choir. In addition, there is an extracurricular choral group known as The Black History Tour Group. They have sung at presidential inaugurations twice, in 2001 and 2009 and have appeared at White House functions three times, in 1998, 2004 and 2007. Dramatics Jackson High School offers a class in theater. The drama club puts on two to three performances per year. After-school programs are also available, including Improv and other theater productions. Visual Arts The visual arts classes at Jackson High vary from general art classes to Sculpture, Drawing and AP Studio Art.

It is used in Biblical exegesis to describe the supposed deeper meaning intended by God but not by the human author. Walter C. Kaiser notes that the term was coined by F. Andre Fernandez in 1927 but was popularized by Raymond E. Brown.Walter C. Kaiser, Jr., \\"Single Meaning, Unified Referents: Accurate and Authoritative Citations of the Old Testament by the New Testament,\\" in Kenneth Berding and Jonathan Lunde, ed., Three Views on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2007), 47. Brown defines sensus plenior as That implies that more meaning can be found within scripture than the original human authors intended and so the study of scripture that isolates a particular book and concerns itself only with the details of the author's time and situation can be incomplete. Sensus plenior corresponds to rabbinical interpretations of the Hebrew Scriptures, remez (\\"hint\\"), drash (\\"search\\"), and/or sod (\\"secret\\"), by which deeper meaning is drawn out or from the text. John Goldingay suggests that the citation of Isaiah 7:14 in Matthew 1:23 is a \\"stock example\\" of sensus plenior. Conservative Christians have used the term to mean the larger or whole teaching of scripture. See also * Peshat References Additional references * Raymond E.

The syndrome is associated with epileptic seizures, behaviour disorders and mental retardation. When not all cells contain a ring chromosome 20, the individual suffers from ring 20 chromosomal mosaicism. Ring Chromosome 20 syndrome is thought to be an underdiagnosed condition. Since chromosomal analysis or karyotype testing is not a routine investigation for patients with epilepsy, the diagnosis of ring chromosome 20 syndrome is typically delayed or unrecognized. Presentation Recurrent seizures are the most recognizable feature of this syndrome and are most often the first sign of this syndrome. These syndromes are often ongoing and poorly responsive to anti-seizure medications. Most patients develop seizures the first few years of life, but the age of onset ranges from ages 1 to 17. Different types of seizure have been reported in this syndrome. The most common seizure type appears to be brief focal onset epileptic seizures with impairment of consciousness and awareness, known as complex partial seizures. Other features you may see in these complex partial seizures include staring, oral automatisms, unspecified automatic behavior, involuntary motor movements and/or head turning. Furthermore, many patients have subtle nighttime behavioral changes, such as stretching, rubbing, and turning resembling a nighttime awakening. However, electroencephalography (EEG) studies during these events show abnormal electrical seizure activity, indicating that nocturnal behavioral events are actually subtle nocturnal seizures or non- convulsive status epilepticus. Many of these patients experience their seizures only during sleep. They can have seemingly bizarre features as they originate from the frontal lobe of the brain. Often, individuals with ring chromosome 20 syndrome are initially found to have complex partial seizures of frontal lobe origin, though imaging studies do not show a corresponding structural brain abnormality. In certain patients, these seizures may secondarily generalized. Individuals from the ages of 0‚Äì17 years should be considered for ring 20 chromosome analysis if they have: predominantly complex partial seizures, medically refractory cryptogenic epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut- like features with no cause identified, frequent subtle nocturnal seizures, an EEG showing prolonged high voltage frontally dominant slowing intermixed with spikes or sharp waves, an EEG showing overlapping features of continuous slow spike and wave discharges in sleep (CSWS) and electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES), and/or subsequent cognitive impairment/learning difficulties/mild retardation.These patients will typically have a normal childhood development until onset of epilepsy and lack evidence of dysmorphism or other congenital malformations. Genetics Formation of a ring chromosome. Rather than the typical linear pattern of a chromosome, deletion of the endings of a chromosome can lead to ring formation. A chromosome has two arms, one long and one short. Deletion of the short arm of chromosome 20 does not appear to result in epilepsy; however, terminal deletion of the long arm is associated with epilepsy. Therefore, some gene loss from the terminal segment could be responsible for the manifestation of epilepsy in ring chromosome 20 syndrome. The most common breakpoint in patients is in the q13.33 region of chromosome 20. As chromosomes occur in pairs, the affected individual usually has one normal chromosome and the other replaced by a ring chromosome. However, this is not usually the case for every cell in the patient. In most individuals with ring chromosome 20 syndrome, a certain percentage have two normal chromosome 20s and the remainder have one normal and one ring 20 chromosome. This mixture is called mosaicism. A higher degree (percentage) of mosaicism appears to be associated with earlier age of seizure onset and presence of malformations. Yet, the degree of mosaicism does not determine response to drug treatment. Since the range in age of onset of seizures and IQ for a given mosaic ratio is relatively wide, prediction of phenotype based on the mosaicism ratio is somewhat limited. Occasionally, there is a variation, where the ring chromosome 20 syndrome is characterized by an extra ring chromosome in addition to the two normal ones and hence gives rise to a partial trisomy or supernumerary ring 20. This supernumerary ring 20 can cause multiple anomalies but no epilepsy, and this resulting syndrome should be differentiated from ring chromosome 20 syndrome. This confusion has persisted even in the literature. The genes in the q13.33 region of chromosome 20 have yet to be fully delineated. However, this telomeric region includes two genes that are related to other distinct epilepsy syndromes, autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy and benign familial neonatal convulsions. The genes identified in these two syndromes are the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha-4 subunit and potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily KQT member 2 respectively. Mutations in these genes lead to the clinical manifestations found in these disorders. It is theorized that deletions in these regions from the ringed chromosome may lead to epilepsy in affected patient. A similar association between a ring chromosome and an autosomal-dominant disease has been reported for ring 17 chromosome and Miller-Dieker syndrome. The recurrence risk for ring chromosome 20 syndrome is very low. The ring formation is typically not identified in parents, and occurs 'de novo' during pre-natal development. Diagnosis The ring 20 abnormality may be limited to as few as 5% of cells, so a screen for chromosomal mosaicism is critical. Newer array technology will not detect the ring chromosome and the standard metaphase chromosome analysis has been recommended. A karyotype analysis examining at least 50 cells should be requested to properly detect mosaicism. Treatment Vagus nerve Successful management of seizures plays a key role in improving quality of life. Antiepileptic medications are the main therapies for seizures; however, it appears that seizures in this syndrome do not respond well to drugs. In the cases reported in literature, numerous new and old antiepileptic drugs have been tried, but no one drug appears to be more efficacious than others. Therefore, no recommendations can be made regarding the selection of the most appropriate antiepileptic drug. As not all cases of ring chromosome 20 syndrome are the same, different individuals may respond to treatment in different ways.Alternates to antiepileptic drug treatment include the ketogenic diet and vagus nerve stimulation but not epilepsy surgery. Ketogenic Diet The ketogenic diet is a high fat, low carbohydrate diet reserved for intractable childhood epilepsies. There are no published reports on the use of the ketogenic diet in patients with ring chromosome 20 syndrome. However, its efficacy and safety are well established in other difficult to control epilepsy syndromes. Epilepsy Surgery Epilepsy surgery investigations are performed to identify a discrete seizure focus. Extensive investigations in ring chromosome 20 syndrome patients fails to identify a discrete seizure focus and published data supports that that epilepsy in ring chromosome 20 syndrome is not amenable to resective surgery. VNS Therapy The vagal nerve stimulator is a battery-powered device similar to a pacemaker that is implanted under the skin. It delivers a mild electrical stimulation to the brain via the vagus nerve and has proven to be effective for the treatment of complex partial seizures. There are only a few published reports on the success of this therapy in ring chromosome 20 epilepsy syndrome, making it unclear if this is the optimal therapy. Prognosis Limited data is available for the long-term prognosis of ring chromosome 20 syndrome since only over 60 patients with this syndrome have been reported in published literature. Optimal control of seizures appears to be the determining factor, but early diagnosis and a comprehensive management plan with multidisciplinary support is also thought be to be important. Research Two international research studies are currently underway. The International Genetic Study done with the Spinner Laboratory at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia studies the ring 20 chromosome at the molecular level. The Clinical Research Study collects clinical information from parents to create a database of about the full spectrum of patients with ring chromosome 20 syndrome.

It is notable for being a pioneering group that sings in both Arabic and English, and for being formed under Saddam Hussein's regime. It was founded by Shant Garabedian and Artin Haroutunian. They were later joined by Hassan Ali Al-Falluji, Akhlad Raof and Nadeem Hamid, who left the group in 2009 for personal reasons, Artin Haroutunian who left the band in 2011 due to his decision to live in Holland,Marwan Sameer (Pianist/Keyboardist) joined in 2012 and left 2014. Pre-2003 Invasion The brainchild of Art (Artin) and Shant, the group was originally formed in 1999, during the last years of Saddam Hussein's presidency. The duo dared to form a pop band where few had the courage to do so. They found the resources to produce their first demo song, with limited sound engineering devices. They eventually advertised for vocalists and recruited the other three members into the band - Hassan who answered the advertisement running on the local radio \\"Voice of Youth\\". Then Hassan's cousin Akhlad and a third friend Nadeem joined and formed UTN1or Unknown to No One . They used to compose music on a keyboard, which they left in the trunk of their Volkswagen Passat. The vehicle was also their rehearsal stage beside band members' houses. During that time they also wrote and composed some original songs, and for them to get any airtime on the local radio, they had to compose a song for Saddam's Birthday. The song, having a nice catchy tune to it, was aired on the VOY FM more than twice every hour during the public celebratory times of his birthday. The band released its first single entitled Fancy Girl, a love song. Alan Enwia, an Assyrian Christian music record store owner, offered to produce an album for them. Lacking any professional support, they independently managed to have eight songs recorded within a limited budget. The album found appeal with youth that started buying their debut album in display at the music record store. They managed to sell more than 2000 copies in 2002. After the Iraqi war, Iraq's first ever Western boy band created big media interest and its members were interviewed with by the BBC, CNN and Associated Press. British producers offered to produce a demo album which they finished in 2002 entitled FROM NOW ON. Post-2003 Invasion After the war broke out, the boys lost momentum at home but soon were featured in Western news programs achieving some stardom. A British talent searcher, Peter Whitehead, promised to promote their music, but he failed to secure a visa for the group to travel to England. The boys experienced bitter disappointment. But with the old regime gone, new hope emerged for the pop group as people became more and more interested in Iraq's only boy band. 2004 they signed a contract with a production company that moved them to Jordan and then London where they recorded While We CanMusic video for While We Can their first international song, which talks about the situation in Iraq. 2006 They moved to Lebanon to start a career in the Middle East. They prepared and recorded their new English album in 2007 and they recorded the first Arabic hit song Jamila which it was released on the 19th of December 2007.Music video for Jamila It was one of the most popular songs in the Lebanese charts in late 2007. It had airplay throughout the Arab World. May 2008, The band released their third single (the 2nd one in Arabic) under the title Lughat Al-AynMusic video for Lughat Al-Ayn which also reached number 1 on the Lebanese charts, and it was the door to get a sponsorship to record and finish their album that they worked on since 2006, the sponsor is an Arabic Channel called Al Aan TV. They were interested on them because their target it is the Iraqi Audience and they saw that the UTN1 is a good example for an Iraqi youth group that can represent the Iraqi youth in the outside (Arabic and Western world) Music videos have been prepared for all 3 singles that they released.

They came up in the mid-1960s. By the 1980s they had fallen out of use. Guitarists used overdrive pedals instead, in a similar fashion. But the circuit and its derivatives have experienced a great revival in the 21st century, thanks to the many boutique builders who have rediscovered the circuit.

Unlike most of today's clones, the original Rangemaster was not a pedal, but a box meant to be placed on top of the amplifier. The circuit makes use of a single OC71 or OC44 germanium transistor. The Rangemaster has also been used extensively by Brian May, Tony Iommi, Marc Bolan, and Rory Gallagher. Tony Iommi's Rangemaster was modified to be full-range.

Date of Homer Establishing an accurate date for Homer's life presents significant difficulties. No documentary record of his life is known to have existed other than his writings of the Odyssey, as well as the Iliad. All accounts are based on tradition. Only one explicit date exists. Herodotus maintains that Hesiod and Homer lived not more than 400 years before his own time, consequently not much before 850 BC.Herodotus, Histories 2.53. Artemon of Clazomenae, an annalist, gives Arctinus of Miletus, a pupil of Homer, a birth date of 744 BC. Received opinion generally dates him approximately between 750 and 700 BC.Homer; Rieu, EV (translator); Rieu, DCH (editor); Jones, Peter (editor): The Odyssey (Penguin, 2003), p. i. The lives and the epigrams Sappho sings for Homer, Charles Nicolas Rafael Lafond, 1824 There are 10 known extant lives of Homer. Eight of these are edited in Georg Westermann's Vitarum Scriptores Graeci minores, Downloadable Google Books. including a piece called the Contest of Homer and Hesiod.Westermann, pages 33-45. Greek language text. The longest Life of Homer is written in the Ionic dialect, and claims to be the work of Herodotus, but is certainly spurious (Pseudo-Herodotus).Westermann, pages 1-20. Greek language text. An English translation can be found at Downloadable Google Books In all probability it belongs to the 2nd century AD, which was fruitful beyond all others in literary forgeries. The other lives are certainly not more ancient. The lives preserve some curious short poems or fragments of verse attributed to Homer, the so-called Epigrams, which used to be printed at the end of editions of Homer. They are numbered as they appear in Pseudo-Herodotus. These are easily recognized as popular rhymes, a form of folklore to be met with in most countries, treasured by the people as a kind of proverbs. In the Homeric epigrams the interest turns sometimes on the characteristics of particular localities, for example, Smyrna and Cyme,Epigrams 1, 2, 4, Buckley pages 427-428. Erythrae,Epigram 8, Buckley page 429. and Mt Ida;Epigram 10, Buckley page 429. others relate to certain trades or occupations: potters,Epigram 14, Buckley page 431. sailors, fishermen, goat herds, etc. Some may be fragments of longer poems, but evidently they are not the work of any one poet. The fact that they were all ascribed to Homer merely means that they belong to a period in the history of the Ionian and Aeolian colonies when Homer was a name which drew to itself all ancient and popular verse. Again, comparing the epigrams with the legends and anecdotes told in the Lives of Homer, one can hardly doubt that they were the chief source from which these Lives were derived. Thus Epigram 4 mentions a blind poet, a native of Aeolian Smyrna, through which flows the water of the sacred Meles. Here is doubtless the source of the chief incident of the Herodotean Life, the birth of Homer, named Son of the Meles to conceal a scandalous affair between his mother and an older man who had been appointed her guardian. The epithet Aeolian implies high antiquity, inasmuch as according to Herodotus and Pausanias, Smyrna became Ionian not too long before 688 BC. Naturally the Ionians had their own version of the story, a version which made Homer come out with the first Athenian colonists. The minor poems The same line of argument may be extended to the Hymns, and even to the works of the so-called Cyclic poets, the lost early epics some of which formed the Epic Cycle and Theban Cycle. Thus: #The hymn to the Delian Apollo ends with an address of the poet to his audience. When any stranger comes and asks who is the sweetest singer, they are to answer with one voice, \\"the blind man that dwells in rocky Chios; his songs deserve the prize for all time to come.\\" Thucydides, who quotes this passage to show the ancient character of the Delian festival, seems to have no doubt of the Homeric authorship of the hymn. This does not necessarily imply that Homer was born a Chian: many accounts say that he was from Smyrna and lived in Chios later in his life. #The Margites, a humorous poem which kept its ground as the reputed work of Homer down to the time of Aristotle, began with the words, \\"There came to Colophon an old man, a divine singer, servant of the Muses and Apollo.\\" Hence the claim of Colophon to be the native city of Homer, a claim supported in the early times of Homeric learning by the Colophonian poet and grammarian Antimachus. However, this does not contradict Homer being from Smyrna, because Smyrna was founded by Colophonians and there was a close link between the two cities, possibly unfriendly. The Suda reports (almost certainly drawing upon ancient accounts that are now lost) Homer being a Smyrnaean that was taken as captive to the Colophonians in a war, hence the name ·ΩçŒºŒ∑œÅŒøœÇ, which in Greek means \\"captive\\". Homer's name originating from him being a captive is widely reported. #The poem called the Cypria was said to have been given by Homer to his son-in-law Stasinus of Cyprus as dowry. The connection with Cyprus appears further in the predominance given in the poem to Aphrodite. #The Little Iliad and the Phocais, according to the pseudo-Herodotean life, were composed by Homer when he lived at Phocaea with a certain Thestorides, who carried them off to Chios and there gained fame by reciting them as his own. The name Thestorides occurs in Epigram 5. #A similar story was told about the poem called the Capture of Oechalia, the subject of which was one of the exploits of Heracles. It passed under the name of Creophylus of Samos, a friend or (as some said) a son-in-law of Homer, and was sometimes said to have been given to Creophylus by Homer in return for hospitality. #Finally, the Thebaid was confidently counted as the work of Homer. As to the Epigoni, which carried on the Theban story, there was less certainty. These indications render it probable that the stories connecting Homer with different cities and islands grew up after his poems had become known and famous, especially in the new and flourishing colonies of Aeolis and Ionia. The contention for Homer, in short, began at a time when his real history was lost, and he had become a sort of mythical figure, an anonymous hero, or personification of a great school of poetry. However, Smyrna remains by far the most likely candidate. Arctinus of Miletus An interesting confirmation of this view from the negative side is furnished by the city which ranked as chief among the Asiatic colonies of Greece, Miletus. No legend claims for Miletus even a visit from Homer, or a share in the authorship of any Homeric poem. Yet Arctinus of Miletus was said to have been a disciple of Homer, and was certainly one of the earliest and most considerable of the Cyclic poets. His Aethiopis was composed as a sequel to the Iliad; and the structure and general character of his poems show that he took the Iliad as his model. Yet in his case we find no trace of the disputed authorship which is so common with other Cyclic poems. How has this come about? Why have the works of Arctinus escaped the attraction which drew to the name of Homer such epics as the Cypria, the Little Iliad, the Thebaid, the Epigoni, the Capture of Oechalia and the Phocais? The most obvious account of the matter is that Arctinus was never so far forgotten that his poems became the subject of dispute. This may provide a glimpse of an early post- Homeric age in Ionia, when the immediate disciples and successors of Homer were distinct figures in a trustworthy tradition when they had not yet merged their individuality in the legendary Homer of the Epic Cycle.

It was first published by Del Rey Books in 1981. It was the sixth novel of Kurtz' Deryni novels to be published, and the third book in her second Deryni trilogy, The Legends of Camber of Culdi. The Legends trilogy serves as prequels to The Chronicles of the Deryni series that Kurtz wrote from 1970 to 1973, and it details the events that occurred two centuries before the Chronicles trilogy. Kurtz' next Deryni series to be published was The Histories of King Kelson, but the internal literary chronology of the Legends trilogy is continued in The Heirs of Saint Camber trilogy. Plot introduction The novel is set in the land of Gwynedd, one of the fictional Eleven Kingdoms. Gwynedd itself is a medieval kingdom similar to the British Isles of the 9th century, with a powerful Holy Church (based on the Roman Catholic Church), and a feudal government ruled by a hereditary monarchy. The population of Gwynedd includes both humans and Deryni, a race of people with inherent psychic and magical abilities. The novel takes place in the early ninth century, beginning ten years after the conclusion of Saint Camber. The plot of the novel centers on the desperate efforts of the Deryni to protect their futures from a rising tide of human anger and discrimination. As the health of aging King Cinhil Haldane begins to fail, a small group of powerful Deryni struggle to save their race from the deadly plots of Cinhil's ambitious nobles. Plot summary The events of Camber the Heretic span roughly one year, from January 917 to early January 918. The novel begins as the Deryni Healer Rhys Thuryn and his wife, Evaine MacRorie Thuryn, attempt to treat an injured colleague, Earl Gregory of Ebor. While tending to Gregory's wounds, Rhys accidentally discovers an innate ability to block Gregory's Deryni powers. Stunned and amazed by his discovery, Rhys seeks the advice of his father-in-law, Camber MacRorie, the legendary Deryni adept who has been living in the guise of Bishop Alister Cullen for the past decade. Although equally shocked by Rhys' discovery, Camber is unable to provide any insights, and they soon return to Valoret to tend to the king. King Cinhil Haldane is dying, a fact which deeply concerns Camber and his family. Although Cinhil himself has never truly overcome his distrust of Deryni powers, he has kept the peace between the races throughout his reign, due largely to his close friendship with the man he believes to be Alister Cullen. However, with Cinhil's death fast approaching, Camber realizes that the ambitious human lords at court will soon be able to wage open war on Deryni throughout the kingdom. Prince Alroy Haldane, Cinhil's eldest son and heir, is a sickly twelve-year-old boy, and Camber knows all too well that the Regency Council that will control the throne during Alroy's minority will not treat Deryni kindly. Despite his misgivings about his own powers, Cinhil is nonetheless forced to admit that some of his powers are extremely beneficial to a king. Accordingly, he asks Father Joram MacRorie, Camber's son, to assist him in a magical ritual to bestow such powers upon his three sons. The following night, Camber, Joram, Rhys, Evaine, and Jebediah d'Alcara perform the ritual with Cinhil, mirroring the same ritual that gave Cinhil his own powers fourteen years earlier. The ritual is successful, but the strain is too much for the ailing king. Cinhil soon collapses and dies, but not before he finally learns the truth about Camber's secret identity. With Cinhil dead, the human lords waste no time in making their bid for power. At the first meeting of the Regency Council, Camber is quickly removed by his fellow Regents. Additionally, almost all of the Deryni members of the Royal Council are forced to resign. Only Archbishop Jaffray is spared, as the Archbishop of Valoret is entitled to serve on the council for life. As the Deryni at court begin to make new lives for themselves, the Camberian Council discusses Rhys' discovery. Fearful of the persecutions that will soon be coming against Deryni throughout Gwynedd, Camber suggests a desperate plan to save some of their people. By blocking their powers under the guise of a religious blessing, some Deryni may escape the persecutions by living as normal humans. Conditions continue to deteriorate for Deryni after Alroy's coronation as king. Prince Javan Haldane's personal Healer, Lord Tavis O'Neill, is attacked and mutilated by a group of Deryni for serving the human prince. An attempt to infiltrate the royal court ends in disaster when Earl Davin MacRorie of Culdi, Camber's grandson, is slain while defending the king's brothers. The Michaelines, a militant religious order with many Deryni members, finally decide to leave Gwynedd completely, and many other Deryni flee the increasingly hostile kingdom. Additionally, Tavis and Javan begin to remember details of the night of Cinhil's death, spurring their curiosity to discover the whole truth of the night's actions. Finally, in late October, Archbishop Jaffray is killed in an anti-Deryni uprising. The Curia of Bishops meets in Valoret to choose Jaffray's successor. The Regents make no secret that they want Bishop Hubert MacInnis to be elected, and they actively campaign for his selection. Nonetheless, many of the bishops refuse to vote for Hubert, and the deadlocked Curia is unable to choose a new primate. Finally, a group of bishops approaches Camber and asks him to accept their nomination. Although initially unwilling to accept, Camber eventually agrees to their proposal. After his election the following day, Hubert and the other Regents erupt with rage. They order their forces to attack several prominent Deryni religious houses, but Camber and Joram are unable to warn the houses in time. Meanwhile, Tavis summons Rhys to attend to Javan, then drugs him to read his memories of Cinhil's death. In doing so, Tavis discovers that he also has the ability to block Deryni powers. On Christmas Day of 917, Camber, as Alister Cullen, is enthroned as Archbishop of Valoret and Primate of All Gwynedd. Rhys convinces Tavis to release him, and immediately attempts to warn Camber that the Regents are planning to attack the cathedral itself. A tense stand-off between the bishops and the Regents results in a bloody confrontation as the Regents attempt to arrest the assembled clerics. Although Camber and many of his allies manage to escape, Rhys does not survive the incident and soon dies in Camber's arms. Having routed the Deryni, the Regents immediately move to press their advantage. Hubert is soon elected Archbishop, and the Regents embark on a ruthless campaign of Deryni suppression. New laws and religious doctrines are quickly passed, forbidding Deryni from holding land or office and banning Deryni from the priesthood. The lands of Deryni nobles are savagely attacked, their people murdered and their estates burned. Camber's sainthood is not only revoked, but the supposedly dead Deryni lord is declared to be a heretic. Additionally, all members of Camber's family are outlawed and sentenced to death. While attempting to flee to safety, Evaine is stunned by the feeling of Rhys' death. Accompanied by her nephew, Ansel MacRorie, she travels to Trurill to retrieve her eldest son. However, the Regents' forces have reached the castle first, and Evaine and Ansel discover a scene of barbarous destruction. The castle is burned and nearly all the occupants are dead, including Evaine's son. The deaths of her husband and her son send Evaine into premature labor and she soon gives birth to her second daughter, Jerusha. Nonetheless, Evaine and Ansel manage to evade pursuit and reach safety. Shortly after the beginning of the new year, Camber and Jebediah travel to rendezvous with Evaine, Ansel and Joram. Despite their attempts to remain incognito, they are recognized by several of the Regents' men, who soon attempt to capture the pair. Camber and Jebediah are sorely wounded in the fight, and Jebediah quickly succumbs to his injuries. As he lies bleeding in the snow, Camber ponders his past and his powers, remembering a dangerous spell that may enable him to elude death once again. Weakened and dying, he decides to cast one final spell. Later, as Evaine and Joram gaze at the body of their father, they notice the odd shape of his hands, and they wonder aloud if there might still be a way for Camber MacRorie to live.

Composition Marion Sinclair was a music teacher at Toorak College, a girls' school in Melbourne she had attended as a boarder. In 1920, she began working with the school's Girl Guides company. One Sunday morning in 1932, Sinclair had a sudden inspiration in church and dashed home to write down the words to \\"Kookaburra\\". In 1934 she entered the song into a competition run by the Girl Guides Association of Victoria, with the rights of the winning song to be sold to raise money for the purchase of a camping ground, eventually chosen as Britannia Park. The song was performed for the first time in 1934 at the annual Jamboree in Frankston, Victoria, at which the Baden-Powells, founders of the Scouting and Guiding movements, were present.Adelaide Sunday Mail newspaper 1982 www.anzagl.org Despite its \\"Aussieness\\", the song is well-known and performed around the world, particularly in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, where the Girl Guide movements in those countries have adopted it as a traditional song. It is included with other folk songs from around the world in the Girl Guide Song Book.Girl Guide Song Book, Girl Guides Association, London, 1974. Copyright status Marion Sinclair died in 1988, so the song is still under copyright, according to Australian copyright law. The publishing rights are held by Larrikin Music. In the United States, the rights are administered by Music Sales Corporation in New York City. In June 2009, Larrikin Music sued the band Men at Work for copyright infringement, alleging that part of the flute riff of the band's 1981 single \\"Down Under\\" was copied from \\"Kookaburra\\". This action followed an episode of Spicks and Specks where this usage was the basis of a panel question. The counsel for the band's record label and publishing company (Sony BMG Music Entertainment and EMI Songs Australia) claimed that, based on the agreement under which the song was written, the copyright was actually held by the Girl Guides Association.Kontominas, Bellinda (25 June 2009) Riff row leaves Men at Work up a legal gum tree, Sydney Morning Herald, Accessed 26 June 2009. On 30 July 2009, Justice Peter Jacobson of the Federal Court of Australia made a preliminary ruling that Larrikin did own copyright on the song, but the issue of whether or not songwriters Colin Hay and Ron Strykert had plagiarised the riff would be determined at a later date.Men at Work one step closer to losing royalties, The Age, 30 July 2009. On 4 February 2010, Justice Jacobson delivered his judgment that Men at Work had infringed Larrikin's copyright, and that both recordings submitted to the court \\"... reproduce a substantial part of Kookaburra\\".Arlington, Kim: Men at Work's Down Under ripped off Kookaburra: court, The Sydney Morning Herald, 4 February 2010.Men At Work lose plagiarism case in Australia BBC News Thursday, 4 February 2010 Larrikin subsequently petitioned the court to receive between 40 and 60 percent of the song's royalties backdated to 1981, but on 6 July 2010 Justice Jacobson awarded the company 5 per cent of royalties backdated to 2002‚Äîbelieved to be a six-figure sum.Madden, James: Men at Work avoid big royalties payout over origins of Land Down Under, The Australian, 6 July 2010. On 31 March 2011 an appeal by record company EMI was dismissed by Justices Arthur Emmett, Jayne Jagot and John Nicholas, who concluded there had been an infringement of copyright of the tune \\"Kookaburra Sits in the Old Gum Tree\\". One of the band's songwriters, Colin Hay, said afterwards the result was disappointing and they would consider their position after reviewing the judgement more closely.Kookaburra gets the last laugh, The Daily Telegraph, 31 March 2011. In October 2011 the band lost its final court bid when the High Court of Australia refused to hear an appeal.  Controversy  In 2010, Australian primary school director Garry Martin asked school children to replace \\"gay your life must be\\" with \\"fun your life must be.\\" There was an outcry from internet users that he was banning the word \\"gay\\" and from the Australian gay and lesbian advocacy group Also Foundation, so Martin tried to clarify his position. \\"All I was doing,\\" he stated, \\"was substituting one word because I knew if we sing 'Gay your life must be' the kids will roll around the floor in fits of laughter.\\"Simon, Mallory (3 September 2010) In Aussie school, Kookaburra sits in gum tree - but isn't gay. cnn.com, 2 September 2010.

Wallach Hall is the second oldest residence hall (or dormitory) on the campus of Columbia University, and currently houses undergraduate students from Columbia College as well as the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. It opened in 1905 as \\"Livingston Hall\\" after Robert Livingston, a Founding Father of the United States and alumnus of King's College, Columbia's predecessor, but its name was changed after Ira D. Wallach donated approximately $2 million towards its renovation.This gave rise to the joke, \\"Livingston signed the Declaration of Independence, Wallach signed a check.\\" (Although a member of the committee of the Continental Congress that drafted the Declaration, Livingston did not actually sign the historic document.) The building was home, among others, to Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, an Indian jurist, political leader, philosopher, anthropologist, historian, orator, prolific writer, economist, scholar, editor, a revolutionary and one of the founding fathers of independent India. Ambedkar received a Baroda State Scholarship of 11.50 British pounds per month for three years in 1913 to join the Politics Department of Columbia University as a postgraduate student. Wallach Hall was also home to Beat Generation author Jack Kerouac. In his autobiography Vanity of Duluoz he expressed his satisfaction with the move from neighboring Hartley Hall:Kerouac, Jack, Vanity of Duluoz, p.66 > One great move I made was to switch my dormitory room from Hartley Hall to > Livingston Hall where there were no cockroaches and where b'God I had a room > all to myself, on the second floor, overlooking the beautiful trees and > walkways of the campus and overlooking, to my greatest delight, besides the > Van Am Quadrangle, the library itself, the new one, with its stone frieze > running around entire with the names engraved in stone forever: \\"Goethe ... > Voltaire ...

The song is about a girl who falls in love with a DJ on tour who visits Icara√≠ Beach in Niter√≥i, Rio de Janeiro State during a chance meeting. She loses contact with him when he goes home and pines for him. She meets up with him again at a later date on the same beach, again by chance. She makes her interest known at this time and asserts her wishes to remain with him. Over the years, many fan-based interpretations were derived from the original. The success of the track is largely attributed to the vocal remix done by Pronti and Kalmani, whose studio was next door to Solid Sessions' studio in the same building. Pronti and Kalmani liked the track the first time they heard it but they felt it could use some extra production work and wanted to write vocals for it. They asked Solid Sessions if they would like to collaborate on the track with the guarantee that they would respect the beauty of the original work and that if it was not agreed that both producers liked the remix it would not be released. In 2002, the song's popularity grew with new remixes by DJs such as Armin van Buuren, Kyau & Albert and James Holden. The song was remixed again in 2006 by 4 Strings and San & Sebastian Moore. In 2009, the song appeared again in a new version on the album The New Daylight by Dash Berlin. Dash Berlin later released his 4AM Remix which was featured on A State Of Trance episode 455. A remix by Signum was featured on Corsten's Countdown 149. Pronti and Kalmani's remix featured vocals by Dutch vocalist Vera Kramer. The music video was recorded in Rio de Janeiro featuring a Brazilian and a Greek super model. The song charted at #47 in the UK Singles Chart and at #61 in the Dutch Singles Chart.

A 1942 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, he joined Time Inc. in 1945 after working for The Baltimore Sun and the Providence Journal. He wrote for Time Inc. magazines including Time, Life, People and Sports Illustrated. During a career which spanned the 1940s to the 1990s, he profiled such notables as Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra, Fred Astaire, Barbra Streisand, Robin Williams, Bill Cosby, Jack Nicholson and Miss Piggy. His 1955 Time cover story on Marilyn Monroe, based on a chaste 10-hour interview in her hotel bed while she was filming Bus Stop, was the first to report on the star's traumatic childhood; in 1984, he wrote: \\"Out it came for the first time, the whole hideous mess: the foster homes, the religious sadists who threatened her with hellfire, the child molester who raped her when she was 6. Simply to remember was agony for Marilyn. Sometimes she was racked with sobs; sometimes she choked on anger and disgust. Sometimes tears filled my eyes too.\\" For a 1995 Life Magazine photoshoot with Michelle Pfeiffer, he held the Hope Diamond in his hand. Darrach's work is widely anthologized.

He succeeded James Agee as Time' s film reviewer; several of his reviews are reprinted in Film 67/68. The vividness of his writing is notable; his language has appeared in several collections of quotations, including this description of Elvis Presley: \\"The hair was a Vaseline cathedral, the mouth a touchingly uncertain sneer of allure. One, two-wham! Like a berserk blender the lusty young pelvis whirred and the notorious git-tar slammed forward with a jolt that symbolically deflowered a generation of teenagers and knocked chips off 90 million older shoulders.

The characteristic of this kind of nozzle is that part of the way along the inside of the nozzle there is a straightening of the curve of the nozzle contour, followed by a sharp step outwards. At low altitude, this causes the jet to separate at the step and ambient pressure maintains the jet at this place, avoiding jet instabilities and avoiding massive overexpansion. As the altitude rises, the jet becomes progressively under-expanded and grows until it fills the nozzle, at which point the gas provides more pressure against the rest of the nozzle and thrust and specific impulse increases.

Gameplay  Evochron was technically a sequel to RiftSpace and was largely designed around the feedback received from the original game. Freeform gameplay was expanded substantially by allowing the player to transport and trade commodities and mine material from asteroids. Gameplay was also entirely real time, so there were no cut scenes or menus that suspended the game's universe. Seamless planetary descents were introduced with Evochron, allowing players to travel from space to stations on a planet's surface and back again without cut scenes, immediate scene changes, or loading screens. Long-distance travel was managed with built-in jump drives rather than jump gates, giving the player control over when and where they travelled from system to system. Ship-to-ship trading and multiplayer were also introduced. The game was discontinued and upgraded to Evochron Alliance. Evochron Alliance was the sequel to the original Evochron. It featured several major improvements requested by players, including a new shipyard that lets the player customize their ship for offense, defense, exploration, and/or speed. New modification options allow players to customize many aspects of the game's design from the cockpit to the ships themselves. A new dedicated interactive training mode helped introduce players to the game. The Newtonian physics were adjusted to a more manageable system by player request. New objects were also introduced such as hidden storage containers with free items, planetary moons, particle nebula clouds, and wormholes. Many new systems were also introduced, including three Vonari systems. While Arvoch Conflict was in development, Starwraith 3D Games also worked on applying the cockpit graphics system to Evochron Alliance. Evochron Alliance 2.0 implemented the new 3D cockpit and HUD system while also introducing all-new ship models. 2.0 also added support for TrackIR and panning first person view control. Directional shielding was added along with several improvements to customizing options, gameplay, and control options. It has multiplayer capabilities with up to 24 players. Its successor, Evochron Renegades, was released in September, 2007.

It was founded in 1904 by Brig. Gen. Hierome L. Opie as The Evening Leader. While it traces its founding to Opie in 1904, the paper had a predecessor, The Daily News, which was founded in 1890. Opie worked as a reporter for The Daily News, which was a morning paper, before starting The Evening Leader. In 1919, Opie bought The Daily News and combined it with The Morning Leader, a paper that he had started to compete directly with The News. The combined paper was called The Staunton News- Leader. When the papers were combined, the new edition adopted the volume number of The Daily News and so the current edition's volume number goes back further than the 1904 founding date. In the 1960s, the Opie family combined The Staunton News-Leader with The Evening Leader, and Staunton was left with only one daily newspaper, The Daily News Leader. \\"Daily\\" was dropped from the name in 2002.

The group is described as an exclusive sisterhood whose members train their bodies and minds through years of physical and mental conditioning to obtain superhuman powers and abilities that can seem magical to outsiders. The Bene Gesserit are focused on acquiring more power and influence to direct humanity on an enlightened path. Some of their fictional powers are analyzed and deconstructed from a real-world scientific perspective in the book The Science of Dune (2008). The Bene Gesserit are primary characters in all of Frank Herbert's novels, as well as the prequels and sequels written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. They also feature prominently in the multiple adaptations of the Dune series: the 1984 film Dune; the 2000 TV miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune; and its 2003 sequel, Frank Herbert's Children of Dune; as well as the 2021 feature film Dune. A television series based on the Bene Gesserit, called Dune: The Sisterhood, was announced in 2019 for WarnerMedia's upcoming streaming service, HBO Max. Anirul A Bene Gesserit of Hidden Rank, Anirul is noted in Dune (1965) to be the deceased wife of the 81st Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and the mother of his five daughters, the Princesses Irulan, Chalice, Wensicia, Josifa and Rugi. Anirul is referred to only three times in Herbert's 1965 novel Dune, and only once by name, but is a major character in the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999‚Äì2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. In Dune: House Atreides (1999), Anirul is described as having \\"short bronze-brown hair,\\" and it is said that her \\"features were long and narrow, giving her a doelike face, but her large eyes had a depth of millennia in them.\\" In the novel, she is the Bene Gesserit Kwisatz Mother, the Reverend Mother chosen every generation to guide the Bene Gesserit breeding program. She calculates that the culmination of the program, the creation of a male superbeing called the Kwisatz Haderach, is imminent, and is contingent on a daughter fathered by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen must produce a daughter by an Atreides; this daughter will then be bred with another Harkonnen heir, to produce the male Kwisatz Haderach. The Bene Gesserit Margot Fenring arranges for Anirul to marry Shaddam as a means for the Sisterhood to gain influence over the Imperial throne by ensuring that Shaddam will never have a son. During the events of Dune: House Corrino, Anirul is murdered by the Harkonnen Mentat Piter De Vries while trying to save the young Paul Atreides from being kidnapped. Anteac In God Emperor of Dune (1981), the Truthsayer Tertius Eileen Anteac comes to Arrakis in 13,725 A.G. with Luyseyal for an audience with the God Emperor Leto II that coincides with the Royal Festival held every ten years. They receive a message from Othwi Yake, Assistant to the Ixian Ambassador, that Face Dancers have infiltrated the Ixian Embassy, and are planning to assassinate Leto II. They try to warn Leto, but the message does not reach his convoy in time; however, the plot fails, as Anteac and Luyseyal knew it would. They achieve little in their meeting with Leto II, and he takes the priceless vial of spice-essence with which they hoped to test his mortality. He reminds Luyseyal of the lesson learned from past over-machined societies: \\"The devices themselves condition the users to employ each other the way they employ machines.\\" Later, Leto enlists Anteac's aid in detecting the Face Dancers, who by that time have replaced everyone in the Ixian Embassy except the new Ambassador, Hwi Noree. In particular, Anteac identifies the duplicate of Yake, who has been killed and replicated since the original sent his warning to Anteac. Leto's chief minister Moneo Atreides suggests to the God Emperor that Anteac is a secret Mentat, a skill prohibited in the Empire by Leto himself; Leto agrees but says that it amuses him. Hwi shares her knowledge of the environment in which she was brought up with Anteac, who has been conscripted by Leto to lead a Fish Speaker assault on Ix, to wrest the secret of Hwi's origins. Anteac is shocked at the knowledge that Hwi is to marry Leto, and at the same time annoyed that her order had allowed so talented a woman as Hwi to pass through their training program without turning her into one of them. With Anteac's faithful assistance, Leto's forces successfully invade Ix and capture Malky, but Anteac is killed. Some 1,500 years later in Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), the Duncan Idaho ghola recalls his past incarnation from the time of Leto II, noting that he had met with Anteac on orders from the God Emperor to suppress the Mentat school the Bene Gesserit had hidden on Wallach IX. It is revealed that Bellonda is a descendant of Anteac's. Bellonda Bellonda is a Reverend Mother and the chief Mentat- Archivist counselor to Mother Superior Taraza in Heretics of Dune (1984). After Taraza's death, Bellonda serves new Mother Superior Darwi Odrade in the same function in Chapterhouse: Dune (1985). During a conversation with the Duncan Idaho ghola it is revealed that Bellonda is a descendant of Anteac, an important Reverend Mother from the time of the God Emperor Leto II. Bellonda then retrieves the following information about the origins of Mentats from Other Memory: In Hunters of Dune, the 2006 sequel to Chapterhouse Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, it is noted that Bellonda is one of the few Bene Gesserit with access to sensitive breeding records, and one of even fewer possessing the memories of all the Mothers Superior. Bellonda suspects that the Honored Matres had originally been Reverend Mothers sent out in the Scattering, and calculates that melange withdrawal and hypnosis had caused them to deny their origins. Thirteen years after the no-ship Ithaca escapes from the planet Chapterhouse, Bellonda is killed in a duel by her Spice Operations Director partner and nemesis, the former Honored Matre Doria. An outraged Mother Commander Murbella, leader of the merged New Sisterhood of Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres, forces Doria to share minds with Bellonda before her memories are lost forever. Carlana As Miles Teg is being T-Probed by the Honored Matres in Frank Herbert's Heretics of Dune (1984), he recalls the visit of an important member of the Bene Gesserit to his home in Lernaeus. Miles is left talking with one of the visitor's young acolytes, Carlana, who unsuccessfully tries her \\"fledging skills\\" on the eleven-year-old Teg. Miles, who has been well-instructed by his mother Janet Roxbrough, can easily see through Carlana and manipulates her in return. Carlana is described as having red-blond hair, a doll's face with green-gray eyes and upturned nose, and an \\"inflated view of her own attractions.\\" Chaola Before the events of the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999‚Äì2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, Chaola Fenring (also known as Cirni) is lady-in-waiting to Habla, the fourth wife of Padishah Emperor Elrood Corrino IX, and serves as wet nurse to both her son Count Fenring and Crown Prince Shaddam. It is also hinted that Chaola may have secretly been a sister to Elrood. Chaola's son Hasimir proves to be a failure for the Bene Gesserit breeding program; as Paul Atreides himself notes in Dune (1965), \\"Fenring was one of the might-have- beens, an almost Kwisatz Haderach, crippled by a flaw in the genetic pattern ‚Äî a eunuch, his talent concentrated into furtiveness and inner seclusion.\\" Nonetheless, the bloodline manipulations of the Bene Gesserit produce a supremely intelligent and perceptive killer in Fenring, who later serves as Emperor Shaddam's chief counselor. Chenoeh As related in God Emperor of Dune (1981), Quintinius Violet Chenoeh, specially trained as an oral recorder, is sent (with Tawsuoko) by Syaksa to Arrakis on a fact-gathering mission in 13,725 A.G. She is invited to converse with the God Emperor himself, and he is uncharacteristically indulgent of her questions and somewhat generous with his own information, however cryptic. Emperor Leto tells Chenoeh that he plans to restore \\"outward spiritual freedom\\" for mankind, and then refers to Siona Atreides as his \\"achievement\\" (which the Sisterhood correctly interprets as being related to Leto's own breeding program). Leto then says, \\"You will return to your Superiors with my message, but these words keep secret for now. I will visit my rage upon your Sisterhood if you fail.\\" Chenoeh complies, following Syaksa's own warning: \\"You must do nothing which will bring down his wrath upon us.\\" Leto relates how he and his sister Ghanima were able to escape the disaster of Abomination, and also makes one of the earliest references to his secret journals, later found at Dar-es-Balat. He knows he will ultimately be perceived as a tyrant, and wishes to preserve his \\"feelings and motives ... lest history distort them too much.\\" At the same time, he warns \\"Beware of the truth,\\" and shares what he calls \\"the greatest mystery of all time\\" by which he composes his life: \\"The only past which endures lies wordlessly within you.\\" Leto tells Chenoeh that by virtue of his taking her into his confidence, \\"You will become here an integral part of my myth. Our distant cousins will pray to you for intercession with me!\\" He also foretells her later death during her attempt at becoming a Reverend Mother through the spice agony. Chenoeh's account of their secret conversation is found after her death, and it is later noted that \\"the persistent Cult of Sister Chenoeh assumes new significance because of the journals' disclosures.\\" Chenoeh and Tawsuoko also bring back to Chapterhouse proof (in the form of a written eyewitness account of Leto's statement) that, as rumored, Leto executed nine historians in 12,333 A.G. In Heretics of Dune (1984), she is quoted via epigraph: Corysta In the 2006 Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson short story \\"Dune: Sea Child,\\" Corysta is a Reverend Mother who, out of love for the child, would not hand over to the Sisterhood the baby they had tasked her to conceive. It is taken from her anyway, and as punishment, Corysta is banished to Buzzell to work in the operation harvesting valuable soostones. The Honored Matres later conquer the planet, enslaving the Bene Gesserit there. Corysta nurtures a foundling Phibian until it, too, is taken from her by the Matres when she refuses to tell them the secret location of Chapterhouse. When Murbella's forces retake Buzzell in Hunters of Dune (2006), Murbella shares minds with Corysta, learning all she can about the situation on Buzzell but also experiencing Corysta's past. She recognizes Corysta's value and loyalty and puts her in charge of the soostone operation. Corysta manages to improve the efficiency and output of the operation, which is the Sisterhood's only source of revenue besides melange and is essential to their plan to amass arms for a final battle with the Unknown Enemy. Doria Ambition leads Doria, an Honored Matre, to reluctantly join the Bene Gesserit as Murbella hopes to unite the opposing organizations in Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's Hunters of Dune (2006). Though Doria seeks to learn the impressive skills of the Bene Gesserit, her Honored Matre impulsiveness and resistance to authority are difficult to shake. A chief advisor to Murbella, Doria is one of the few assimilated Honored Matres with access to sensitive Bene Gesserit breeding records. Doria and Bellonda are on opposite sides from the beginning; hoping to force them to at least respect each other's differences, Murbella makes them partners managing the spice operations on Chapterhouse. Thirteen years after the escape of the no-ship Ithaca, Doria kills Bellonda in a final confrontation. An outraged Murbella forces Doria to share minds with Bellonda, and makes her the sole Spice Operations Director. Six years later, driven to the brink of insanity by Bellonda's incessant chatter within her mind, Doria is eaten alive by a sandworm. Dortujla In Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), Dortujla is the head of the Sisterhood keep on Buzzell, having been sent to the cold aquatic planet years before as punishment for the so-called \\"Jessica crime\\" ‚Äî a love affair, forbidden by the Bene Gesserit as a weakness that could compromise their performance. Dortujla comes to Odrade at Chapterhouse, reporting that Handlers and their half-man/half-cat enslaved Futars have offered alliance against the Honored Matres, who have yet to make a move on Buzzell. Dortujla's Mentat analysis, however, suggests that the Handlers somehow intend dominance, and that the Matres intend to colonize Buzzell. Odrade sees an opportunity; she orders Dortujla to return to Buzzell and make contact with the Matres, brokering a meeting between Odrade and the Honored Matre leader (in which the Bene Gesserit will supposedly surrender) on Junction ‚Äî the old Spacing Guild complex above Gammu ‚Äî which the Matres control. Dortujla is tortured by the Honored Matres and forced to watch her party be murdered and fed to captive Futars; however, she witnesses a Futar using its immobilizing scream (which has \\"qualities of Voice\\") against the Matres. Later, Dortujla accompanies Odrade, Tamalane and the acolyte Suipol to meet the Great Honored Matre Dama on Junction, as Miles Teg leads a force to attack Gammu. Dortujla and her party are eventually slain by the Honored Matres, but the Bene Gesserit conquest proves successful with Murbella left as leader to both the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres. Farad'n In Children of Dune (1976), Farad'n is the son of Princess Wensicia and grandson of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, trained in the Bene Gesserit ways by Lady Jessica. Geasa In Heretics of Dune (1984), the Duncan Idaho ghola remembers Luran Geasa, his first chief instructor. She had become very attached to him, but had been sent away after allowing him to discover (at age eight) that he is a ghola. Harishka Harishka is the Mother Superior in the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999‚Äì2001), as the Sisterhood nears the fruition of its breeding program. Hesterion In Heretics of Dune (1984), Hesterion is Archivist counselor and advisor to Mother Superior Taraza and one of the few sisters with access to sensitive breeding records. Hesterion is the first advisor to suggest that the Tleilaxu ambition is to produce a complete prana-bindu mimic, and she is correct. Iriel Iriel is tasked to cultivate the Cult of Sheeana on Gammu; in Hunters of Dune (2006), she discovers the Honored Matre plan to send Obliterators on a Spacing Guild heighliner to destroy Chapterhouse. She and some of her followers barely escape Gammu with their lives, but manage to reach Chapterhouse and warn Murbella in time. Soon after, Iriel is killed in the Bene Gesserit takeover of Gammu. Irulan Princess Irulan is the eldest daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and the Bene Gesserit Anirul. She becomes the consort of Paul Atreides in Dune (1965) as he deposes her father. Irulan is later one of Paul's advisors in Dune Messiah (1969), and a surrogate mother to his orphaned twin children in Children of Dune (1976). Janess Janess Idaho is the second eldest daughter of Murbella and Duncan Idaho, born a few minutes after her twin sister Rinya. In Hunters of Dune (2006), Janess and Rinya are prodigies: ambitious, impatient, and unquestionably talented, but Janess possesses just a hint more caution. Janess is obsessed with learning more about her father Duncan, and she often quotes his philosophical works. Rinya always has to be first for everything, and she demands to be allowed to undergo the spice agony, wanting to become a Reverend Mother at the age of 14, just like Sheeana had done. Janess tries to stop the ritual but Rinya insists; Rinya fails and dies. Janess later undergoes the agony herself at age 17 and is successful. Ranked as a lieutenant in the forces of the combined Bene Gesserit/Honored Matre New Sisterhood, her first military assignment is to exterminate a renegade Honored Matre group who control a portion of the planet Gammu. Janess is later promoted to Regimental Commandant, and adopts her father's last name. Janet Lady Janet Roxbrough is the mother of Supreme Bashar Miles Teg who had taught him the Bene Gesserit ways in his youth, prior to Heretics of Dune (1984). Jessica Lady Jessica is the concubine of Duke Leto Atreides and mother of Paul Atreides in Dune (1965). She returns to Arrakis in Children of Dune (1976), fearing that all is not well with her daughter Alia and the deceased Paul's twin children, Leto II and Ghanima. Lucilla Lucilla is an attractive young Reverend Mother and Imprinter sent to help train the latest Duncan Idaho ghola on Gammu in Heretics of Dune (1984). In Chapterhouse: Dune (1985) Lucilla manages to save the collective memories of the Sisterhood on Lampadas before the planet is destroyed by the Honored Matres, but is ultimately killed on Junction by the Honored Matre leader Dama. Luyseyal In God Emperor of Dune (1981), the Truthsayer Marcus Claire Luyseyal comes to Arrakis in 13,725 A.G. with Anteac for an audience with the God Emperor that coincides with the Royal Festival held every ten years. They receive a message from Othwi Yake, Assistant to the Ixian Ambassador, that Face Dancers have infiltrated the Ixian Embassy, and are planning to assassinate Leto II. Anteac and Luyseyal try to warn Leto, but the message does not reach his convoy in time; however, the plot fails, as Anteac and Luyseyal knew it would. They achieve little in their meeting with Leto II, and he takes the priceless vial of spice-essence with which they hoped to test his mortality. He reminds Luyseyal of the lesson learned from past over-machined societies: \\"The devices themselves condition the users to employ each other the way they employ machines.\\" Margot Lady Margot Fenring is the wife of Count Hasimir Fenring, close friend to Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. In Dune (1965), Margot warns Lady Jessica about the threat to her son Paul Atreides, and later seduces Feyd-Rautha on orders from the Sisterhood to retrieve his genetic material through conception. Miles Teg Miles Teg is the former Supreme Bashar of the Bene Gesserit, pulled out of retirement in Heretics of Dune (1984) to help train the newest Duncan Idaho ghola. He is replaced by his own ghola in Chapterhouse: Dune (1985). Mohiam Gaius Helen Mohiam is a high- ranking Bene Gesserit who serves as Imperial Truthsayer to Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV in Dune (1965), and has an ill-fated visit with Paul Atreides on Arrakis in Dune Messiah (1969). Murbella Murbella is a young Honored Matre captured by the Bene Gesserit in Heretics of Dune (1984) and soon indoctrinated into the Sisterhood. In Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), she kills the Honored Matre leader Logno as Bene Gesserit Mother Superior Darwi Odrade is killed, and manages to secure the leadership of both groups. Odrade Darwi Odrade is an Atreides descendant introduced in Heretics of Dune (1984). Secretly the daughter of Bene Gesserit Bashar Miles Teg, Odrade's \\"care with details\\" makes her like her father most suited for duties related to security. The younger Reverend Mother Lucilla is a near copy of Odrade from her physical appearance to the sound of her voice; however the two women are not directly related, but are instead the products of parallel breeding lines. Though trained by the Bene Gesserit from a young age, for the first few years of her life Odrade had been raised in secret on the seacoast of Gammu by a couple she called \\"Mama Sibia and Papa.\\" Odrade recalls this childhood fondly and treasures the lessons of love learned there, which she must keep forever secret from the Bene Gesserit, a \\"society where any form of love was suspect.\\" In Heretics of Dune, the \\"wild talents\\" of the Atreides bloodline that Odrade displays intermittently are what the Bene Gesserit both fear and desperately need. The suspicious mainly Bellonda scrutinize her continually, looking for reasons to terminate her, while Mother Superior Taraza senses that the Sisterhood needs Odrade's limited Atreides prescience to avert imminent destruction at the hands of the Honored Matres: Taraza tasks Odrade to take over the Bene Gesserit Keep on the planet Arrakis, and take under her protection the foundling girl Sheeana, who has the ability to control the giant sandworms which roam the desert planet. Recognizing Sheeana's value to the Sisterhood, Odrade begins training her as a Bene Gesserit acolyte. Meanwhile, an anonymous document referred to as the Atreides Manifesto surfaces, attacking all religions in the known universe except for that of the Bene Tleilax. This creates a furor with the intensely religious Tleilaxu, who have long nursed dreams of hegemony, dominating the universe with their religion. The Tleilaxu council decides to treat the Manifesto as a gift from God, and they spread it far and wide. It is later revealed that the Manifesto was in fact written by Odrade. When Taraza is killed after a showdown with the Honored Matres on Arrakis, Odrade becomes Mother Superior. In Chapterhouse Dune (1985), Odrade is accompanied by Tamalane, Dortujla and the acolyte Suipol to meet the Great Honored Matre Dama on Junction, as Miles Teg leads a force to attack Gammu. With Gammu about to fall, the Honored Matres activate their \\"weapon of last resort\\", turning victory into defeat and holding Odrade captive. Tamalane, Dortujla, and Suipol are killed. As planned with Odrade previously, Murbella travels to Junction alone, pretending to have escaped the Bene Gesserit with their unique abilities and the location of the Bene Gesserit's hidden homeworld, Chapterhouse. Murbella is brought before the new Great Honored Matre Logno, who has Odrade standing nearby unrestrained in a gesture of contempt. Murbella provokes and kills Logno, while simultaneously the Honored Matre Elpek kills Odrade. With both of these deaths, Murbella becomes the new Mother Superior as well as Great Honored Matre, fulfilling Odrade's intentions. Ramallo Ramallo is a Fremen Reverend Mother in the tribe who take in Paul Atreides and Lady Jessica after the Harkonnen attack in Dune (1965). Raquella Raquella Berto-Anirul (born 137 B.G.), granddaughter of Vorian Atreides and Karida Julan, is noted in the Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson prequel trilogy Legends of Dune (2002‚Äì2004) to be the founder of the Bene Gesserit. During the events of Dune: The Battle of Corrin (2004), Raquella establishes the Humanities Medical Commission with fellow doctor (and her lover) Mohandas Suk in 107 B.G. after the burnout of a catastrophic virus (the Demon Scourge) genetically engineered and unleashed by the thinking machines to destroy humanity. In 88 B.G., Raquella travels to Rossak with Suk in their roles as doctors to help fight another outbreak of this plague. After being infected herself, Raquella makes a miraculous recovery due to \\"healing water\\" found on the planet. Paranoid and feeling that the doctor might somehow usurp her power, the leader of the Sorceresses of Rossak poisons Raquella with the Rossak Drug. Rather than killing her, the ordeal awakens Other Memory within Raquella. Her body changed by her ordeal with the Scourge, she manages to internally convert the poison into a harmless substance, thus being the first to undergo what would later become the spice agony. Soon thereafter, Raquella also discovers the new ability to command others with Voice. She conceives a daughter with Suk, but remains on Rossak to continue her work as he pursues his goal to form the greatest medical school ever seen (later known as the Suk School). Raquella assumes authority over the Sorceresses and their breeding programs, and founds the Bene Gesserit school of thought. Rebecca Rebecca is a \\"wild\\" Reverend Mother discovered by Lucilla in Chapterhouse: Dune (1985). Lucilla, fleeing the destruction of the planet Lampadas by the Honored Matres (and carrying the priceless shared-minds of all the planet's Reverend Mothers), is forced to land on Gammu. Once there she seeks out the hidden Jews, whom she knows will give her sanctuary. They are obligated to turn her over to the Honored Matres for their own survival, but before they do, Lucilla shares minds with Rebecca, transferring the knowledge of the \\"Lampadas horde.\\" Rebecca and the Jews eventually escape Gammu with the Bene Gesserit forces, and Rebecca is able to pass on the 7,622,014 Lampadas shared-minds to the Sisterhood. In Hunters of Dune (2006), Rebecca is on the no-ship Ithaca when Sheeana and Duncan Idaho use it to make their escape from Chapterhouse. Rebecca later offers herself as a volunteer to become one of the axlotl tanks used to produce the important gholas of Paul Atreides, Leto II and others. Rinya Rinya is the eldest daughter of Murbella and Duncan Idaho, born a few minutes before her twin sister Janess. In Hunters of Dune (2006), Rinya and Janess are prodigies: ambitious, impatient, and unquestionably talented, but Janess possesses just a hint more caution. Janess is obsessed with learning more about her father Duncan, and she often quotes his philosophical works. Rinya always has to be first for everything, and she demands to be allowed to undergo the spice agony, wanting to become a Reverend Mother at the age of 14, just like Sheeana had done. Janess tries to stop the ritual but Rinya insists; Rinya fails and dies. Sabanda Sabanda is a young Reverend Mother in Chapterhouse: Dune (1984) who is captured and interrogated by the Great Honored Matre Dama on Junction. Sabanda dies without revealing anything to the Honored Matres ‚Äî except the fact that Sheeana is alive and, to Sabanda's amusement, the fact that Mother Superior Odrade calls the Matre leader \\"Spider Queen.\\" Schwangyu In Heretics of Dune (1984), Schwangyu is in charge of the Duncan Idaho ghola project on Gammu. As the leader of a faction of the Sisterhood who believe that such gholas are a danger to the order and its goals, she has been subtly encouraging the ghola's failure. By the time Lucilla arrives to teach Idaho and bind his loyalty to the Sisterhood with sexual imprinting, he has already been tarnished by Schwangyu and nurses hate for the Bene Gesserit, hoping to escape their control of his life. Despite Schwangyu's efforts to seduce Lucilla to her side, Idaho blossoms under the training of Lucilla (and Miles Teg), and Schwangyu begins to realize that she has much underestimated Lucilla. Sheeana Sheeana Brugh is a young girl native to the planet Rakis whose unique ability to control sandworms is revealed after her impoverished village is wiped out by one in Heretics of Dune (1984). The giant creature refuses to harm her, then whisks her to the capital city of Keen when she climbs on to its back in the long-forbidden Fremen tradition. Sheeana is soon recognized as the \\"sandrider\\" predicted by the God Emperor Leto II, and worshipped by the priesthood of Rakis. As she matures to adulthood, Sheeana effectively assumes control of the priesthood; her popularity and religious aura have increased both on and off Rakis, and the priests, believing her a prophet, are compelled to follow even her most unorthodox commands. The Bene Gesserit ‚Äî who have their own plans for Sheeana and have secretly guided her education ‚Äî thwart an assassination attempt on her, and unofficially take control of Sheeana, the priesthood, and Rakis. Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade begins Sheeana's formal Bene Gesserit training, and Mother Superior Taraza is soon pleased with Sheeana's progress, and considers a secondary plan of seeding other planets with sandworms with Sheeana's help. Rakis itself is destroyed by the Honored Matres at the end of Heretics of Dune; in Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), Sheeana is now in charge of the project to breed sandworms on the Bene Gesserit world Chapterhouse. She becomes a full Reverend Mother but remains very independent, with mysterious depths. Disagreeing with the plans of new Bene Gesserit leader Murbella, at the end of Chapterhouse Dune Sheeana chooses to escape Chapterhouse on a no-ship with the Duncan Idaho ghola. In Hunters of Dune, the 2006 sequel to Chapterhouse Dune by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, Sheeana and Duncan lead the no-ship in their journey to flee the Unknown Enemy that pursues them. Sheeana decides that they need to make new gholas of former heroes using the genetic material carried by the last Tleilaxu Master Scytale. The story concludes in Sandworms of Dune (2007). Suipol In Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), Suipol is an acolyte chosen to serve and accompany Odrade on her voyage with Tamalane and Dortujla to meet the Great Honored Matre Dama on Junction, as Miles Teg leads a force to attack Gammu. Odrade describes her as a \\"dark little thing with a round, calm face and manners to match. Not one of our brightest but guaranteed efficient.\\" However, after interaction with Suipol, Odrade realizes that she is much more capable than anticipated and judges her ready to undertake the spice agony and become a full Reverend Mother. Suipol and her party are eventually slain by the Honored Matres, but the Bene Gesserit conquest proves successful with Murbella left as leader to both the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres. Odrade is upset by the Suipol's death, lamenting the fact that the young acolyte died without being able to share her memories with another sister. Syaksa As related in God Emperor of Dune (1981), Syaksa sends Chenoeh and Tawsuoko to Arrakis on a fact-gathering mission in 13,725 A.G. Her warning to Chenoeh that \\"You must do nothing which will bring down his wrath upon us\\" encourages Chenoeh to obey the God Emperor's command to withhold certain of his statements from the Sisterhood. Syaksa and four other Reverend Mothers (Yitob, Mamulut, Eknekosk and Akeli) incorporate information gleaned from this mission into an \\"assessment of the state of the Empire\\" for that year (before the subsequent assassination of Leto II). Syaksa believes that the religious character of the Fish Speakers is slowly being devolved under Leto II. She further attributes to him a motive based on the concept of hydraulic despotism, in which a government structure maintains power and control through exclusive control over a basic resource needed to live (in this case, melange), proposing that he is building the Empire toward an even greater dependence on the spice. Tamalane Tamalane is one of the Duncan Idaho ghola's first chief instructors on Gammu in the events before Heretics of Dune (1984). Tamalane is one of Mother Superior Darwi Odrade's advisors in Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), and accompanies Odrade, Dortujla and the acolyte Suipol to meet the Great Honored Matre Dama on Junction as Miles Teg leads a force to attack Gammu. Tamalane and her party are eventually slain by the Honored Matres, but the Bene Gesserit conquest proves successful with Murbella left as leader to both the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres. Tanidia In Children of Dune (1976), Tanidia Nerus is briefly mentioned as being mother of the Lady Jessica through her mating with Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. The prequel novel Dune: House Harkonnen (2000) establishes this as an alias of Mohiam. Taraza Alma Mavis Taraza is the Mother Superior in Heretics of Dune (1984) who brings Bashar Miles Teg reluctantly out of retirement to guard the latest Duncan Idaho ghola. Taraza blackmails Tleilaxu Master Waff to find out all he knows about the new threat to the Old Empire known as the Honored Matres, as well as the fact that the Bene Tleilax have included their own agenda within the ghola. She also manages to divine that Waff is a secret Zensufi, which finally gives the Sisterhood a way to manipulate the Tleilaxu. Assigned to take command of the outpost on Rakis by Taraza, Odrade makes an alliance with Waff using this very knowledge of his religious beliefs. This alliance plays into Taraza's master plan: to destroy Rakis and free humanity from Leto II's own plan. An alliance with the Tleilaxu, the only remaining source of melange, would be essential after such a scenario. Taraza then considers a secondary plan of seeding other planets with sandworms with the help of the \\"sandrider\\" ‚Äî a girl named Sheeana who has the power to control the worms. But when the Honored Matres finally attack Rakis, Taraza is killed with the first attack, cut down by lasguns. Luckily, Odrade has time to share Other Memory with Taraza before escaping with Sheeana into the desert on a worm. Tawsuoko As related in God Emperor of Dune (1981), Tawsuoko is sent (with Chenoeh) by Syaksa to Arrakis on a fact-gathering mission in 13,725 A.G. In addition to the record of Chenoeh's somewhat enlightening conversations with the God Emperor, she and Chenoeh bring back to Chapter House proof (in the form of a written eyewitness account of Lord Leto's statement) that, as rumored, Leto executed nine historians in 12,333 A.G. Tessia In the Prelude to Dune series (1999‚Äì2001), Tessia is the Bene Gesserit wife of Prince Rhombur Vernius of Ix. Though she is sent to him by the Sisterhood, any possible agenda involving the Prince and House Vernius is never revealed; even Lady Jessica cannot determine if Tessia has any ulterior motives. Wanna Wanna Marcus (born 10,092 A.G.), is the Bene Gesserit wife of Suk doctor Wellington Yueh. Immediately prior to the events transpiring in Dune (1965), she is kidnapped by the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, who uses the threat of her extended torture to subvert Yueh's Suk Imperial Conditioning (which normally prohibits him from doing harm) and coerce him to betray Duke Leto Atreides. Yueh gives in to the Baron's demands, but twists the letter of his orders and tries to kill Harkonnen with the unwitting help of Duke Leto, an attempt that ultimately fails. Yueh discovers (as he suspected) that Wanna had already been killed (presumably in 10,186 A.G., per the Dictionary of Muad'Dib by the Princess Irulan, as referenced via epigraph in Dune), and is killed himself by the Baron's twisted Mentat, Piter De Vries. Nevertheless, Yueh proves critical for the successful escape of Paul Atreides and Lady Jessica into the desert. In the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999‚Äì2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, it is revealed that Wanna had been instructed by the Sisterhood not to bear Yueh any children. She had told him she was infertile due to an industrial accident. A ghola of Yueh is created in Hunters of Dune, the 2006 first installment of the Herbert/Anderson finale of the original series. In its 2007 sequel, Sandworms of Dune (2007), the Bene Gesserit Sheeana subjects Yueh to an intense personal trauma to restore his original memories; he recalls how Piter De Vries and Baron Harkonnen had broken the Suk conditioning by repeatedly forcing him to watch Wanna be systematically tortured and humiliated.

History   Early years  The Hillel Day School was established in the fall of 1958, after a long period of planning, by a group of Detroit educators, Rabbis and leaders of the community.Detroit Jewish News 1958-05-16Abramson 1965 The group was spearheaded by Rabbi Jacob Segal, who was consequently recognized as the founder of the school and its honorary life president.Cohen 2003, p. 286Detroit Jewish News 1966-06-10 The school began with 29 students in the kindergarten and first grade,Jewish News 2018-04-26 a further grade being added each following year.Detroit Jewish News 1958-05-16 By 1960 it grew into a modern elementary day school with 51 students in kindergarten and three gradesJewish News 2018-04-26 which combined Hebraic- religious and general studies under the spiritual influence of Conservative Judaism and Zionism.Michigan Jewish History 1960-11 By 1963, enrollment was 115 students in grades K-6.Jewish News 2018-04-26 By 1966, Hillel grew up into a K-9 school and, in 1967, held the commencement exercises for its first graduating ninth grade. The next year's graduates were the first students that completed ten years of education at Hillel, from kindergarten at school's founding in 1958 to ninth grade.Detroit Jewish News 1968-06-14  1970s-1990s  In 1970 Hillel moved to its current home in Farmington Hills.

Sometime around 1980 the ninth grade became the entry point for local public high schools, and enrollment to Hillel's ninth grade dropped. In 1988, Hillel Day School held graduation exercises for its last graduating ninth grade class.Detroit Jewish News 1988-05-13 Since then, Hillel continued as a K-8 school.

Governance  Hillel Day School is a private, non-profit corporation administered by a headmaster, who in turn acts under the direction of a board of trustees.

Catholic Bishop of Chicago case that went before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1979. In that case, the court ruled that the lay teachers at religious schools are exempt from the federal collective bargaining agreement.Jewish Exponent 2014-04-09 At the time, Hillel Day School belonged to Schechter Day School Network of Jewish day schools that identify with Conservative Judaism. Many conservative rabbis criticized Hillel's decision to no longer recognize its teachers‚Äô union for the purposes of collective bargaining.

New students are placed in separate Hebrew classes, but are otherwise integrated into the general Hillel curriculum. Prior to that, students were strongly encouraged to enter Hillel by second grade because of the school's rigorous Judaic studies component.Detroit Jewish News 2004-01-16 Hillel requires student's complete vaccination as a condition of admission and continuous enrollment. In 2015, when Michigan had one of the country's highest rate of vaccination waivers, Hillel declared it would no longer accept a religious or philosophical waiver from parents who refuse to vaccinate. Jewish authorities justify vaccination by the Jewish law principle of pikuach nefesh, which holds that the preservation of human life overrides virtually any other religious rule. \\"As a religious school, we can determine whether refusal of the vaccine has any religious merit, and we decided it does not,\\" Hillel's headmaster Freedman said.Jewish News 2015-02-05  Cost of attendance  Tuition for the 2014‚Äì2015 academic year ranged from $11,280 for kindergarten to $17,975 for grades 1‚Äì8.

The secular curriculum follows the Michigan Department of Education academic standards. In 2012, Prof. Andries Coetzeea from University of Michigan Linguistics Department sat in on a Hillel's 7th grade Hebrew class. The class was taught exclusively in Hebrew, except for the occasional English explanation for Andries's sake. In spite of the fact that Andries has an MA degree in Biblical Hebrew, the 7th grade Hillel students had a better command of the Hebrew language than he did.Patch 2012-10-18 Hillel students celebrate both American and Jewish holidays. In 2013, the first day of Hanukkah coincided with Thanksgiving. It is a rare event: the last time it happened was 1888.

The 1006 was originally built for Navy warships during World War II, but later became a designer chair used in high- end restaurants and by interior designers. In the 1990s, the company began creating designer versions of the 1006 chair, such as the stackable Hudson chair and the 111 Navy Chair made from recycled plastic. Emeco also makes stools, tables, and other furniture. As of 2012, more than one million Emeco 1006 chairs have been produced. History Emeco founder Wilton C. Dinges developed the Emeco 1006 chair in 1944 in collaboration with the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). It was originally designed for the US Navy, which needed a chair for the deck of battleships that could survive sea air and a torpedo blast to the side of the ship. The chairs had eye bolts under the seat, so they could be attached to a ship-deck using cables. When competing for the Navy contract, Dinges is reported to have demonstrated the chair's durability by throwing it out of an eighth floor window of a Chicago hotel where the Navy was examining submissions. It bounced, but did not bend or break. After the war, Emeco started selling 1006 chairs to prisons, hospitals and government offices. The chair was sold to restaurants in the 1980s and 1990s, under Jay Buchbinder's leadership, then as a designer chair in the 2000s after Emeco was acquired by his son, Gregg. French designer Philippe Starck designed a total of 14 chairs and 4 tables for Emeco. In 2006 Coca-Cola began a collaboration with Emeco to create a 1006-based chair made out of recycled Coca-Cola bottles, which was released in 2010. Metropolis Magazine said it was a public relations effort by Coke to make a durable product out of their bottles; they also hoped to encourage other manufacturers to do the same. In 2005, Target started selling an Emeco 1006 imitation product supplied by Euro Style. The supplier said it planned to modify the chair's style to avoid a legal dispute over alleged trademark infringement. In October 2012, Emeco filed a lawsuit against Restoration Hardware for allegedly making unauthorized reproductions of the 1006 Navy chair. Restoration Hardware removed the chair from its website, stopped selling the chair, and reached an undisclosed settlement with Emeco. The Emeco 1006 chair is featured regularly in design magazines and movies, such as The Matrix, Law & Order and CSI. In Europe the original 1006 chair is sometimes referred to as \\"the prison chair\\" due to its use in government prisons and in prison-related movie scenes. Description The original Emeco 1006 chair has a curved back with three vertical struts and a slight curve on the back legs. It weighs about seven pounds and is guaranteed to last 150 years. Most of the original chairs from the 1940s are still in use. The traditional aluminum chairs are made mostly out of recycled aluminum, but also silicon, iron, copper, magnesium, chromium, titanium and zinc. Emeco 111 chairs are made out of 60 percent recycled plastic and 30 percent glass fiber. The Emeco 111 chair was named based on it being made of at least 111 recycled Coca-Cola bottles. The Hudson chairAs of 2014, there are approximately 88 Emeco chair models. The first designer version of the 1006 chair in the \\"Emeco by Starck\\" line was the Hudson chair, named after the Hudson Hotel that put a Hudson chair in every room. It has a similar silhouette as the original 1006, but has a reflective or brushed aluminum surface, a solid backrest and is stackable. It also came in swivel and upholstered versions. The reflective glossy versions of the 1006 chair are polished for eight hours, substantially increasing their cost. There are also Emeco-brand barstools, swivel chairs, rocking chairs and armchairs. Emeco's chairs are manufactured by hand in Hanover, Pennsylvania through a two-week, 77-step process. Eames Demetrios, the grandson of designer Charles Eames, published a documentary film on the manufacturing process called \\"77 Steps.\\" Many believe the chair is cast from a single form, but it is actually welded together from 12 pieces. Sheets of aluminum are rolled into tubes, cut to length, and bent into shapes on large hydraulic machines. Various notches and punchouts are made so pieces can fit together before welding. Workers grind down the welding joints to give it a smooth finish, creating the appearance of being cast from a single piece. The chair goes through a repeated heating and cooling cycle that increases the strength of the aluminum. The chairs are also anodized. Originally swivel chair bases and other parts were purchased from a supplier, but in the 1950s, Emeco began purchasing manufacturing equipment to manufacture them in-house.

The root is formed by the bronchus, the pulmonary artery, the pulmonary veins, the bronchial arteries and veins, the pulmonary plexuses of nerves, lymphatic vessels, bronchial lymph nodes, and areolar tissue, all of which are enclosed by a reflection of the pleura. The root of the right lung lies behind the superior vena cava and part of the right atrium, and below the azygos vein. That of the left lung passes beneath the aortic arch and in front of the descending aorta; the phrenic nerve, pericardiacophrenic artery and vein, and the anterior pulmonary plexus, lie in front of each, and the vagus nerve and posterior pulmonary plexus lie behind. The chief structures composing the root of each lung are arranged in a similar manner from the front to the back on each side. This means that the upper of the two pulmonary veins are located anteriorly, the pulmonary artery is in the middle, and the bronchus and bronchial vessels are located posteriorly. Structures The arrangement on the two sides is not symmetrical. Right side: (superior to inferior) Eparterial bronchus, pulmonary artery, hyparterial bronchus and inferior pulmonary vein Left Side: (superior to inferior) Pulmonary artery, bronchus and inferior pulmonary vein. Also on each hilum there are hilar bronchopulmonary lymph nodes. The parietal pleura surrounding the root of the lung extends downwards from the hilum in a fold called the pulmonary ligament. The lower end of this is sometimes referred to as the inferior pulmonary ligament. At the lower edge of each lung, the pleural layers come into contact with each other and terminate in a free curved edge. The pulmonary ligaments serve to hold the lower part of the lungs in position. Additional images File:Gray806.png|The phrenic nerve and its relations with the vagus nerve.

This international bridge unites the Matamoros‚ÄìBrownsville Metropolitan Area, which counts with a population of 1,136,995, making it the 4th largest metropolitan area in the Mexico-US border. It is popularly called the \\"old bridge\\" because its original incarnation, still standing, is the city's oldest international bridge. In 1999, Texas state Historical marker 11778 was placed at the site by the Texas Historical Commission and the Cameron County Historical Commission to recognize the bridge's historical significance. History In 1904, when the railroad constructed by St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway reached Brownsville, it was separated from the Mexican National Railway line by the Rio Grande. In 1908, future vice president John Nance Garner IV presented a bill to congress that would allow the construction of a bridge to span the river and connect the railways. The original B&M; International Bridge U.S. troops on the Int. Bridge, 1915 In 1909, the Brownsville and Matamoros Bridge Company, jointly owned by St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway and the Mexican National Railway, was incorporated to oversee construction and operation of the bridge. Work began in April. The Foundation Company of New York lay the concrete foundation, and the Wisconsin Bridge and Iron Company of Milwaukee constructed the steel spans. To accommodate river traffic, the bridge was constructed as a swing bridge, an additional expense that proved unnecessary, as river traffic grew inactive before construction was fully completed. The swing mechanism was tested in July 1910 and never opened again. Construction of the 227 foot structure cost approximately $225,000. The first B&M; International Bridge opened for traffic on December 12, 1910. The bridge was intended to serve all land-based international traffic, including pedestrian, animal-drawn, automobile and rail. On opening day, the Brownsville Herald published an elaborate set of tolls, including five cents for a foot passenger, ten cents for equestrians, twenty cents for an automobile with driver (plus five cents additional per extra passenger) and weight- and passenger-based charges for carriages and carts. Additional charges applied to excessive luggage. Livestock and trade goods were taxed. Children under seven who were accompanied by an adult were permitted to cross the bridge free. The bridge was widened in 1953 and 1992 to accommodate larger commercial trucks. The second B&M; International Bridge In spite of the enlargements, increasing traffic demands made the combined usage of the bridge problematic. Automobile traffic on both sides of the US and Mexican border had to be halted to allow trains to cross. In 1997, a new concrete, four-lane toll bridge was opened adjacent to the original bridge to handle automobile traffic. The old bridge today serves primarily railway traffic, though it was also used for truck traffic before the opening of the Veteran's International Bridge in East Brownsville. The new bridge features a central concrete divider and a separate pedestrian sidewalk. Current Currently, the B&M; Bridge Company is jointly owned by the federal government of Mexico and the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Union Pacific trains cross the original International Bridge. The B&M; Bridge Company is now calling its automobile bridge the Express Bridge in honor of its issuance in 1999 of prepaid toll express cards. The Express Bridge is also open to, and collects tolls from, bicyclists and pedestrians. Bridge maintenance, security and administration is maintained on the US side, which is also where tolls are collected. South bound lanes at B&M; Bridge Border crossing The Brownsville B&M; Port of Entry opened in 1909 with the completion of the Brownsville & Matamoros International Bridge. Since 1999, all truck traffic has been diverted to the Veterans and Los Indios crossings.

This international bridge unites the Matamoros‚ÄìBrownsville Metropolitan Area, which counts with a population of 1,136,995, making it the 4th largest metropolitan area on the Mexico-US border. Description Opened in 1999, the Veterans International Bridge is presently the newest of the three bridges in the Brownsville area. The roadway consists of four lanes and a truck lane. The bridge also has sidewalks on both sides to accommodate pedestrian traffic. The bridge operates daily from 6 a.m. to midnight. On the Brownsville side, the bridge connects to the southern terminus of I-69E / US 77 / US 83 and the Brownsville ‚Äì Veterans Port of Entry. On the Matamoros side, it connects to the northern terminus of Fed. 101 / Fed. 180\\\\. As of September 2, 2010, the toll for bicycles and pedestrians is ($12 MXN). The toll for cars, pick-up trucks, and motorcycles is ($48 MXN). The toll for trucks begins at ($124 MXN) for those with two-axles. In the fiscal year ending in September 2010, the bridge saw 1,607,271 crossings, approximately double that of the Los Indios Bridge but half of the number at the Gateway International Bridge. This corresponded to a toll revenue in excess of US$6.6 million. Border crossing The Brownsville Veterans Port of Entry opened in 1999 with the completion of the Veterans International Bridge at Los Tomates. It is the easternmost US-Mexico border crossing, and is by far the newest of the three crossings between Brownsville and Matamoros. History A key component of an initiative to construct the new Veterans International Bridge at Los Tomates was the careful coordination among U.S. and Mexican local, state, and federal agencies. The Los Tomates Expressway (Interstate 69E/U.S. Highway 77/83) Extension project linking Brownsville, Texas, with Matamoros, Mexico, included new, elevated main lanes; construction of frontage roads; and improvements to the International Boulevard intersection. Other significant aspects of the project were the relocation and construction of a new 47 acre (19-hectare) park and the dedication of a new 175 acre (71-hectare) wildlife preserve. With the completion of the bridge and 10 other projects, international trucking can now bypass the heavily congested downtown corridors of Brownsville and Matamoros. Design and engineering Design and Project management were completed by Maverick Engineering, Inc. ‚Äì Design and project management of the Veterans‚Äô International Bridge inbound traffic lane expansion. The scope of the project included the addition of one auto lane for fast access and several lanes for industrial traffic growth. One of these lanes was for the FAST processing of inbound NAFTA freight.

April 24, 1981) is a retired professional lacrosse player. Originally from London, England, Ratcliff moved to Victoria at the age of 7. NLL career Ratcliff was drafted 49th overall by the Calgary Roughnecks in the 2001 NLL entry draft. In 2004, the Roughnecks won the Champion's Cup, defeating the Buffalo Bandits in Buffalo. In 2006, Ratcliff was named MVP of the NLL All-Star Game, scoring 4 goals, one of which was the game winner with only 4.4 seconds left in the game. On March 25, 2008, Ratcliff was traded to the Toronto Rock for forward Josh Sanderson. After a single season in Toronto, Ratcliff was traded back west to the Washington Stealth along with Tyler Codron and Joel Dalgarno in a blockbuster deal for former NLL MVP Colin Doyle. He stayed with the Stealth through their move to Vancouver, and announced his retirement on February 6, 2015. WLA career Ratcliff was a longtime member of the Victoria Shamrocks of the Western Lacrosse Association out of British Columbia Canada. He is a 2-time Mann Cup champion with the team and has twice led the league in scoring. In early 2010 Ratcliff was traded (with the consent of the Shamrock players and coaching staff), to the Nanaimo Timbermen of the WLA at his own request to be closer to his current place of residence. In September 2012, Ratcliff tested positive for use of two forms of steroids and a prohibited pain medication during the Mann Cup. Ratcliff has waived his hearing and accepted his suspension which is due to end on November 9th 2014. MLL career Ratcliff was drafted by the San Francisco Dragons of the MLL in 2006. He played one game and recorded 1 goal and 1 assist. Later in the season he was put on waivers due to his commitment of playing in the WLA rather than the MLL.

The company initially sold clothing for infants and children, but later expanded to women's clothing and accessories. It was known for its \\"tastefully styled and proper women's clothes and its sturdy children's wear.\\"\\"Bumper-to- Bumper for Bargains at Best's,\\" by William H. Jones, The Washington Post, Times Herald, October 7, 1970, p. B1. Philip Le Boutillier served as president during the late 1930s. The store had expanded to 20 branches by 1966, when the company was acquired by McCrory's, who also operated Lerner Shops and S. Klein. In late-1970, McCrory's liquidated the company. At the time of its closing, the store had 1,200 employees.  Flagship store  Best & Co. Liliputian Bazaar, 60 and 62 West 23rd Street The flagship Best & Co. department store was originally located in the \\"Ladies' Mile\\" near Sixth Avenue and 23rd Street. In 1908, Best & Co. spent $500,000 to purchase the former Engineer's Club at 372 Fifth Avenue at 35th Street for a new store, joining an elite group of merchants to locate in that section of Fifth Avenue in the early 1900s, including B. Altman (365 Fifth Avenue), Gorham (390 Fifth Avenue), and Tiffany's (401 Fifth Avenue). This limestone building later became the Bond Clothing Stores flagship when Best moved farther up the avenue, and was later converted to apartments.Paratis Group, 372 Fifth Avenue: SoHo in Midtown, History webpage (accessed Sep 16, 2008). Its final 12-story flagship store was located at Fifth Avenue and 51st Street, directly north of St. Patrick's Cathedral. It was acquired by the company in 1944, from the Union Club. After it closed in late 1970, the white marble building was torn down and the Olympic Tower was built in its place.  Branches  Best & Co. was also in the forefront of opening stores in upscale suburban areas long before its competitors. It opened its first branch locations in the late 1920s and early 1930s, in Manhasset, Long Island (1928); Mamaroneck, New York (1930); East Orange, New Jersey (1930); and Jenkintown, Pennsylvania (1936, closed 1937). By 1938, when it opened its initial Washington, D.C. store at 4433 Connecticut Ave., NW, it had branches operating in suburban New York, Cleveland, Detroit, Boston, and Philadelphia.\\"Best's Opens Branch Stores on Conn. Ave.\\", The Washington Post, September 16, 1938, p. X16. On August 28, 1940, it opened a branch in Winnetka, IL, a suburb of Chicago. During the late 1940s-early 1950s a branch location opened at Arlington Blvd. and So. Glebe Road, in Arlington, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. In 1955, the main Washington D.C. store moved to new quarters; a store at 4020 Wisconsin Ave., NW.\\"Best & Co. to Locate at New Site\\", The Washington Post and Times Herald, June 19, 1955, p. X16. In 1966, when Ira Guilden was elected chairman, 20 branch locations were in operation. When the chain closed in late 1970, there were 12 branch stores in operation.\\"Best & Co. to Close Two Area Outlets\\", The Washington Post, Times Herald, October 4, 1970, p. 29. Despite the new owners liquidating the company in late 1970, a new store was planned, built, and fixtured as an outparcel to the upscale Fashion Center in Paramus, New Jersey. This store also featured a new script logo for the company, but sat empty for a couple of years until a Britt's store opened using all the fixtures and displays originally intended for Best & Co.

Wylie: Bya-kar), also officially referred to as BumthangApproved Thromdes & Boundaries in 2 July 2010, Approved Class B Thromdes, Bumthang Thromde; Thromde List part 2 http://www.mowhs.gov.bt/publications/approved-thromde-and-boundaries/ , is a town in the central-eastern region of Bhutan. It is the district capital (dzongkhag thromde) of Bumthang District and the location of Jakar Dzong, the regional dzong fortress. The name Jakar roughly translates as \\"white bird\\" in reference to its foundation myth, according to which a roosting white bird signalled the proper and auspicious location to found a monastery around 1549. History The town is the site of Chakhar Lhakhang, a small and unassuming temple which marks the site of the \\"Iron Palace\\" of Sindhu Raja, the Indian monarch who is believed to have first invited Guru Rinpoche to Bhutan in 746. The current building is said to have been constructed by Tert√∂n Dorje Lingpa in the 14th century. According to the Jakar foundation myth, a roosting white bird signaled the proper and auspicious location to found a monastery around 1549. The settlement thus earned the moniker Jakar, meaning \\"white bird.\\" There are many significant Buddhist sacred sites nearby the town, such as Kurjey Lhakhang, which holds a body print of Guru Rinpoche; Jambey Lhakhang, one of the 108 monasteries that in mythology were miraculously constructed by King Songten Gampo in one night; and Tamsshing Lhakhag established by Tert√∂n Padma Lingpa (1450‚Äì1521). In addition, one of the country's largest monastic colleges, Lhodrak Kharchhu Monastery, overlooks Jakar. Geography Location Jakar is located in Bumthang (Choekhor) Valley within Chhoekhor Gewog in central Bumthang. Administratively, however, Jakar is a separate thromde (municipality) inside the gewog. The administrative office for the Choekhor Gewog is located in the northern suburbs of Jakar. Just north of Jakar lies Wangchuck Centennial Park, a protected area of Bhutan. Climate Jakar has a subtropical highland climate (K√∂ppen: Cwb). Transport Jakar is accessed via a north-south road that connects to the Lateral Road, the main highway of Bhutan. Jakar is also the site of Bathpalathang Airport. The airport formed part of the Royal Bhutanese Government's 10th Five Year Plan (2008). The airport was originally scheduled to open in October 2010, but faced many delays due to soil stability, river diversion, funding, and labour. Labour and material shortages through early 2011 prompted a new target date of July 2011, however as of September 2011, the airport had not been opened for operations. Further complications have arisen from legislated land and property compensation schemes for those who have been forced to move to accommodate the airport. Both Drukair and Tashi Air conducted inaugural flights to Bathpalathang on 17 December 2011-- coinciding with the national day of Bhutan. The first commercial Drukair flight between Paro and Bathpalathang occurred on 23 December 2011; it failed to make a profit. Main sights Jakar Dzong Constructed in 1667, Jakar Dzong sits atop a ridge above the town of Jakar. The dzong fortress is now an administrative center. It may be the largest dzong in Bhutan, with a circumference of more than . Tourism Being located in the spacious and tree covered Bumthang (Choekhor) Valley, the area is also a popular tourist destination, and consequently the town is served by several good quality hotels and craft shops. there are so many guest houses. The bazaar is located on a street of single story buildings in an area of the town called Chamkhar. A new bazaar consisting of three story traditional buildings in the Dekiling area was planned to be completed in 2010. Culture Jakar, like the rest of Bumthang District and its neighbors, is culturally part of eastern Bhutan. While Dzongkha is the national language of administration and instruction, local languages include Bumthang and Brokkat. Jakar is famous throughout Bhutan for its distinctive and brightly colored woven wool items called yethra. Schools There are 19 schools in the dzongkhag. There are two higher secondary schools, three middle secondary schools and two lower secondary schools and the rest are community schools.

It measures approximately 5 cm vertically and extends from the eighth to the tenth rib along the mid-axillary line. Function The lungs expand into this recess during forced inspiration; however, the recess never fills completely. During expiration, it contains no lung tissue, only pleural fluid. Clinical significance Pleural effusions collect in the costodiaphragmatic recess when in standing position. A thoracocentesis (pleural tap) is often performed here while a patient is in full expiration because of less risk of puncturing the lungs and thereby causing pneumothorax.drugs.com > costodiaphragmatic-recess Retrieved May 2011 Imaging Comparison between a normal costophrenic angle on the patient's right, and an obscured costophrenic angle (circled) on the patient's left, due to pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion. In anatomy, the costophrenic angles are the places where the diaphragm (-phrenic) meets the ribs (costo-). Each costophrenic angle can normally be seen as on chest x-ray as a sharply- pointed, downward indentation (dark) between each hemi-diaphragm (white) and the adjacent chest wall (white). A small portion of each lung normally reaches into the costophrenic angle. The normal angle usually measures thirty degrees. Pleural effusion With pleural effusion, fluid often builds up in the costophrenic angle (due to gravity). This can push the lung upwards, resulting in \\"blunting\\" of the costophrenic angle. The posterior angle is the deepest. Obtuse angulation is sign of disease. Chest x-ray is the first test done to confirm the presence of pleural fluid. The lateral upright chest x-ray should be examined when a pleural effusion is suspected. In an upright x-ray, 75 mL of fluid blunts the posterior costophrenic angle. Blunting of the lateral costophrenic angle usually requires about 175 mL but may take as much as 500 mL. Larger pleural effusions opacify portions of the hemithorax and may cause mediastinal shift; effusions > 4 L may cause complete opacification of the hemithorax and mediastinal shift to the contralateral side.

A high school football star, Means became well known because of the rule breaking that surrounded his recruitment by college programs. Means was a standout defensive tackle at Trezevant High School in Memphis, Tennessee. As a high school senior in 1999, he was Tennessee's Mr. Football, a high school All American and was one of the most highly regarded football players in the nation. Many analysts considered Means to be the best high school defensive lineman in the United States. Several schools competed to land him as a recruit, and he ultimately signed with the University of Alabama. He appeared in seven games during the 2000 season, starting four of them. In January 2001, former Trezevant assistant coach Milton Kirk asserted that head coach Lynn Lang had let colleges know that for $200,000 Lang would arrange for Means to play for Alabama. Kirk said that in the fall of 1999, he'd helped Lang broker a deal with several Alabama boosters in the Memphis area. During the fall, he'd gotten $30,000 from the boosters. The other $170,000 was paid when Means signed with the Crimson Tide in December. Other claims specific to the recruitment of Means included Kirk's assertion that Lang demanded and received $6,000 in cash from a University of Kentucky booster in the presence of Kentucky assistant coach Claude Bassett for arranging Means' visit to that school, and that Lang in similar fashion received $4,000 for each visit he arranged to the University of Georgia and the University of Alabama. These allegations and other evidence provided by Tennessee Volunteers coach Phillip Fulmer led the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate the recruitment of high school football players in Memphis. The FBI investigation led to the criminal conviction on February 2, 2005 of Alabama booster Logan Young for paying $150,000 in cash to Lang through 1999 and 2000 in order to have Means play football at Alabama. Lang and Kirk also received criminal convictions for their roles in Means' recruitment. As a result of this and other violations, Alabama was given a two-year bowl ban and five years' probation, and narrowly escaped being handed the \\"death penalty.\\" The Tide were also docked 21 scholarships. Kentucky was given a one-year bowl ban. The University of Georgia, the University of Arkansas and the University of Memphis also pursued Means but were not sanctioned for any misconduct regarding their recruitment of Means. At Young's trial Lang testified that Georgia head coach Jim Donnan gave Lang $700 \\"out of his own pocket\\", that University of Memphis head coach Rip Scherer promised free law school tuition for Lang's wife at Memphis and that an Arkansas coach offered him $150,000 or a position on the Razorbacks' coaching staff. At Young's trial, Donnan and Scherer denied Lang's allegations. Brad Lawing, an assistant coach for Michigan State University who recruited Means, said Lang demanded $200,000 to arrange for Means to play football there, and that Lang stated he would have to repay $50,000 to another school that had already paid for Means. Arkansas head coach Houston Nutt stated that one of his assistant coaches was told by Lang that $200,000 was required to secure Means' enrollment. Also during Lang's trial, Means testified that he never took a required standardized test for college admission. Means testified that Lang had another student take the test in his place. At Young's trial, federal prosecutors offered evidence that Lang had tried to \\"sell\\" Means to eight schools: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Memphis, Michigan State University, the University of Mississippi and the University of Tennessee. After the allegations came to light, Alabama released Means from his national letter of intent, and he transferred to Memphis to finish his college career. He was overweight and academically ineligible in 2002 but in 2004 married, worked on his conditioning and improved his play. He was second team All-Conference USA as a senior but was not drafted by any NFL team. The Houston Texans signed him as an undrafted free agent, but he was unable to make the roster. Means was selected by Team Arkansas in the third round of the inaugural All American Football League draft on January 26, 2008.

Its capital is the town of Ponferrada. Other major towns are Bembibre and Villafranca del Bierzo, the historical capital. The territory of El Bierzo includes most of the upper basin of the Sil river. It is surrounded by mountains on all sides, which makes this area remarkably isolated from all neighbouring lands.  History  In pre-Roman times the region was populated by the Astures, a Hispano-Celtic Gallaecian people. They were conquered by Emperor Augustus in the Astur-Cantabrian Wars (29-19 BC) and the area quickly became the largest mining center of the Empire during the Roman period, where gold and other metals and minerals were extracted. Numerous Roman mining sites are still visible in the area, one of the most spectacular being Las M√©dulas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1997.http://www.fundacionlasmedulas.org/index.jsp Romans also imported grapevines, and wine production thrived in the region until the propagation of Phylloxera at the end of the 19th century, which destroyed the majority of the vineyards. Historically part of the Kingdom of Le√≥n, and briefly a province of its own within the larger Leonese region from 1821 to 1823, with the new administrative division of Spain in 1833 the majority of the region was integrated in the province of Le√≥n, with the Valdeorras municipalities becoming part of Galicia. El Bierzo developed its own peculiarities as Galician and Leonese traditions mixed under Castilian influence, and thus was granted the administrative status of comarca. Spanish is the official language, but local dialects of Galician and Leonese are also spoken in the westernmost areas and are present in some village toponyms. In the 12th century there was a colony of immigrants from Poitou in the Bierzo.Richard A. Fletcher (1978) The Episcopate in the Kingdom of Le√≥n in the Twelfth Century (Oxford: Oxford University Press), 49. The status of El Bierzo as a shire is recognized by law, and it is the only one officially recognized in the autonomous community of Castile and Le√≥n. Languages The predominant language nowadays is Spanish but the local vernaculars can be classified as either Galician or Leonese; the Galician traits increase as you move from south-east to north-west. The use of Galician and Leonese in everyday speech has mixed usages. Although both have enjoyed a recent revival through the work of different associations that promote their use and study, Galician has been more favored, extending its area of influence. Leonese continues to have a very limited use. The Galician language, in addition to Galicia, is also spoken in western El Bierzo and a small area called As Portelas in the westernmost part of the province of Zamora, both areas in the community of Castile and Leon; the teaching of Galician in public education is allowed in those areas under an agreement between the Education Departments of Galicia and Castile and Leon. In 2005-2006 there were 844 students studying in 9 municipalities of El Bierzo, with 47 teachers, and in 2008-2009 more than 1000 students enrolled in Galician courses in El Bierzo and As Portelas, although many of them are children of immigrants from Galicia. In addition to that, the Statute of Autonomy of Castile and Leon, in its article No. 5, states: \\"[We] Shall respect and protect the Galician language and language patterns in places where the language is habitually used.\\". The number of Galician speakers in El Bierzo is estimated to be about 35,000 people concentrated in the westernmost municipalities of the region. In the last year the Bercianos have made many campaigns to improve Galicians' use in their Comarca, even with the collaboration of members from the Royal Galician Academy, professors and students from Villafranca del Bierzo. Politically, usually the Galeguist parties defend the use of Galician language in the western Bierzo, parties as Galician Nationalist Bloc or PSdeG, but recently, even right-wing parties like People's Party defend the Galician language in the area. Pachuezu or patsuezu is the western Asturleonese variant most entrenched in the north of El Bierzo, where there are estimated to be about 4,000 speakers of Leonese.  Economy  The railroad arrived in the region in 1881, and during World War I local tungsten deposits were exploited to supply the arms industry. In 1918 the Ponferrada Mining, Iron and Steel Company (') was founded to exploit coal deposits in the region, and it grew to become Spain's largest coal mining corporation. The Spanish National Energy Corporation (Endesa) was founded in 1944 and in 1949 it opened Spain's first coal-fueled power plant in Ponferrada, Compostilla I. In 1960 the B√°rcena Dam (') opened and by the second half of the 20th century the economy of the region was mainly based on mining and electricity generation, both hydroelectric and coal-fueled. Starting in the late 1980s most mines were closed, and after the collapse of the mining industry the region was for a while in a crisis. However, in the late 1990s the region underwent a major transformation with the establishment of several industrial and services firms, the reintroduction of commercial wine production, the opening of a local branch of the University of Le√≥n in Ponferrada offering several undergraduate degrees, and in general a radical improvement of the region's infrastructure. The economy is now based mainly on tourism, agriculture (fruit and wine), wind power generation and slate mining. Important factors contributing to the recent boom of the tourism industry in the region are the increasing popularity of the Way of St. James (; a pilgrimage route that goes from France to Santiago de Compostela, Galicia), the designation in 1997 of Las M√©dulas as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the development of rural tourism lodging and wineries in the area. The Energy City Foundation was established in Ponferrada in 2006 and is currently overseeing the construction of the National Energy Museum (') in the city, as well as sponsoring several other initiatives that should further boost tourism and the economy of the region.http://www.fundacionlasmedulas.org/index.jsp See also * Montes Aquilanos * Bercian dialect * Bierzo Edict * Santa Marina del Sil  References  External links *El Bierzo Regional Council Official Website *Consejo Regulador de la Denominaci√≥n de Origen Bierzo *Instituto de Estudios Bercianos Category:Comarcas of Castile and Le√≥n ","title":"El Bierzo"},{"id":"7145236","text":"Charles Shere (b.

Pulaski is located at the intersection of Lake Street and Pulaski Road in the West Garfield Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The station opened in March 1894. History Pulaski was constructed in 1892-94 and opened in March 1894 as part of the Lake Street Elevated Railroad. The station was constructed in the Queen Anne architectural style, as were the other Lake Street stations. In 1956, Pulaski's platforms were lengthened by 200 feet from the east end and additional entrances to the station were opened at Harding Avenue after the closing of the nearby Hamlin station. The Harding Avenue entrance to the eastbound platform became exit-only in 1960, but the westbound entrance remained open. Pulaski was rebuilt in 1973, and the original station houses were demolished at this time. On December 18, 1993, the westbound Harding Avenue exit closed. In 1994 Pulaski closed along with the rest of the Green Line so it could be rebuilt. The platforms at the station were completely rebuilt during its closure, but the original fare controls were kept, so the old platforms were converted into walkways between the fare controls and the platform. A wooden railing was erected on the old platforms to keep passengers away from the tracks. This arrangement was designed to be temporary in the hopes that Pulaski could be turned into a \\"super-station\\", but by 1999 the CTA gave up on the super-station plan and built a new station house which connected to the new platforms. The old platforms and fare controls were removed in 2011. Services As part of the Green Line, Pulaski is used by those traveling between the West Garfield Park neighborhood and other areas served by the line, including Oak Park and Forest Park, the Loop, and the South Side. Trains to Harlem/Lake arrive approximately every ten minutes; trains toward Ashland/63rd and Cottage Grove arrive every ten minutes as well, and alternating trains go to each terminus. Pulaski has separate station houses and fare controls for the inbound and outbound platforms. Farecard vending machines are present at both entrances. A customer assistant booth is located at the inbound entrance; passengers at the outbound entrance must press a call button if they need assistance. The station's elevated platforms are accessible via stairs and elevators; both platforms are wheelchair accessible. An overhead footbridge connects the two platforms, but it may only be used by CTA employees. Pulaski is connected to the Bethel New Life community center next to the station via a bridge from the outbound station house.

Scale in centimeters. A reed relay is a type of relay that uses an electromagnet to control one or more reed switches. The contacts are of magnetic material and the electromagnet acts directly on them without requiring an armature to move them. Sealed in a long, narrow glass tube, the contacts are protected from corrosion. The glass envelope may contain multiple reed switches or multiple reed switches can be inserted into a single bobbin and actuate simultaneously. Reed switches have been manufactured since the 1930s. Compared with armature-based relays, reed relays can switch much faster, as the moving parts are small and lightweight, although switch bounce is still present. Also, they require less operating power and have lower contact capacitance. Their current handling capacity is limited but, with appropriate contact materials, they are suitable for \\"dry\\" switching applications. They are mechanically simple, making for reliability and long life. Memory device A few million reed relays were used from the 1930s to the 1960s for memory functions in Bell System electromechanical telephone exchanges. Often a multiple-reed relay was used, with one of the reeds latching the relay, and the other or others performing logic or memory functions. Most reed relays in the crossbar switching systems of the 1940s through the 1970s were packaged in groups of five. Such a \\"reed pack\\" was able to store one decimal digit, encoded in a two-out-of-five code (74210 code variant) for easy validity checking by wire spring relay logic. Such an electrically latching reed relay requires continuous power to maintain state, unlike magnetically latching relays, such as ferreed (ferrite and reed relay) or the later remreed (remanent reed relay). Crosspoint switch In the Bell System Stored Program Control exchange systems of the 1970s, reed relays were no longer needed for data storage, but tens of millions of them were packaged in arrays for voice path switching. In the 1ESS switch, the cores were made of a magnetically remanent alloy, so the relay could latch magnetically instead of latching electrically. This \\"Ferreed\\" method reduced power consumption and allowed both contacts to be used for voice path. The coils were wired for coincident current selection similar to a magnetic core memory, so operating the contacts for one crosspoint would release the other crosspoints in its row and column. Each input of the array had, besides the two talk wires, a P lead for controlling the crosspoints on that level. Two coils on each crosspoint were wired in series with all the others on that level, to the P lead. Each output of the array also had a P lead with two coils on each crosspoint of that output level. The two windings controlled by the same level were unequal, and were wound around opposite ends of the reed, in opposing polarity. When a pulse passed through the crosspoints of a level, the two ends of each reed were magnetized north to north or south to south, thus repelled each other and opened the crosspoint in all except the selected crosspoint. The selected crosspoint had current passing through both its input P lead and its output P lead, thus through all four windings. On each end of the ferreed, the windings provided by the two different P leads were opposed to each other, and the greater one predominated when both were energized. This being the input P lead at one end of the ferreed, and the output P lead at the other end, the two ends of that particular ferreed were magnetized north to south, hence attracted each other and closed the contact. Current was applied by the pulser only to set up the connection. The P leads remained dry and the crosspoint remained closed until such time as another connection was made involving one of the levels. Because the individual crosspoints were more expensive than those of crossbar switches, while the control circuitry was cheaper, reed arrays usually had fewer crosspoints and were more numerous. This required them to be arranged in more stages. Thus, while a telephone call in a typical crossbar exchange like 5XB passed through four switches, a call in a reed system such as 1ESS typically passed through eight. In the later 1AESS, the reeds were of remanent magnetic material. This \\"Remreed\\" design allowed further reduction in size and power consumption. A \\"grid\\" of 1024 2-wire crosspoints, arranged as two stages of eight 8√ó8 switches, was permanently packaged in a box. Despite the sealed contacts, plating with silver rather than with precious metals resulted in reed arrays being less reliable than crossbar switches. When one crosspoint failed, the grid box was quickly replaced as a unit, and either repaired at a local workbench or shipped to a repair shop. Stromberg-Carlson made the similar ESC system, whose reeds were called crossreed. Reed relays were extensively used in the British TXE family of telephone exchanges. Other uses Reed arrays passed out of use in the mid-1990s, being unnecessary in digital telephone systems such as DMS-100 and 5ESS switch. Reed relays have continued in their uses outside the telephone industry, such as for automatic test equipment and electronic instrumentation due to their hermetic seal, fast operate time, extended life to 109 operations and highly consistent contact performance. Reed relays have also found numerous applications in RF and microwave switching applications. They are also used in applications which make use of their extremely low leakage current (in the order of femtoamperes) such as photomultiplier detectors and other extremely low current handling circuits. Reed switches can also be manufactured to withstand several kilovolts and are still used as high-voltage relays in place of more costly sulfur hexafluoride or vacuum relays.

Early life Docherty was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1911. After graduation from Glasgow University and a three-year pastorate at Aberdeen's North Kirk, he set sail from Southampton to the United States in 1950. Ministry Docherty succeeded Peter Marshall as the pastor of the historic New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in Washington D.C., just a few blocks from the White House. Abraham Lincoln routinely attended church there while president. It was customary for later presidents to attend New York Avenue Presbyterian Church on \\"Lincoln Sunday,\\" the Sunday nearest Lincoln's birthday, and sit in the pew that had been rented by Lincoln. When President Dwight Eisenhower attended on Lincoln Sunday, February 7, 1954, Docherty preached a sermon calling for the addition of \\"under God\\" to the Pledge. As a result of his sermon, the next day President Eisenhower and his friends in Congress began to set the wheels in motion to amend the Pledge of Allegiance to include the phrase. On February 8, 1954, Representative Charles Oakman (R-Mich), introduced a bill to that effect.Digest of Public Bills Senator Homer Ferguson, in his report to the Congress, March 10, 1954, said that \\"the introduction of this joint resolution was suggested to me by a sermon given recently by the Rev. George M. Docherty, of Washington, D.C., who is pastor of the church at which Lincoln worshipped.\\" This time Congress concurred with the Oakman-Ferguson resolution, and Eisenhower opted to sign the bill into law appropriately on Flag Day (June 14, 1954). The fact that Eisenhower clearly had Docherty's rationale in mind as he initiated and consummated this measure is apparent in a letter he wrote in August, 1954. Docherty's sermon was published by Harper & Bros. in New York in 1958 and President Eisenhower took the opportunity to write to Docherty with gratitude for the opportunity to once again read the fateful sermon.Dwight D. Eisenhower to George M. Docherty, May 27, 1958; original in the collection of Sue Docherty of Alexandria, PA. Docherty continued at New York Avenue Presbyterian Church for 26 years. During that time he became active with Martin Luther King, Jr. in the civil rights movement. He developed relationships with later Presidents, as well as noted theologians such as Karl Barth and Billy Graham. For 22 years, Docherty had a television program in Washington, D.C. A book of his sermons entitled, One Way of Living, was published by Harper in 1958, and his biography, I‚Äôve Seen the Day, was published by Eerdmans in 1984. His sermon collection is now in the stewardship of the Robert E. Speer Library at Princeton Theological Seminary. A collection of original recordings of his early sermons are now in the care of the Harvard Divinity Library in Cambridge. Retirement and death After retiring from New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in 1976, Docherty and his family moved back to Scotland. In 1979, he was asked to join the faculty of Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania for a year. Several years later he would return again to Alexandria, Pennsylvania, near Huntingdon.

Summary The bar was established in 1989, and has since become a landmark within the Church and Wellesley village and a popular destination for LGBT tourists visiting the city. The North American version of the television show Queer as Folk featured the bar as its main queer hangout. Filmed in Toronto, the series was set in Pittsburgh, and the show would often film on the street outside the bar. Indoor scenes were shot on location in the first season, but a soundstage was later built. In a fourth-season episode of the series in which several of the characters travelled to Toronto, Woody's appeared both as Pittsburgh's \\"Woody's\\" and a fictional Toronto bar called \\"Moosie's\\". Woody's was also the highlight of a skit on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Woody's operates with an adjacent bar known as Sailor. Woody's and Sailor appear to be separate establishments from the outside, but are connected inside. Woody's and Sailor are located at 465-467 Church St. Toronto, ON. Woody's hosts several \\"best\\" competitions, including \\"best chest\\" and \\"best ass\\", on various nights. These competitions are judged on popularity, with the contestant receiving the most applause crowned the winner. The top positions receive cash prizes and passes to local gay establishments, including dance clubs and bathhouses.

The station is located at the intersection of Austin Boulevard and Corcoran Place in the Austin neighborhood on Chicago's West Side and borders the village of Oak Park. Austin opened on April 15, 1899, as part of a surface level extension of the Lake Street Elevated Railroad, along with Central. It was rebuilt in the early 1960s as part of a project which moved the western end of the Lake Street line off of its street level alignment and onto an abandoned strip of the parallel Chicago and Northwestern Railway's embankment. The station at Austin consists of a single island platform; a stairway and escalator connect the platform to a station building. Trains serve Austin from 3:50 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. on weekdays, from 4:55 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. on Saturdays, from 4:55 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. on Sundays. In addition to trains, Austin also serves CTA and Pace buses. History The original Austin station in 1909 The first Austin station opened in 1899, as part of a grade-level extension of the Lake Street Elevated Railroad west from terminal at 52nd Avenue through Austin and Oak Park. It temporarily served as the terminal for the Lake Street Elevated until the line was extended further west later that year. It was rebuilt in 1962, as part of a project which moved the western two and a half miles of the Lake Street line off of its street level alignment and onto an abandoned strip of the parallel Chicago and Northwestern Railway's embankment. As part of the reconstruction, an auxiliary entrance was constructed at Mason Avenue, a block east of the main entrance. On February 18, 1973, the Mason entrance was reduced to functioning only as an auxiliary exit due to budget cuts. It was later closed entirely in 1994. Facilities The station consists of a single island platform on a grade-separated embankment. The platform is located on the south side of the right of way of Metra's Union Pacific/West Line to the east of Austin Boulevard. It serves the Green Line's two tracks; the northern track serves trains to Harlem/Lake, while the southern track serves trains to Ashland/63rd and Cottage Grove. Fare controls and a customer assistant booth are in the station house, alongside the railroad embankment at street level. Access to the platform is provided by a stairwell and an escalator. The station's lack of an elevator or a ramp means that it is not handicapped accessible. Train Service Austin is part of the Chicago Transit Authority's Green Line, which runs from Harlem/Lake to downtown Chicago and south to Ashland/63rd and Cottage Grove on Chicago's South Side. It is the fourth inbound station from Harlem/Lake on the Green Line and is located between the Ridgeland and Central stations. Green Line trains serve Austin from 3:50 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. on weekdays, from 4:55 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. on Saturdays, from 4:55 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. on Sundays. The station is approximately 4 minutes from Harlem/Lake, 17 minutes from Clark/Lake in the Loop, 51 minutes from Ashland/63rd, and 45 minutes from Cottage Grove. 629,581 passengers boarded at Austin in 2011.

He served for a little more than a year, from December 18, 1876 to December 26, 1877. Biography Gerkins was born in Holstein, Germany, January 12, 1842. His parents emigrated to America during his early childhood and settled in Erie County, New York, near Buffalo. At age 16, Gerkens and his ox teams came direct to Los Angeles, where for several years he \\"was engaged in teaming and freighting.\\" He next went to Yuma, Arizona, ran a ferry for a year, \\"and again engaged in freighting and carried on the business until 1865,\\" then returned to California and worked as a ranch foreman for Robert Burnett for two years. On January 9, 1867, he married Isadora Carabajal, a native of Los Angeles. They had three children, Charles F., Margurette and Annie. Between 1867 and 1871 he was a sheep rancher and owned property on the southern slope of the Puente Hills. He built a house on Camilla Street in the community that became Whittier, California. It is the oldest home in the city. \\"His next venture was in the grocery business, on San Fernando street, at the junction of Downey avenue.\\" He was twice elected a member of the Los Angeles City Council, and in 1877 sold his store and became police chief for a year and assistant police chief for two years thereafter.

Body/glaze interaction problems Glaze defects can be as a result of the incompatibility of the body and the selected glaze, examples including Crazing and Peeling. Crazing Crazing is a spider web pattern of cracks penetrating the glaze. It is caused by tensile stresses greater than the glaze is able to withstand.\\"Ceramics Glaze Technology\\". J. R. Taylor, A. C. Bull. Institute Of Ceramics / Pergamon Press. 1986.Ceramic Glazes. 3rd edition. Parmelee C. W. The Maple Press Company. 1973 Common reasons for such stresses are: a mismatch between the thermal expansions of glaze and body; from moisture expansion of the body; and in the case of glazed tiles fixed to a wall, movement of the wall or of the bonding material used to fix the tile to the wall.Dictionary Of Ceramics. Arthur Dodd & David Murfin. 3rd edition. The Institute Of Minerals. 1994. The cracks can allow the ingress of water into the cracks. Once fired ware tends to be more resistant to crazing due to better development of the glaze/body interfacial layer, which reduces stress gradients between the glaze and body. In pottery a distinction is often made between crazing, as an accidental defect, and \\"crackle\\", which is when the same phenomenon, often strongly accentuated, is produced deliberately. The Chinese in particular enjoyed the random effects of crackle, though it spans a spectrum: in Ru ware it is a tolerated feature of most pieces, but not sought, vs in Guan ware a strong crackle is a desired effect. The causes of crazing include: *Thermal expansion mis-match. Poor fit between the glaze and the body's thermal expansion is the main cause of crazing and can be due to: :*Under-firing resulting in failure to develop sufficient body thermal expansion. :*Firing too quickly, resulting in failure to achieve sufficient heatwork. :*Low thermal expansion body. :*High thermal expansion glaze. :*Over-firing of vitreous ware. *Moisture expansion of the body. Porous bodies swell slightly due to absorption of moisture. Where glazes are in only slight compression this can be sufficient to bring them into tension. The problem results in delayed or secondary crazing, which occurs over a period of time after the ware has been produced. *Glazing too thickly. This is a common cause of crazing. Glazes, which should be craze resistant, can craze if applied too thickly. This is because the further the glaze surface is away from the body the lower the compression acting on it. *Thermal shock. Opening the kiln too soon above 100 ¬∞C can cause crazing and dunting. Above 200 ¬∞C catastrophic failure can occur due to the volume changes at the cristobalite inversion (around 225 ¬∞C) *Glaze Fit. The matching of the thermal expansion of a glaze to that of the body on which it is held. To prevent crazing the glaze must be in compression when the ware has been cooled from the kiln to room temperature; to achieve this, the thermal expansion of the glaze must be less than that of the body. Steger's Crazing Test is a method for the assessment of the glaze fit. It is undertaken by measuring any deformation on cooling of a thin bar that was glazed only on one side.W. Steger. Ber. Deut. Keram. 9 (4). 1928.\\"Evaluation Of The Steger Method In The Determination Of Ceramic-Glaze Joining\\". M. Peterson, A. M. Bernardin, N. C. Kuhnen, H. G. Riella.

Volume 36 Issue 4, pp. 140‚Äì142. 2008. A common method of testing glazed ceramic ware for crazing resistance is to expose pieces of ware to the steam in an autoclave at a minimum of 50 psi.British Standard 3402 and British Standard 4034\\"Autoclave Test Results On Crazing Of Sanitary Ware And Wall Tiles\\". Journal of the American Ceramic Society. Volume 29 Issue 7, pp. 203‚Äì204. 2010 Seger's Rules are a series of empirical rules put forward by the H. A. Seger for the prevention of crazing and peeling. To prevent crazing, the body should be adjusted as follows: decrease the clay, increase the free silica; replace some of the ball clay by kaolin; decrease the feldspar; grind the silica more finely; biscuit fire at higher temperature. Alternatively, the glaze can be adjusted: increase silica and/or decrease fluxes; replace some SiO2 by B2O3; replace fluxes of high equivalent weight by fluxes of lower equivalent weight. To prevent peeling, the body or glaze should be adjusted in the reverse direction.The Collected Writings Of Hermann August Seger. H. A. Seger, E. Cramer. Nabu Press. 2010 POD edition. Peeling The breaking away of glaze from ceramic ware in consequence of too high a compression in the glaze layer; this is caused by the glaze being of such a composition that its expansion coefficient is too low to match that of the body. It is the opposite of crazing, as are the preventative steps: see Seger's Rule above. Peeling is also known as shivering.\\"Glazing Faults In Raw Glazes\\". Ceram.

Metal release Regulations have existed since the late 1960s to protect consumers from the potential risk of toxic materials, mainly metals, being released from glazes into drink and foodstuffs. Lead and cadmium are the metals of greatest concern, although testing can be extended to include others. The propensity for any glaze to release metal may depend on complex interactions between the formulation used, any applied decoration and the kiln atmosphere. Monitoring the level of metal release from glazed ware forms part of the Quality control procedures of all reputable producers.\\"Countermeasures For Lead Release From On-Glaze Decorating Of Porcelain Products\\". A. Fukunaga. Ceram. Jap. 37, no. 8. pp. 628. 2002. Test methods are specified according to national and international standards, although testing usually involves: the ware being immersed or filled with a 4% acetic acid solution; covered and left for 24 hours at room temperature, although if cooking ware is being tested higher temperatures are needed; the acetic acid solution decanted from the ware and the concentration of leached metal measured by Atomic absorption spectroscopy.\\"Whitewares: Production, Testing And Quality Control\\".

Blisters appear as large bubbles either just below or penetrating the surface, leaving sharp, rough edges that collect dirt. The surface of the glaze is very unpleasant and looks like a boiled mass of bubbles, craters and pinholes.\\"Formation Of Blisters And Pinholes In Raw Glazes Of Ceramic Sanitaryware. Pt. 1.

Crawling A defect that appears as irregular, bare patches of fired body showing through the glaze where it has failed to adhere to or wet the body on firing. The cause is a weak bond between glaze and body; this may result from greasy patches or dust on the surface of the biscuit ware or from shrinkage of the applied glaze slip during drying. The fault is more likely to occur with once-fired ware such as sanitaryware.\\"Crawling‚ÄîA Serious Defect In Glazes After Firing\\". S. K. Mukherji, B. B. Machhoya, R. M. Savsani, T. K. Dan.

Metal Marking Metal marks are dark lines, often accompanied by damage in the glaze, caused by the deposition of metal during the use of metal utensils. The cutlery, or other relatively soft metal, will leave a very thin smear of metal on pottery ware if the glaze is minutely pitted. A glaze may have this defective surface as it leaves the glost kiln, or it may subsequently develop such a surface as a result of inadequate chemical durability. The fault is also known as cutlery marking.\\"The Marking of Glazes by Cutlery\\". W. P. Howells, W. Roberts. British Ceramic Research Association. Technical Note 98. 1966.\\"Metal Marking Of Dinnerware\\". C. Prieur, G. Bisson, C. Casset. \\"Industrial Ceramics\\" no. 927, pp. 458‚Äì461. 1997.\\"Testing For Metal Marking Resistance\\". Z. C.

Pin-hole A fault that is commonly the result of a bubble in the glaze when it was molten that burst but was only partially healed. The bubbles are most often from gas that originates from air trapped between the particles of powdered glaze as the glaze begins to mature, or from gases evolved from carbonate compounds.\\"Practical Suggestions For Control Of Glaze Defects.

These are pin-holes or craters sometimes occurring in glazed non-vitreous ceramics while they are in the decorating kiln. The cause of this defect is the evolution of water vapour, adsorbed by the porous body, during the period between the glost firing and the decorating firing, via minute cracks in the glaze.The Causes of Pinholes in Vitreous China Sanitaryware.

On October 28, 1962, the station was elevated on an embankment and the main entrance was rebuilt by taking advantage of the small space along the road to include a ticket window and enclosed waiting rooms. When the Green Line closed for a renovation project in 1994, the CTA had planned to permanently close the Oak Park station along with four other stations (, , and ).

History Representations of bisexual eroticism have been found in ancient Etruscan tomb paintings that feature homosexual activity combined with heterosexual activity. Pornographic film industry Bisexual pornography began to develop as a genre in the 1980s. While bisexual content featuring lesbianism had been prevalent during the 1960s and 1970s, bisexual content featuring male homosexuality was first introduced by major pornographic studios in the early 1980s. Paul Norman was one of the earliest directors to gain a reputation for creating bisexual films, with his \\"Bi and Beyond\\" series debuting in 1988. Content featuring male bisexuality has been a growing trend since the advent of internet pornography. However the genre remains a very small proportion of the pornographic DVD market; for example at porn retailer HotMovies.com, there are only 655 bisexual titles out of a catalogue of more than 90,000 films. Bisexual DVDs sell much better online than in adult video stores, possibly due to customers in stores feeling embarrassed to buy them. Most bisexual pornography is made by small production companies rather than the major studios. Actors are mostly amateur; any well-known actors in bisexual porn tend to be from the gay pornography industry. The sex columnist Violet Blue states that bisexual pornography usually features gay male actors who are straight-for-pay. Blue says that many bisexual productions suffer from poor casting, lack of enthusiasm from homophobic directors, and lackluster performances because \\"all too many bisexual videos feature two men having sex with each other while desperately trying not to enjoy the female participants.\\" Although including heterosexual content, bisexual pornography is often considered a \\"gay\\" genre by the pornographic industry and many of its viewers are gay men. Bisexual pornography is often placed near the gay section in adult video stores, since many consumers are gay men. As the genre has developed, it has become increasingly associated with the gay male pornographic industry. By the 2000s, bisexual productions used less scenes with women together and bisexual scenes now frequently resemble gay scenes with heterosexual content added. Male performers in heterosexual porn who have appeared in bisexual porn, have had their sexuality questioned and been stigmatized, and have been accused by the gay community of being in denial about their sexual orientation; while male performers in gay porn who have appeared in bisexual porn have been accused of being heteronormative. Female actresses face much less stigma for appearing in bisexual porn. Although many still get stigmatized for performing with male performers who usually work in the gay pornography or transgender pornography industry. In August 2018, MindGeek's gay pornographic website Men.com created controversy by releasing its first scene featuring MMF bisexual porn, sparking a discussion over whether bisexual porn belongs on a gay porn website. In reaction to the controversy, MindGeek decided to stop featuring bisexual pornography on Men.com and created a separate bisexual website instead called WhyNotBi.com  Notable directors and performers  * Kurt Lockwood * Danny Wylde * Sharon Kane * Chi Chi LaRue * Shy Love * Paul Norman (director) * Ona Zee  See also  * Gay pornography * List of LGBT-related films * Pornographic film  Bibliography  * Marjorie Garber: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life (Routledge, 2000).

His name and appearance are references to the title character from the classic horror feature film Creature from the Black Lagoon. Publication history Lagoon Boy first appeared in Aquaman vol. 5 #50 (December 1998) and was created by Erik Larsen. Fictional character biography No writer has yet provided an origin story for Lagoon Boy. In his first appearance, he is allowed into Atlantis as part of an attempt by Aquaman to make Atlantis more open to those living outside the city by granting them citizenship. His presence is met with protests by many elitist Atlanteans. Lagoon Boy comes to the citizenship ceremony on the day of Aquaman and Queen Mera's marriage. While there he befriends Blubber, a humanoid whale with a genius IQ, and his assistant Sheeva the Mermaid. Aquaman #54 reveals that the three characters have begun calling themselves \\"The Land-Lovers\\" as they were underwater creatures who were fascinated with the world over water. Blubber creates a device which allows Atlanteans to view television from the surface world, and the trio head up to the surface world in order to explore and compare it to the television broadcasts they had seen. Their appearance creates a huge disturbance and the Coast Guard is quickly called. Aquaman rescues the Land-Lovers from persecution and sends them back to Atlantis. After Erik Larsen's run on Aquaman ended, the Land-Lovers did not reappear in the title. Lagoon Boy was used shortly before the end of Larsen's run by writer Chuck Dixon, who wrote the Young Justice Special #1 (No Man's Land) story. In the story, the male members of Young Justice (Superboy, Robin and Impulse), head for Gotham City and meet Lagoon Boy. They join together to stop Kobra. Lagoon Boy reappears in Young Justice: Sins of Youth, where he is aged to adulthood. He helps Young Justice against Klarion the Witchboy and Black Manta, and he assists the JSA, JLA and the Titans in ending the wild mixture of science and magic which had been causing the transformations. Lagoon Boy later displays the ability to command, or at least enlist the aid of, humpback whales in order to cause a riptide on the shores of the rogue nation of Zandia, aiding Young Justice in the process.Young Justice (vol. 1) #50 (December 2002) Robin and Lagoon Boy team up to stop a sea monster from damaging Gotham Harbor and force its return to the sea.Robin (vol. 4) #83‚Äì84 (December 2000 ‚Äì January 2001) Lagoon Boy was briefly shown in Infinite Crisis when The Spectre wreaks havoc on the people of Atlantis. He is shown fighting the Spectre alongside many Atlanteans and their allies. Lagoon Boy is one of the few survivors after Spectre squashes the city.Infinite Crisis #4 (March 2006) Over a year after Young Justice disbands, Lagoon Boy is recruited alongside several other obscure teenaged heroes as part of a Teen Titans spin-off team known as the Titans East. Unfortunately, he and the rest of the Titans are severely injured after being attacked by the children of Trigon on a routine training exercise.Titans East Special (January 2008) In a scene taking place just hours prior to the events of Blackest Night, Lagoon Boy's former teammate Hawk II visits Titans Tower and angrily tells Cyborg that Lagoon Boy is still in a coma.Titans (vol. 2) #2 (July 2008) In 2011, DC Comics rebooted the DC Universe in \\"The New 52\\". Lagoon Boy appeared as a member of the Teen Titans five years in the futureTeen Titans: Future's End #1. DC Comics. During the \\"Heroes in Crisis\\" storyline, Lagoon Boy is seen at Sanctuary where he is dealing with the trauma of the deaths when a mysterious assailant massacred his teammates in the Titans East team. He is among the heroes who were killed by a mysterious assailant and was found with a knife in his chest.Heroes in Crisis #1. DC Comics. Powers and abilities Lagoon Boy is an amphibious boy. He is small in stature, but strong, quick and durable. His body is covered in green scales and fins and he has sharp claws and teeth. When excited, Lagoon Boy also has the ability to blow up like a puffer fish, which makes him appear to be much larger and more intimidating, making him physically more powerful and develop quills that can cause great pain to other opponents who cross his path. Lagoon Boy discovers a conch horn that allows him to call out to his Spotty, a monstrous animal from the undersea trench called the Devil's Deep. Lagoon Boy has also displayed the ability to command humpback whales. At this point, it is unclear just how much control he has over them. He could also conjure and mold water into any shape he saw fit, using it as a jettison device to reach a flying Powerboy.Titans East Special (January 2008) While not a superpower per se, he also has access to wealth acquired from submerged ships and cities.Aquaman (vol. 5) #54 (April 1999) In other media Television * In Teen Titans animated series a character named Tramm is based on Lagoon Boy. Tramm was first seen in the episode Deep Six. He was called by Aqualad to fix Cyborg's T-Ship. After he had fixed it, both Aqualad and Tramm were made Honorary Titans. He made close friends with Cyborg shortly after. Because he was a young hero with gifted powers, Tramm was targeted by the Brotherhood of Evil. In \\"Calling All Titans\\", Tramm was sent to aid Aqualad when he was attacked by Plasmus and Trident. He was eventually subdued by XL Terrestrial, but defeated him and went to find Aqualad. Trident fought Aqualad, while Plasmus took on Tramm. Both heroes were defeated and added as a flash-frozen trophy in the Brotherhood's base in Paris. In \\"Titans Together\\", Tramm was seen alongside Aqualad when Mas y Menos freed the captive Titans, but wasn't actually seen fighting. After their victory, Tramm socialized with other Titans in the Titans Tower and was seen next to Aqualad, ready to capture Doctor Light. * Lagoon Boy (La'gaan) appears in the Young Justice episode \\"Downtime\\", voiced by Yuri Lowenthal. He is shown as a student at the Conservatory of Sorcery alongside Lori Lemaris. In \\"Happy New Year\\", it is shown that Lagoon Boy has joined the Team and also is in a relationship with Miss Martian. She refers to him as La'gaan while he refers to her as \\"Angel Fish\\". Lagoon Boy often goes out of his way to make romantic overtures towards Miss Martian in the presence of Superboy, her former love interest, resulting in friction between the two boys. When he encounters Aqualad in \\"Alienated\\", he is the only one who does not show him sympathy, opting to attack him for betraying his friends. He is prone to use Atlantean slang or euphemisms in regular conversation, usually when caught off guard, such as \\"Neptune's Beard!\\" In \\"Depths\\", Lagoon is captured by Black Manta's forces defending a satellite where he was knocked out by Aqualad. Aqualad orders Black Manta's men to deliver Lagoon Boy to the Light's new partner; this is later revealed as an attempt by Aqualad (who is only posing as a traitor as part of an undercover operation) to keep Lagoon Boy from being killed without blowing Aqualad's cover. In \\"Before the Dawn\\" he is experimented on by the Reach, who explain that despite his physical differences, he is technically human and therefore a viable metagene candidate. He is freed along with Beast Boy and Impulse but is later knocked out by Black Beetle. His unconscious body is dragged into the Team's bioship and saves Blue Beetle from drowning after the latter is blown from the Reach's ship. In \\"The Fix\\" he is ambushed along with Miss Martian by Deathstroke, the Terminator and his assistant Tigress (secretly former Team member Artemis), who are targeting Miss Martian on orders from Black Manta. Despite his best attempts to defend his girlfriend, Lagoon Boy is knocked out and his leg badly injured. He appears again in \\"Intervention\\" where his leg has recovered. However Miss Martian has come to the realization that she was merely using him and that their relationship isn't fair to either of them. She then breaks up with him. Lagoon Boy assists the Team in their attempt to capture the Light in \\"Summit\\" and then to stop the Reach's doomsday weapon in \\"Endgame\\". For this, he is paired up with Aqualad who had revealed his true colors and rejoined the Team. At first, Lagoon Boy was not happy about it until Aqualad explained that he had hoped that Lagoon Boy would take his place on the Team in his absence, thus repairing their friendship. Miscellaneous * Lagoon Boy appears Teen Titans Go! #52 as an alternate alias of Robby Reed. Unknown to both Robby and the Titans, his H-Dial borrows power from any hero who's in close proximity to him, and thus becomes Lagoon Boy when Aqualad is close by. * Lagoon Boy appears in the fourteenth issue of the Young Justice tie-in comic.

Georgetown is the administrative headquarters of the Shire of Etheridge, a local government area encompassing the nearby settlements of Mount Surprise, Forsayth and Einasleigh.  History  Georgetown area may have been part of North America 1.7 billion years ago based on the characteristics of rocks found in Georgetown matching those of northern Canada rather than the rest of Australia. Researchers at Curtin University have postulated that 100 million years later, this landmass collided with what is now northern Australia, at the Mount Isa region, forming the Nuna supercontinent.

The eventual result was the FH-1 Phantom, a twin-engined craft that was only moderately faster than the best propeller fighters of the time. The Navy ordered 100 planes (only 60 were actually built), and the first units were delivered in 1947. They were used to equip one Navy and two United States Marine Corps squadrons. They were the first carrier-based pure jet fighters acquired and put into operational service by the Navy. The Marines used a few of their planes to form an aerial formation-flight demonstration team, dubbed The Flying Leathernecks (which was also the title of a 1951 film starring John Wayne, concerned with Marine aviation activity in World War II). Three flag officers in the Navy, Admiral Daniel V. Gallery and Rear Admirals Apollo Soucek and Edgar A. Cruise, checked themselves out in the Phantom and made fly-by appearances at the inauguration ceremony of New York City's Idlewild Airport and the 1948 Cleveland Air Races. They referred to themselves as The Gray Angels, a reference to the actual Navy flight-demonstration team known as the Blue Angels (formed in 1945, the Blue Angels' official title was U.S. Navy Flight Demonstration Team, and they were first referred to as Lancers, but within a few months the references were changed to Blue Angels). The \\"Grays\\" flew in various air shows during the summer of 1947, but the team was abruptly disbanded after their poorly timed arrival at a September air show in Cleveland, Ohio nearly caused a head-on low-altitude collision with a large formation of other aircraft.Mills, 1991, p. 226.

History Jean-Marie Beurel was born on 5 February 1813 at Plouguenast, in Lower Brittany, France. He was assigned to the Mission of Siam by the Missions √âtrang√®res de Paris and arrived in Singapore on 29 October 1839 at the age of 26. Father Beurel had come as a parish priest for the Roman Catholic chapel on Bras Basah Road. When Bishop Jean-Paul-Hilaire-Michel Courvezy talked of extending the chapel because it was getting too small, Father Beurel suggested that a church be built elsewhere so that the current site could be used for a school for boys. Fund- raising for the Cathedral began in 1840. Faced with a shortage of funds, Beurel travelled as far as China and the Philippines to seek help. Contributions were received 4,000 francs from Queen Marie-Amelie Therese of France, 3,000 Spanish dollars from the Archbishop of Manila and the Protestant community in Singapore. Of the two architectural plans submitted, the chosen design was by Denis McSwiney, a former clerk to George Drumgoole Coleman. The foundation stone was laid on 18 June 1843 by John Conolly, a merchant resident of Singapore. Cathedral of the Good Shepherd was completed at the cost of 18,355.22 Spanish dollars, and was consecrated by Father Beurel on 6 June 1847, before a crowd of more than 1,500 people. In 1848, Father Beurel asked the Straits Settlements government for land to build a school, but was refused. He left Singapore on 28 October 1850 for France. While he was in France, Father Beurel approached the Reverend Mother Superior General Mother de Faudoas of the Infant Jesus Sisters to enlist some sisters in starting a school for girls. He returned to Singapore in 1852 with some Brothers from the Brothers of the Christian Schools. In May 1852, Father Beurel and the Brothers founded Saint Joseph's Institution in the former chapel. In July 1852, he asked the Straits Settlements Government once again for land next to the church for a charitable institution for girls. When he was told that there was already sufficient land given to the church, he bought a house in Victoria Street with his own money of 4,000 francs that George Drumgoole Coleman had built for H. C. Caldwell, Senior Sworn Clerk who later became Registrar of the Court. With the help of Mother Mathilde Raclot and her fellow Sisters, Town Convent, the first Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus in Singapore, was opened in February 1854. To further the expansion of the Town Convent, Father Beurel had acquired all the nine lots of land that would constitute the entire Convent complex. In 1859, Father Beurel had completed the parochial house next to the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd. In 1868, he returned to France on account of illness. Father Beurel died in Paris, France, on 3 October 1872 at the age of 59 and was buried in the Montparnasse Cemetery. At the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd is a memorial plaque to Father Beurel.

He stood tall and weighed . Although he was born in Houlton, Maine, on the Canada‚ÄìUS border, he attended high school in Burbank, California, and was selected by the Angels in the seventh round of the 1974 Major League Baseball Draft. He then spent 5 years in the club's farm system before his recall during the middle of the 1979 campaign. Botting made his Major League debut in relief on June 28, 1979, against the Texas Rangers at Arlington Stadium. Angels starting pitcher Jim Barr came out of the game with one out in the top of the first inning, with runners on second and third, and already behind 3‚Äì0. Botting \\"threw gasoline on the fire,\\" and when the inning ended it was 8-0, Texas. He then pitched to four batters in the top of the second and retired no one, though there was an error committed by Angels shortstop Jim Anderson. In two-thirds of an inning, Botting allowed not only the two inherited runners to score, but gave up seven runs (six earned) of his own. On July 26, Botting pitched 5 innings of relief at Yankee Stadium to earn his first Major League win. Nolan Ryan had come out of the game after pitching one scoreless inning because he heard popping in his elbow. In relief, Botting allowed three hits, three walks, and one run, striking out six. The Angels won, 9-5. Botting's second and last win came on August 6, 1979, in a road game against the Oakland Athletics. He was the starting pitcher and allowed one run in 7 innings as the Angels beat the A's by a score of 5-2. In 1980, again splitting time between the Triple-A Salt Lake City Gulls of the Pacific Coast League and the Angels, he made six starts for California, going 0‚Äì3 with a 5.81 ERA. Botting's career totals for 18 games pitched included a 2‚Äì3 record, seven games started, and five games finished. He struck out 34, walked 28, and allowed 86 hits and 46 earned runs in 56 innings pitched. His ERA was 7.39, and his WHIP was 2.036. Botting left pro baseball after the 1980 season, which he spent in the Kansas City Royals' organization.

The novel follows Peony, a Chinese bondmaid of the prominent Jewish family of Ezra ben Israel's, and shows through her eyes how the Jewish community was regarded in Kaifeng at a time when most of the Jews had come to think of themselves as Chinese. The novel contains a hidden love and shows the importance of duty, along with the challenges of life.

His main village, also known as Saturiwa, was located on the south bank of the river near its mouth, and according to French sources he was sovereign over thirty other village chiefs. Chief Saturiwa was a prominent figure in the early days of European settlement in Florida, forging friendly relations with the French Huguenot settlers, who founded Fort Caroline in his territory. History Chief Saturiwa led the Saturiwa chiefdom in what is now Jacksonville, Florida, when French Huguenots under Jean Ribault explored the area in 1562. His people came into direct contact with the French when Fort Caroline was built by Ren√© Goulaine de Laudonni√®re two years later. The largest and best attested of the Timucua subgroup known as the Mocama, the Saturiwa occupied an area from the mouth of the St. Johns towards what is now downtown Jacksonville, and up and down the adjacent Atlantic coast from St. Augustine north to the St. Marys River.Deagan, Kathleen A. (1978) \\"Cultures in Transition: Fusion and Assimilation among the Eastern Timucua.\\" In Jerald Milanich and Samuel Procter, eds. Tacachale: Essays on the Indians of Florida and southeastern Georgia during the Historic Period. The University Presses of Florida. According to the French, Saturiwa was sovereign over thirty other villages and their chiefs, ten of whom were said to be his \\"brothers\\". French sources also record the name of his son, Athore. The powerful Saturiwa quickly forged an alliance with the French, hoping to secure their aid against his enemies, the Utina up river. However, Laudonni√®re reneged on his deal to help Saturiwa against the Utina, as he also wanted to pursue an alliance with them. Relations between the Saturiwa and the French soured for a time, but soon cordial relations were restored.Hann, John H. (1996). A History of the Timucua Indians and Missions, pp. 63‚Äì69. University Press of Florida. . When the Spanish conquered Fort Caroline and ejected the French in 1565, Saturiwa and his people were hostile to the Spanish, who allied with the Utina. In 1567 Saturiwa joined a coalition with two other tribes, the Potano and the Mayaca, against the Utina and their Spanish allies. The following year Saturiwa and his ally, Chief Tacatacuru, joined the French soldier Dominique de Gourgue in an attack on Fort Caroline. It is not known when Saturiwa died, but his people remained hostile to the Spanish until well into the 1570s. Saturiwa and his family are depicted in several of Theodor de Bry's engravings reputedly based on original drawings by Jacques le Moyne.

Produced by bass guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Chris Taylor, the album's title refers to vocalist Ed Droste's mother's house where the majority of recording took place. The album is the first to feature both Taylor and vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen, and received critical acclaim upon its release, significantly increasing the band's exposure. An EP, Friend, was released the following year featuring material recorded mostly during the same sessions. Background Following the release of Horn of Plenty in 2004, Grizzly Bear expanded from being the solo moniker for vocalist Ed Droste into a full band, with the addition of Horn of Plenty collaborator Christopher Bear, bassist and multi-instrumentalist Chris Taylor, and guitarist and vocalist Daniel Rossen. Christopher Bear noted, \\"Getting together the band for the live show changed things quite a bit, in terms of dynamics and instrumentation used. The songs [on Horn of Plenty] were quite simple and open ended so it left a lot of room for interpretation, which was great because it allowed us to get a band sound happening and working on a very reactionary level.\\" Recording With the four-piece band line-up in place, Grizzly Bear began recording at Ed Droste's mother's house on Cape Cod in July 2005, with bassist and multi- instrumentalist Chris Taylor adopting the role of producer. Drummer Christopher Bear stated, \\"A lot of the stuff we'd end up recording was really late at night, after voices had really warmed up, or after properly loosening up at our religious cocktail hour.\\" Following a month of initial tracking, each band member added individual overdubs at a later date, with Bear noting, \\"After the initial basic tracking month, a lot of things were added individually by everyone and a lot of those sounds were very time intensive. I couldn't imagine doing some of those things with everyone around, or feeling like you're on the clock at a studio.\\" Many of the demos for the album were what the band refers to as \\"sketches,\\" done by mostly singer/guitarists Daniel Rossen and Ed Droste. \\"Marla\\" itself is actually a song written by Droste's great aunt, a failed musician. As he explained in an interview with Pitchfork Media: The string arrangements on \\"Marla\\" were composed and performed by Owen Pallett, with Christopher Bear noting that their collaboration stemmed from his contribution to the band's remix album, Horn of Plenty (The Remixes) (2005). As Horn of Plenty was a solo effort by Droste, this record is truly the band's \\"debut\\" as it features all members contributing to the writing and production of the album. Recordings took place throughout July 2005 in the house of Droste's grandmother on Cape Cod. Writing and composition The addition of vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen to Grizzly Bear resulted in two primary songwriters existing within the band. Drummer Christopher Bear stated, \\"A lot of the songs are composed by Daniel and the way that he writes brings out another side of how the band interacts. In general, having four people with different ideas and strengths has changed our sound the most.\\" Regarding the album's lyrical and thematic content, Droste and bandmate Chris Taylor stated: \\"There is not really a theme with the lyrics but the theme of the album is us figuring out how to work together and recording in that house, which is what brought it together in that weird way.\\" Regarding his sexuality and its influence on his lyrics, Ed Droste stated: \\"I kind of like vague lyrics. Sometimes they are gay, but they're not overt. A lot of the lyrics on Yellow House Dan [Rossen] wrote and 'My love's another kind' could be interpreted that way, and I think he's very open to that interpretation, too, even though he was thinking of it as something else. That's why I relate to it when I sing those lyrics, because I'll sing those parts with him on the song. I think we all are into the vague nature of it.\\" Reception Yellow House has received universal acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 79, based on 19 reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The album received critical acclaim from several major publications, and ranked No. 8 in Pitchforks best albums of 2006 list, as well as a similarly high placement in the same list of the New York Times. Release In 2012, vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen reflected on its release, stating, \\"When we finished Yellow House, we were so young and so excited about the first record we made as the four of us. We were so deep in it, it was such a special thing at that time, such a romance releasing it. I don't know if it was like that for everyone but it certainly felt like it.\\" The first single, \\"Knife\\", was only released on 7-inch picture disc vinyl with the exclusive B-side \\"Easier\\" (alternate edit) on May 21, 2007. A music video for \\"Knife\\" was produced by Encyclopedia Pictura in 2007. A music video for \\"Central and Remote,\\" directed by Jesse Graziano, was also released in 2007.

It was first published by Del Rey Books in 1984. It was the seventh of Kurtz' Deryni novels to be published, and the first book in her third Deryni trilogy, The Histories of King Kelson. Although The Legends of Camber of Culdi trilogy was published immediately prior to the Histories trilogy, The Bishop's Heir is a direct sequel to Kurtz' first Deryni series, The Chronicles of the Deryni. Plot introduction The novel is set in the land of Gwynedd, one of the fictional Eleven Kingdoms. Gwynedd itself is a medieval kingdom similar to the British Isles of the 12th century, with a powerful Holy Church (based on the Roman Catholic Church), and a feudal government ruled by a hereditary monarchy. The population of Gwynedd includes both humans and Deryni, a race of people with inherent physic and magical abilities who have been brutally persecuted and suppressed for over two centuries. The novel begins over two years after the conclusion of High Deryni, shortly after the seventeenth birthday of King Kelson Haldane. As a recurring political rivalry threatens to erupt into open rebellion, Kelson must face a dangerous combination of new and old foes who rise up against him. Plot summary The Bishop's Heir details the events of a period of time lasting roughly a month and a half, beginning in late November 1123 and ending in early January 1124. The novel begins as the Curia of Bishops meets in Culdi to choose the successor to the deceased Bishop of Meara. The selection of the next bishop is a delicate matter, as the Mearans have made several attempts to secede from Gwynedd over the past century. King Kelson Haldane addresses the assembled clerics, then departs to make a survey of the local barons. Shortly thereafter, Kelson is reunited with Lord Dhugal MacArdry, an old friend who he has not seen since before his coronation, and the king decides to visit Dhugal's father, Earl Caulay MacArdry of Transha. While visiting Transha, Kelson learns more about Princess Caitrin Quinnell, the Mearan Pretender. Descended from the ancient line of Mearan rulers, Caitrin is determined to establish herself as queen of a free and independent Meara, a land which has been ruled by Gwynedd for over a century. However, Kelson is forced to return to Culdi after Duke Alaric Morgan contacts him and informs him that Duncan McLain has been attacked and wounded. Upon returning to Culdi, Kelson acknowledges the election of Bishop Henry Istelyn, who has been chosen as the new Bishop of Meara. Shortly after Kelson returns to his capital of Rhemuth, Dhugal is captured while attempting to stop the escape of Edmund Loris, the former Archbishop of Valoret who was imprisoned for his past treason. Loris takes Dhugal to the Mearan city of Ratharkin, where he places both Dhugal and Istelyn in confinement. When the news of Loris' escape and Dhugal's capture reaches Kelson, the king decides to make a daring winter raid on Ratharkin. Caitrin arrives in Ratharkin, accompanied by her children and her husband, Dhugal's uncle Sicard MacArdry. Although Istelyn refuses to assist Loris and Caitrin in their treason, Dhugal pretends to agree, hoping to find a way to warn Kelson. He eventually manages to escape Ratharkin, taking his cousin Sidana prisoner as he flees. Dhugal is rescued by Kelson's approaching forces, and Sidana's younger brother, Llewell, is also captured. Kelson gives Sicard until Christmas to surrender Loris, then returns to Rhemuth with Caitrin's two youngest children as hostages. Upon returning to Rhemuth, Kelson eventually bows to the pressure of his advisors and agrees to marry Sidana if her mother refuses to surrender, hoping to avert open rebellion by joining the two royal lines. A short time later, when Duncan is consecrated a bishop, the power of the ceremony nearly overwhelms Dhugal, who possesses mental shields that no human should have. When Christmas finally arrives, Caitrin's messenger brings Istelyn's severed head to court, openly defying the orders of the king. Although reluctant to marry a girl he barely knows and who has been raised to hate him, Kelson nevertheless follows through on his promise and asks Sidana to marry him. Sidana reluctantly agrees, but Llewell is furious at the possibility of his sister marrying his enemy. Two weeks of preparations ensue, during which time both Kelson and Sidana try to adjust to the realities of their approaching nuptials. On the morning of the wedding, Duncan recognizes a cloak clasp that Dhugal is wearing, which is the same clasp that Duncan gave his wife many years ago. Duncan tells the tale of his unusual marriage to Dhugal's mother, and Morgan uses his powers to confirm that Duncan is Dhugal's natural father. Realizing that he is part-Deryni, Dhugal is finally able to lower his shields, and father and son quickly exchange memories of their lives during their time apart. A short time later, Kelson and Sidana ride through Rhemuth to the castle, where the entire court waits to witness the marriage of their king and their new queen. Kelson and Sidana exchange their vows as man and wife, but the ceremony is suddenly interrupted when Llewell slashes his sister's throat, making a final desperate attempt to prevent the wedding. Morgan and Duncan frantically try to save Sidana, but she dies almost instantly. Stunned and horrified, Kelson can do nothing but hold the body of his dead bride and weep.

Career Early career Lushta was born on 22 January 1916 in Kosovska Mitrovica, Kingdom of Serbia (present day Mitrovica, Kosovo). It was in his hometown that he would begin to play football with the local club Rudari Trepƒça, where he quickly established himself as one of the most effective strikers the city and even region had ever seen. After spendin with Rudari Trepƒça Lushta two years left Kosovo in 1934 and went to Albania to join the Technical School \\"Harry Fultz\\" in Tirana and in that time he joined two time Albanian champions SK Tirana. His career with Tirana immediately took off, winning the league title in his first season in Albania, before going on to win it a total of four times between 1934 and 1939, as well as the inaugural King's Cup in 1939. He left Albania and SK Tirana in 1939 following the Italian occupation of Albania to join Bari in Italy, where he scored 3 times in 16 games during his first season in Italy. His performances with Bari attracted the interest of Juventus who he joined in 1940 after just one year with Bari. In his first season with Juventus he scored 9 times in 26 games before netting 15 goals the following season to be named the highest scoring foreigner of the 1941‚Äì42 Serie A.Personaggio gli Albanesi Riza Lushta Lushta with Juventus in the 1940‚Äì41 season Lushtas entered the parlor and football Serie A was done in red and white sweater Baris where Lushta in his first season scored three times in 19 matches. An unimpressive results may seem, but sufficiently startling to giants Juventus would bite on attracting over Albanian to the old lady. Back home staid in Turin and Juventus so exploded Lushta. In 26 games, he made nine goals the first season, of which he uppf√∂ljde this with the network 16 times in 28 matches for the season, of which he was the same year took a cuptitel with Juventus at incredibly great merit of Lushta yourself. In the finale was one against AC Milan, match result nailed 4‚Äì2 to Juventus which Lushta slammed into a hat-trick for Milan in the final. Total goals in the Cup that season landed on eight goals in six games. 24 goals in 34 games in total during the same year, of which a hat-trick on himself Milan in the final shot up the name Lushta to the skies in both Italy and the continent. A follow next year with 18 goals in 28 matches completed only the celebration of Lushta. His last year at Juventus (1944) could Lushta only 5 games, after making just as many goals in the opening games Napoli chose to release Albanian. How and why Juventus went along with this is still a major mystery among many puzzled supporters of both Juventus and football journalists. The same season successful Lushta slam into another seven pods for Napoli before Italy capitulated and Lushta chose to seek his fortune on the western front. But not with a rifle in his hand, but this time in the French league and the club AS Cannes, a short spell that Lushta ended when he got the offer to return to Italy and Alessandria, where he rounded off a new season with 17 goals before he finished his pro career with AC Siena. He chose for this to unwind in the slightly smaller clubs Forli and Rapallo Ruentes in Italy before 1953 ended his football career final. In the national team so the rumor is that Lushta played 35 games for Albania whom he scored 30 times. A total of superior hindsight against today's players, with the exception that contemporary games in almost 100% of cases were unofficial matches and Lushtas any record thus not officially today. Lushta died in February 1997 in Torino, it was rumored that Lushta for much of his adult life lived alone in Torino with no close family or very many friends. He was buried in the same city, the city where his name once echoed across the Olimpico after m√•lkavalkaderna. He is still today the Albanians who made the absolute most goals in the major leagues in Europe, and was also one of the largest during his time in Europe. A total of 68 goals in Serie A became the striker from Kosovo. Kosovo's largest football stadium in Mitrovica carry today his name. After a youth start with FK Rudari Trepƒça, he started his career at SK Tirana, and won four Albanian titles with the team (1934, 1936, 1937 and 1939, the latter one not recognized by the Albanian Football Association) and the first Albanian Cup in 1939. He then moved to Italy to play with A.S. Bari, and then Juventus F.C. (won one Coppa Italia in 1942), and Napoli, after which he went to France to play with AS Cannes. Eventually he went back to Italy and played with Alessandria, and then in Italian Third Division with Siena and in Italian Fourth Division with Forl√¨, and the Rapallo Ruentes, the team of Rapallo. He closed his career in 1954 at 38 years old. Overall, he played 170 matches in Serie A, scoring 68 goals; with Juventus, he played the Italian War Tournament 1943-44 (5 matches and 5 goal scored). He never played for the Albania national football team. He died at 80 years old. In Mitrovica, Kosovo, his birthplace, the city stadium currently bears his name.

Background  According to the unknown author of the Hudud al-'Alam, the Farighunid family was descended from the legendary Iranian king Afridun/Faridun. The English historian Clifford Edmund Bosworth suggests that the Farighunids had ancestral ties with the Afrighids, the ruling dynasty of Khwarazm. This is possibly supported by the fact that some chronicles refer to the Afrighids as the \\"Al Farighun of Kath\\". History Map of Khurasan and Transoxiana The first Farighunid amir mentioned is Ahmad ibn Farighun. Ahmad, together with the Banijurids, was compelled to recognize the Saffarid Amr ibn al-Layth as his suzerain. Only a short time afterwards, Amr ibn al-Layth was defeated and captured by the Samanids; Ahmad transferred his allegiance to them around this time. Later Ahmad married his daughter to his Samanid sovereign Nuh II. The Farighunids would remain Samanid vassals until the end of the 10th century. Ahmad was succeeded by his son Abu'l Haret Muhammad, whose reign marked the apex Farighunid authority and influence. The chiefs of the neighbouring regions of Gharchistan and Ghur acknowledged his overlordship. Abu'l Haret died probably some time after 982, and his son Abu'l Haret Ahmad was drawn into the conflicts that took place within the Samanid amirate during its decline. He was ordered by his suzerain Nuh II to attack the rebel Fa'iq, but was defeated by him. The Farighunids developed marriage alliances with the Ghaznavids; Abu'l Haret's daughter had married Mahmud, while Mahmud's sister had married Abu'l Haret's son Abu'l-Nasr Muhammad. Abu'l Haret assisted Sabuktigin's forces at Herat against Fa'iq and the Simjurids, a battle in which the Ghaznavids and Farighunids were victorious. The Ghaznavids soon afterwards supplanted the Samanids in Khurasan, and the Farighunids become Ghaznavid vassals. Abu'l Haret died in c. 1000 and Abu'l-Nasr Muhammad succeeded him. Abu'l-Nasr enjoyed the confidence of Mahmud of Ghazna; in 1008 he fought in the center of the Ghaznavid line against the Karakhanids near Carkhiyan and in the following year escorted Mahmud during his campaign in India. He also married off a daughter to Mahmud's son Muhammad of Ghazni. When Abu'l-Nasr died in around 1010, Muhammad took over the rule of Guzgan, even though Abu'l-Nasr had left a son, Hasan. This marked the end of Farighunid rule. Cultural significance The Farighunids had a significant impact of many prominent individuals in the arts and sciences at the time. Two great poets, Badi' al-Zaman al-Hamadani and Abu al-Fath al-Busti, addressed poems to them, and the author of the Hudud al-'Alam, the first geographical treatise to be written in New Persian, dedicated the work to Abu'l Haret Muhammad in 982/3. The Farighunids may also have had connections with the encyclopedist Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Khwarizmi and another encyclopedist named Isaiah ibn Farighun, who wrote the Jawame' al-'ulum for the Muhtajid amir Abu Ali Chaghani.

History The IBM Data Processing Division (DPD) sponsored five Scientific Center research groups in the United States and some others around the world to work with selected universities on a variety of customer-related projects.Melinda Varian, \\"VM and the VM Community: Past, Present, and Future\\", Princeton University Office of Computing and Information Technology, April 1991, pp. 22-50: \\"The Births of System/360, Project MAC, and the Cambridge Scientific Center\\" The IBM Research Division in Yorktown Heights, NY was a separate laboratory organization at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center that tended more to \\"pure\\" research topics. The DPD Scientific Centers in the late 1960s were located in Palo Alto, California, Houston, Texas, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Grenoble, France. The IBM Time-Life Programming Center in Manhattan, New York worked with the scientific centers but had a slightly different reporting line. Established by Norm Rasmussen, the Cambridge Scientific Center worked with computing groups at both MIT and Harvard, in the same building as Project MAC and the IBM Boston Programming Center (BPC). Additional joint projects involved the MIT Lincoln Laboratory on the outskirts of Boston and Brown University in Providence, RI. The scientific center in 1969 had three main departments: Computer Graphics under Craig Johnson, Operations Research under John Harmon, and Operating Systems under Richard (Rip) Parmelee. In December 1975 Richard MacKinnon became director of the center, succeeding Dr. William Timlake who, in turn, had succeeded Rasmussen. As the third director, MacKinnon was to serve as its longest- tenured director. During his tenure, Cambridge Scientific Center was responsible for a number of enhancements to the VM/370 operating system which became IBM's most popular interactive computing system. These included: an enhanced scheduler for the operating system based on the work of Lynn Wheeler; the VNET networking capability based upon the work of Edson Hendrick and Tim Hartman; multiprocessor support for the IBM asymmetric MPs, led by Howard Holley; IBM's first UNIX system under VM for the National Security Agency; a remote operations capability for VM led by Love Seawright and David Boloker and done in conjunction with the University of Maine, Orono {and which spread throughout IBM's processor lines}; a special controller which allowed ASCII terminals to access VM {done in conjunction with Yale university Comp Center and its director, Greydon Freeman} ; and the ASCII software support for the IBM PC which allowed PCs to access IBM and many other non-IBM mainframes {the work of Jim Perchik}. The VNET networking software became the basis for IBM's internal corporate data network {which had over 3,000 IBM processor nodes} and the university BITNET network which was facilitated by Cambridge in conjunction with Yale Computer Center {Grey Freeman} and CUNY computer center {Ira Fuchs}. MacKinnon served at Cambridge for 18 years and in July 1992 had the unenviable responsibility of closing CSC when IBM decided to close all its scientific centers worldwide. IBM closed the center on July 31, 1992.Melinda Varian, VM and the VM Community: Past, Present, and Future, April 1991, page 50 Selected publications R. J. Adair, R. U. Bayles, L. W. Comeau, and R. J.

At the National Exposition in Florence in 1861, Abbati was awarded a medal for his interior views‚Äîbut refused to accept it, as a gesture of protest against the composition of the jury. Subsequently, he became attracted to the practice of painting landscapes en plein air. His activity as a painter was interrupted during 1866 when he enlisted again in the army for the Third Independence War, during which he was captured by the Austrians and held in Croatia.Broude 1987, p. 128. Returning to civilian life at the end of the year, he moved to Castelnuovo della Misericordia and spent the final year of his life painting in the countryside.

Quebrada de las Flechas. The Calchaqu√≠ Valley () is an area in the northwestern region of Argentina which crosses the provinces of Catamarca, Tucum√°n, Jujuy and Salta. It is best known for its contrast of colours and its unique geography that ranges from the mountain desert to the subtropical forest. There are a number of valleys and rivers within the Calchaqu√≠ Valley that have their own name, such as the Quebrada del Toro (Gorge of the Bull), Valle de Lerma (Lerma Valley) near Salta city, the Quebrada de Escoipe formed by the Escoipe River, the Valle Encantado at the feet of the Cuesta del Obispo, the Quebrada de las Conchas of the Conchas River near Cafayate, the valley of the , and the Calchaqu√≠ River itself. These valleys were once inhabited by a number of tribes. Ruins of the Quilmes can be found in Tucum√°n. Other tribes of the area included the Calchaqu√≠es, Taf√≠, and the Yokavil (Santa Mar√≠a). Decades before facing the invasion of the Spanish colonization, the natives of these lands suffered the invasion of the Inca Empire. Among the most visited tourist attractions of the valley are Taf√≠ del Valle, Cafayate, Molinos, San Carlos, Santa Mar√≠a and Cachi at the western end of the valley, as well as the Los Cardones National Park, and the Los Sosa Provincial Park in Tucum√°n. In several parts of the valley there are numerous vineyards, specially in the Cafayate area. The natural reserve Quebrada de las Conchas or also known as Quebrada de Cafayate is located within the Calchaqu√≠es Valleys, in the province of Salta, north of the Argentine Republic, very close to the town of Cafayate. Located 90 km southwest of the city of Salta, it includes part of the departments of La Vi√±a, Guachipas and Cafayate and belongs to the dry chaco ecoregion and mountain range of saws and pockets. [1] This ravine is an area of great scenic beauty with very striking rock formations for their reddish colorations. In 1995 it was declared by decree No. 6806 as a managed natural reserve, with an area of 25784 ha, in order to protect the curious geological formations and high walls of unique landscape value, as well as an important paleontological site belonging to the period Cretaceous The ravine is a geologically modern accident, produced by tectonic movements that took place in the last two million years. Through the ravine and within the reserve runs the Conchas River where the trace of National Route 68, which connects the town of Cafayate with the city of Salta. In its route you can see landscapes of very varied colors and geoforms of great variety among which are the Garganta del Diablo and the amphitheater of reddish sedimentary rocks. In the past (when the past was humid) these formations were cascades of fresh water and that by the flow of concentrated water they were eroding the stone, which today astonish by its special configuration. Other geoforms that can be observed at the edge of the route are. The Amphitheater, The Friar, The Toad, Windows, Castles, etc. and about 7 km from Cafayate Los M√©danos, deposit of fine calcareous aeolian sands. [2] [3] Due to its rich archeological and historical past, the reserve has numerous fossil remains. [4] In the area near the Morales bridge, fossil frogs of the group of p√≠pidos are found. There are layers of marine and continental limestones very rich in fossils and even in dinosaur footprints. Also, the so-called stromatolites are presented. In the Yesera, there is an important fossil fish deposit, evidence of a process that would have occurred some 15 million years ago: the last entry of the sea to the continent. In recent archaeological investigations it was discovered that a few meters away from the current route 68 the Inca road ran, adding archaeological relevance to the site.

This skirmish is famously known in early American history as Lochry's Defeat. Biography Archibald Lochry was born 15 April 1733 at Octarano Settlement, started 1717, Chester Lancaster County Province of Pennsylvania to Jeremiah Loughry and Mary Murphy. Jeremiah born C.1700 Armagh came to Pennsylvania before 1725, Deed: Chester Co. 3/1725. The family first settled in Lancaster County. In 1737 they moved to York (Adams) where with four others bought 5000 acres known as \\"Carrolls Delight\\". About 1775, Archibald married Mary Erwin. (This may have been his second marriage, the first being in 1756). The Lochry family became prominent in Pennsylvania and Archibald Lochry was one of the strongest men in Westmoreland County. He also successfully acquired large tracts of land, which he used to support his fellow settlers. The colonists on the Pennsylvania frontier had been vulnerable to attack by Shawnee, Delaware, and Sandusky Indians, necessitating a blockhouse as an armory and safe haven between the forts at Hanna's Town and Ligonier. The blockhouse was built on Lochry's land. (In 2002, the Archaeological Institute of America reported that this blockhouse had been rediscovered and preserved as an historical landmark.) He began his military career on 18 July 1763 as an ensign in the Second Battalion in the provincial service. Both he and his brother William were appointed justices in Bedford County at its organization, and later when Westmoreland County was organized, he was made a justice there as well. In a listing of the deputies to the provincial convention held at Philadelphia, July 15, 1775, Lochry is named as a Westmoreland official in several capacities. In 1777 he was appointed County Lieutenant and Prothonotary in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. In 1778 he was clerk for both the Court of Quarter Sessions and the Orphans Court. In 1781 he was Clerk of Court, Westmoreland County, Pa. Also in 1781, Archibald was made a Colonel and given command over 100 men to discomfort Indian and British forces in the Ohio Valley during the Revolutionary War. Military expedition to Ohio Following the French and Indian War and during the colonization of Western Pennsylvania, Virginia and Kentucky, friction between Europeans and Native Americans was an almost constant feature. Repeated depredations and killings by Native Americans and by the European Americans had led to a breakdown in relations on the frontier and formerly neutral or friendly Indian leaders were now generally allied with the British against the Americans. In 1781, Lochry as the County Lieutenant for Westmoreland County and Colonel Daniel Brodhead, who commanded the Colonial forces at Fort Pitt were unable to agree upon a strategy for meeting Indian attacks upon colonial settlements on the frontiers of Pennsylvania and Ohio. As a result, no effective action was taken and attacks increased. Finally, General George Rogers Clark of Virginia came north to prosecute the war in Northern Virginia (now West Virginia) and Pennsylvania. Clark requested that Lochry organize a militia of Pennsylvania Rangers and join him. At the same time, George Washington ordered Broadhead to support the expedition with supplies and ammunition. The Indian activities were of such a grave concern to settlers that Lochry had no problem enlisting and organizing a unit of 107 men by July 1781. The plan of attack was developed by General Clark. It's declared mission was to take an army into the heart of the Indian country, to burn their houses, devastate their country, destroy their warriors, and to so weaken them that they would thereafter be unable to disturb the settlers of Western Pennsylvania. (Privately, Clark's grand objective was the capture of the British outpost at Detroit.) The specific attack strategy began with an expedition down the Ohio River in a manner to similar campaigns that Clark had led in the past. General Clark's plan was to divide his forces into two groups, one commanded by himself and the other commanded by Lochry. The two forces were to move down the Ohio River together and then split up. Lochry was to move north against the Sandusky tribe while Clark would go west and south, join up with troops from Kentucky and move against the Shawnee and Delaware. Once they had their enemies defeated, they would rejoin and march on Detroit to capture it from the British. Initially Clark's forces and Lochry's forces would be supplied at Ft Pitt, resupply at Fort Henry in Wheeling and then begin the trek down the Ohio River. Lochry's party of one hundred & seven mounted volunteers rendezvoused at Carnahan's Block House, eleven miles west of Hanna's town, on the July 24, 1781, but then things did not go as planned. They were delayed as they waited for supplies from Brodhead, which never materialized and so they began their march on 2 August. General Clark was already on his way toward Forth Henry. Rushing to catch up, Lochry's troops arrived on the 8th of August, only to find that Clark and all the men, boats and stores he could gather had departed just twelve hours earlier. Clark left a letter for Lochry, affixed to a pole, directing Lochry to follow him to the Falls of the Ohio. Clark was in a difficult situation. His troops were farmers and were desperate to get back home to start bringing in crops. They were deserting whenever he would stop for a period (Lochry apprehended a Lieutenant Baker and sixteen men who were deserting from Clark at Fishing creek.) So even though he needed to have a larger force for penetrating the enemy lands, he was also obliged to keep moving in order to curtail desertions. But, leading the way for Lochry, Clark was uncertain that Lochry was even following him and so, did not leave the supplies that Lochrey desperately needed. Though Lochry's troops were not deserting he also had a difficult situation. At Fort Henry, his stores and forage gave out. So, he detached a Captain Shannon with seven men in a small boat to overtake Clark and secure supplies. Shannon carried this letter with him: :::Wheeling, Augt. 8th, 1781. :::My dear General. ::::I arrived at this Post this moment. I find that there is neither Boats, provisions or ammunition left. I have sent a small canoe after you to know what is to be done. If you send back these articles mentioned and with directions where I will overtake you, I will follow. We are upwards of one hundred strong including Light Horse. ::::::I am, Sir, ::::::::Yours ::::::(Signed) A. Lockry. Shannon's party had not proceeded far when the Indians, who were carefully watching the expedition, captured him and all of his men. They also obtained the letter to General Clark detailing Lochry's situation. The Indians, having learned of his lack of ammunition, immediately arranged to attack Lochry. They called in their braves and raised a force of about 150 warriors. The attack party was commanded by George Girty, who along with his brother Simon Girty (a more notorious traitor), led the hostile Indians against the colonialists on the frontier. Captain Shannon's small group was forced to accompany the Indians for several days, while they followed Lochry down the river, at a discrete distance and waited the arrival of additional 500 men with which they intended ultimately to attack. \\"Lochry's defeat\\" Traveling down the middle of the Ohio River offered some protection against attacks. However, it also made it difficult for men and horses to obtain food. At about 10:00 in the morning on 24 August 1781, Lochry ignored the danger and ordered his men to put into shore on the north side of the Ohio River about ten miles below the mouth of the Big Miami, near the present town of Aurora, Indiana. The horses were left to graze, while the men killed a buffalo to prepare for their sustenance. Girty had his Indian scouts out along both banks of the river, and the news of the landing was immediately communicated to his now larger force of 648 warriors. Some of these men took up positions quietly on a bluff overlooking the sand bar where the Pennsylvania Rangers were located. Others approached stealthily from the opposite bank of the river. Once in position, they took the militia by surprise with a sudden volley of shots. The soldiers seized their arms and fought for their lives as long as they had ammunition. They then tried to escape in their boats but the Indians pursued and closed in on them before they could get away. Unable to escape or defend themselves, Col. Lochry surrendered. Every member of the expedition not already killed, was captured. Colonel Lochry was tomahawked by a Shawnee Indian after the battle while sitting on a log, and all the wounded who were unable to march were similarly dispatched. The prisoners were marched eight miles up the Miami River, subsequently taken to Detroit, and sent from there to Montreal. Along the way they were sold to the British. The average price for a soldier was one gallon of whiskey. The initial number of deaths was 37, however perhaps as few as 25 soldiers returned from captivity to describe what happened. In the intervening years, family and friends had no news of the expedition or the fate of the men. Even General Clark was not aware of Lochry's defeat until several months later. Lochry has been remembered to this day in the name of places near the battle site, including Laughery Creek and Laughery Island. Members of the expedition British officers confiscated letters and other information from the captured and dead militiamen. These documents have been re-discovered in England and help provide insights into the battle. Among the documents is a roster of the troops killed or captured. It may have been prepared by Simon Girty. In addition, some of the members officers who were captured kept records and pension applications make mention of some individuals in this group.

It premiered on Disney Channel on July 26, 1986 as a part of the channel's \\"Premiere Films\\" presentation (a precursor to the Disney Channel Original Movies banner). Hayley Mills is the only actress that returned from the original film. She continues to portray Susan and Sharon, the twins who were separated at age one, met up twelve years later at summer camp, switched places and went on to reunite their divorced parents. The film focuses on Sharon's daughter, Nikki, who tries to hook her mother up with her best friend Mary's father, portrayed by Tom Skerritt. It was a success for the Disney Channel and it later spawned two more made-for-television sequels, both produced in 1989.  Plot  The film takes place twenty-five years after the original film. Sharon Ferris (n√©e McKendrick) is divorced and living as a single mother in Tampa, Florida. Her daughter, Nikki, is not happy about their impending move to New York City and Sharon's decision to send her to an all- girls school in the fall. While in summer school, Nikki makes enemies with Jessica Dintruff (Tannen) but befriends Mary Grand. Mary's father, Bill Grand, has been widowed for four years. To stop Nikki from moving to New York City and to see their parents happily married, the girls scheme to set them up. Nikki and Mary trick their parents into meeting each other by sending Sharon flowers that are supposedly from Bill, but they do not just fall madly in love with each other as the girls had hoped, so they contact Sharon's twin sister, Susan Carey (n√©e Evers). She is married and still living in California. She is convinced by the girls to fly to Tampa to help them by posing as Sharon and going on a few dates just to get things started. Susan, disguised as Sharon, \\"accidentally\\" bumps into Bill at a bar called the Press Box and watches a few innings of a baseball game with him. The real Sharon detests baseball, and is confused when Bill drops by her workplace the next day and mentions how much fun they had. Susan and Bill cross paths a couple more times over the next few days. Florence (Cromwell) Bill and Mary's maid, begins to suspect that something is awry. Sharon discovers the girls' scheme and decides to trick them instead. She contacts Brian Carey (Harvey) Susan's husband, who is a pilot for Trans World Airlines, and involves him in her scheme. While Susan and Bill are on a date, the real Sharon and Brian pretend to also be on one, with Sharon dressed as a different woman. Susan becomes distracted and clumsy on her date while watching her husband. Finally having had enough, she announces to Bill that the man she is watching is her husband. She storms over to their table, but begins laughing when she sees her sister underneath a black wig. Susan and Sharon clear up the situation for Bill, and Sharon says that she does not have romantic feelings for him, and would like it if they just remained friends. A going away party is thrown for Sharon and Nikki on the boat of her boss, Mr. Elias. Sharon and Bill meet in the cabin while Nikki and Mary go get something from the car. The girls release the ropes from the boat and push it away from the dock. The guests begin arriving and watch helplessly as the boat drifts away. Sharon and Bill are enjoying each other's company, but wonder where everyone is. They go to the deck, see how far out they are from the shore, and then, Bill kisses Sharon. The scene switches to the wedding. Mary and Nikki are finally step-sisters and Nikki doesn't have to move to New York City.

On her interview with Good Morning America that year, Mills wasn't sure about reprising her role as the twins. \\"I was astonished. I thought what they wanted to do was try to repeat the original film in some way. I wasn't too sure that was a very good idea. It was a good film, and it has passed the test of time,\\" Mills said to the Chicago Sun-Times. \\"I did hesitate before saying yes,\\" said Mills, \\"first because it was always my favorite film and I wasn't sure about making a sequel. Second, because it's taken me so long to try to break away from my Disney image. It's been a real impediment toward getting the kind of roles I want. But everyone at Disney was so enthusiastic about the project that I finally agreed to do it. And I think it's turned out well.\\"A GROWN-UP HAYLEY MILLS FINDS PARENTING NO \`TRAP Mann, Roderick. Los Angeles Times 22 Feb 1986: 1. The film was written by Stuart Krieger. In the original draft of the script, Sharon was originally going to have a son, instead of a daughter like she does in the finished product. This was changed when rewrites of the script were ordered. The names of Nikki Ferris and Mary Grand are the same names of the characters that Mills portrayed in the Disney films The Moon-Spinners and In Search of the Castaways. Director Ronald F. Maxwell revealed that this was an homage to Mills' films with The Walt Disney Company. The characters of Walter and Lillian Elias are named after Walt Disney and his wife. (Disney's full name was Walter Elias Disney; Lillian was his wife's name.)  Filming  Ronald F. Maxwell was chosen to direct this sequel, taking over from the original's director David Swift. When the film premiered on the Disney Channel, a documentary titled On Location: Parent Trap II accompanied it. The documentary included footage of Mills as she describes the production of the film and her history with the Disney films.http://www.ultimatedisney.com/parenttrap-2moviecollection.html> Filming took place for three weeks in the Tampa area. The exteriors of Robert E. Lee Elementary and the interiors of Mitchell Elementary were used as the summer school that Nikki and Mary both attend. The film was shot in 18 days. \\"I never worked so hard in my life,\\" said Mills. A local Publix was used as the grocery store where Susan and Sharon narrowly miss meeting each other. It has been remodeled drastically since filming had wrapped.  Music  The film's score was composed by Charles Fox. The theme song is \\"Let's Keep What We've Got,\\" written by Hal David and performed by Marilyn McCoo. It appears in the opening credits while clips from the original The Parent Trap movie play, and is reprised in the closing credits when the final scene (Nicki and Mary, as junior bridesmaids/flower girls, walk up the aisle after their parents' wedding) is frozen. Other songs in the film include \\"Nothin' At All,\\" sung by Andrea Robinson, who would later voice Ariel's mother, Athena, in Disney's The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning, and \\"Stand Back,\\" sung by Stephanie Mills.

It combines characteristics of the health maintenance organization (HMO) and the preferred provider organization (PPO). The POS is based on a managed care foundation‚Äîlower medical costs in exchange for more limited choice. But POS health insurance does differ from other managed care plans. Enrollees in a POS plan are required to choose a primary care physician from within the health care network; this PCP becomes their \\"point of service\\". The PCP may make referrals outside the network, but with lesser compensation offered by the patient's health insurance company. For medical visits within the health care network, paperwork is usually completed for the patient. If the patient chooses to go outside the network, it is the patient's responsibility to fill out forms, send bills in for payment, and keep an accurate account of health care receipts. A point-of-service plan is like an HMO. It requires the policyholder to choose an in-network primary care doctor and to get referrals from that doctor if they want the policy to cover a specialist‚Äôs services. And a point-of-service plan is like a PPO in that it still provides coverage for out-of-network services, but the policyholder will have to pay more than if they used in-network services.

Before closing in 1995, the company produced many third-party products for the Commodore 64, Commodore 128, Amiga, Macintosh, Atari ST and PC computers. Overview The Lt. Kernal is the first third- party hard drive peripheral for Commodore computers. Originally developed by Fiscal Information in 1985, it was turned over to Xetec for manufacturing and customer support.Lt. Kernal history Xetec's best selling product is its line of printer interfaces, which allows the use of many models of non-Commodore parallel-interface printers with Commodore computers. Some of the popular printers of that era that are supported include Canon, C-Itoh, Star Micronix, Epson, NEC, Okidata, and Panasonic. Early interface models (such as the \\"Serial Printer Interface\\" and \\"Graphics Printer Interface\\") simply convert from Commodore's serial format to the more standard Centronics parallel interface, with only minimal ASCII conversions and graphic character printing. The Super Graphix Jr adds support for 50+ printers and \\"Near Letter Quality\\", which is a technique of using multi-pass graphic printing to achieve higher quality text printing. The more sophisticated Super Graphix also adds an 8K data buffer, screen dump support, two user-loadable fonts (from a library of fonts on the included disk), and a font creation program. The Super Graphix Gold adds a 32K buffer, 4 fixed and 4 user-loadable fonts (from a library of fonts on disk), 10 font printing effects, picture printing, built-in screen dump programs, fast-serial support, and the rather unusual ability to interface a printer directly to a disk drive (for printing pictures and loading fonts directly from disk).Scanned Xetec user manuals The Fontmaster line of word processing software provides Commodore users the ability to exploit the graphics capabilities just emerging in printers of the day in order to produce documents containing a mixture of font styles, sizes and effects as well as embedded pictures. Although lacking the power and flexibility of word processors available today, it was ground-breaking in its day, winning an Outstanding Original Programming award at the 1985 Consumer Electronics Show. Fontmaster 128 was featured in the 1987 Consumer Electronics Show Software Showcase. Xetec's offerings for the Amiga include SCSI interfaces, hard drives, CD-ROM drives, streaming tape drives, and RAM expansion. Xetec was the first to offer the popular Fish disks collection on CD-ROM with their three-volume set of Fish & More discs. Xetec also developed a few products for Macintosh and PC computers, products for the RC hobby market, and spent a number of years in research and development of solid-state fluorescent lighting ballasts, for which Jon Flickinger holds two patents. In summary, Xetec's total list of products include these: Lt.

Usually located in the signal box, the levers are operated either by the signalman or the pointsman. The world's largest lever frame (191 levers) is thought to have been in the Spencer Street No.1 signal box in Melbourne, Australia, which was decommissioned in 2008. The largest operational lever frame, meanwhile, is located at Severn Bridge Junction in Shrewsbury, England, and it contains 180 levers, although most of them have been taken out of use.  Overview  Lever frame of the signal box Hausen im Tal, Germany: the signals are operated by the red levers, blue levers with Arabic numerals are for points and blue levers with Roman numerals are for track locks. The box on the right of the lever frame is used for manual block signalling; the smaller green levers are used for operating the route locks. The interlocking apparatus is in the box behind the levers. A three-lever ground frame at Kyle of Lochalsh, released by Annett's key The lever frame is located in the signal box, which can be a building at ground level or a tower, separated from or connected to an existing station building. Early lever frames were also built as ground frames next to the track, without any form of shelter and were usually operated by traincrew and not permanently staffed. Especially in England, lever frames with the pivot underneath the floor of the signal box were common (as seen on the photo on the left).Cauer: Sicherungsanlagen im Eisenbahnbetriebe, p. 122 This design's relatively short lever angle is a major disadvantage, as it requires more force to move the lever. Therefore, later, especially in Germany, lever frames with pivots inside the signaller's room were used, that allow for a lever angle of approximately 180¬∞ (as seen on the photo on the right).Cauer: Sicherungsanlagen im Eisenbahnbetriebe, p. 123 By the movement of individual levers (or sometimes cranks), signals, points, track locks, level crossing gates or barriers and sometimes movable bridges over waterways are operated via wires and rods. The signaller chooses the correct combination of points, facing point locks and signals to operate, which will control the movement of each train through their area of control. The lever frame contains interlocking designed to ensure that the levers cannot be operated to create a conflicting train movement. Each interlocking installation is individual and unique to the location controlled. The interlocking may be achieved mechanically or by electric lever locks, or (more usually) a combination of both. Signals or points located some distance away from the signal box are sometimes electrically rather than mechanically operated. Movement of the controlling lever operates an electrical circuit controller. In the UK, it is practice to cut short the handles of any levers controlling electrical apparatus, to remind signalmen that little effort is required to move them. Mechanical lever frames and interlocking have now largely been replaced by modern, much larger electrical or electronic route interlockings located in Power Signal Boxes and more recently Integrated Electronic Control Centres which are able to control much larger areas of the rail network.  Variants   Mechanical lever frames  Interlocking apparatus behind the levers (L√ºdinghausen railway station) A mechanical lever frame is designed to harness mechanical advantage to operate switch points, signals or both under the protection of the interlocking logic. The levers are connected to field appliances via solid pipes or taut wires such that the full travel of the lever will reliably cause full travel in the appliance. Each lever is engaged with the interlocking logic such that movement of the lever is only possible when all necessary conditions are met. The interlocking may be mechanical, electric (via solenoids) or both with the apparatus being mounted horizontally behind the lever frameCauer: Sicherungsanlagen im Eisenbahnbetriebe, p. 125 or vertically below it. To assist the operator in determining their functions, each lever in a frame will generally be uniquely labelled, one common method being to number the levers in order from left to right. A lever's identification may be painted on its side or engraved on a badge or plate fitted either to the lever or behind it. This may be accompanied by a description of the lever's function. Usually, a large track diagram is positioned within easy view of the operator, which clearly shows each lever number adjacent to symbols representing the items of equipment that they operate. Levers are commonly coloured according to the type of equipment they control, the code of colours varying between different railway administrations. For example, in British practice, the following code generally applies: a red lever controls a stop signal or shunt signal, a yellow lever controls a distant signal, a black lever controls a set of points, a blue lever controls a facing point lock, and a white lever is spare. Brown levers are used to lock level crossing gates. Lever handles are usually of polished, unpainted steel, and signalmen operate them with a cloth to prevent rusting from the sweat on their hands. In Germany, signal levers are red, whilst levers for points and track locks are usually blue, and route lock levers are green. Also, individual numbers and letters are used to indicate each individual item a lever operates in Germany as well.Cauer: Sicherungsanlagen im Eisenbahnbetriebe, p. 126 Some mechanical frames were combined with a set of electric levers or switches to more efficiently work electrically powered signals or other non-mechanically operated devices.http://www.rrsignalpix.com/tower_delray.php Typically the switch points would be left under mechanical operation as the other devices used comparatively little electrical power and could be run off of batteries or a low capacity railroad-operated power system.  Power frames  Everglades Junction signal box with its Westinghouse Brake & Signal Co. Ltd. Style 'L' Power Lever Frame Power frame, type Siemens M43 A power operated interlocking frame uses some form of power assist to operate switches, signals and other interlocking appliances in the field. The power can come from hydraulic, pneumatic or electric sources with direct acting or low voltage electric control.Cauer: Sicherungsanlagen im Eisenbahnbetriebe, pp. 250 The use of mechanical levers is retained in order to engage a mechanical interlocking component, in addition to switches or valves needed to actuate the field appliances. In hydraulic lever frames, moving the lever operates a hydraulic valve rather than wires and rods. To prevent accidents, operating a set of points requires pulling the actual lever for the points and a secondary check lever. The points are then moved by a hydraulic motor. This type of power frame has the disadvantage of a relatively low distance between points and signal box (approximately 200‚Äì250 m) and a slow operating speed. It was common in Italy and France only.Cauer: Sicherungsanlagen im Eisenbahnbetriebe, p. 250 Pneumatic lever frames have an operating principle that is related to that of hydraulic lever frames, however, instead of a hydraulic liquid, compressed air is used. The two types also share the same disadvantages such as pressurized tubing having to run directly between the field appliance and the lever frame. Electric control of a hydraulic or pneumatic actuator in the field was far simpler and more reliable, allowing for a greater distance between signal box and points. Whilst first being common in the United States due to work by the Union Switch and Signal corporation (a division of WABCO), this system was later used in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth nations,Cauer: Sicherungsanlagen im Eisenbahnbetriebe, p. 251 where the Westinghouse Air Brake Company had a presence. In Austria, Siemens & Halske built a fully electric power frame in 1894, which does not rely on compressed air. Instead, electric motors move the points. Later, this system was also used in Germany.Cauer: Sicherungsanlagen im Eisenbahnbetriebe, p. 252 In the United State the Taylor Signal Corporation, later merged into General Railway Signal developed an electrically powered interlocking system that made use of mechanical slides to engage traditional mechanical locking. Union Switch and Signal later modified their electro-pneumatic system to all-electric as early as 1896. A major issue with power frames was ensuring that the position of the levers on the frame correctly represented the position of the switch or other appliance in the field. Unlike a mechanical linkage, pneumatic or hydraulic lines could leak and cause points to drift out of correspondence with disastrous consequences. The Taylor/GRS electric power frame system used a feature called \\"dynamic indication\\" where the back EMF generated when the electric motor reached the limit of travel would signal the interlocking logic that the points had finished moving, but not the position of the points on an ongoing basis.Railway Signaling and Communications, Volume 9, #7, pg 209 This and other open loop systems designed in the 19th and early 20th centuries to save on costly relays, were replaced by closed loop systems after a number of accidents. In North America this is known as \\"Switch-Signal\\" protection and any change in the position of a field appliance will immediately set the electric signals controlled by a power frame to danger.Railroad Operation and Railway Signaling, Edmund John Phillips, pg. 155-158 Since power frames still utilize traditional mechanical interlocking logic, some form of mechanical operating mechanism is still necessary. However, since the signals and points are worked by an external source of power, little mechanical effort is needed to move the levers and they could both be miniaturized and reshaped. The simplest form of power frame lever is simply a smaller version of a traditional lever. General Railway Signal was known for its \\"pistol grip\\" style levers that work slides moving in and out from a horizontal frame. Union Switch and Signal modified the Saxby and Farmer tappet interlocking system, dispensing with the straight lever entirely and placing a rotating crank onto the locking spindle (although in the UK the Westinghouse Brake & Saxby Signal Co. modified this design to resemble a traditionally shaped miniature lever.) In continental Europe there were many miniature lever designs, although Siemens & Halske made use of short knobs that were rotated by the operator.  Manufacturers  In the UK, larger railway companies like the Great Western Railway (GWR) and the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) developed their own mechanical interlocking systems, whilst most smaller independent railway companies installed signalling products and systems bought from such firms as The Railway Signal Company (RSC) and The Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company (WB&SCo;). ;This list contains manufacturers of lever frames *Aster (France) *Bianchi-Servettaz (Italy) *Fiebrandt & Co (Germany) *Max J√ºdel & Co (Germany) *The Railway Signal Company (United Kingdom) *Scheidt & Bachmann (Germany) *Siemens & Halske (Germany) *Stahmer (Germany) *Vereinigte Eisenbahn- Signalwerke (Germany) *The Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company (United States and United Kingdom)  Photo gallery  Image:Signal box inside.jpg|Inside a signal box on the Isle of Wight Steam Railway Image:Hancock-lever-frame.jpg|Mechanical lever frame in Hancock tower, USA Image:Rail levers.jpg|Signal levers, Switzerland Image:Lever frame Oban Tower SRM.jpg|Oban, Saskatchewan, Canada Image:McK&H; Eastgates Frame.jpg|McKenzie & Holland lever frame at Eastgates signal box, Colchester, UK Image:Cromer Beach Frame.JPG|Railway Signal Company lever frame at Cromer Beach signal box, Cromer, UK Image:Oulton Broad Swing Bridge012.JPG|View of the frame in the locking room showing how it is installed within the signal box.

It is endemic to the south west of Australia, occurring at the coastal plain, jarrah forest and wheatbelt regions, often at the ancient granite outcrops of Western Australia.  Description  Hakea petiolaris grows as an erect shrub or tree up to in height. The leaves have a distinctive pale-grey colour and are long and wide. The flowers are arranged in groups that appear on small branches or in the forks of branches. The groups are roughly spherical and contain 120 to 200 individual flowers. Each flower is long and white or cream in colour with the perianth, (the non-reproductive part of the flower) ranging in colour from pink to purple. Flowering is followed by woody seed capsules which are long and wide. Each capsule splits into valves and releases 2 dark brown or black winged seeds.  Taxonomy  Hakea petiolaris was first described by Carl Meissner in 1845, using a collection made at York by Ludwig Preiss. The specific epithet (petiolaris) is derived from the Latin word petiolus meaning \\"small, slender stalk\\". The Latin epithet petiolaris refers to the leaves presentation on conspicuous stalks. There are three subspecies, differing in the sizes of their leaves and the colour of the perianth as it ages. * Hakea petiolaris Meisn. subsp. petiolaris has flowers that darken to mauve and then pink and has smaller leaves than those of the other subspecies. It is a shrub or small tree, one to two metres high, possesses a lignotuber and flowers in June. * Hakea petiolaris subsp. trichophylla Haegi flowers darken to mauve and then maroon. It is a large shrub or tree, greater than three metres in height and sometimes attaining nine metres. It releases seed stored in its capsules rather than regenerating from a lignotuber in response to fire and flowers from April to June. The hairs on the leaves, that shine grey-green during flowering, are persistent; this is referred to in the epithet trichophylla, that is derived, according to Haegi from the Greek (Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. Revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie.Oxford: Clarendon Press., gen. ; 'hair') and (; 'leaf'). * Hakea petiolaris subsp. angusta Haegi which has flowers that darken to mauve and then pinkish mauve. A shrub or small tree, 1‚Äì2 m high, it flowers from March to May. The epithet angusta is a Latin word meaning \\"narrow\\". Distribution and habitat * Subspecies petiolaris grows in Jarrah forest, usually near granite outcrops between the Darling Range and York in the Avon Wheatbelt, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. * Subspecies trichophylla grows near granite outcrops in shrubland near Wongan Hills and with disjunct populations near Kununoppin and Tuttanning Nature Reserve east of Pingelly in the Avon Wheatbelt, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. * Subspecies angusta is only known from a few small populations growing around granite outcrops near Pingaring in the Mallee biogeographic region. Conservation All three subspecies of H. petiolaris are listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Cultivation Bees in Hakaea petiolaris flowers, cultivars in Swan Valley, Western Australia The species is propagated from seed, establishing itself as a large shrub, or a tree to around ten metres, the width is around two metres. The horticultural applications include use as a screening plant or hedge, or displayed as individual specimens. It is a fast growing and hardy species, frost resistant, bird attracting and has good potential as a feature plant. Hakea petiolaris is recommended for the attractive appearance of its flowers and attraction for birds. Clusters of dullish red flowers, contrasted by white styles, are presented at the leaf axis in the austral autumn or winter. The plant is successfully grown in the urbanised sub-coastal regions of southern Australia. The most common subspecies in cultivation is H. petiolaris subsp. trichophylla.  Ecology  The presentation of flowers at the stem (cauliflory) may be a relictual characteristic of a time when tall forest dominated the region and pollinators such as birds moved within the dense leaf canopy of under-storey species.

It was not authorized by Union military authorities but was the work of an informal group of anti-slavery Kansas \\"Jayhawkers\\". The town of 2,077 people https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1860/population/1860a-23.pdf was plundered and burned to the ground, 200 slaves were freed and nine local citizens were court-martialed and executed. Background Following Sterling Price's secessionist Missouri State Guard victory over General Nathaniel Lyon's Union army at the Battle of Wilson's Creek, Price continued his goal of keeping control of Missouri from the Unionists. Guerilla leader James H. Laneoften called the leader of the Jayhawkersorganized 1,200 troops to resist Price's invasion into Kansas. Price defeated Lane at the Battle of Dry Wood Creek near Fort Scott, Kansas. Lane retreated and Price continued his offensive further into Missouri to the Siege of Lexington. While Price moved North, Lane launched an attack behind him. After crossing the Missouri border at Trading Post, Kansas on September 10, Lane began an offensive moving East on Butler, Harrisonville, Osceola and Clinton, Missouri. Osceola The climax of the campaign was on September 23, 1861, at Osceola, where Lane's forces drove off a small Southern force and then looted and burned the town. An artillery battery under Capt. Thomas Moonlight shelled the St. Clair County courthouse. According to reports, many of the Kansans got so drunk that when it came time to leave they were unable to march and had to ride in wagons and carriages. They carried off with them a tremendous load of plunder, including as Lane's personal share a piano and a quantity of silk dresses. Lane led hundreds of slaves to Kansas and freedom. The troops moved northwest and arrived at Kansas City, Missouri, on September 29, to pursue Price as he retreated south through the state. Osceola was captured and then plundered, with Lane's men freeing 200 slaves and taking 350 horses, 400 cattle, 3,000 bags of flour, and quantities of supplies from all the town shops and stores as well as carriages and wagons. Nine local men were rounded up, given a quick drumhead court-martial trial, and executed. All but three of the town's 800 buildings burned; the town never fully recovered.Spurgeon, Ian (2009), Man of Douglas, man of Lincoln: the political odyssey of James Henry Lane, University of Missouri Press, pp. 185‚Äì88Petersen, Paul R.

The only known proteins containing the hypusine residue is eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) and a similar protein found in archaebacteria. In humans, two isoforms of eIF-5A have been described: eIF5A-1 and eIF5A-2. They are encoded by two distinct genes EIF5A and EIF5A2. The protein is involved in protein biosynthesis and promotes the formation of the first peptide bond. The region surrounding the hypusine residue is highly conserved and is essential to the function of eIF5A. Thus, hypusine and eIF-5A appear to be vital for the viability and proliferation of eukaryotic cells. Hypusine is formed in eIF-5A by post-translational modification of one of the lysyl residues. Two reactions and two enzymes are involved: *1. Deoxyhypusine synthase catalyzes the cleavage of the polyamine spermidine and transfer of its 4-aminobutyl moiety to the Œµ-amino group of one specific lysine residue of the eIF-5A precursor to form deoxyhypusine and 1,3-diaminopropane. *2. Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase mediates the formation of hypusine by addition of a hydroxyl group to the deoxyhypusine residue. An excess of hypusine was found in the urine of children and patients with familial hyperlysinemia. Hypusine was first isolated from bovine brain by Japanese scientists Shiba et al. in 1971. The name hypusine indicates that the molecule comprises moieties of hydroxyputrescine and lysine.

After its introduction to the stage by the Virginia Minstrels in 1843, \\"Miss Lucy Long\\" was adopted by rival troupes. George Christy's cross-dressed interpretation standardized the portrayal of the title character and made the song a hit in the United States. \\"Miss Lucy Long\\" became the standard closing number for the minstrel show, where it was regularly expanded into a comic skit complete with dialogue. Versions were printed in more songsters and performed in more minstrel shows than any other popular song in the antebellum period. In blackface minstrelsy, the name Lucy came to signify any sexually promiscuous woman.  History  The first published edition of \\"Miss Lucy Long\\" is uncredited in an 1842 songster called Old American Songs. Billy Whitlock of the Virginia Minstrels later claimed the song in his autobiography: \\"I composed ... 'Miss Lucy Long' (the words by T. G. Booth) in 1838.\\"Nathan 42 note 17. Despite predating the minstrel show, \\"Miss Lucy Long\\" gained its fame there.Mahar 406 note 52. The song was the first wench role in minstrelsy. The Virginia Minstrels performed it as their closing number from their earliest performances. Dan Gardner introduced what would become the standard Lucy Long costume, skirts and pantalettes.Nathan 39. George Christy's interpretation for the Christy Minstrels became the standard for other troupes to follow.Knapp 54. The New York Clipper ignored Gardner completely and wrote \\"George [Christy] was the first to do the wench business; he was the original Lucy Long.\\"New York Clipper, December 8, 1866. Quoted in Mahar 405‚Äì6 note 51. By 1845, the song had become the standard minstrel show closing number,Mahar 20. and it remained so through the antebellum period.Knapp 54, 68. Programs regularly ended with the note that \\"The concert will conclude with the Boston Favorite Extravaganza of LUCY LONG.\\"Mahar 307, 405 note 50, quoting several playbills. The name Lucy came to signify a woman who was \\"sexy, somewhat grotesque, and of suspect virtue\\" in minstrelsy. Similar songs appeared, including \\"Lucy Neal\\". In the late 1920s, a dance called the Sally Long became popular; the name may derive from the minstrel song.Oliver 45. Musicologist Robert B. Winans found versions of \\"Miss Lucy Long\\" in 34% of minstrel show programs he examined from the 1843‚Äì52 period and in 55% from 1843‚Äì47, more than any other song.Winans 147‚Äì8. Mahar's research found that \\"Miss Lucy Long\\" is the second most frequent song in popular songsters from this period, behind only \\"Mary Blane\\". The song enjoyed a resurgence in popularity from 1855‚Äì60, when minstrelsy entered a nostalgic phase under some companies.Mahar 36. Lyrics Many different \\"Miss Lucy Long\\" texts are known.Mahar 307. They all feature a male singer who describes his desire for the title character. In the style of many folk song narratives, most versions begin with the singer's introduction:Mahar 307‚Äì8. Compare this later recorded version by Joe Ayers: For nineteenth-century audiences, the comedy of \\"Lucy Long\\" came from several different quarters. Eric Lott argues that race is paramount. The lyrics are in an exaggerated form of Black Vernacular English, and the degrading and racist depictions of Lucy‚Äîoften described as having \\"huge feet\\" or \\"corncob teeth\\"‚Äîmake the male singer the butt of the joke for desiring someone whom white audiences would find so unattractive.Mahar 311, quoting Lott. However, in many variants, Lucy is desirable‚Äîtall, with good teeth and \\"winning eyes\\".Mahar 308. Musicologist William J. Mahar thus argues that, while the song does address race, its misogyny is in fact more important. \\"Miss Lucy Long\\" is a \\"'public expressions of male resentment toward a spouse or lover who will not be subservient, a woman's indecision, and the real or imagined constraints placed on male behaviors by law, custom, and religion.\\"Mahar 310‚Äì1. The song reaffirms a man's supposed right to sexual freedomMahar 309. and satirizes courtship and marriage.Mahar 311. Still, the fact that the minstrel on stage would desire someone the audience knew to be another man was a source of comic dramatic irony. The refrain is simple: However, its meaning is more difficult to identify and varies depending on the preceding verse. For example: The verse makes Lucy out to be a \\"sexual aggressor who prefers 'tarrying' (casual sex, we may infer) to marrying. ... \\" The singer for his part seems to be in agreement with the notion.Knapp 68. Thus, Lucy is in some way in charge of their relationship. Of course, audiences could easily take \\"tarry\\" as either a sexual reference or an indication of a prim and reserved Lucy Long. However, other verses put the power back in the male's hands. For example, this verse makes Lucy no better than a traded commodity: In the Ayers version of the song, Miss Lucy and the male singer are already married. The lyrics further subvert Lucy's ability to control the sexual side of the relationship: The singer later promises to \\"fly o'er de river, / To see Miss Sally King.\\"Quoted in Mahar 309. He is the head of the relationship, and Lucy is powerless to stop him from engaging in an extramarital affair. Lucy's social freedom is limited to dancing the cachucha and staying home to \\"rock the cradle\\".Mahar 309‚Äì10. \\"Miss Lucy Long and Her Answer\\", a version published in 1843 by the Charles H. Keith company of Boston, Massachusetts, separates the song into four stanzas from the point of view of Lucy's lover and four from Lucy herself. She ultimately shuns \\"de gemman Dat wrote dat little song, Who dare to make so public De name ob Lucy Long\\" and claims to prefer \\"De 'stinguished Jimmy Crow.\\"Quoted in Nathan 39. Structure and performance \\"Miss Lucy Long\\" is a comic banjo tune, and there is little melodic variation between published versions. Nevertheless, the tune is well-suited to embellishment and improvisation. The verses and refrain use almost identical music, which enabled troupes to vary the verse/chorus structure and to add play-like segments. A repeated couplet binds the piece together and gives it a musical center around which these embellishments can occur.Cockrell 169. The lyrics of the comic banjo tune, are written in exaggerated African American Vernacular English and tell of the courtship or marriage of the male singer and the title character. \\"Miss Lucy Long\\" satirizes black concepts of beauty and courtship and American views of marriage in general. The song is misogynistic; the male character dominates Lucy and continues his sexually promiscuous lifestyle despite his relationship with her. Minstrels usually performed the song as part of a sketch in which one minstrel cross dressed to play Lucy Long. The blackface players danced and sang with regular interruptions of comic dialogue. The part of Lucy was probably not a speaking role and relied entirely on pantomime. For example, in 1846, Dan Emmett and Frank Brower added these lines to a \\"Miss Lucy Long\\" sketch: Notes References * Cockrell, Dale (1998). \\"Nineteenth-century popular music\\".

As of 2007, Ilima is living in Niut≈çua and working in Nuku ªalofa at the Tongan ministry of training, employment, youth and sports. Although the king was unmarried and had no legal heir, Tongan constitution and culture dictate that it was not possible for him to raise his illegitimate daughter to higher ranks in the monarchy. The articles in the constitution of Tonga regarding the country's line of succession state clearly that only a child of a legal marriage can succeed the throne of his or her parent. Additionally, in traditional Tongan culture, one may inherit land and status from one's father, but one's rank in society is determined solely by one's mother. In a hypothetical situation in which a beggar marries a queen and has a son who chooses to follow in his father's footsteps, Tongan culture dictates that the son would sit as a royal among the chiefs of the country. In a hypothetical situation that is reversed, for example a prince marries a woman of no rank, the child would be like any other commoner of the country in the eyes of the country's chiefs, even if he became, for example, a rich and influential businessman.

Thus, humanitarian use licenses set the conditions for the provision of access to innovations for people in need at a royalty free basis or at lower costs. Humanitarian use licenses assure that products of research and development stay publicly available and that at the same time the incentive function of exclusive intellectual property rights are maintained. The intellectual property rights system Humanitarian use licenses represent a tool to distribute the outcomes of research and development more equally. They relax the exclusive claims of intellectual property rights with more permissive licenses for developing countries. Intellectual property is an umbrella term for various legal entitlements which attach to certain types of information, ideas, or other intangibles in their expressed form. The term intellectual property reflects the idea that this subject matter is the product of the mind or the intellect, and that these rights may be protected by law in the same way as any other form of property. There are several functions related to these rights that make them work as a catalyst for the market. But there are also fundamental differences between the economic and social conditions of developed countries and developing countries. Hence, conventional licensing practices have caused distortions that make humanitarian use licenses a tool worth considering.  Incentive function  The holder of a legal Intellectual Property Right is generally entitled to exclude others for a period of time. This gives the owner a comparative advantage over others for a limited time. Thus, innovative activity is rewarded, which stimulates research and development. But many developing countries are characterized by a weak research and development sector. Of the 400,000 inventions for which patent applications are submitted annually, developing countries take part in 1 percent whereas the United States, the USSR, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Japan participate in 73 percent. (Vestry Besarovic) This makes the industrial sector of developing countries largely dependent on imitation. Universally imposed minimum standards of patent protection, as the TRIPS (Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) requires, are not likely to contribute to economic growth unless a particular level of development has been achieved (Thompson and Rushing). When developing countries have to purchase expensive technology because of a protective regime to comply with TRIPS, it can lead to the breakup of industries and thus reduce economic growth.  Transaction function  Transaction costs hinder development on whether there is a sufficient resource commitment from industry. This factor influences the relative price of a patent and its relative utility. In economies that have to rely on imitation yet clear laws are unlikely to stimulate innovation. Protection gains importance at higher stages of development when it serves to stimulate. Until this stage is reached, the relative benefits for facilitating transactions will not outweigh the relative costs of hindering technology application.  Disclosure function  Patent applications must disclose how the claimed invention functions. This disclosure allows persons skilled in the art to make use of the innovation. As new technologies are applied, further innovations can be built on existing ones. But rates of secondary and university education are much lower in developing countries than they are in developed countries. Along with the lack of capital flows into research and development, this lowers the potential for adoption of new technology and the development of innovations. Thus, the information disclosed in a patent becomes useless, as the preconditions for taking advantage of the information do not exist in developing countries. Inequalities in the global intellectual property rights system The effects of the globally imbalanced power relations are best illustrated by looking at sectors strongly concerned with IPR, medicine and agriculture. These sectors are also crucial for development as they serve the basic needs of people. They can be harmful as they cover consumer products. For example, patent protection for drugs keeps the price high and inhibits competitors from introducing cheaper generic versions. In agriculture, the patenting of genes or certain properties of crops can make the use of these crops costly and burdensome. Access to varieties that have long been used by farmers can be restricted, and as a result markets can be destroyed. An illustrative example for this is the case of the Enola bean, where a field bean variety showing a certain colour was patented. Subsequently, the licensor required all importers of Mexican beans to pay royalties, which would have caused a significant drop in export sales of beans from Mexico. But protection may also hinder development in intermediate stages, as it covers not only final products, but also intermediate products, processes and tools to create those products. Thus, protections covering biotechnology can decrease the development of and access to new technologies in developing countries, thus preventing new crops or drugs from being developed. Moreover, drugs for tropical diseases and crops adapted to tropical conditions have been developed only to a limited extent. The purchasing power in these countries is low and thus there are no lucrative markets. Although only 10% of the global disease load occurs within industrialised countries, 90 percent of global drug investment goes toward the drugs for industrialized countries. Projects that address diseases of developing countries such as malaria and tuberculosis receive comparatively little funding. Stimulating research and development Technologies can be provided that stimulate the development of needed and to local conditions adapted products. Companies and research institutes in the specific countries are able to produce and develop at lower costs and know the local needs and problems best. Technology can benefit the poor farmer or the sick people that are in need of drugs or food as well as the economy as a whole. Providing consumer products Humanitarian Use Licenses have the potential to enhance the supply of important consumer products. When cheap or cost free licenses are granted to companies in developing countries, it would be possible for them to produce copies of drugs or seeds to provide the population with. Apart from missing royalty payments companies in developing countries will possibly be able to produce and distribute at a much lower price than companies in wealthier countries. How it works Defining the population that should benefit and the institutions that can serve the needs of this population is required in the humanitarian use licensing scheme. Depending on the different technologies that should be assigned via the Humanitarian Use License, there are different approaches of how to formulate a Humanitarian Use License: * Assigning a non-exclusive license means to retain the freedom to assign licenses also to other parties. The terms under which additional licensing is provided can be fixed beforehand, thus securing the situation for the licensee. This could mean that the licensor is only permitted to assign additional licenses to countries in certain regions or that are i.e. classified as least developed countries. *Public-private partnerships are projects that private sector companies and the government jointly fund and operate. Governmental involvement can be seen as giving an incentive for private companies to engage in activities that they otherwise would not have carried out. Transferring technology to public private partnerships for product development for neglected markets or neglected diseases is a way of facilitating the work and enabling them the development of adapted products. *For the development of adapted technologies a direct partnership between companies, universities or research institutions of developed and developing countries can be established. Partners in developing countries will have a greater interest to meet the needs of these countries. *Governments or foundations that fund research can require that the outcomes will be free for humanitarian licensing. The establishment of those clauses secures that later negotiations will be held with clear expectations. *Measuring the progress and the impact of a project, for example, the condition that on or before the date of the first phase of a clinical trial for a new drug, the licensee will have identified a generic manufacturer in a middle-income country to produce the licensed technology at a reasonable price for developing countries. Subsequently, if this milestone is not met, other provisions and reservations in the agreement would be triggered, for example loss of exclusivity, sublicensing, exercise of march-in rights, and even termination of the agreement. (Brewster, Chapman, Hansen) *Access to a product can be assured when the licensor requires that products are sold at the markets in developing countries to a price, people can afford there. an appropriate price may be set by having a small profit of about 5-10%. *Stimulating the research of products that are adapted to the conditions in developing countries can be achieved when clauses that exclude particular categories of research from infringement are integrated into licensing agreements. *By including reach through clauses, new technologies, based on the licensed one, will be treated under the same licensing conditions that cover the original license. Thus, intermediate technologies, genes or processes can be maintained available for licensing for humanitarian licensing. *A ‚Äúnon suit‚Äù agreement is an agreement that an intellectual property holder will not assert these rights against one or more parties to the agreement. (Kaplan) The advantage for institutions or companies granting innovations is that they won't have to fear any liability by using these clauses. For example, companies may hesitate to grant i.e. genetic material to research institutions, as they might fear any claims that can be made based on international agreements like the Cartagena protocol, that force companies into the responsibility to care for the material they distribute. Benefits for the supplier Exclusive claims that are connected with intellectual property rights might cause companies to fear loss of revenues. However, this is not necessarily the case, as mostly non-commercial markets are served. People are provided with royalty free goods that otherwise would not have made the purchase in the first place. Donating technology and support for developing countries will create positive publicity for companies that do so, especially in the biotechnology and medical sectors. This can be reinforced if also governments take a role in this. Promoting positive publicity by giving prices or tax incentives are possible ways to reward companies that are engaged in underserved sectors. Many developing countries have a growing potential private market for technologies. The technology supplier may plan to develop these growing markets as part of a long-term market strategy, implying that the supplier expects these currently unprofitable markets to become profitable in the future. Thus, the supplier can create a loyal customer base in the future with a generous donation today (IP strategies 2001) Disadvantages Humanitarian use licences could be compulsorily assigned by the government or subject to voluntary implementation by the patent holder. However, developing standards in humanitarian licensing that encourages also private companies to technology transfers would rather stimulate the voluntarily engagement of the private sector in development. Thus, resources would be directed into more productive channels than compulsory licensing could do. Building trust of partners can be achieved by careful drafted clauses that a rights holder could choose to include in licensing agreements. The cost of such a failure depends on how many farmers included in the target would have purchased the technology from the market had they not been granted preferential access (IP strategy 2001). A trade-off between the effort to administer the targeting scheme and the size of leakage is probable ‚Äì the lower the risk of leakage should be, the higher will be the cost of implementation of these targeting schemes. Of particular concern are countries with a wide income disparity, where for example viable commercial markets may exist in the cities, while rural areas are underserved and require a humanitarian license and a significantly different price-point. Fields of application Humanitarian use licenses should be considered in every stage of development as there could be restrictions to the access to materials, processes for product development or final products. Patents can be granted with respect to whole varieties, single genes or procedures that permit the isolation of genes. Humanitarian Use Licenses therefore do not only concern companies that bring products to the market and could via such licenses directly deliver people in need. It has to be considered also by Universities, National and International Agricultural Research Centres and Public Private Partnerships whose work represents the basis for further upstream research.

Laurent-Joseph-Marius Imbert, MEP (23 March 1796 ‚Äì 21 September 1839), sometimes called Laurent-Marie-Joseph Imbert and affectionately known in Korea as Bishop Imbert Bum (Korean name: Bum Se-hyeong) was a French missionary bishop in Asia. Most notable among the Koreans, he was appointed by Pope Gregory XVI in August 1836 when first Bishop Barth√©lemy Brugui√®re died in Manchuria. Eventually, he was executed in the Kingdom of Joseon for his Catholic faith; it is estimated that 8,000 to 10,000 were killed for their faith in 19th-century Korea‚Äîthe Korean Martyrs. 103 of them, including Imbert, were canonized by the Catholic Church as saints in 1984. His feast day is 21 September, and he is also venerated with the rest of the 103 Korean martyrs on 20 September. Biography Imbert was born at Marignane, to parents who were residents of the hamlet of Callas, in the commune of Cabri√®s in the Department of Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne. When he became of age, he was sent to Aix to pursue his studies. According to reports, he paid his expenses by making and selling rosaries. He then enrolled at the seminary of the Paris Foreign Missions Society on 8 October 1818. On 5 March 1819, Imbert was incardinated in the Archdiocese of Paris, and ordained on 18 December of that same year, having received an indult from the Holy See due to his not having reached the legal age. He then set sail from France on 20 March 1820, bound for missionary service in China. Imbert's first stop was in Penang, Malaya, where he was asked to replace a teacher at the College General (Major Seminary), who had taken ill. He taught there from April 1821 to January 1822 In 1821, Esprit- Marie-Joseph Florens, the Vicar Apostolic of Siam, requested for him to call at Singapore. The bishop had been contemplating opening a missionary station in Singapore. He was not very certain, though, whether there was any urgency or he was aware of the circumstances prevailing in the island. Therefore, the young missionary was to check on the situation. He reached Singapore on 11 December 1821 and spent about a week there. Imbert might have been the first priest to celebrate Mass on the island. In February 1822, Imbert sailed for Macau, but unable to go directly there, he spent the next two years in Tonkin, French Indochina. Only then was he able to enter China, where he spent twelve years in Sichuan and founded a seminary in Moupin. On 26 April 1836, Imbert was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Korea and Titular Bishop of Capsa. He was consecrated on 14 May 1837 by Giacomo Luigi Fontana M.E.P., the Vicar Apostolic of Huguang. He then crossed secretly from Manchuria to Korea that same year. During this time, Korea was going through a period of Christian persecution. On 10 August 1839, Imbert, who was secretly going about his missionary work, was betrayed. Realizing that it was only a matter of time before he was arrested and killed, he celebrated Mass and surrendered himself to those who lay in waiting for him. He was taken to Seoul, where he was tortured to reveal the whereabouts of foreign missionaries. Mistakenly believing that his converts would be spared if all foreign missionaries came out from hiding and gave themselves up, he wrote a note to his fellow missionaries, Pierre-Philibert Maubant and Jacques-Honor√© Chastan, asking them to surrender to the Korean authorities as well, which they did. All three of them were imprisoned together. They were taken before an interrogator and questioned for three days to reveal the names and whereabouts of their converts. As torture failed to break them down, they were sent to another prison and beheaded on 21 September 1839 at Saenamteo, Korea. Their bodies remained exposed for several days but were finally buried on Nogu Mountain. The three were among the 79 Korean Martyrs beatified in 1925, and among the 103 Korean Martyrs canonized by Pope John Paul II in Seoul on 6 May 1984. The feast day of Saint Laurent Imbert is celebrated on 20 September (formerly 10 June).

Nooms was probably born and died in Amsterdam. He started painting and drawing in his later years, following a rough, drunken life as a sailor. It is not known how he acquired his skill as an artist. His knowledge of ships is evident from his work: ships and foreign locations are depicted with high accuracy and in great detail, and served as an example to other artists of how to depict ships. A widely traveled artist, Nooms visited Paris, Venice and possibly Berlin, and also journeyed along the coast of North Africa. A favourite subject of his paintings were the Dutch victories in the Anglo-Dutch Wars. For instance, he painted the Amalia, the flagship of admiral Maarten Tromp, before the Battle of the Downs in 1639. This painting now hangs in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, UK. His painting of the Battle of Leghorn in 1653 is in the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In the 1650s, Nooms made a series of etchings of ships and topographical views characterized by a high degree of detail and precision. These etchings served as an example to many artists. The 19th century French etcher Charles Meryon was highly influenced by Nooms, whose etchings of Paris cityscapes inspired him to his own series of Paris etchings. Meryon dedicated some of these works to Nooms in poetic form. One of Nooms' final works, from 1664, shows a view of the Amsterdam harbour, with the IJ bay and the naval depot's Lands Zeemagazijn, now the home of the Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum (Netherlands Maritime Museum). Appropriately, this work now hangs in the Netherlands Maritime Museum.

The land is marked by steep-sided hollows, as much as deep in places, which are separated by conical hills and ridges. Maroons who had escaped from plantations used the difficult territory for its natural defenses to develop communities outside the control of Spanish or British colonists. History In the late seventeenth century, the Cockpit Country was a place of refuge for Jamaican Maroons fleeing slavery. During the course of the First Maroon War, there were two Leeward Maroon communities - Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town) and Accompong Town. Cudjoe's Town was located in the mountains in the southern extremities of Saint James Parish, Jamaica, close to the border of Westmoreland Parish. Accompong is situated just to the south of Cudjoe's Town, on the border between Westmoreland and Saint Elizabeth Parish. When the Leeward Maroons signed a peace treaty in 1740, they assisted the colonial authorities in pursuing runaway slaves who sought refuge in the Cockpit Country. However, these runaways allied with Trelawny Town during the Second Maroon War. When the Maroons of Trelawny Town were deported in 1796, the Maroons of Accompong had difficulty policing the Cockpit Country, and several communities of runaway slaves established themselves there. After the removal of the Trelawny Maroons, the colonial militia built a barracks at their village, which they renamed Maroon Town, Jamaica. At the start of the nineteenth century, Cuffee (Jamaica) established a community of runaway slaves in the Cockpit Country, and resisted attempts by the colonial authorities and the Maroons of Accompong Town to rout them. Then, in the second and third decades of the century, another group of runaway slaves from Trelawny Parish set up a community in the Cockpit Country at Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come. They also succeeded in resisting attempts by the colonial militias and Accompong Town to rout them. During the Baptist War of 1831‚Äì2, more slaves ran away and found freedom in the Cockpit Country. Accompong Town is an indigenous Maroon community that still has a certain recognized autonomy under the independent Jamaican government. Geography On the north, the main defining feature is the fault-based \\"Escarpment\\", a long ridge that extends from Flagstaff in the west, through Windsor in the centre, to Campbells and the start of the Barbecue Bottom Road (B10). The Barbecue Bottom Road, which runs north‚Äìsouth, high along the side of a deep, fault-based valley in the east, is the only drivable route across the Cockpit Country. Walkers and riders can use two old, historical trails cross further west, the Troy Trail, and the Quick Step Trail. As of 2006 they are seldom used and difficult to find. In the southwest, near Quick Step, is the district known as the \\"Land of Look Behind.\\" It was so named because Spanish horsemen venturing into this region of hostile escaped slaves were said to have ridden two to a mount, one rider facing to the rear to keep a precautionary watch against ambush. Where the ridges between sinkholes in the plateau area have dissolved, flat-bottomed basins or valleys have been formed that are filled with terra rosa soils, some of the most productive on the island. The largest basin is the Vale of Clarendon, long and wide. Queen of Spains Valley, Nassau Valley, and Cave Valley were formed by the same process. Shallow caves, known locally as cockpits, are particularly common around the hamlet of Quick Step, reaching a density of 15 per km2.Jamaica Underground: The Caves, Sinkholes and Underground Rivers of the Island, by Alan Fincham (page 31). Noteworthy caves include Marta Tick Cavehttp://www.jamaicancaves.org/martatick.htm and Minocal's Glory Hole.http://www.jamaicancaves.org/minocals_050115.htm Ecotourism has been proposed for the hamlet of Quick Step, at the end of the road into the heart of Cockpit County.http://www.cockpitcountry.com/Quickstep.html Environment The Cockpit Country is Jamaica's largest remaining contiguous rainforest. In 1979 an unpublished paper proposed preserving the area as a National Park.Cotterell \\"The Proposed Development of the Cockpit Country.\\" Unpublished. NRCD, Kingston, Jamaica. 1979. In 1994 the geographer Alan EyreEyre, Slow Death of a Tropical Rainforest: The Cockpit Country of Jamaica, West Indies, 1994 proposed that the Cockpit Country be designated as a World Heritage Site to preserve its environment. A petition for protection of the area was submitted to Prime Minister Bruce Golding in 2006. As of April 2013, public consultations have begun on the definition of the boundary proposed in a recently released study by Mitchell, Miller, Ganapathy, and Spence of the University of the West Indies (UWI). Eleutherodactylus sisyphodemus, a small, critically endangered frog species, is known only from the Cockpit Country. Cockpit Country hosts 90% of the global population of black-billed amazon, a parrot endemic to Jamaica. Cockpit Country is also home to the Jamaican swallowtail, the largest butterfly in the Western Hemisphere. Cockpit Country is one of the last remaining homes for the species.

Design and construction Hyacinth was the second of four s, which were a ship-rigged and lengthened version of the 1796 . All four ships of the class were ordered on 10 June 1823 and Hyacinth was laid down at Plymouth Dockyard in March 1826. She was launched on 6 May 1829 and commissioned for the West Indies Station on 12 January 1830. Dimensions Hyacinth measured along the gun deck by in the beam, and had a tonnage of 429 40/94 bm. She was flush-decked with a small forecastle and quarterdeck. Armament She was armed with sixteen 32-pounder carronades and two 9-pounder bow chaser guns. Service During her 42-year career, she was stationed in the West and East Indies from 1829‚Äì41, took part in the First Opium War from 1841‚Äì42, and from 1843-46 was stationed off the west coast of Africa in the suppression of the slave trade.

If special relativity is true, then each observer will have their own plane of simultaneity, which contains a unique set of events that constitutes the observer's present moment. Observers moving at different relative velocities have different planes of simultaneity, and hence different sets of events that are present. Each observer considers their set of present events to be a three-dimensional universe, but even the slightest movement of the head or offset in distance between observers can cause the three-dimensional universes to have differing content. If each three-dimensional universe exists, then the existence of multiple three-dimensional universes suggests that the universe is four-dimensional. The argument is named after the discussions by Rietdijk (1966)Rietdijk, C. W. (1966) A Rigorous Proof of Determinism Derived from the Special Theory of Relativity, Philosophy of Science, 33 (1966) pp. 341‚Äì344. and Putnam (1967).Putnam, H. (1967). Time and Physical Geometry, Journal of Philosophy, 64, (1967) pp. 240‚Äì247. It is sometimes called the Rietdijk‚ÄìPutnam‚ÄìPenrose argument.\\"Being and Becoming in Modern Physics\\". Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Andromeda paradox Illustrative example of the Andromeda paradox Roger Penrose advanced a form of this argument that has been called the Andromeda paradox in which he points out that two people walking past each other in the street could have very different present moments. If one of the people were walking towards the Andromeda Galaxy, then events in this galaxy might be hours or even days advanced of the events on Andromeda for the person walking in the other direction. If this occurs, it would have dramatic effects on our understanding of time. Penrose highlighted the consequences by discussing a potential invasion of Earth by aliens living in the Andromeda Galaxy. As Penrose put it: The \\"paradox\\" consists of two observers who are, from their conscious perspective, in the same place and at the same instant having different sets of events in their \\"present moment\\". Notice that neither observer can actually \\"see\\" what is happening in Andromeda, because light from Andromeda (and the hypothetical alien fleet) will take 2.5 million years to reach Earth. The argument is not about what can be \\"seen\\"; it is purely about what events different observers consider to occur in the present moment.  Criticisms  The interpretations of relativity used in the Rietdijk‚ÄìPutnam argument and the Andromeda paradox are not universally accepted. SteinStein, H. (1991) On relativity theory and the openness of the future, Philosophy of Science, 58 (1991) pp. 147‚Äì167. and SavittSavitt, S. F.

She is most known for 2004's Down to the Bone, which starred Vera Farmiga, 2010's Winter's Bone, which starred Jennifer Lawrence in her breakout performance and for which Granik was nominated for Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, and 2018's Leave No Trace, a film based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rock.  Early life and education  Granik was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to father William R. Granik, who was an attorney with H.U.D. who litigated fair housing, and mother Brenda Granik Zusman. She grew up in the suburbs of Washington D.C. Her parents divorced in 1978. Granik is the granddaughter of broadcast pioneer Ted Granik (1907‚Äì1970), founder and moderator of the long-run public affairs panel discussion program, The American Forum of the Air, on from 1934 to 1956, first on the radio and later on television. Granik is from a Jewish family. In 1985, Granik received her B.A. in political science from Brandeis University. As an undergraduate at Brandeis, Granik also took classes at the Studio for Interrelated Media at the Massachusetts College of Art. In 2001, Granik received an MFA from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts.  Career  While at Brandeis, Granik took Henry Felt's film and media workshop production class and volunteered with the Boston grassroots filmmaking organization Women's Video Collective. She also took film classes at the Studio for Interrelated Media at the Massachusetts College of Art. During this time, Granik made educational films for trade unions on subjects like workplace health and safety, one of which was made for the Massachusetts Division of Occupational Safety. Granik worked in production on educational media projects, eventually working on long form documentaries by Boston-area filmmakers before deciding to go to graduate school for filmmaking at New York University. In 1997, Granik directed her first short film, Snake Feed, as her senior thesis with the mentorship of NYU film professor Boris Frumin, who was instrumental in sharing his love of post-World War II European neorealist films. Snake Feed, which began its life as a 7-minute documentary portrait exercise, was accepted into Sundance Institute's Lab Program for screenwriting and directing. Granik workshopped and developed the short film into a feature film at the Sundance Lab. Granik has said that Snake Feed was a work of narrative fiction, with the main characters, recovering addict Irene and her boyfriend Rick, playing dramatized versions of themselves. In 2004, the short film of Snake Feed and the story of Irene and Rick became the basis of Granik's first feature-length film, Down to the Bone, which was a fictionalized depiction of their struggles. Down to the Bone is the story of an upstate New York mother who goes to rehab to kick her cocaine addiction and ends up falling in love with a nurse and descending back into her old drug habits. Down to the Bone was based on an original screenplay written by Granik and her creative partner, Anne Rosellini. The role of the main character Irene, played by Vera Farmiga, significantly raised Farmiga's profile as an actor. Down to the Bone was shot in Ulster County in upstate New York. Granik's second feature, 2010's Winter's Bone, was an adaptation by Granik and Rosellini of the 2006 novel by Daniel Woodrell. It is the story of Ree Dolly, a teenager living in the Missouri's Ozark Mountains who is the sole caretaker of her two younger siblings and her catatonic mother. She is forced to hunt down her missing drug-dealing father in order to save her family from eviction. The film starred a then-unknown Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes and won the Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic Film at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, which led to a distribution deal with Roadside Attractions. Winter's Bone won the Seattle International Film Festival Golden Space Needle Audience Award for Best Director and Best Actress award for Jennifer Lawrence. In 2011, Winter's Bone was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actress for Jennifer Lawrence and Best Supporting Actor for John Hawkes. The film featured a soundtrack made up of old time gospel, bluegrass, and traditional music found in the Ozarks and was produced by Steve Peters. It features the singing of Marideth Sisco, who worked as a music and folklore consultant for the region, and also appeared in the Winter's Bone. The actor John Hawkes sings one track on the soundtrack. Winter's Bone was shot on location in the Ozark area of southern Missouri. Granik cast many of the supporting roles with first-time actors from the surrounding area and all of the homes on screen were established Ozark homes‚Äîno sets were built for this film. For the look of the film, Granik kept most of the established aesthetics of the homes in which they were shooting and many of the few mementos that were added to the homes were contributed by Ozark people in the community. Granik produced and directed an HBO television pilot called American High Life. The show was a family drama that \\"follows a young career woman to her economically depressed small home town in the midwest.\\" The show was not picked up. Granik developed a film adaption of Rule of the Bone, the 1995 novel by Russell Banks, but the project is still in development. In 2014, Granik's film, Stray Dog, was released. The film is a documentary about a man named Ron Hall, whose nickname is \\"Stray Dog,\\" and portrays his life as an avid biker and Vietnam Veteran who sometimes struggles with PTSD. The film documents Hall's participation in an annual pilgrimage motorcycle ride called \\"Ride to the Wall\\" with fellow biker Vietnam vets from all over the country where they ride to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. Granik had met Hall, who had a small role on Winter's Bone, during filming. Granik directed the drama Leave No Trace, starring Ben Foster and newcomer Thomasin McKenzie, which was released in 2018, domestically by Bleecker Street and internationally by Sony Worldwide Acquisitions. The film tells the story of a father and daughter who illegally live on government land and are forced to adapt to more traditional living in mainstream life. It examines ideas of self-reliance and community, and was a critics' pick of The New York Times. Leave No Trace premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, and played at the Cannes Film Festival, and was shot in the forested areas of Oregon, including Forest Park near Portland, Oregon, over the course of 30 days. In addition to Oregon, Washington state was used for locations, with some scenes shot at a Christmas tree farm. Leave No Trace took approximately three and a half years to develop, from the first time Granik read Peter Rock's novel, My Abandonment, on which the film was based. Other projects Granik has in development include a documentary about life after being released from jail and the subject of recidivism in East Baltimore ‚Äì that was to feature Felicia \\"Snoop\\" Pearson from The Wire and elements of her memoir, Grace After Midnight ‚Äì but is now a documentary about four former inmates in New York City. Another project is a film based on Barbara Ehrenreich's book, Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America, which focuses on poverty and the working poor in America.  Themes  Granik is known for discovering actors like Jennifer Lawrence, Vera Farmiga and Thomasin McKenzie who have gone on to successful careers after early roles in Granik's films. She is also known for using local, non-professional actors in her films. Granik has worked with creative partner Anne Rosellini on all of her films. Granik has said that she sees a common thread of press coverage describing her as having a \\"comeback narrative,\\" along with questions about how much time has elapsed between projects, partly due to the relatively low output of films in her career compared to the contemporaries she started out with. Interviewed by Jeremiah Kipp in Filmmaker in 2005, Granik discussed the challenges of directing a movie like Down to the Bone. She gave an overview of the challenges involved in doing a film about addiction: :The traditional storyline in an American film is usually in the form of a V shape. I am oversimplifying, but we see someone tumbling down, they hit bottom, and then they rise up again and find redemption. Anyone who personally, tangentially or culturally knows anything about addiction is aware that it resembles an EKG. Up and down, up and down. Very few people ever get clean on the first or second attempt. For many people, it‚Äôs something they have to try over and over again. You get knocked down and ask all the ethical questions like how many chances do you give a person? When is the last chance? How many chances do they get? Can you imagine how difficult it is to fit that in a feature-length film? But those are the questions that are worth asking... The reason why boils down to the word ‚Äúdark‚Äù. It is the scariest four-letter word in American storytelling and in this culture. Our film had a strong reception in Europe and achieved distribution, but that was not the case here. We received so many responses like, ‚ÄúWe love the film, but we cannot do anything with it or we‚Äôll lose our shirts. We‚Äôre sorry.‚Äù The intervention comes from people like Laemmle/Zeller Films. Every couple of years, some mavericks take on this challenge of distributing so-called un-distributable films. They take those films on a small run and allow them to see the light of day. Those efforts are what give a film like Down to the Bone a chance to have a life of some kind. Granik's films deal with issues of personal strength and willpower, like the character of Ree Dolly in Winter's Bone. She cites Mike Leigh, Ken Loach, Shane Meadows, the Dardenne brothers, Laurent Cantet, and Abbas Kiarostami as some of her major influences in her directing career.In a 2018 interview with FF2 Media about Leave No Trace, Granik discusses the themes of the film and what drew her to creating the film: > I realized while reading it that one of the turning points in a girl‚Äôs > coming-of-age is coming to terms with the fact that as much as you may care > about someone, you can‚Äôt necessarily save them or even help them. You can be > loving and tolerant, but you can‚Äôt fix them. And that‚Äôs something she‚Äôs > really struggling with in a really robust way, especially when they‚Äôre in a > new setting. And I really liked the fact that Tom is the one thing that‚Äôs > grounding him. She is his source of meaning. His sense of self-worth is > bolstered by being meaningful to her, by being her dad. He takes pride in > being her teacher and taking responsibility for her. And I was just so > interested in the universality of that. The ties that bind is core material. > There‚Äôs nothing new about those themes, but I really liked that the novel > had renewed my interest in exploring them.  Personal life  Granik is married to Jonathan Scheuer, who has executive produced her films and is Vice Chairman of the Board of Trustees of National Jazz Museum in Harlem. They live in New York City and have a daughter.

Each year approximately 8,000 pilgrims participate in the 47 km long walk along the B51 and more visitors arrive by bus or car. History The pilgrimage was started by layman citizen of Osnabr√ºck in 1852, approved by the Catholic Church under the condition, that no spirits or other alcoholic beverages will be drunk. In 1856 the procession was led for the first time by a priest. Despite an interdiction during the wars in 1864-1866 (Second War of Schleswig) and 1914-1918 (World War I), during the Kulturkampf 1872-1882 and during Nazi Germany 1938-1944 many people went in small groups or alone on the pilgrimage to Telgte. Object of veneration The chapel housing the piet√†, in front of the church St. Clemens The object of veneration is the statue of the painful Blessed Virgin Mary. It shows Mary, holding the body of Jesus after his death. The statue was made in 1370 and is thus one of the oldest portrayals of this motive (see Piet√†). The statue is made from wood of the poplar and 150 cm in height. In 1654 the Prince-Bishop Bernhard von Galen had a chapel built especially for the piet√† and the pilgrimage. After this the interest in the Osnabr√ºck pilgrimage increased even more. Course of the pilgrimage The pilgrimage starts on Saturday at 1:30 am with masses in the churches St. Johann and St. Joseph in Osnabr√ºck, and at 3 am the walk begins. The pilgrims walk through the village Oesede (Georgsmarienh√ºtte) and the town Bad Iburg. They reach Glandorf at about 8 am where another mass is celebrated. At 10 am they rest in Oedingberge and a meditation is held. The procession reaches Ostbevern approximately at 1 pm and after a lunch break they set out for the last part of the walk. They reach Telgte at 4 pm and visit the piet√†. With prayers for the night in the church St. Clemens, the schedule for the first day ends. The first pilgrim mass starts on Sunday at 4:30 am with at least one other mass following for children and youths. Before they begin their way back at 8 am they come together for a last prayer. At 7 pm they reach The church of Peter and Paul in Oesede (Georgsmarienh√ºtte), where the final meditation is held.

It lies north of El Paso, north of Las Cruces, and southeast of Truth or Consequences. Spaceport America is \\"the world's first purpose-built commercial spaceport\\", designed and constructed specifically for commercial users that had not previously been an airport or federal infrastructure of any kind. The site is built to accommodate both vertical and horizontal launch aerospace vehicles, as well as an array of non- aerospace events and commercial activities. Spaceport America is owned and operated by the State of New Mexico, via a state agency, the New Mexico Spaceport Authority. Current tenants of the spaceport include Virgin Galactic, TMD Defense and Space, White Sands Research and Developers and SpinLaunch while Boeing, HyperSciences, UP Aerospace, and Armadillo Aerospace and its successor, Exos Aerospace, have all operated from the spaceport. Spaceport America was officially declared open on October 18, 2011, the visitor center in Truth or Consequences became fully accessible to the general public on June 24, 2015, and after Virgin Galactic completed the interior buildout, the entire facility was deemed ready for operations in August 2019. Visitors can book tours from Visit Las Cruces or the visitors center in Truth or Consequences. History Located in southern New Mexico, Spaceport America is the result of over two decades of efforts to increase the commercial accessibility of spaceflight. Inception Do√±a Ana, Luna, Otero, and Sierra Counties. The spaceport's initial concept was proposed by Stanford University engineering lecturer and tech startup advisor Dr. Burton Lee in 1990. He wrote the initial business and strategic plans, secured US$1.4 million in seed funding via congressional earmarks with the help of Senator Pete Domenici, and worked with the New Mexico State University Physical Science Laboratory (PSL) to develop local support for the spaceport concept. In 1992, the Southwest Space Task Force was formed to advance the New Mexico space industry's commercial infrastructure and activity. After several years of study, they focused on a plot of state-owned land, north of Las Cruces, as a location for the spaceport. In 2003, the task force petitioned new Economic Development Cabinet Secretary Rick Homans who then picked up the torch. Homans presented the idea to state Governor Richardson and negotiated with the X Prize Foundation to locate the X Prize Cup in New Mexico. Following an announcement by Governor Richardson and Sir Richard Branson that the new Virgin Galactic would make New Mexico its world headquarters, the state legislature enacted laws providing for the world's first purpose-built commercial spaceport in 2006. The spaceport was branded Spaceport America. Construction Spaceport America terminal hangar facility as of October 2010. The \\"Virgin Galactic Gateway To Space\\" in October 2010. The runway under construction, March 2010. Construction of the first temporary launch facility at the spaceport site began on April 4, 2006. Early operations of the spaceport utilized this temporary infrastructure, some of it borrowed from neighboring White Sands Missile Range. In early 2007, red tape was still in the process of being cleared and the spaceport itself was still little more than \\"a by concrete slab.\\" That slab would eventually be part of the launch facility for the spaceport's first tenant UP Aerospace. On April 3, voters in neighboring Do√±a Ana County approved a spaceport tax that would go into effect upon final approval from the Spaceport America host county Sierra County. The first images of the then planned spaceport's Hangar Terminal Facility (HTF) were released in early September 2007. In April 2008, the voters in Sierra County approved the plan, releasing over US$40 million in funding for the spaceport. Voters in the third county of Otero, however, rejected the spaceport tax during November general elections. In spite of this, Spaceport America had what it needed to move forward and great headway toward its completion began. In December 2008, the New Mexico Spaceport Authority received its launch license for vertical and horizontal launch from the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Commercial Space Transportation. Shortly thereafter, Virgin Galactic signed a 20-year (240-month) lease as the anchor tenant, agreeing to pay US$1 million per year for the first five years in addition to payments on a tiered scale based on the number of launches the company makes. In December, Gerald Martin Construction Management, from Albuquerque, was chosen to oversee construction. , the first of 13 bid packages for the spaceport was expected to be publicly released later that month and all 13 bid packages were scheduled to be released by June 2009. \\"The goal is to have [construction] completed in 17 months, by December 2010.\\" The ground-breaking ceremony took place June 19, 2009 and paid tours of the facilities began in December of the same year. By February 2010, the in mid- construction budgetary estimate for completion was $198 million. On October 22, a ceremonial flypass of Spaceport America was made by SpaceShipTwo to celebrate the completion of the runway. By October 2010, with the runway complete and the terminal building under active construction, the budgetary estimate for completion increased to $212 million. Approximately two-thirds of that were provided by the state of New Mexico and the remainder from \\"construction bonds backed by a tax approved by voters in Do√±a Ana and Sierra counties.\\" The spaceport was officially declared open on October 18, 2011 but the tenant did not move in and begin operations right away. By August 2011, Spaceport America was substantially complete and the cost of the entire project was $209 million. The interior of the building was the responsibility of tenant Virgin Galactic, and work on the interior began only in 2018. By August 2019, interior work was complete, and the entire facility was deemed ready for operations.https://spacenews.com/virgin-galactic-declares-spaceport- america-ready-for-spaceshiptwo/ Increased private funding With the beginning of the administration of New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez in 2011, the state government took a new approach to increase private investment to complete the spaceport project. In order to oversee the new effort, Governor Martinez appointed an entirely new board of directors for the Spaceport Authority and removed Executive Director Rick Homans. By 2013, the Spaceport had signed SpaceX as an additional tenant for vertical takeoff and vertical landing flight testing of prototype reusable rockets such as the Falcon 9 Reusable Development Vehicle. The facilities at Spaceport America were never used for Falcon 9 RDV and equipment staged was eventually moved back to Texas. Delays in operation of the anchor tenant There have been a series of delays in Virgin Galactic beginning flight operations at Spaceport America. The multi-year extension of the test program and the re-designed engine announced in May 2014 were responsible for much of the delay. In 2014, the spaceport announced that it was seeking additional tenants and hoped to sign another one in the next year. Budgetary difficulties in operating the spaceport have become salient in New Mexico politics. The annual cost of providing fire protection services that have been contracted for the mostly unused spaceport is approximately . The inflight breakup and crash of the first SpaceShipTwo vehicle‚ÄîVSS Enterprise‚Äîin October 2014 has raised questions about the future of the spaceport. With further delays to the start of Virgin Galactic commercial operations, ostensibly to at least 2016, the spaceport may need funding from state or local authorities in New Mexico in order to keep the basic fire and security and administrative operation underway. The Spaceport Authority asked the New Mexico legislature in November 2014 for in emergency funds to maintain operations until 2016, the earliest date at which Virgin is expected to be able to begin commercial flight operations. SpaceX has also been delayed in initiating test flights of F9R Dev2 at the spaceport from when they were originally anticipated. In May 2015, budgetary details made public revealed that the substantially unused spaceport has an annual deficit that has been running approximately , with the deficit being made up by state taxpayers. The primary planned revenue in the times of delayed operations by Virgin Galactic and SpaceX, with limited operations by other minor tenants, is local tax revenue, paid by the taxpayers of Sierra and Dona Ana counties. In May 2019, Virgin Galactic announced that they were finally ready to relocate all of their spaceflight activities to the spaceport. Virgin completed the interior fit out work in mid-2019 and the entire facility was deemed ready for operations in August 2019. WhiteKnightTwo and SpaceShipTwo moved to the Spaceport in February 2020. The operational flights are expected to begin sometime in 2020.https://spacenews.com/virgin-galactic-declares- spaceport-america-ready-for-spaceshiptwo/ In 2019, Infiniti was testing some of its current models at the Spaceport America desert test tracks, such as its Q50 sports sedan and Q60 sports coupe.https://www.barrons.com/articles/infinitis-revival-depends-on-sleek-new- sedan-and-suv-stylingand-electrification-01573060678 On June 25, 2020 Virgin Galactic carried out its second successful glide flight of its spaceship over Spaceport America in southern New Mexico. The first flight took place in May 2020.https://www.kob.com/national-news/virgin-galactic-marks-second-glide- flight-over-new-mexico/5771943/  Facility  Terminal hangar at the Spaceport America, taken during a Land Rover Discovery Sport photo shoot. The site area nets approximately , with the terminal & hangar facility grossing an area of .http://www.spaceportamerica.com/about-us/spaceport-america.html The western zone of the Facility (25,597 sq ft.) houses support and administrative facilities for Virgin Galactic and the New Mexico Spaceport Authority. The central zone contains the double-height hangar (47,000 sq ft.) to store White Knight Two and SpaceShipTwo craft. The eastern zone (29,419 sq ft.) encompasses the principal operational training area, departure lounge, spacesuit dressing rooms, and celebration areas. The onsite restaurant and mission control room have direct east views across the apron, runway and landscape beyond. The spaceport was built with environmental sustainability in mind. Designed to meet the requirements for LEED Gold Certification, it incorporates \\"Earth Tubes\\" to cool the building, solar thermal panels, underfloor radiant cooling and heating, and natural ventilation. A visitor center was planned in downtown Truth or Consequences (the closest town) to provide shuttle bus services to the Spaceport. However, due to delays in spaceport operations and reduction in spaceport authority revenues, the plans were considerably scaled back in January 2014. Rather than the planned facilities, the revised plan in January 2014 had only a capital budget. Rather than the \\"planned $13 million visitor center at the spaceport [there will be a] $1.5 million hangar\\" and the Truth or Consequences visitor center budget request was cut to from the original . By May 2015, news media were reporting that the spaceport authority \\"spent so much money with a company to design the visitors‚Äô experience that it had no money left over to actually build the facilities for it.\\" The spaceport is located under FAA Special Use Airspace Restricted Areas 5111A and 5111B. When both these areas are active the airspace is restricted from surface to 'unlimited'. Operations , Over 300 suborbital flights had been successfully launched from Spaceport America, The primary user is UP Aerospace with 13 launches of SpaceLoft XL sounding rockets from 2006 to 2019 and 5 launches of prototype vehicles from 2007 to 2009. Boeing, SpinLaunch, HyperSciences, EXOS Aerospace, TMD Defense and Space and White Sands Research and Developers are current tenants. Spaceport revenue In order to repay the construction bonds and eventually meet operating expenses from Spaceport operations, the spaceport authority has forecast a number of revenue streams. These include lease payments, takeoff and launch payments, tours, etc. However, anchor tenant Virgin Galactic had paid only in facility lease payments as of November 2014, and was projected to pay for each six-passenger flight of SpaceShipTwo once flight operations begin. Due to continued long-term revenue shortfalls, the Spaceport Authority is \\"working on a business plan that would further expand the search for revenue sources beyond Virgin Galactic ...[targeting] new tenants, including other space ventures, commercial projects, tourism, special events and merchandising.\\" Spaceport America Cup An annual rocketry competition and engineering event, Spaceport America Cup, takes place at the site, is an Intercollegiate Rocketry Engineering Competition (IREC)-official event, and is sanctioned by the Experimental Sounding Rocket Association (ESRA). An international field of college and commercial teams operate sounding and sport-class rockets of several varieties and specifications, including solid, liquid, and hybrid fuel rockets, with altitude ranges between 3 and 10 km, and utilize the airspace of the immediate area as well as downrange toward the White Sands facilitates. Spaceport operators As of 2020, eleven entities have operated, or announced plans to operate, from Spaceport America- Virgin Galactic, SpinLaunch, Up Aerospace, Boeing, HyperSciences, EXOS Aerospace, TMD Defense and Space, White Sands Research and Developers and C6 Launch Systems. Current operations =UP Aerospace= From the early stages, the spaceport has been host to several vertical launches by UP Aerospace. As the first tenant, it had access to multiple functional vertical takeoff facilities of the then incomplete spaceport., UP Aerospace continues to operate its suborbital flights from the spaceport. UP Aerospace continues to operate from the spaceport as of November 2019. =Armadillo Aerospace= Armadillo Aerospace launched their suborbital rockets (for example, the STIG-A rocket) from the spaceport in the early years of the 2010s.http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=35459 Armadillo Aerospace went out of business in 2013. It only conducted a few test flights from the spaceport. =Virgin Galactic= White Knight Two and SpaceShipTwo VSS Enterprise on the spaceport taxiway. As Spaceport America's anchor tenant, Virgin Galactic is to be given primary access to the runway, from which it will operate 2 hour commercial suborbital trips. , Virgin Galactic has accepted over 400 reservations and collected $50 million in deposits.VSS Enterprise Completes First Manned Glide Flight , Virgin Galactic, 2010-10-10, accessed December 30, 2010. Virgin Galactic's suborbital ship, SpaceShipTwo (SS2), is carried by its mother-craft White Knight Two (WK2) to an altitude of before being released on a suborbital trajectory under its own rocket power. Space Ship Two's launches will apex from the Earth's surface at more than . Customers will take part in 3 days pre-flight preparation, bonding, and training onsite at the spaceport. , Virgin Galactic planned to directly employ about 150 persons at the spaceport site. In May 2014 Spaceport America and Virgin Galactic signed an agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration to regulate routine space missions launched from Spaceport America, setting out how they will be integrated into the National Airspace System. Virgin plans to initially fly every six weeks. Virgin Galactic flight operations at the new spaceport have been delayed several times, and , have not begun nine years after the Virgin project was initiated. An October 2014 in-flight breakup of VSS Enterprise‚Äîthe first flight article SpaceShipTwo during a test flight at Mojave Air and Space Port in California‚Äîhas further delayed the start of Virgin suborbital spaceflights from Spaceport America. In 2013, Virgin Galactic had planned for a 2015 flight to stage Zero G Colony, a music festival featuring Lady Gaga however this never occurred when Virgin did not get to passenger flight operations. Commercial flights are expected to start sometime in the year 2020. =Google= In 2016 Google tested high altitude solar powered drones to deliver Internet at 5G speeds. It used the runway and dedicated flight controls at the Space Flight Operations Center at Spaceport. It also leased a hangar from Virgin Galactic. In 2016/2017, Google pulled the plug on Project SkyBender to focus on Project Loon instead.http://www.itechpost.com/articles/74092/20170113/google-parent-pulls- plug-internet-drone-project-skybender-shifts-focus.htm =Exos Aerospace= Exos Aerospace, the successor company of Armadillo Aerospace, has conducted 4 suborbital rocket flights with its SARGE rocket from the spaceport. The first flight took place in 2018; three flights took place in 2019. The flights have met with difficulties and failures; none has been completely successful. The flights have mostly been carrying research and technology payloads, for example for NASA. =C6 Launch Systems= In October 2020, Spaceport America signed an agreement with Canadian Corporation C6 Launch Systems to provide services, resources, and access to vertical launch sites facilities for testing operations and activities. Starting January 2021, the Canadian rocket company will install a new vertical test stand and conduct system integration tests including several engine firings. The various tests are aimed to validate the avionics, engine control, ground control and communications subsystems. Previous and potential ongoing operations =X Prize Foundation= Back in 2005, Spaceport America was expected to be the annual venue for the X Prize Cup suborbital spaceflight competitions, once it was fully operational. That series of competitions never materialized. =SpaceX= In May 2013, SpaceX announced that the high- altitude, high-velocity test flights part of its reusable launch system development program would be done at Spaceport America near Las Cruces, New Mexico ‚Äî and not at the Federal Government's adjacent White Sands Missile Range facility as previously planned. SpaceX signed a three-year lease for land and facilities at the newly operational spaceport. SpaceX indicated in May 2013 that they did not yet know how many jobs would move from Texas to New Mexico. SpaceX began constructing a 30 m √ó 30 m (98 ft √ó 98 ft) pad at Spaceport America in May 2013, 7 km (4.3 mi) southwest of the spaceport's main campus, planning to lease the pad for US$6,600 per month plus US$25,000 per test flight. A third flight test vehicle‚ÄîF9R Dev2‚Äîwas initially planned to be flown only at the high-altitude test range at Spaceport America and at altitudes of up to 91,000 meters (300,000 ft). In September 2014, following the destruction of the F9R Dev1, SpaceX changed the plans, so the F9R Dev2 vehicle would fly first in McGregor for low-altitude testing. The initial FAA permit to fly the Falcon 9 Reusable Development Vehicle at McGregor in Texas was open until February 2015. In May 2015, a specialized press article stated that due to the technical success of the landing attempts on the sea on the autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS), SpaceX was planning on using the New Mexico site for testing the returned stages. But to date, no work has occurred at the facility. On February 19, 2015 SpaceX announced that the F9R Dev2 would be discontinued. SpaceX continues to have an open contract with Spaceport America for potential future public use, or any other probable usage, alongside their own private launch site further south down the Rio Grande near the Gulf of Mexico in Brownsville, Texas. Towns near Boca Chica, Texas, are concerned by the spaceflight tests, so Spaceport America will continue to have potential use for SpaceX.

Biography Liviu Constantinescu Born into an old family of Christian Orthodox clerics from Transylvania, Liviu Constantinescu ignored suggestions from family and teachers to become an engineer or teacher and decided to study natural sciences. He earned a master's degree in physics and chemistry (1935) and a doctor's degree in physics (1941) from the University of Bucharest. After a few years as teaching assistant at the Department of Sciences of his alma mater (1937‚Äì1943), he was appointed director of the newly founded Geophysical Observatory Surlari, named today National Geomagnetic Observatory Surlari ‚ÄúLiviu Constantinescu‚Äù (1943‚Äì1958); this started his career as a geophysicist. He was appointed professor (1949‚Äì1975) at a newly created Department of Geophysics, led by Sabba S. ≈ûtefƒÉnescu and later by Liviu Constantinescu himself; in parallel, he directed geophysical research at various institutes of earth sciences of the Romanian Academy (1959‚Äì1970). Discriminated politically for his repeated refusal to join the ruling communist party, he was forced into early retirement at age 60 (1975); he came back after the fall of the dictatorship, fifteen years later. In 1990 he was elected full member of the Romanian Academy (he had been a corresponding member since 1963) and president of its Section of Geonomic Sciences (1990‚Äì1994). Until his definitive retirement (1995), he devoted himself to rebuilding the Romanian Academy and the geophysical institutions in Romania; he was president of the Romanian National Committee of Geodesy and Geophysics and of the Romanian Society of Geophysics. Liviu Constantinescu has made important contributions to several domains of pure and applied geophysics: geomagnetism (normal distribution and secular variation of the main geomagnetic field, general morphology and particularities of magnetic perturbations, magnetotellurics); handling and interpretation of gravimetric and magnetometric data (analytic continuation of potential fields, effects of Earth tides, time variation of the gravity field); seismology and tectonophysics (focal mechanism of earthquakes, seismicity and seismotectonics, Carpathian earthquakes, seismicity of the Romanian territory). He was member of the study group on Seismic methods for monitoring underground explosions at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) (1968‚Äì1970); member and vice-president of the coordination committee of the UNDP/UNESCO project for the study of the seismicity of the Balkan region (1970‚Äì1977). He held important positions in international scientific organizations: vice-president of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) (1969‚Äì1971) and member of the Bureau of IUGG (1967‚Äì1975); member of the governing council of the International Seismological Centre (1970‚Äì1974) and of the council of the European Geophysical Society (1970‚Äì1975); vice-president of the European Seismological Commission (1972‚Äì1976). An academic equally familiar with natural sciences and humanities, Liviu Constantinescu was a teacher for many. For 25 years, he gave lectures on geomagnetism and magnetic prospecting, gravimetry and gravimetric prospecting, radioactive prospecting, seismology. He was editor and coauthor of the textbook Exploration Geophysics (Prospec≈£iuni geofizice) (1964-1965); he wrote the section The Earth (Terra) of the Italian Enciclopedia del Novecento (1975-1990).

An attractive extremely prickly bush with sweetly scented yellowish flowers. The nectar rich blooms and dense form provides a good habitat for wildlife. Description Hakea corymbosa is a non lignotuberous erect multi-branched shrub growing to high and wide. The young shoots are referred to as \\"water canes\\", when mature they develop into a new cluster of foliage. The shrub becomes extremely dense and prickly, the foliage appearing like clusters of \\"clouds\\". The narrow waxy leaves are long and wide on lower parts but whorled near the flowers. Leaves are alternately arranged along the stems with a distinct centre vein on the upper side and three on the underside ending in a sharp point. The inflorescence consists of 12-18 flowers appearing in profusion in leaf axils. The pedicel is long and smooth. The perianth is a pale yellow-green. Woody fruit have a roughish texture, broadly egg-shaped long and wide ending in a short sharp point without a beak. The winged seed measures long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Hakea corymbosa was first formally described by the botanist Robert Brown in 1830 as part of the work Supplementum primum prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae. The type specimen had been collected at King George Sound by William Baxter in 1823. The specific epithet (corymbosa) is derived from the Latin corymbus meaning \\"bunch of flowers\\", \\"peak\\" or \\"top\\" referring to the flowers growing as a flat top or in a convex arrangement. A lignotuberous form with bright yellow flowers found north of Perth was classified as a separate species, Hakea eneabba. Distribution and habitat Hakea corymbosa is native to the Great Southern, southern Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia from Williams in the west, Albany in the south to Kondinin in the north and Cape Arid in the east. It is found in acid to slightly alkaline, sandy soils over or around laterite or granite,in heath or woodland. Use in horticulture Hakea corymbosa can be grown in a sunny location in most soil types, preferring temperate climates receiving over rainfall a year. Plants in a shady spot tend to have elongated growth. It can be grown as a windbreak, hedge or for erosion control. Hakea corymbosa is recommended for attracting birds as it provides a dense safe haven with its prickly habit and nectar rich flowers as a food source. Propagation is by seed, preferably gathered using gloves due to the prickliness of the foliage.

Although the terms of reference of a project are often referred to as the project charter, there are significant differences between the two. This article describes a TOR containing detailed definitions, while a project charter has high-level requirements, assumptions, constraints and descriptions as well as a budget summary without detail, and a milestone-only schedule. Terms of reference show how the object in question will be defined, developed, and verified. They should also provide a documented basis for making future decisions and for confirming or developing a common understanding of the scope among stakeholders. In order to meet these criteria, success factors/risks and constraints are fundamental. They are very important for project proposals. Creating detailed terms of reference is critical, as they define the: * vision, objectives, scope and deliverables (i.e. what has to be achieved) * stakeholders, roles and responsibilities (i.e. who will take part in it) * resource, financial and quality plans (i.e. how it will be achieved) * work breakdown structure and schedule (i.e. when it will be achieved) TORs should include: * success factors, risks and constraints. Project life-cycle The terms of reference are created during the earlier stages of project management by the founders of the project in question, immediately after the approval of a project business case. They are documented by the project manager and presented to the project sponsor or sponsors for approval. Once the terms have been approved, the members of the project team have a clear definition of the scope of the project. They will then be ready to progress with implementing the remaining project deliverables. This phrase \\"terms of reference\\" often refers to the task(s) assigned to a consultant or adviser.

In 1949, Manansala received a six-month grant by UNESCO to study at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Banff and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. In 1950, he received a nine-month scholarship to study at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris by the French government. Marker (Macabebe, Pampanga Town hall. Later Painting Career Manansala's paintings are the best and were celebrated as the best of the barrio and the city together. His Madonna of the Slums is a portrayal of a mother and child from the countryside who became urban shanty residents once in the city. In his Jeepneys, Manansala combined the elements of provincial folk culture with the congestion issues of the city. Manansala developed transparent cubism, wherein the \\"delicate tones, shapes, and patterns of figure and environment are masterfully superimposed\\". A fine example of Manansala using this \\"transparent and translucent\\" technique is his composition, Kalabaw (Carabao). Vicente Manansala, a National Artist of the Philippines in Visual Arts, was a direct influence to his fellow Filipino neo- realists: Malang, Angelito Antonio, Norma Belleza and Manuel Baldemor.

He was born in Poitiers. Having finished his studies there, he was appointed tutor to the young comte de Valan√ßay, who was killed at the battle of Blenheim (1704). Nadal put himself under the patronage of the house of Aumont. He was received in 1706 into the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. With Jean-Aymar Piganiol de La Force, he took on the editing of the Nouveau Mercure until 1711, a premature force for literary modernism that was not successful. In 1712 he was secretary of the embassy of the duc d'Aumont to London as liaison between King Louis XIV of France and Anne, Queen of Great Britain, in the negotiations that led up to the Treaty of Utrecht. In 1716 he was appointed abbot in commendam of the Abbey of Doudeauville. Aside from his academic dissertations and his Histoire des VestalesHistoire des Vestales, avec un trait√© du luxe des dames romaines. (\\"History of the Vestal Virgins\\") (1725), which caused a stir of interest in this aspect of ancient Rome, the Abb√© Nadal composed five tragedies: Sa√ºl (1705), H√©rode (1709), Antiochus, ou les Machab√©es (1722), Mariamne (1725) and Osarphis, all on classical or biblical subjects. He was included in Le Parnasse fran√ßois project of √âvrard Titon du Tillet, which provoked Voltaire's sarcastic epigram (see √âvrard Titon du Tillet). Nadal was convinced his tragedy of Mariamne had failed because of Voltaire's \\"brigue horrible et scandaleuse\\" that set Paris against it, and said so in the preface to the printed play, giving Voltaire the opportunity to reply under a pseudonym with withering compliments (\\"Lettre de M. Thieriot √† M. l'Abb√© Nadal\\", 1725), commiserating with Nadal, that it was solely the machinations of Voltaire's intrigues \\"that one hears it said so scandalously that you are the worst versifier of the century and the most tiresome writer.\\"\\"qu‚Äôon entend dire si scandaleusement que vous √™tes le plus mauvais versificateur du si√®cle, et le plus ennuyeux √©crivain.\\" Voltaire's fine-honed savagery inspired Nadal to excise the uncomplimentary remarks about Voltaire in his prefaces when he came to collect and publish the plays in 1736 with others of his poems, in three small volumes.

History The area of Gemersk√° Poloma was variously part of Great Moravia and the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. In 1241 the area was subject to Mongol invasion. The first historical mention of the village was in 1282; as \\"Poloma\\". At the end of the 14th century, Poloma was divided into two distinct villages: Mal√° Poloma (\\"Small Poloma\\") and Veƒæk√° Poloma (\\"Big Poloma\\"). The two villages were ultimately united together again in 1958. The original name of the village comes from polom, meaning \\"broken\\" in Slovak. The story says that there was a big storm one day nearby the current village in the mountains and ruined the dwellings of the inhabitants. They therefore chose to move away from the place and settle down closer to the river on the current village site. Gemersk√° Poloma was invaded by the Ottoman Turks in 1557 and belonged to the Bebek family of ≈†t√≠tnik until the end of the 16th century. Several people died from the cholera epidemic in the period 1873‚Äì1875. Geography The village lies at an altitude of 342 metres and covers an area of 57.635 km¬≤. It has a population of about 2020 people. The river Slana passes on the southern part of the village. There are three important mountains surrounding the village: Turecka on the south, Volovec on the south-west and Sulova on the north. Culture The village has a public library a swimming pool (non-functional) and a football pitch. The most important people born in Gemerska Poloma are Peter Kellner-Hostinsk√Ω and Peter Mad√°ƒç. Peter Kellner-Hostinsk√Ω (1823-1873) was an important writer, philosopher, historitian, economist. Peter Madac was a famous doctor of medicine and a specialist in physics.

United States, 328 U.S. 640 (1946), is a case in the Supreme Court of the United States.. The case enunciated the principle of Pinkerton liability, a prominent concept in the law of conspiracy. History Walter and Daniel Pinkerton both lived separately on Daniel Pinkerton's farm. They were indicted for violations of the Internal Revenue Code. Walter Pinkerton was found guilty of nine counts of violating the tax code and one count of conspiracy. His brother Daniel was found guilty of 6 substantive counts of violating the tax code and one count of conspiracy. Daniel Pinkerton appealed, claiming that because only his brother had committed the substantive crimes he was incorrectly convicted. The actual crime committed may have been moonshining and the government chose to prosecute for tax evasion. They were suspected of \\"unlawful possession, transportation and dealing of whiskey. Issue At issue is whether a defendant can be held liable for substantive crimes committed by another in the furtherance of a conspiracy in which they are joined. Holding The Court held that when a defendant is joined in a conspiracy, substantive crimes committed to advance that conspiracy can be charged to all defendants as long as they are still part of the conspiracy when those crimes are committed.

It consists of twelve carbon, eighteen hydrogen, and six bromine atoms tied to the ring. Its primary application is in extruded (XPS) and expanded (EPS) polystyrene foam that is used as thermal insulation in the building industry. Other uses are upholstered furniture, automobile interior textiles, car cushions and insulation blocks in trucks, packaging material, video cassette recorder housing and electric and electronic equipment. According to UNEP, \\"HBCD is produced in China, Europe, Japan, and the USA. The known current annual production is approximately 28,000 tonnes per year. The main share of the market volume is used in Europe and China\\" (figures from 2009/2010).^ UNEP Stockholm Convention HBCD Risk management evaluation http://chm.pops.int/Convention/POPsReviewCommittee/Chemicals/tabid/243/Default.aspx Due to its persistence, toxicity, and ecotoxicity, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants decided in May 2013 to list hexabromocyclododecane in Annex A to the Convention with specific exemptions for production and use in expanded polystyrene and extruded polystyrene in buildings. Because HBCD has 16 possible stereo-isomers with different biological activities, the substance poses a difficult problem for manufacture and regulation. Toxicity HBCD's toxicity and its harm to the environment are current sources of concern. HBCD can be found in environmental samples such as birds, mammals, fish and other aquatic organisms as well as soil and sediment. On this basis, on 28 October 2008 the European Chemicals Agency decided to include HBCD in the SVHC list, Substances of Very High Concern, within the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals framework. On 18 February 2011, HBCD was listed in the Annex XIV of REACH and hence is subject to Authorisation. HBCD can be used until the so- called ‚Äúsunset date‚Äù (21 August 2015). After that date, only authorised applications will be allowed in the EU. HBCD has been found widely present in biological samples from remote areas and supporting evidences for its classification as Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic (PBT) and undergoes long-range environmental transportation. In July 2012, an EU harmonised classification and labelling for HBCD entered into force. HBCD has been classified as a category 2 for reproductive toxicity.Commission Regulation (EU) No 618/2012 of 10 July 2012 amending, for the purposes of its adaptation to technical and scientific progress, Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures.http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:179:0003:0010:EN:PDF Since August 2010 hexabromocyclododecanes are included in the EPA's List of Chemicals of Concern. On May 2013 the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) decided to include HBCD in the Convention‚Äôs Annex A for elimination, with specific exemptions for expanded and extruded polystyrene in buildings needed to give countries time to phase-in safer substitutes. HBCD is listed for elimination, but with a specific exemption for expanded polystyrene (EPS) and extruded polystyrene (XPS) in buildings. Countries may choose to use this exemption for up to five years after the request for exemption is submitted.https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CN/2013/CN.934.2013-Eng.pdf Japan was the first country to implement a ban on the import and production of HBCD effective in May 2014. Because HBCD has 16 possible stereo-isomers with different biological activities, the substance poses a difficult problem for manufacture and regulation. The HBCD commercial mixture is composed of three main diastereomers denoted as alpha (Œ±-HBCD), beta (Œ≤-HBCD) and gamma (Œ≥-HBCD) with traces of others. A series of four published in vivo mice studies were conducted between several federal and academic institutions to characterize the toxicokinetic profiles of individual HBCD stereoisomers. The predominant diastereomer in the HBCD mixture, Œ≥-HBCD, undergoes rapid hepatic metabolism, fecal and urinary elimination, and biological conversion to other diastereomers with a short biological half-life of 1‚Äì4 days. After oral exposure to the Œ≥-HBCD diastereomer, Œ≤-HBCD was detected in the liver and brain, and Œ±-HBCD and Œ≤-HBCD was detected in the fat and feces with multiple novel metabolites identified - monohydroxy-pentabromocyclododecane, monohydroxy-pentabromocyclododecene, dihydroxy-pentabromocyclododecene, and dihydroxy-pentabromocyclododecadiene. In contrast, Œ±-HBCD is more biologically persistent, resistant to metabolism, bioaccumulates in lipid-rich tissues after a 10-day repeated exposure study, and has a longer biological half-life of up to 21 days; only Œ±-HBCD was detected in the liver, brain, fat and feces with no stereoisomerization to Œ≥-HBCD or Œ≤-HBCD and low trace levels of four different hydroxylated metabolites were identified. Developing mice had higher HBCD tissue levels than adult mice after exposure to either Œ±-HBCD or Œ≥-HBCD indicating the potential for increased susceptibility of the developing young to HBCD effects. The reported toxicokinetic differences of individual HBCD diastereoisomers have important implications for the extrapolation of toxicological studies of the commercial HBCD mixture to the assessment of human risk.

It encompassed the area surrounded by the rivers Maritsa (Evros) in the east, Mesta (Nestos) in the west, the Rhodope Mountains in the north and the Aegean Sea in the south. Its total territory was c. 8.600 km¬≤. The whole of Western Thrace was captured by Bulgaria during the First Balkan war and awarded to the country by the Treaty of London. During the Second Balkan War the Greek Army captured most of the area between Skecha and the Maritsa river south of Soflu without encountering resistance by the weak Bulgarian army which retreated to the southern slopes of the Rhodope mountains (several kilometers to the north of Skecha and Gyumyurdzhina) while the Ottoman forces occupied the regions of Soflu, Dimotika and Ortakyoy. After the Second Balkan War the treaty of Bucharest was signed which returned the area to Bulgaria and the Greek army withdrew from Western Thrace. Thereupon local Muslims and Greeks petitioned, with the encouragement of the Greek authorities refused to recognize the Bulgarian control of the area and petitioned the Ottoman army to occupy Western Thrace. On their invitation, the region was then occupied by small Ottoman forces, largely irregulars. While the area had been returned to Bulgaria by the Bucharest treaty, the Bulgarian army wished to conflict with the Ottomans and retreated to a line coinciding with the pre- Balkan war border up to Aydomush and from there along a ridge of the Rhodope mountains running west of Daridere and east of Madan up to the Bulgarian-Greek border.The Destruction of Thracian Bulgarians in 1913, Lybomir Miletich, 1918, p. 205 After the retreat of both the Bulgarian and Greek armies, an autonomous state was declared with Ottoman support, in order to avoid Bulgarian rule after the Treaty of Bucharest, in which the Ottomans had not taken part. Under British pressure, the Bulgaria and the Ottomans signed the Treaty of Constantinople, which satisfied the Turkish claims to recognition of Eastern Thrace and recognized Western Thrace as part of Bulgaria. The Ottomans withdrew their forces and by 25 October, and the area was returned by Bulgaria. The southern part of the former Provisional government was occupied in 1918 by French forces. This area was finally annexed by Greece in 1920 and has been part of that country ever since, except for the Bulgarian occupation between 1941‚Äì1944. The northern part of the former Provisional Government remained part of Bulgaria after 1919. The capital of Provisional Government of Western Thrace capital was G√ºm√ºlcine, now Komotini, in Greece.

The Copertino Castle is a castle in Apulia, southern Italy. It is located in the eponymous city of Copertino, north of Gallipoli on the heel of Apulia, between Manduria and Galatina. Overview Like the castle of Otranto, Copertino was built for the defence of the peninsular of the Salento. The castle was originally built in the Norman period, and altered significantly for Alfonso Castriota by Charles V's renowned fortifications expert Evangelista Menga in 1540, in response to significant military developments including the use of gunpowder. The alterations included a ditch and majestic bastions with 90 arrow slits to allow cannon movements. Copertino therefore incorporates an Angevin keep, being later enlarged to a quadrangle plan with a tapered rampart at each of the four corners. The entrance portal is in Catalan-Durazzesque style, conceived as a triumphal arch, with the entrance to the family chapel of St Mark to the right of the entrance vestibule. The chapel itself is decorated with 15th Century frescoes by the mannerist painter Gianserio Strafella. The Castle's inner courtyard includes several enormous galleries, and to the left of the Castle's entrance is the porticoed palace built for the Squarciafico Pinelli, Counts of Copertino and Marquesses of Galatone, ancestors of the Princes of Belmonte. Copertino Castle is one of the largest fortresses constructed in Apulia. It is held in local folklore that Isabella of Clermont, daughter of Tristan de Clermont and Catherine of Taranto, who later became Queen of Naples, was born at Copertino Castle.

BMW manufactured 40,218 units, including a smaller engine version, the R850C, which was produced from 1997 to 2000. The R1200C was BMW's attempt to tap into this market, and was a significant departure from their previous endeavors. The R1200C was designed by BMW head designer David Robb, featuring a cruiser riding posture. From its inception, the R1200C featured a passenger seat that could fold up to become a driver backrest with three different angles, adjustable while riding. BMW first released the R1200C with an advance promotional placement of the motorcycle in the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies. The R1200C was one of four BMW motorcycles featured in The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City in 1998. When BMW ended production of the R1200C lineup, Dr. Herbert Diess, then President BMW Motorrad, cited a prime reason for discontinuing the bike was the apparent unsuitability of the , engine to then current market tastes and the unavailability of a suitable engine for further development, but did not rule out BMW pursuing a reinterpretation of the cruiser idea at a later date. In 2004 a final special model of the R1200C Montauk (sold as a 2005 model and registered as such)as a commemorative Montauk model was presented, of which 350 units were built. Only six of these units were shipped to North America, all six to the Canadian market. 4 into Ontario and 2 into Quebec. Since originally shipped to this market, one has been imported into the USA. The special models are: *Classic: The \\"Classic\\" was not a new model, but after the Avantgarde and the Independent versions came on the market, it was the \\"original\\" R1200C. *Avantgarde: Introduced in 2000, less chrome (added graphite look), medium height bars, ABS a cost option. *Independent (designated \\"Phoenix\\" for U.S. market): Introduced in 2001, single seat (passenger seat and foot pegs optional), two-tone paint, new aluminum wheels, speedster style windshield, fog lamps, white indicator lenses, BMW rondel on alternator cover. *Montauk: Introduced in 2003, overall ‚Äòbeefier‚Äô design. Extended rake front end, alloy wheels and instrument panel from the R1200CL, braided brake hoses, additional vertically stacked headlight. *Troika: Meaning trike or three-wheel model, it is a R1200C with a side car. Displayed at the IAA (Internationale Automobil Ausstellung) in Frankfurt in 1997, the side car had a torpedo-like nose, interior with leather matching the motorcycle seat, a shock that laid horizontally in front of the third wheel with a wooden step over it for the passenger, and a spoked wheel matching the motorcycle wheels. *R1200CL: Introduced in 2002, full dress touring model that added a tachometer and analog-style clock to the instrument panel, extended rake, larger wheel size, alloy wheels, fairing, two smaller stacked separate lights for high beams, cruise control, driver floor boards, heel/toe shifter, six-speed gear box, oversized passenger seat, two 12V power outlets, heated hand grips, heated seats, clam-shell side cases and removable top case with passenger backrest. An oddity of the R1200CL was its \\"M\\" shaped windscreen that created a large notch in the center so the driver has an unobstructed view ahead. The alternator was upgraded to a massive 840W. Electronics and alarm for an optional, keyless anti-theft system were pre-installed. *R1200CLC: Same as the R1200CL, but with ABS braking standard, radio, CD player, chrome alternator cover, chrome engine guard and chrome side luggage guards. *2000 Changes: For the 2000 production year BMW introduced an 850cc version, called the R850C. For the 1200cc model, new colors configurations were available including a black engine, the rear shock was upgraded to be an adjustable hydraulic shock, and the electronic ignition and fuel injection were adjusted. *2004 Changes: For the final production year BMW added dual ignition, integral ABS (the brake pedal and lever, when applied independently, actuate both front and rear brakes simultaneously), improved transmission, and a passenger comfort seat available at no extra cost. R1200C in film The R1200C features in the 1997 James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies. Michelle Yeoh, in her role as Chinese spy Wai Lin, rode the bike in the scene where she and 007 run from Elliot Carver's henchmen, who are chasing them in a helicopter. In 2012, the bike was later featured in the Bond in Motion. 50 Vehicles. 50 Years exhibition at the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu, England.

He retired after the Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì1829) with the rank of Major General, but was recalled to active service on the occasion of the Hungarian Revolt of 1848. After giving up his military career, Buturlin was appointed Director of the Imperial Public Library in 1843. Buturlin's obscurantist views led him to demand from Czar Nicholas I of Russia an all- pervasive system of censorship. During the last year of his life he headed the Buturlin Committee, a secret super-censorship organ that supervised all regular censors. The Committee was disbanded early in the reign of Alexander II of Russia. As a historian Buturlin described in detail the major wars of Catherine II's reign and the Patriotic War of 1812. Many of his works are in French. He viewed Alexander I as the true saviour of Russia and ranked the Battle of Borodino among Kutuzov's mistakes.

During his playing career, he was widely known for his partnership with Steve Bull at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Playing career Mutch was a trainee at Liverpool and Everton but was not taken on as a professional footballer. He was playing for non-league Southport when then-Third Division Wolverhampton Wanderers signed him in February 1986. He made his Wolves debut on 8 March 1986 in a goalless draw with Rotherham United, but despite scoring 7 goals in 15 games could not halt relegation to the bottom tier. The following season saw the start of his prolific goalscoring partnership with Steve Bull, who arrived in the November. The partnership propelled the team to the play-offs, where they narrowly missed out. In the 1987-88 season, Mutch and Bull scored 53 league goals between them and helped Wolves win Fourth Division Championship. The following season the duo scored a further 58 (83 in all competitions), to fire Wolves to the Third Division Championship and a second successive promotion. He would remain at Wolves for five more seasons, but despite his efforts and those of his colleagues he was unable to take them into the top flight. Mutch also scored in Wolves' 2‚Äì0 victory over Burnley in the Associate Members' Cup at Wembley in May 1988. Mutch's goal-scoring prowess was recognised by a call-up to the England B squad in 1989 ‚Äì making three appearances against Switzerland, Norway and Iceland. He also represented his country at under-21 level. In August 1993, Mutch left Molineux for Premier League new boys Swindon Town in a ¬£250,000 deal. His total record at Wolves was 106 goals in 288 appearances (13 as substitute). His first game for the Wiltshire side came against Liverpool in a 5‚Äì0 league defeat, but in his fifth game he made it onto the scoresheet for the first time with an equaliser in a 2‚Äì2 draw against also promoted Newcastle United. He also scored a consolation goal later in September in a 4‚Äì2 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford, and would score a total of six league goals that season (eight in all competitions), but it wasn't enough to stop Swindon from going down with a mere five wins from 42 games and 100 goals conceded. After two seasons at Swindon ‚Äì including his one and only season in the top flight ‚Äì Mutch was loaned to Wigan Athletic but the move was not made permanent, and he instead moved to Stockport County in early 1996. He spent two seasons at Edgeley Park, which saw the club win promotion to the second tier and reach the semi-finals of the League Cup under Dave Jones. He left Stockport at the end of the 1997-98 season, signing for non-league Barrow, and later returning to play a game for his former club Southport. He ended his playing career while working as a coach at Telford United in 2000. In the 1994/95 Premier League season his Merlin sticker was the most common amongst collectors. In 2013 Mutch was inducted into the Wolverhampton Wanderers Hall Of Fame. Management career As his playing career had ended, Mutch transitioned into coaching, with spells as assistant manager of both Telford United (while still playing) and Morecambe (2001‚Äì2004). He joined Vauxhall Motors in July 2007 as assistant manager, but soon stepped up to become manager in October 2007 after the resignation of Carl Macauley. He left the club after their 6‚Äì0 defeat at home to Kettering Town in March 2008, as Macauley returned to the club. In October 2008, he was appointed manager of Burscough of the Conference North. By early 2009 he had left the club. On 8 May 2012, Mutch was announced as manager of Northwich Victoria. He left the club having resigned, along with player-coach Adriano Rigoglioso on 3 November, with the club eighth in the table, and 21 points behind leaders Coalville Town On 1 October 2013 Mutch was appointed as manager of Evo Stik Premier Club Stafford Rangers after a successful interim period, but left by mutal consent on 2 January after a run of very poor results.

On 31 March 1620, \\"Archibald Acheson, a Scotchman\\", was knighted at Theobalds by King James 1st,Shaw, William A., The Knights of England, vol.2, London, 1906, p.175. and in 1621 he was appointed Master in Chancery of Ireland. Sometime before 25 October 1626 he was appointed a Lord of Session of Scotland as 'Lord Glencairn'.The Great Seal of Scotland (printed editions) no.1007 of that date. On 21 October 1627 he was appointed by King Charles 1st, Royal Secretary of State of Scotland.The Great Seal of Scotland, no.1158 confirmation on that date. On 1 January 1628, he was made a Baronet of Nova Scotia. Ireland In 1610 numerous land grants were made in the county of Armagh, precinct of Fewes. One is of 2000 acres to Sir James Douglas, Knt., of Spott, Haddingtonshire, subsequently sold the next year to Henry Acheson, who afterwards sold it to Sir Archibald Acheson. A further 1000 acres originally granted to Henry was also sold on to Sir Archibald Acheson in 1628.Hanna, Charles A., The Scotch-Irish, 2 vols., 1902. p.506, chapter xxxv: \\"The Ulster Plantation from 1610 to 1630\\". Acheson does not ever appear to have resided in Ireland, however, and his position in the Court of Chancery there appears titular; his judicial duties were all in Scotland. He nevertheless became a \\"denizen\\" of Ireland on 12 February 1618, presumably in order to qualify for the lands he was receiving from his brother, Henry Acheson of Dromlech, Co. Armagh. Certainly Sir Archibald's second son, George, resided in Ireland.Townend, Peter, editor, Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 105th edition, London, 1970, p.1139.

After his first wife died, Sir Archibald remarried in 1622, Margaret, daughter of Sir John Hamilton and Johanna Everard, by whom he had a son, George (1629-1685).Scot, Sir John, of Scotstarvet,1754 By his first wife he had a daughter, Jean, who married Sir Lewis Lauder of Over Gogar & Alderston, Knt., (c1599-c1640), Sheriff-Principal of Edinburgh and son of Sir Alexander Lauder of Haltoun, Knt.Crawford, Donald, editor, Journals of Sir John Lauder, Lord Fountainhall, 1665-1676, Edinburgh, 1900, p.191.The Great Seal of Scotland, no.1614, confirmed 17 March 1645. They had at least three known children. Jean was still living on 3 April 1663 as \\"relict of Sir Lewes Lauder of Over Gogar\\".Books of Council & Session, National Archives of Scotland, Deed recorded 3 April 1663. He may have had another daughter by one of his marriages, Isabella Acheson of Gosford, who married Hector Og Maclean (1583‚Äì1623). Sources list her as the daughter of \\"Sir Archibald Acheson\\", but because of her age, she may have been the daughter of Captain Patrick Acheson or one of his siblings. If she was the same age as Hector Og Maclean, she would have been born in 1583 and would have had her first child around 1600 at age 17. If she was the daughter of Sir Archibald Acheson she would be born no earlier than 1610 the year Archibald married. This would make her at least 20 years younger than Hector Og Maclean, and would make her the same age as her own children. This is the error in the standard genealogy. His eldest son Patrick succeeded him to the baronetcy but having died without issue several years after his father, whereupon the title passed to his half-brother George Acheson, 3rd Baronet, who relocated to Ireland and in 1657 was High Sheriff of counties Armagh and Tyrone.Townend, 1970, p.1139.

History Both Rowan and Grisman were virtuoso folk and bluegrass performers in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, clubs, who became caught up in the changes in the music scene in the mid-1960s. They formed Earth Opera in 1967 in Boston, and were joined by John Nagy on bass, Paul Dillon on drums, and Bill Stevenson on keyboards and vibraphone. The group was signed by Jac Holzman to Elektra Records. Their self-titled debut album, produced by Grisman's ex-bandmate Peter Siegel, and including veteran drummer (and Mothers of Invention alumnus) Billy Mundi, was a mixture of folk and psychedelic influences. The group frequently opened for The Doors, who were also on Elektra Records. Although the first album never charted, Elektra was willing to record a second LP, The Great American Eagle Tragedy. By this time, Stevenson had left. The second album featured an array of eminent guests including John Cale (viola) and Bill Keith (pedal steel). The Great American Eagle Tragedy managed to reach the lower end of the national charts, the cover featuring a parody of the U.S. presidential seal with a superimposed death skull and what looks like blood stains. However, the band's relative lack of success caused Earth Opera to break up in 1969. Rowan, Grisman, Nagy, and Stevenson all continued their careers in the music business. (Nagy became a producer and engineer, including producing the late Mimi Farina (Solo, 1986)) In 2002, both of Earth Opera's LPs were reissued on CD.

During a party in Hollywood showing off his fifth Dr. Death film, he announces his engagement to Ellen Mason (Julie Crosthwait), who gives him an engraved watch as an engagement gift. Later that evening, however, adult film producer Oliver Quayle (Robert Quarry) reveals Ellen had worked for him previously. Distraught at Toombes' angry reaction, Ellen returns to her room, where a masked man in dark garb, similar to Dr. Death's attire, approaches her with a knife. An apologetic Toombes comes in shortly after, only for her severed head to fall from her shoulders. Though he is acquitted of the crime, Toombes' career is destroyed as he spends several years in a mental hospital, where even he is not sure whether he killed Ellen or not. After his release, Toombes is called to London by his friend, screenwriter Herbert Flay (Peter Cushing), who has partnered with Quayle to produce a Dr. Death television series for the BBC. While on the cruise ship en route to England, Toombes encounters a persistent young actress (Linda Hayden), who steals his watch and follows him through London and eventually to Flay's house. In the spider-infested basement, Toombes discovers Faye Carstairs (Adrienne Corri), the female lead in one of the Dr. Death movies and now Flay's reluctant wife, driven mad after being disfigured in a car accident. Outside Flay's house, the young actress discovers the masked man walking the grounds; believing it to be Toombes, she approaches him, only to be killed with a pitchfork. When her body is discovered, Scotland Yard suspects Toombes, as the killing resembles a scene from one of his films. Toombes publicly berates his female co-star on set; she is soon found hanged by her hair, another scene from a Dr. Death film. Scotland Yard questions him but finds no conclusive evidence. Toombes is harassed by the parents of the actress from the boat, who threatens to deliver the watch to the police unless he pays them a ransom. However, the masked man lures them into the house and impales them both with a broadsword. On the set, the director is crushed by a descending bed canopy in a trap intended for Toombes. Later, Toombes is chased through the BBC studio by the masked man while on his way to an interview. Julia Wilson (Natasha Pyne), Quayle's public relations chief, discovers a contract in Quayle's files, but is killed by the masked man; Toombes discovers her body and suffers a nervous breakdown. Taking Julia's body onto the set, he locks himself inside, turns the camera on, and sets it ablaze. Believing Toombes to have died in the fire, Flay signs a contract to take his place as Dr. Death. Later he watches the reel of film from Toombes' death in his home ‚Äì only to see Toombes seemingly walk out of the screen, burned but apparently very much alive. When Toombes demands why Flay wishes to destroy him, Flay rages that he had written the Dr. Death role for himself, but was passed over in favour of Toombes; he murdered Ellen to frame Toombes in the hopes of destroying his career but was still not given the role. He then reveals that the contract that Julia had discovered stipulated that if Toombes died, Flay would take over as Dr. Death. The two struggle into the basement, where Flay is stabbed and killed by Faye and fed to her spiders. Toombes applies makeup to his burn-scarred face, now looking similar to Flay, and sits down to dinner with Faye.

Interviewer * Linda Hayden as Elizabeth Peters * Barry Dennen as Gerry Blount * Ellis Dale as Alfred Peters * Catherine Willmer as Louise Peters * John Garrie as Inspector Harper * Ian Thompson as Bradshaw * Jenny Lee-Wright as Carol Clayton * Julie Crosthwait as Ellen Mason * Peter Halliday as Psychiatrist The title credits mention \\"special participation\\" by Basil Rathbone and Boris Karloff, who had died in 1967 and 1969, respectively; the film included scenes in which they had appeared with Vincent Price from previous AIP films (Rathbone from Tales of Terror [1962], Karloff from The Raven [1963]). Other AIP films starring Price that had scenes played in the film include The Haunted Palace, The Pit and the Pendulum, Scream and Scream Again, and House of Usher. Release The film performed considerably less well at the box office than other horror movies Price had made for AIP and Samuel Z. Arkoff considered it marked the end of the horror cycle. Reception Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 3/4 stars, calling it \\"Good, if somewhat unimaginative\\". Time Out gave the film a mostly positive review, noting its tendency to go over-the-top, but commended the film's interweaving of Price's character Toombes with the actor's actual film career, and \\"reasonably witty in its use of inter-penetrating fantasies born of the Dream Factory\\". Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews awarded the film a grade B-, calling it, \\"Cheesy but enjoyable\\". Not all reviews have been positive, TV Guide awarded the film 1/5 stars, writing, \\"With its behind-the- scenes setting and focus on an aging star whose glory days are behind him, this could have been a wonderful elegy to the twilight of Price's long career. Unfortunately, the script and direction simply aren't up to the task, and the film becomes an inferior spin-off of Dr. Phibes series. Not even the interaction between Price and Cushing--two very different actors--manages to generate much interest, leaving the clips from Price's Corman-AIP films the best part of the movie.\\" References External links   Category:1974 films Category:1974 horror films Category:British films Category:British crime thriller films Category:British horror films Category:American films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American mystery films Category:Amicus Productions films Category:English-language films Category:Films about actors Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films based on horror novels Category:Films scored by Douglas Gamley Category:Mariticide in fiction Category:British serial killer films ","title":"Madhouse (1974 film)"},{"id":"7146892","text":"Kobeliarovo (1466 Fekethepathak,. 1551 Kobelar, 1773 Kobelarow ) (; ) is a village and municipality in the Ro≈æ≈àava District in the Ko≈°ice Region of middle-eastern Slovakia.

In addition, the village also has a cultural centre, which can be rented out to host dances, and parties. It also houses ping pong tables, and a currently inactive library. There is also a school that is situated parallel to the cultural centre, but the school had to be closed down, most likely because of the high influx of gypsy children entering the school. Finally, there is monument dedicated to fallen Hungarian soldiers during the two world wars, it is situated directly in front of the church. Demographics Historically, the village has always been primarily white Hungarian. Recently however, Slovak and Roma (Gypsy) immigration has had profound effects on the demographics of the village. There has been an alarming increase of Roma in the village, with their population increasing over 500% in the last two decades, climbing to almost 50% of the total population. In terms of language, most of the village could be classified as bilingual, with both language groups (Slovak and Hungarian) having general understanding of the other. Economy The local steel factory situated in the village is its greatest economic contributor, employing not only the locals, but the surrounding area as well. In addition, the village has two soccer fields (a significant feat for a village of such low population). The more recently built soccer field's quality even exceeds that of the largest town in the area, Ro≈æ≈àava. The village also has three grocery stores, two pubs, and a bar.

A limited edition SuperSport called the SuperLight was sold in 1992. The name harked back to the round case 1973 Ducati 750 Super Sport, and the 1975 square case 750 and 900 Super Sport. The appellation 'SS' was applied only to the later belt drive (Pantah) based models. History (1972‚Äì1981) Miglia di Imola, 1972 Modern Ducati, as well as the Super Sport can be traced back to April 1972 when Ducati won the Imola 200 (the European equivalent of the Daytona 200) with a for-production based 750 cc, desmodromic valve v-twin motor developed by Fabio Taglioni. Imola was a traditionally fast circuit that placed a premium on high-speed handling rather than brute horsepower. The Super Sport prototypes used for the inaugural race were developed using a 750 GT based engine and frame and earned instant fame when legendary racer Paul Smart and Bruno Spaggiari finished first and second, respectively, immediately elevating Ducati from a company known for \\"quaintly individual\\" motorcycles and into the superbike market. Super Sport Prototype The first official Super Sport prototypes used the 750 Sport and 750 GT models for their basis, but featured bodywork styled along the lines of the Imola bikes. The frame was painted blue while the fiberglass gas tank, covers and top half of the fairing were silver. The gas tank also featured a unique translucent strip to be able to quickly see the fuel level. 1974 Super Sport 1974 marked the first year of mass production of Super Sport. The bike featured 10.5:1 compression ratio, a voluminous 6 gallon gas tank and a claimed weight of . A mere 401 1974 Super Sports were produced and the bike immediately set new standards for production motorcycles and had unique styling, but for all intents and purposes it was a pure production racer with the minimum of concessions to make it street legal. Unfortunately, the complicated bevel gear-driven camshaft made the bike uneconomical to produce, thus the 1974 model is the only round-case 90-degree v-twin with desmodromic valve gear. However the 1974 model bike is considered to be the most significant production bike in Ducati's history, mostly because it offered the highest standards of handling and performance available at that time and essentially saved Ducati from extinction. 1975‚Äì1981 Square Case Super Sport Square Case Ducati Super Sport 900 Supersport In 1975, two versions of the Super Sport were made available based on the 864 cc \\"square-case\\" 90-degree twin cylinder motor; the full 864 cc version coined the 900 and a sleeved down 750. 250 examples of each were produced but the 750 and 900 are virtually identical. The 1975 Super Sport continued to use the right-side gear shift, contradicting the 1974 U.S. regulation that all bikes have the gear shifting on the left side of the engine. Despite this, a handful of right side Super Sports have made it into the United States. Most of the subsequent changes made to the Super Sport model were to comply with global legislation. Quieter mufflers, relocated shifting and rear brake and new foot pegs. The biggest improvement was the redesign of the kick-starter. On the 1975 model the kick starter would rotate around and shift the transmission into first gear. If the bike was not on the center-stand the rider could potentially have a very unpleasant surprise. Because the price of the 750 Super Sport was very similar to 900, very few 750s were produced with the majority of them being shipped to Australia, Germany or staying in Italy for racing applications. By 1978 the bike looked identical, but several significant improvements had made their way into the motor making them more reliable and solving problems with engine cranks breaking. The electronics also improved as well as some minor timing tweaks making the bike run more efficiently. Most notable was a majorly redesigned gear shifter that made the bike a lot easier for owners to live with the bike. Most 1978 900 Super Sports also came with a dual seat and lockable tool box. The solo seat was available as an option. The 1978 model bike is considered to be the finest iteration of the bevel drive square case Super Sports. The 1978 900 and 1979 750s were the last to retain close links with the Imola racers and the last to come with traditional spoke wheels. it was also in 1978 that the Isle of Man TT Formula 1 race was won by a 900 Super Sport, ridden by former World Champion Mike Hailwood in a popular comeback race. In 1979 the Super Sports were painted black with gold accents to appeal to the British market. Cast Campagnolo wheels replaced the Borrani alloy rims and a Mike Hailwood Replica was made available in very limited numbers painted in lavish green and red schemes. The new changes, specifically the black and gold paint and cast wheels were very successful at making an aging design look more modern. The 1980 model stayed essentially the same with no notable changes. Essentially, the Super Sport was being transitioned into the Mike Hailwood Replica. 1981 900SS (UK spec) - Showing revised tail section, side panels, Campagnolo cast wheels and 40mm Dell'Orto carburetor, with Conti-replica exhausts and Mike Hailwood fairing Into the early 1980s the fuel tank became less angular and more rounded while the tail section was revised to look more modern with a duck-tail sweep. Side covers were integrated into the tail-section and swoopy paint lines tried to connect the design together. All in all, the early 80s Super Sports were somewhat uninspiring and were met with limited success. In 1982 the Super Sport was replaced, mostly in name only, by the S2. Ducati SuperSport (SS) (1988‚Äì2007) Announced in 1988, the Ducati SuperSport used a Pantah based 904 cc air-cooled 90¬∞ V-twin, two-valve \\"Desmodue\\" engine with crankcases derived from the 851 motor. It was mounted in a tubular trellis frame. The resurrection was due largely to Ducati being bought out by Cagiva and the first reborn SuperSport was released as a 750 Sport. It met with failure due to its 16-inch wheels and a kludgy Weber carburator and cracking swingarms. From 1988 to 1991, the model was called a 900 SuperSport, and had a full fairing. The 1989 Supersport received a revised air/oil cooled motor from the 906cc Ducati Paso incorporating many changes to the Pantah motor, including a six-speed gear box. From 1989 to 1990 the motorcycle was fitted with a Marzocchi rear suspension, then first changed to Showa, and then to better quality Marzocchi damping in 1990. Marzocchi M1BB front forks were used until 1990, when they were replaced by Showa upside down units. The Marelli Digiplex ignition was used in early models, and then replaced by a Kokusan ignition. Smaller SuperSports: 350SS/400SS/600SS The Ducati 350SS, Ducati 400SS and Ducati 600SS were Ducati sport bike motorcycles made from 1989 through 1999 for the Japanese and Italian markets. The 350/400 SS models were produced to meet regulations under the prevailing driving license schemes in Japan (400 cc) and Italy (350 cc), where there were limits on maximum displacement allowed for probationary motorcyclists. The 600SS was introduced in 1994 as a midrange competitor for a growing market, and to provide a cheap way to spread the Ducati range. Visually, they are only slightly different from the other SS models. Also known as the 400SS Junior, the models were based on the larger 750SS with which they shared a frame, engine and most other components. The most obvious differences were the 2-into-1 exhaust system on some versions (also used the 600) and the single-disc front brake. The 600SS had five gears instead of the six on the 350 and 400. The smaller engine capacity was achieved by sleeving down the larger 750SS engine. The models were available semi-faired or with a full fairing. As with the Ducati 750SS and 900SS, vents were provided in the cowl in the 1997 model to provide additional air to the rear cylinder, which was prone to overheating. File:Ducati 600 SS face.jpg|600 SS front File:Ducati 600 SS arri√®re.jpg|600 SS rear File:400ss.JPG|400 SS 1991‚Äì1998 The 1991 Supersports were produced with white chrome molybdenum steel frames and white wheels. The swingarms used needle bearings instead of bushings as in the past. Brakes from the Ducati 851 were used on the Supersport vastly improving braking performance. All new bodywork and a pivoting fuel tank were elegantly shaped. The revised Supersports were met with immediate success and became wildly popular. Even though the 1991 Supersport was extremely well developed, Ducati would continue to refine the bike over the years. From 1991 to 1998, the model was called 900SS, and was available with a full (SS) or half fairing (SS/CR). 1992 saw the addition to the SS/SL (Superlight). In 1994, to further differentiate the 900 from smaller Supersports additional models were released in addition the Superlight. The 900 SS/SP (Sport Production) was offered to the North American market only. This model had carbon fiber fenders and clutch cover, sound damping material, adjustable Showa suspension, and an aluminum swingarm. The Superlight had the same options as the SS SP but with a single seat and upswept mufflers. The CRs came with a non adjustable suspension, a steel swingarm, and a narrower 4.5-inch rear wheel and 160 section rear tire. Many riders feel the aluminum swingarms are more desirable; however aluminum swingarms on older Supersports and Monsters are prone to cracking. In 1997, as Supersport sales were declining due to the popularity of the Ducati Monster and Ducati Superbike lines, Ducati attempted to keep the model alive with a few final changes. Yellow was added as a color option, an additional air intake was added as well as new, bolder graphics; namely the \\"Ducati\\" emblazoned across the entire side of the Supersport body panel. In 1998, only 200 red and 200 yellow SS/CRs were imported to the United States. They featured the last of the Cagiva graphics and elephant but had 1998 spec. motors with new pistons, cylinders and lower mounted oil cooler. A final series Supersport the SS/FE (Final Edition) was also available in 98, but featured the new graphics, came only in silver with black wheels, had the single seat and upswept exhausts of the Superlight and represented the last carburated Supersport.

In 1993 the vented clutch cover, fully floating Brembo front discs, and lightweight Marvic wheels and guards disappeared from the Mark 2 SuperLight, and there was now only the fully floating rear brake to differentiate it from the 900 SuperSport. 1999‚Äì2007 Ducati Super Sport In 1999, the Supersport had a major facelift. The fairing was redesigned after the Ducati Supermono and fuel injection introduced. The 1999 model was one of the first Ducatis designed by Pierre Terblanche and met with very limited success based on its controversial aesthetics. The SS was available with 750 cc and 900 cc engines, both offered with either full fairing or half fairing. A lower spec \\"Sport\\" model was offered. In 2003 Ducati replaced the 750 and 900 with three new variations: 620 cc, 800 cc and 1000 cc. Only the 620 was offered with half fairing. Eventually, only the 1,000 cc version was available, which was finally discontinued in 2007. The Supersport 1000 DS had a 992cc air-cooled L-Twin engine with twin spark ignition, which Ducati described as \\"the most advanced air-cooled Desmo engine ever to be built by Ducati.\\" The front suspension had fully adjustable 43mm Showa forks, with an Ohlins single shock (also fully adjustable) at the back. The Supersport 1000 DS had a pair of Brembo Gold Series callipers with 320 mm discs at the front and a single 245 mm disc at the rear, along with lightweight 5-spoke Marchesini wheels. The Supersport 1000 DS produced 95.2 Nm of torque at 5750 rpm, and 95 hp power at 7750 rpm. The SS naming convention was eventually dropped and the line evolved into the SportClassic line that includes the Sport 1000 and GT 1000, and another Paul Smart replica, the PaulSmart 1000 LE. Ducati 800SS The Ducati 800SS, introduced in 2003, is the smaller capacity, higher revving version of that year's air-cooled Ducati SuperSport (SS) model range. The 800SS is a popular base for production racing in the United States, where it competes against motorcycles such as the Suzuki SV650. It is also eligible for racing in the UK in the Minitwins series with a variety of clubs such as Bemsee/MRO, North Gloucester Road Racing Club (NGRRC), and the North East Motorcycle Racing Club (NEMCRC). ;History In 2003 a new fuel-injected desmodromic 90¬∞ V-twin, 88 mm x 66 mm, 803 cc engine, and a new six-speed gearbox were offered in the Supersport 800. There were two versions available: the 800 Supersport and the 800 Sport. The Supersport featured a high specification chassis whilst the Sport was a lower cost version with a less well-specified chassis. Both used the same engine and came in with either a full fairing or half-fairing. The two-valve per cylinder engine produced 74.5 hp @ 8250 rpm, and 70 N¬∑m (7.1 kgf¬∑m) @ 6250 rpm. Earlier 2003-2004 Supersport models had a high- specification chassis featuring fully adjustable Showa front forks and a fully adjustable Sachs shock absorber. From 2004 onwards Ducati reduced the level of chassis specification to that of the Sport (which was subsequently dropped from the range some time later). The alloy swinging arm was replaced with a steel item; the five-spoke Marchesini wheels were replaced by three-spoke wheels by Brembo; the front forks were replaced by non-adjustable Marzocchi items; the Brembo Goldline clutch and brake master cylinder were replaced with lower specification items as found on many lower-capacity Ducati Monsters. From 2006 the 800SS was no longer imported into the UK although it was still available in the United States in limited numbers in 2007.  Ducati SuperSport (2017-2020) 2018 Ducati Supersport S White/Red (stock) At the Intermot 2016, Ducati announced a new SuperSport, that would be available around March or April 2017. The bike uses the 937 cc Testastretta motor (from the Hypermotard 939), but the power arrives lower in the rev range, and final drive gear ratios are longer. The 2017 SuperSport uses a trellis frame and some similarities in appearance to the Panigale, but configured as a \\"relaxed sport bike\\", with a much less radical riding position. The bike is available in two versions, standard and \\"S\\". The \\"S\\" version features a digital quickshifter and fully adjustable √ñhlins suspension at front and rear, but the quickshifter may be ordered for the standard bike. Optional packages includes a \\"Sport Pack\\" (carbon front fender, carbon tank cover, and bespoke brake reservoir covers) or a \\"Touring Pack\\" (semi-rigid panniers, a touring windscreen, and heated grips).

History  Cal Air International was initially conceived in early 1982 after the sudden demise of Laker Airways which had left a large gap in the UK Inclusive tour/charter market. The airline was a joint set up between British Caledonian and the Rank Organisation which already had its interests firmly established in the travel industry with its own tour operators: Blue Sky Travel/Holidays, Wings Holidays, Ellerman Travel and OSL Holidays. The airline was initially named 'British Caledonian Charter' with exactly the same livery as its parent company British Caledonian. Two ex Laker Airways/Skytrain DC-10-10s were acquired along with many highly experienced ex Laker Airways Pilots, Flight Engineers and Cabin Crew. The DC-10s were re-registered as G-BJZE and G-BJZD. However it was not long before British Caledonian realised that its own high quality scheduled product and image was being somewhat tarnished by the more utility charter product in addition to the general public not being able to differentiate between the two companies, even the charter cabin crew all wore identical tartan uniforms to those of the parent company. It was therefore decided to make slight changes to the charter company and livery by introducing 'BCA Charter' decals to the aircraft and outlining the golden St Andrews lion rampant tail logo with a white shield. This lasted only a short time when a radical step was taken between the Rank Organisation and BCAL to completely rebrand the charter arm as 'Cal Air International' This saw the introduction of a striking bold livery never seen in the UK at the time. Douglas DC-10-10 of Cal Air at Manchester Airport in 1988 Cal Air‚Äôs DC-10s were mainly used on UK charter flights to the usual popular Mediterranean resorts, North Africa and the Canary Islands. Long haul destinations included Orlando & Tampa Florida, Los Angeles USA, Caribbean, Toronto & Vancouver Canada and The Gambia & Kenya in Africa. A third ex Laker Airways DC-10-10 was acquired in 1986 and re-registered G-GCAL. Occasional ad hoc charter work was also undertaken which saw the companies DC-10s flying to destinations all over the world. In 1988 British Caledonian was bought by and merged into British Airways. Cal Air International was of no interest to British Airways. The Rank Organisation decided to buy the other 50% share of the company making it the wholly owned subsidiary. This created a problem as the name 'Cal Air International' along with the lion rampant logo in red and its Female Flight Attendants wearing tartan uniforms, was too close in image and style to the new start up British Airways charter airline Caledonian Airways which was now the new face and product of what was known for many years as British Airtours. It was decided that the company would change its name and livery yet again. Various names were seriously considered including 'Bel Air' and 'Phoenix International Airlines'. However, it was Novair International Airways that won the vote. The livery was adapted slightly to take in the new name and a huge shooting blue star was emblazoned on the tail fin. Novair International Airways went on to add three brand new Boeing 737-400 to its fleet of 3 DC-10s deploying them at its Manchester and Glasgow bases. The company stopped operating & closed its doors for good in early 1990 after the Rank organisation could not find a suitable buyer. Both DC-10s G-BJZD & G-BJZE went to FedEx in the USA while G-GCAL operates as a flying eye hospital for Orbis International. Some of the B-737-400 went to British Midland.  Livery  A predominantly white body with a red sash-like diagonal stripe incorporating large \\"Cal Air\\" titling. The tail logo had a large British Caledonian style Scottish Lion Rampant in red.  Fleet  Cal Air International operated three aircraft in its three years of operation consisting of two ex-Laker Airways McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10s: G-BJZD and G-BJZE. A third DC-10 was acquired in February 1986 G-GCAL. Orders were also placed for 3 MD-80s but these were never fulfilled.

Life and career Quarry was born in Santa Rosa, California, the son of Mable (n√©e Shoemaker) and Paul Quarry, a doctor. His grandmother was an actress. He left school at the age of 14 to pursue a career in radio. During World War II in November 1943, Quarry joined the United States Army, where he formed a theatrical troupe. After the war he acted again, first for RKO and then for MGM. His films include Count Yorga, Vampire (1970), its sequel The Return of Count Yorga (1971), and Dr. Phibes Rises Again (1972), in which he played alchemist Dr. Biederbeck pitted against Vincent Price's Phibes in a race to find the mythical elixir of eternal life. Price reportedly did not care for his co-star ‚Äî once, when Quarry was singing in his dressing room during the making of Dr Phibes Rises Again, he said to Price, \\"You didn't know I could sing did you?\\" and Price replied: \\"Well I knew you couldn't act\\" ‚Äî the duo were later also paired in Madhouse (1974). American International Pictures had plans for Quarry to succeed Price, signing him to a long-term contract, but the decline in the company's fortunes, combined with old-style horror films falling out of fashion, meant that it never happened. Quarry did make further horror film appearances, as the hippy guru vampire Khorda in 1973's The Deathmaster, and as a gangster in the 1974 zombie movie Sugar Hill. Quarry made several guest appearances on TV shows, including two in 1965 on Perry Mason. He appeared on an episode of The Rockford Files. He played disfigured gunrunner Commander Corliss in the Buck Rogers in the 25th Century episode \\"Return of the Fighting 69th\\". He played in two episodes of The Lone Ranger. In 1980 he was in an automobile accident, in which he was struck by a drunk driver. It resulted in serious facial injuries. He was also mugged in Hollywood shortly thereafter. In 1987, Quarry returned to film with Cyclone directed by Fred Olen Ray. Quarry would be cast in over 20 of Ray's films in the remainder of his career. Death Quarry died on February 20, 2009 at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California, aged 83.Vampire Legend Dies, radaronline.com, February 2009; accessed July 17, 2015.

He is known to have written the Prashna Upanishad, which is among the ten Mukhya Upanishads. He was the son of noble benevolent sage Dadhichi, who donated his bones to the devatas to provide them a material for making weapons and defeat the Asurs. He was the founder of Pippalada School of thought, which taught the Atharvaveda. Birth At the time his father Dadhichi gave up his life to donate his bones to [Indra] and help him defeat the asur Vritra, his wife Swarcha was pregnant with Pippalada. When Swarcha came to know about death of her husband, she placed the infant Pippalada under a pippal tree. Then she committed suicide to reunite with her husband. The infant Pippalada was taken care of by Dadhichi's sister, Dadhimati. He helped himself to the pippal leaves and amrit(nectar) given by Chandra dev (God of moon). Revenge with Indra When Pippalada grew up and came to know about the way his parents died, he performed a heavy penance to Lord Shiva and obtained a demon to kill all the devatas. All the devatas went to Shiva for protection. Shiva made Pippalada realize that nothing can be gained by killing the devatas as it will not bring his parents back. Defeating Shani Pippalada out of revenge for Lord Shani for giving tortures to his father Dadhichi, he obtained Brahmadanda and hit Lord Shani on his foot . It was then Lord Shiv who made Pippalada of his wrong doings n explained that Lord Shani just did his duty and it was the wrong deeds of Dhadhichi due to which he was punished.

He was the Prime Minister of Thailand from 1995 to 1996. Banharn made a fortune in the construction business before he became a Member of Parliament representing his home province of Suphan Buri. He held different cabinet posts in several governments. In 1994, he became the leader of the Thai Nation Party. In 2008, the party was dissolved by the Constitutional Court and Banharn was banned from politics for five years. Early life, education, and business career Banharn was born on 19 August 1932 in Suphan Buri to a Chinese merchant family. His Chinese name was Tekchiang Saebe (; ). He married Khunying Jamsai Silpa-archa and they have three children. Banharn dropped out of secondary school during World War II. He went to work with his older brother, then founded his own building company. Years later, when he was a politician, he completed his education at the open admissions Ramkhamhaeng University, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1986, and finally a Master of Laws. Banharn's construction company was very successful in the 1960s, when large sums were invested in major infrastructure projects, including military facilities. His business made Banharn a billionaire. Political career Abhisit Vejjajiva and Banharn Banharn Silpa-archa was persuaded to enter politics by Booneua Prasertsuwan, a veteran member of the House of Representatives. In 1976, Banharn Silpa-archa made his political debut when he was elected a Member of Parliament, representing Suphan Buri Province. He joined the Thai Nation Party, a conservative party dominated by the \\"Rajakru clan\\" around Pramarn Adireksarn and Chatichai Choonhavan. His party participated in a coalition government under Prime Minister Seni Pramoj and Banharn was appointed deputy minister of industry. He was elected to the Senate in 1977, but returned to represent his constituency in the House of Representatives the next year. Banharn was re-elected Member of Parliament for Suphan Buri in all following elections, receiving steadily more than 100,000 votes (60 to 90 percent of the votes cast), what made him one of the highest vote-getters in the country. He sponsored the construction of schools, bridges, and other infrastructure in his home province, which in turn were named after him. This has led to the common saying that he \\"owns the province\\". When his party was a junior partner in the government of Prem Tinsulanonda from 1980 to 1983, Banharn was Minister of Agriculture. In 1981, he became secretary-general of the Thai Nation Party. Banharn, being one of the main financiers of the party, accumulated considerable influence inside the party, although he was not a member of the originally dominant Rajakru clan. The local press has once dubbed him \\"Mr. (Mobile) ATM\\" (automated teller machine), due to the suspicion that he had bought the loyalty of political associates in exchange for money. In 1986 Prime Minister Prem again called him up to the government, this time naming him Minister of Transport. After his party had won the elections in 1988 and Thai Nation leader Chatichai Choonhavan had become Prime Minister, Banharn was appointed Minister of Industry. In January 1990, he switched offices with Pramarn Adireksarn and became interior minister. In December of the same year, Chatichai made him Minister of Finance. The Chatichai government was deposed by a military coup d'√©tat in 1991. Banharn returned to the cabinet as early as April 1992, when he once again became Minister of Transport in the short-lived government of General Suchinda Kraprayoon. His party went into opposition after early elections in September 1992. Banharn took over the leadership of the Thai Nation Party from Pramarn Adireksarn in 1994 and also became official leader of the opposition. Premiership Under the leadership of Banharn, the Thai Nation Party won the parliamentary election in 1995, and he became the 21st Prime Minister of Thailand, leading a seven-party coalition. Banharn was involved in numerous corruption scandals, one of which diminished confidence in his administration and caused him to resign. His short-lived yet inept administration is believed to have paved the way for the economic crisis of 1997. During a state visit by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom in October 1996 he mistakenly referred to her as \\"Queen Elizabeth Taylor\\", receiving ridicule and criticism as a result.http://russiatoday.com/Politics/2009-08-27/10-silliest-quotes- politicians.html Russia Today Later life and death Portrait of Banharn on a Thai Nation Party campaign poster for the general election 2007 On 21 January 2008, Banharn announced that his Thai Nation Party would join a coalition with the People's Power Party, successor to the Thai Rak Thai Party of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Because he had earlier vowed before the Emerald Buddha never to rejoin Thaksin because of the corruption scandals, this move reinforced Banharn's image as a \\"slippery eel\\". Upon the dissolution of his Thai Nation Party by the Constitutional Court on 2 December 2008, Banharn Silpa-archa was banned from politics for five years. Non- executive members of the Thai Nation Party immediately founded the Chartthaipattana Party (Thai National Development), chaired by Banharn's younger brother, Chumpol Silpa-archa. Chumphol was Minister of Tourism and Sports in the cabinet of Abhisit Vejjajiva. His son Warawut was deputy transport minister, and his daughter Kanchana was deputy education minister. Banharn died of asthma on the morning of 23 April 2016 at Siriraj Hospital at the age of 83.

Original shows listed the venue as Past the Pavement Hall, being as the county pavement ended about 3/4 of a mile from the building. History The parcel The Outhouse sits on used to house a one-room country school. Two large heritage trees still mark the entrance to the school site. The venue hosted many live music acts between the time it was leased for fraternity parties and biker bashes in 1985, until it was discovered by young rock bands desperate for a place to perform. The first hardcore/alternative rock shows at The Outhouse happened in the late summer/fall of 1985. The growing mainstream popularity of pop punk music in the early 1990s led to the decline of the Outhouse, but what ultimately caused its closing was the Great Flood of 1993. Its doors were permanently closed in 1998. The building once known as the Outhouse is now a BYOB strip club with a small outhouse out near the road. The Outhouse was unique because it was a gutted cinder-block storage garage in the middle of a corn field. The walls (if any) had been torn out leaving only cinder-block walls. Original shows in 1985 featured no stage until a stage was built by volunteers from the University of Kansas student radio station, KJHK, and various local bands. KJHK and others had made an arrangement with the Flaming Lips to play there and felt a stage was needed to attract other non-local acts. During the construction of the stage, it was suggested that the name be changed from Past the Pavement Hall. One KJHK staffer remarked that the place was a \\"shithole\\" and it should be called The Outhouse. The name stuck. Unfortunately, the Flaming Lips tour van broke down and that seminal show never occurred. In the April 1986 issue of Spin, KJHK was recognized for \\"excellence in supporting a local music scene\\" for their work in bringing many national acts to The Outhouse and other Lawrence, Kansas music venues. It was a vibrant time for alternative live music in the Midwest. The stage was a box that stood approximately a foot and a half above the cement floor. Much later, a bar area was added to the back that was used to sell T-shirts, and other band merchandise, as well as non-alcoholic refreshments. People often brought their own alcohol. At first alcohol was allowed in the club, but after The Outhouse received publicity in the local press, the Kansas ABC told the owner that it would begin enforcing the law at The Outhouse. Thereafter, alcohol was openly consumed in the parking- lot/front-yard, but not inside. People would park in the front yard, and for large concerts, they would often park on the nearby gravel road. The field across the street was rumored to have housed a missile silo, but this was incorrect. The building stood just outside the jurisdiction of the Lawrence police department. The Outhouse rarely had any sort of security, but negative incidents were rare. No one stood between the audience and the band. Prior to the Outhouse, venues such as Veterans of Foreign Wars Halls in Kansas City and the Lawrence Opera House (later called Liberty Hall) would host hardcore concerts. When several of the local venues closed, the Outhouse quickly became the place to see punk shows. Concerts at the Outhouse were very inexpensive, with the first shows costing $3, and with $8 being the high end in the early 1990s. Shows at the Outhouse weren't limited to the typical hardcore genre; there were ska, alternative, thrash metal, Oi! and other types of underground genres. People would come from as far as Topeka, Kansas, Kansas City and sometimes further, and with the University of Kansas nearby, there was no shortage of patrons.

In Kansas City, the local public radio station, 90.1 KKFI, had a two-hour hardcore/alternative show called The Little Orphan Annie Show (which went through several hosts and names), that would often announce concerts. The concerts were also sometimes announced in the local alternative newspaper The Pitch. The most common promotion technique was plastering flyers in Lawrence and in areas like the Westport neighborhood of the Kansas City Metropolitan area.

Early life and education He was the son of Peter McOwan, a Wesleyan minister from Scotland. After finishing school he taught at Bath, Colchester and Leeds, and in 1857 taught chemistry at the Huddersfield College Laboratory. That same year he graduated in chemistry from the University of London, becoming professor of chemistry at Huddersfield. Botanical work The year before, he married Amelia Day from Bristol. A severe lung condition, possibly asthma, caused him to move to South Africa and take up the post of principal at the newly established Shaw College in Grahamstown. His health rapidly improved and leaving chemistry behind he resumed studying botany in which he had become interested while still in England, having started a collection of flowers and mosses. This interest was furthered by his association with Dr William Guybon Atherstone, Henry Hutton and Mrs. FW Barber. He entered into a fruitful exchange of specimens and correspondence with Asa Gray of the States, Sir William Hooker of Kew and with Harvey and Sonder who were working on the Flora Capensis. Finding it a drain on his own time to supply duplicates to overseas collectors, he formed the South African Botanical Exchange Society, which brought together a large number of amateur botanists. By 1868 roughly 9000 duplicates had been sent abroad, for which in return they received specimens from Europe, North America and Australia. His contributions are acknowledged in the introductions to Flora Capensis. He assisted Atherstone and HG Galpin in confirming in 1867 that the Hopetown or Eureka Diamond was indeed a diamond. Eventually he became head of natural sciences at Gill College, Somerset East, South Africa and then later director of the Cape Town Botanical Garden. During his time in Cape Town he collated specimens that Henry Flanagan from Kouga sent him. He was also the curator of the Cape Government Herbarium.
