It was designed by Walter Liberty Vernon (Buildings A and B and C) and built from 1904 to 1912 by McLeod Brothers (Buildings A, B) and NSW Public Works Department (Bdg C). It is also known as Buildings A & B: REVY Main Warehouse, Naval Warehouse and Royal Edward Victualling Yard, Building C: Former Commonwealth Ordnance Stores. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 March 2011.  History  Indigenous history The Royal Edward Victualling Yard is located on land originally inhabited by the Cadigal people. Their land south of Port Jackson stretched from South Head to Petersham. The coastal Aborigines around Sydney became known to Europeans as the \\"Eora People\\". The word Eora means \\"here\\" or \\"from this place\\". Local Aboriginal people used the word to describe to the British where they came from and so the word was then used to define the Aboriginal people themselves. The people used the harbour for food using fishing line made from the inner bark of the kurrajong and hibiscus trees and multi-pronged spears tipped with bone. The many varieties of fish and shellfish - oysters, mussels and cockles - were supplemented with vegetables, grubs, birds, possums, wombats and kangaroos. With fish available all year round, there was no need to leave the coast for food. Although the population decreased significantly due to smallpox, the expansion of settlement and several other factors, there is evidence of Aborigines continuing to frequent Pyrmont with its fresh springs up to the 1870s, and even later there are references to ceremonial gatherings at Ultimo.City of Sydney (2002). Colonial history The Royal Edward Victualling Yard (REVY) is located on Darling Island, formerly known as Cockle Island. It was originally a rocky knoll attached to the mainland by tidal mud flats. Development started in the Darling Harbour area in the 1810s when Governor Macquarie moved the colony's produce markets to the corner of George and Market Streets, Sydney. This brought with it the need to develop wharves nearby for transportation of goods. As a result, the growth of maritime trade in the area was extensive and included warehouses, stores and other trade buildings. By 1839 Edward Macarthur owned the entire Pyrmont area and subdivided a large portion of it along the waterfront. While many cottages developed there, industrialisation also occurred quickly, including iron works, flour mills and tin smelters. Among these were the Pyrmont works on Darling Island of the Hunter River Steam Navigation Company (HRSN). HRSN Company was formed in 1839 and started operating in 1846. In the same year Quarry master Charles Saunders was contracted to level Darling Island. In 1851 HRSN Company was renamed the Australian Steam Navigation (ASN) Company. It experienced substantial growth, becoming the largest of the New South Wales (NSW) coastal shipping fleets for a number of decades before being absorbed by overseas interests in the 1890s. In the 1850s the company took out a leasehold on the Pyrmont site. Renovations quickly followed.Design 5 Architects, 2007. It was in this same period (1856) that Garden Island was first suggested as a naval base. In 1865 the Colonial Naval Defence Act empowered the states to provide, maintain and operate warships. The following year Garden Island was dedicated as a naval base.Cox, et. al., 1991. During the 1870s larger ships and cargoes caused the development of longer wharves in the north east of Darling Harbour and at Walsh Bay, prompting the ASN Company to establish a new works at Circular Quay in 1879. By 1884 the Darling Harbour works covered 6.5 acres with a deep water frontage of almost half a mile. The site included a retaining wall on the west, north and south sides of the island which extended from the offices and stores to the foot of the patent slip. Increasing competition saw the ASN Company begin to struggle in the 1880s. They also suffered a number of shipwrecks. These two factors are believed to have led to their takeover by the Queensland Steam Shipping Company in early 1887. The Darling Island works were not part of the takeover and were offered for sale in 1887. The leasehold was purchased by Edmund Compton Batt who developed plans to establish a meat and wool trading centre on the island. These plans did not eventuate due to the refusal of the Railway Commissioners to extend the existing railway network to Darling Island. The government purchased Darling Island in 1889 for on advice of the Railway Commissioners. Discussions commenced immediately for its use as a trade centre for wool, coal or general cargo. Works on a concrete quay commenced in 1897.Godden Mackay Logan, 1995. 1900 to 1909 The Sydney Harbour Trust was created in 1901 and subsequently took over construction of the concrete wharf. By this time the eastern side of the wharf was being used as a wheat trading area. A long single storey shed running the length of berths 12 to 14 was completed in 1902. In the same year the concrete wharf was completed and the eastern and western sides connected by a timber wharf to the north A shed was built in 1903-04 on the western side of the wharf and another in 1906-07 at the northern end. It was during this period that the existing victualling yards at Garden Island were deemed inadequate for the recently formed Commonwealth Naval Forces. The yards at Garden Island had originally been developed to replace the nineteenth century use of store ships. Several sites were considered for the victualling yard. After discussions with the NSW Government the then Commander-in Chief of the Navy, Vice Admiral Fanshawe, suggested Darling Harbour. The decision was then made to build on the mainland. The new storage accommodation would have a floor space of together with a receiving and issuing store, officers, cooperage and a workshop. It was noted years later that the buildings were constructed specifically to meet the needs of the victualling service, particularly in regard to natural lighting, ventilation, storage and expeditious and convenient handling of stores. After some negotiation Walter Liberty Vernon was commissioned to undertake the design of the buildings. Tenders were called for their construction in 1905. It was won by McLeod Bros. The victualling stores were subsequently constructed on the western side of Darling Island from 1905. This original construction included REVY A and B buildings. A one and two storey weatherboard and stucco building was constructed south of where REVY C is now located and was probably an office block. Other buildings included a receiving shed, cooperage and workshop. All these buildings were designed by Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon between 1890 and 1911. The new stores were completed in late 1906 or early 1907 and represented some of the earliest public works by the new Commonwealth Government. in July 1906 Rear Admiral WH Fawkes, officer in Charge requested made a request to the Admiralty that the new stores be officially renamed the Royal Edward Victualling Yard. The request was granted in January 1907, ensuring that the stores became the first Royal Yard in the southern hemisphere and the Navy's major store depot. The Victualling Stores were transferred from Garden Island to REVY on 23 February 1907. They officially became the new headquarters of the victualling department of the Imperial Naval Authority on a permanent lease on 1 June 1907. An inventory in 1907 listed the yard as containing Buildings A and B (stores), a cooperage, slades, police guard room, electricians workshop, two garages, kitchen, Officers Dining Room, two floor office block containing a yard pattern room, seamstress room, and carpenters workshop. There were also yard craft accommodated on the waterfront. These included two work boats, a passenger launch and two well lighters. The Navy would continue to maintain some stores on Garden Island and constructed additional storehouses on Cockatoo Island in 1919. Other storehouses were built at Spectacle Island, although REVY continued to be the main major store depot. Later, like other industries in the area, REVY was reliant on water transport from the nineteenth century. This was not to change for over sixty years. A new entrance from Jones Bay Road was proposed in 1927. Land was leased from the Sydney Harbour Trust Commissioners for the purpose. In 1907 a contract was agreed upon for pile driving and other preparations for the construction of new buildings on Darling Island. Plans were prepared in 1909 and in 1912 the eight story ordinance store (REVY C) was completed. Intended to provide storage for the Military and Postal Departments, it bore the insignia of King George V who succeeded the throne in 1910 rather than that of King Edward was borne by the yard generally. REVY C was not originally part of the REVY Yard. Instead, it was used by a variety of government departments such as the postal department. It was often referred to as the Commonwealth stores. In 1911 the title Royal Australian Navy (RAN) was granted to the Commonwealth Naval Forces. However, naval establishments, including REVY were not transferred to the Commonwealth of Australia until 1913. The cable storage tanks that were used by the Post Master Generals Department to store cables underwater are still in evidence on the ground floor of the building. The cables, designed and fabricated for underwater use, were stored in a cable trench until required. REVY C was one of the last buildings designed by Vernon as Government Architect and is one of only a few surviving warehouses designed by Vernon. Other surviving buildings include the Bushells warehouse in the Rocks and the REVY A and B warehouses. The construction of REVY C also represented an early provision for fire safety in tall buildings. Early fire fighting services could only reach two storeys and below as steam pumped water pressure could only reach a certain height effectively. As a result, tall buildings needed to provide their own fire fighting equipment and access points. Vernon's consideration for fire safety is evident in REVY C by the external fire escape stairs at each end of the building, a rarity in Sydney at the time. REVY C's reinforced concrete floors and roofs, and concrete encased steel columns also improved fire resistance. John Sulman and James Nangle were advocating fire resistant building construction in the 1890s. Nangle advocated brick construction as masonry, with as little timber as possible was considered to have superior fire resistance. Reinforced concrete was also a good construction material for fire resistant purposes. Vernon and the government architects office designed some of the earliest reinforced concrete structures in Sydney. The first was constructed in Australia in 1895 and they were common in Melbourne by 1912. 1910 to 1960s The completion of the REVY C building resulted in the creation of a near continuous wall on the western edge of Darling Island formed by Building E (Weatherboard and stucco building), REVY C and the Birt & Co Cargo Shed. REVY C with its length and slenderness made a significant contribution to the wall effect. Together the buildings enclosed the eastern side of Jones Bay that would reopen as the buildings north and south of REVY C were removed. REVY C also became the tallest building on Darling Island. Although it is not clear when the REVY C building was completely taken over by the military, it was probably during World War One. The Royal Australian Navy took it over in 1923. The REVY C building became the main storage facility for the RAN, playing an instrumental role in the provision of supplies during World War Two. An arrangement had been made in the 1930s that in the event of an outbreak of war, wharf 16, located immediately to the north of REVY C on the western side of Darling Island, would be handed over to the Navy for Victualling purposes. Both materials and troops were shipped from Darling Island during the war years. The main function of the yard was to act as a support system providing food, clothing, and other equipment when required. Food was to be of high quality and nutritious, and all other items of a predictable and uniform standard. When the yard became the responsibility of the Australian Navy in 1913 it became imperative to work out how the yard could continue to supply the China and East Indies Stations with the many items purchased in Sydney, including coal, boats, timber, vegetables, fresh and corned meat, salt, clothing and other commodities. This generated the need to install the cloth inspection equipment. In 1925 two overhead travellers and differential lifting gear were installed in the ground floor of Revy C for handling heavy packages and the stowage of items such as Electric Cables and Mine Sweeping gear. In REVY A and B the electric goods hoists are among the first to be installed in Sydney and are believed to be possibly the only set of hoists of their type to survive. They are remnants of technologies once common throughout Sydney. The goods lift at the northern end of building AB was one of the oldest functioning lifts in Sydney until its decommissioning some time in the late twentieth century. It is indicative of the type installed in Sydney in the early 20th century. The goods aprons are prominent archaeological features which indicate the way in which the building operated. The hydraulics system, including a hydraulic press is one of the few intact examples of an essentially 19th century technology. From 1937 a large amount of work was done to the grain wharf on the eastern side of Darling Island and provisions increased for refrigerated goods and other general cargo. By the 1940s the work of the yard included provisions and meat for the Royal Navy - Middle East and War Board, India, clothing and footwear examination sections and associated activities, pattern and sample room, survey of stores by HMA ships, receiving, opening and checking despatch, general provisioning of clothing, food, bedding, a variety of implements and repair and maintenance. Removal of the victualling yard from Darling Harbour was discussed in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. However, arguments regarding the quality of the facility, its efficiency, the benefits of being located on the mainland, the ongoing successes of the stores, its potential role in the event of an emergency and the availability of fresh water all contributed to the prevention of the yards closure. The grain wharf and its sheds became obsolete due to the increasing size of cargo ships and the introduction of container shipping. The introduction of container shipping drastically altered the way ships loaded and unloaded goods. A ships cargo could be stored away from the waterfront in the containers and transported by road or rail to the waterfront for loading onto ships specially designed to handle containers. The first regular international container services were introduced into Australia in 1969. A large passenger terminal replaced the 1902 grain storage shed in 1951 and the terminal was remodelled in 1968-69. Both cargo sheds originally constructed for Birt and Co were demolished around this time. The first of these was the 1907 northern shed demolished between 1951 and 1955. The 1903-04 two storey shed was demolished between 1968 and 1970. A section of the seawall on the eastern side of the wharf collapsed in 1970 and was substantially reconstructed. 1970s to the present REVY ceased functioning as a victualling yard for the RAN during the 1970s, mainly due to the advent of containerism in shipping. It had become the RAN's largest victualling yard and had played a significant role in every operation entered into by the RAN and the wharf areas to the north were cleared and all small sheds demolished. In the late 1970s plans were made to the refurbishment of the site. The original one and two storey weatherboard and stucco building to the south of REVY C was demolished and REVY C remodelled for tenant use. During the 1980s REVY C underwent major refurbishment to accommodate the Department of Defence, Defence Science and Technology Organisation. Later, REVY A and B were refitted for office accommodation by clerical and technical staff of the naval Support Command. In 1995 the works to Revy A and B received a Merit Award in the 1995 Royal Australian Institute of Architects Awards in the Adaptive Re-use Category of the Greenway Conservation Section for being a fine example of creative and effective engineering input into the refurbishment of an important heritage building. Works included the construction of the glass atrium linking Revy A and B. The finished product was described as an excellent and splendid example of collaboration between the structural engineers and the heritage architects.Institute of Engineers, 1995. The final Royal Australian Navy occupants relocated from REVY A and B during 2002, leaving the buildings vacant. In 2003 the REVY site was sold by the Commonwealth as freehold land, although the Commonwealth continued to occup REVY C until 2005. REVY A and B underwent works in 2003-04 to be adaptively reused as television station offices. REVY C has been vacant since 2005.  Description  The former Royal Edward Victualling Yard is located in an historic waterfront location on the southern shore of Sydney Harbour at Pyrmont. The height of the buildings and their unusual spatial arrangement result in a dramatic landmark amongst a mixture of historic and recent residential and commercial developments, many of which are on a large scale themselves. A community park opposite the site creates a visual corridor through to the harbour east of the site. The verticality and dramatic waterfront location invests REVY A, B and C with landmark qualities and aesthetic significance. REVY C, the tallest building at Darling Island and on the eastern foreshore of Pyrmont, it is a prominent landmark visible from surrounding vantage points at Sydney Harbour and contrasts with the lower and elongated wharf structures such as Jones Bay Wharf. Revy A and B are a pair of large warehouses, consisting of a five-storey block and a six-storey block linked by a square central tower topped by a water reservoir tower of Romanesque design. The blocks and tower are of polychromatic brick with terracotta-tiled, gable hipped roof and exposed rafters at the eaves. Internally, the buildings are constructed with massive timber columns and beams supporting timber floors. Windows in the blocks are rectangular and multi-paned except for the upper floor where Diocletian arched, multi-pane windows are used. The two blocks are sited at an acute angle to one another, joining at the tower, with interconnections between each floor set through the tower section. The face brickwork and large massing of the buildings, together with the arches, indicate aspects of Federation Warehouse styling, although the roof is not characteristic of the style. Items of goods handling and lifting equipment remain in the buildings, including the wall-mounted jib cranes and facade doors. Revy C is an eight-storey, concrete encased steel framed brick building, rectangular in plan. It features Flemish style gabled parapets and a rusticated ashlar bluestone ground floor. There are Diocletian arched window openings to the upper floor (rectangular windows to the other floors), all with multiple panes. Four prominent lift towers are visible above the roofline, located symmetrically. On the lower level, attached to the western facade, is a riveted truss jib crane installed shortly after the completion of the building. The mass, rectangularity and arched upper windows hint at Federation Warehouse styling, while the rounded gables are a suggestion of Federation Anglo Dutch influence. External steel fire stairs are visually prominent. The combined seawall and wharf which surrounds Darling Island is made from concrete blocks laid on bedrock about 8m below mean tide. The seawall was built to a height of 650mm above low water and finished to wharf level with massed concrete which is visible today both on the horizontal and vertical edges of the wharf. The edge of the wharf was capped with a squared timber curb. The curb was made from broad-axed lengths of hardwood bolted to the wharf edge to form an almost continual low barrier. Six massive cast iron or cast steel bollards are bolted to concrete platforms behind the curb at about 15 metre intervals. Opposite the western facade of REVY C are two small double-post bollards. These are placed in gaps in the curb to allow access for mooring lines. The wharf has no piles to which head stocks could be attached, so vertical posts were bolted to the concrete wall at about 4.8m centres and two hardwood whalers run the length of the wharf, attached to the posts. A number of relics associated with the victualling function are extant within the yard, including hoists, lifts, cloth inspection equipment and a crane. (Design 5, GML, Cox)  Condition  As at 24 February 2011, the buildings are in good condition.  Modifications and dates  *1925 - lifting gear added to REVY C *1981 - REVY C refurbished for DSTO *1994 - REVY A and B were converted to office accommodation. *2000+ - REVY A and B converted for commercial use and REVY C vacated and some of the more recent fitout removed  Heritage listing  As at 22 November 2010, the Royal Edward Victualling Yard (REVY) has state significance as the first Royal Yard in the southern hemisphere. It is a reminder of the importance given to the presence of the Commonwealth Naval Forces in the southern hemisphere, and the subsequent growth and development of the Commonwealth Forces and the Royal Australian Navy in the region. The presence of equipment associated with the victualling functions extant within the yard and buildings including hoists, lifts, cloth manufacturing machines and a crane are also strong reminders of the sites functions The stores operated during both World Wars and played an instrumental role in the provision of supplies during World War Two. The narrow, vertical Federation Warehouse buildings designed by Walter Liberty Vernon are a fine example of a style of building, design features and commercial activity now rare on and around the waterways of central Sydney. They are also fine examples of largely intact Federation warehousing. Royal Edward Victualling Yard was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 March 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The REVY site has state historical significance as some of the earliest major public works commissioned by the Commonwealth Government in its first decade of administration. The buildings have important historic links to the early growth of the Royal Australian Navy and as its major provisioning facility for two world wars. It was the first naval yard in the southern hemisphere to be granted the title \\"Royal\\" and was intimately associated with the formative years and growth of the Royal Australian Navy. The complex has local historical significance as one of the first Sydney warehouse facilities to be electrified (1906) and are an example of the reliance on water transport and the importance of the Darling Harbour Area to industry and transport in the late nineteenth century and the first 60–70 years of the twentieth century before containerisation drastically altered the way shipping was handled. REVY C - demonstrates the expansion of the complex over time. For some time after construction it was one of the tallest buildings on the southern central Sydney waterfront . The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The REVY buildings are state significant for their association with their architect, Walter Liberty Vernon, Government Architect 1890-1911 and the activities of the newly formed Commonwealth government in the early years of the twentieth century. The site also has state associational significance with the Royal Australian Navy and its Commonwealth Forces predecessor for its continuous association with naval and defence purposes for a century from 1903 to 2003. The stores represent the size and complexity of naval victualling supply functions and the growth of this activity over time and have associations with the growth of the Post Master General's Department and the expansion of communications. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The REVY complex has aesthetic and technical significance at a state level. Their occupation of an historic waterfront location and the height of the buildings and their unusual spatial arrangement results in a dramatic landmark composition on the southern shore of Sydney Harbour. The large, richly coloured, finely modelled, brick masonry stores buildings are fine examples of the Federation Warehouse style designed by Walter Liberty Vernon. The tallest building at Darling Island and on the eastern foreshore of Pyrmont, REVY C in particular is a prominent landmark visible from surrounding vantage points at Sydney Harbour and contrasts with the lower and elongated wharf structures such as Jones Bay Wharf. REVY includes elements such as a wall crane, hoists, loading bays, platforms and lift works which demonstrate the process of moving goods in and out of the building. Early gantry rails and underground cable water tanks also demonstrate the purpose of the building and emphasising the changes taking place in building technology in the early twentieth century. It also exhibits the rare external fire escapes which are design features at each end of the west facade. Likewise, some surviving fabric manufacturing equipment demonstrates the purpose of Revy A and B and the evolution in these technologies. Together, the three buildings demonstrate vertical store handing prior to containerisation in their external configuration. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Low staff turnover and long periods of service mean the site has state social significance for the many naval personnel across the state who have worked at the site or had a long association with the Victualling Branch of the Royal Australian Navy up to the 1970s. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The narrow vertical warehouse style of the buildings is now rare in Sydney, has the ability to demonstrate vertical store handling. In REVY A and B the electric goods hoists are among the first to be installed in Sydney and are possibly the only set of such hoists to survive. They provide opportunities to study remnants of technologies once common throughout Sydney as do other technologies such as the goods lift at the northern end of REVY A, was one of the oldest functioning lifts in Sydney until the late twentieth century. It is indicative of the type installed in Sydney in the early 20th century. The goods aprons are also prominent archaeological features which indicate the way in which the building operated. The hydraulics system, including a hydraulic press is one of the few examples of an essentially 19th century technology. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The REVY buildings remain rare examples of multistorey dockside warehouses. A waterfront warehouse building of the height of Revy C is now rare in Sydney. The Revy C building fire stairs are not only evidence of an early solution to fire safety, but are also a rare solution in Sydney. It also exhibits the rare external fire escapes which are design features at each end of the west facade. It also exhibits fine brick masonry modelling and is an excellent example of the warehouse design work of the government architect of the period, Walter Liberty Vernon. The buildings are a rare surviving example of a waterside naval store. The application of containerism has removed the need for waterside facilities such as warehouses and of those that remain, the REVY buildings are rare masonry structures which maintain their association with the waterfront. They are one of the few warehouses designed by Vernon. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. REVY A, B and C are excellent representative examples of narrow, vertical Federation style warehouses and are typical of buildings constructed between and with their load bearing masonry external walls, reinforced concrete floors and reinforced flat concrete roof. The buildings are representative of waterfront warehousing technology employed in the early part of the 20th century as are the various remnant technologies still present.

Its apparent visual magnitude has irregular variations between a maximum of 11.63 and a minimum of 14.02. Spectrum The exact spectral class of the star is not yet known. Different estimations gives a range F8-K5Vea, meaning that there is agreement in identifying it as a main sequence star more luminous and with stronger emission lines than the usual, a typical classification for young stars that are near the main sequence phase. The color indexes vary with the star's brightness, but the spectral class of BM Andromedae does not change with the decrease of luminosity. Strong H-alpha lines in the spectra are a sign of a gaseous envelope, while an infrared excess indicates the existence of an extended dust envelope. System BM Andromedae is a young stellar object with a circumstellar cloud around it, one stage of the evolution from protostars to the main sequence phase. The cloud is made of a gaseous envelope and an extended dust envelope. The latter can reach a distance of 1 AU from the star and is strongly flattened and observed edge-on. It was also found that a correlation exists between the local interstellar magnetic field and the polarization of light emitted by BM Andromedae. Thus, the magnetic field could have played a role in the formation of the system. Variability The envelope blocks a fraction of the light emitted by BM Andromedae, but it's not uniform so this fraction is variable in time. This explains both the brightness variability and the one of color indexes. It was also found that the dust envelope polarizes the light emitted by BM Andromedae; the more light is blocked, the stronger is the polarization.

The first survey of the site was conducted by the Nagaoka Municipal Science Museum in 1951, and several excavations have followed at later dates. In addition to various stone tools (including stone axes) and the foundations of pit dwellings and raised floor structures, a typical design of pottery known as the \\"Fujihashi style\\" was discovered. Also found within the site was a production area for jadeite stone balls. The site is open to the public as an archaeological park with reconstructions of buildings, and includes the \\"Fujihashi History Plaza\\" - a museum containing models, panels, and restored excavated items.

After taking command of Southern Army in the Montenegrin–Ottoman War of 1876–1878, he represented the Principality of Montenegro at the Congress of Berlin. He served as head of government of Montenegro from 1879 to 1905.http://rulers.org/rulm2.html#montenegro Biography Božo studied in Paris. He returned to Montenegro following his studies. As cousin of Prince Nikola, Božo served as heir apparent from 1860 to 1871, when Nikola's first son Danilo was born. Božo was the commander of the Southern Army during the Montenegrin–Ottoman War of 1876–1878. He had great success in the Battles of Medun and Trijebač. However, in his memoirs, vojvoda Ilija Plamenac claims he was the de facto leader of the Southern Army as Božo was too young and inexperienced. After the war, Božo was the Montenegrin representative at the Congress of Berlin. He was a candidate for Prince of Bulgaria in 1879. After the Congress, Božo served as head of government for more than 25 years. First as President of the Senate, and after that as President of the Council of State from 1879 to 1905. He retired from politics with the proclamation of the liberal 1905 Constitution of Montenegro. In 1915, he was made governor of Shkodër and Malësia following their occupation in World War I. Božo was jailed in December 1918 during the events that led to the creation of Yugoslavia. He was arrested near Nikšić with his two younger brothers, general Đuro Petrović and former district councilor Marko Petrović. All three were interned in Podgorica. Božo and Marko were released after almost one year, and were later interned in Sarajevo. General Đuro was kept in Podgorica where he suffered from cataract. He died in 1929 and is buried in the Church of St. Sava graveyard in Erakovići, near Cetinje.

Marine conditions persisted for much of the Paleozoic and parts of the Mesozoic, followed by periods of uplift and erosion. The country has extensive salt, gypsum and potash, but very little hydrocarbons and limited base metals. Geologic History, Stratigraphy and Tectonics The Precambrian and Paleozoic are poorly attested in the Laotian rock record. Some areas in the northwest, northeast and southeast are believed to have high-grade metamorphic rocks from the Proterozoic. No Cambrian rocks have been verified, although some may be represented by metasedimentary rocks underlying Ordovician strata. Shale with graptolite fossils in the northeast belong to the Early Ordovician. Marines sedimentation took place during the Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian. Continuous sedimentation went on in the east into the Carboniferous, but elsewhere a marine regression brought erosion. The Permian and Carboniferous brought renewed marine deposition of sandstone, shale and limestone as well as some terrestrial deposits like coal found near Vietiane and Saravane. The limestone forms a prominent karst topography in the north and east. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) Marine sedimentation only continued in a few sedimentary basins during the Triassic at the start of the Mesozoic, such as the Sam Neua area. Volcanic rocks that erupted primarily in the Permian, but into the Triassic are situated in northern Laos in the Pak Lay- Luang Prabang area and northwest to the border with Myanmar. They correlate with similar rocks in Thailand inferred to be the result of subduction-related volcanism. Dacite and rhyolite are common in the Sam Neua area while rhyolite and tuff covers much of the Sekong Valley and along the Cambodian border in the south. Almost all Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks are terrestrial, except for marine rocks in the southern Sekong Valley from the Early Jurassic. A mountainous terrane formed due to Triassic uplift, which brought intense erosion. By the Middle Cretaceous, the land surface was heavily worn down leaving silt, clay and mud interspersed with evaporites, which underlie the plains around Vietiane and east of Savannakhet. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) Paleogene deposits from the Cenozoic are absent in Laos, but Neogene freshwater sediments settled in small valleys between mountain ranges, made up of shale, sandstone, marl and lignite. Because of a lack of coarse sediments which typically erode off of steep neighboring mountains, geologists have interpreted these basins as the down-dropped remnants of older, wider basins. Highlands uplifted during the Pliocene and Pleistocene and immediately experienced intense erosion. The Plain of Jars has extensive gravel and silt terraces from the Quaternary, including loess and volcanic ash. The Mekong River which transported the eroded material may have followed a different course because sediments are primarily shallow and Holocene in age beneath the present course of the river. Thick basalt lavas extruded onto Mesozoic sandstone at the Bolovens Plateau east of Pakse during the Pleistocene. Tectonics The Truong Son and Luang Prabang structures converge in northern Laos, bordered by northwest trending fault-bounded structures such as Phu Hoat Massif. The Song Ma Anticlinorium near Vietnam exposes Proterozoic basement rock at the surface. The Yunnan-Malay fold belt originated from closure of two sedimentary basins and is a prominent feature. Only a few major intrusions are known such as Early Triassic granodiorite near Pak Lay and gabbro near Sayaboury. Natural resource geology Laos has small amounts of tin, gypsum, limestone and coal and previously has alluvial sapphire, copper and salt mining. The country has extensive salt and gypsum deposits as well as potash near Vientiane, possible bauxite on the Bolovens Plateau and some iron deposits. Laterite deposits contain some cassiterite.

Evaporation of water from a surface removes heat, creating a cooling effect, which can improve vegetable storage shelf life. ECCs are relatively large compared to the more common household clay pot cooler, and are therefore most suitable for farmers with large production quantities, farming groups, or farming cooperatives.  History  The brick ECC was originally developed in India by Susanta K. Roy and D.S. Khuridiya in the early 1980s to address fruit and vegetable post-harvest losses, especially in rural areas where electricity is non-existent.Roy, K. S., & Khurdiya, D. S. (1982). Keep vegetables fresh in summer (Vol. 27). Indian Horticulture.Roy, S. K., & Khurdiya, D. S. (1985). Zero Energy Cool Chamber (Vol. 43). India Agricultural Research Institute: New Delhi, India. Research Bulletin. Roy and Khuridiya’s ECC design is composed of a double brick wall structure, supported by a base layer of brick, and covered with a straw mat.  Suitability  ECCs provide the most benefits when they are used in low humidity climates (less than 40% relative humidity), the temperature is relatively hot (maximum daily temperature greater than 25 °C), water is available to add to the device between one and three times per day, and the device can be located in a shady and well-ventilated area. Additionally, storage conditions must meet users’ needs for scale of storage needed and optimal conditions for different vegetables throughout the year. The cost of the ECC must be affordable and justified by the benefits be realized due to its improved storage.Roy, S. K. (1989). On-farm storage technology can save energy and raise farm income. Amity Science, Technology & Innovation Foundation. http://ucce.ucdavis.edu/files/datastore/234-2143.pdfOdesola, I. F., & Onwuka, O. (2009). A Review of Porous Evaporative Cooling for the Preservation of Fruits and Vegetables. (Vol. 10). The Pacific Journal of Science and Technology. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228406788  Construction  The size of an ECC can be chosen to meet a range of user storage needs; however, the cost can vary significantly based on desired size and local cost of materials. Because ECCs can be constructed over a range of sizes, it is important to select an appropriate size according to the need, to avoid over- building and spending more money than is needed. Evaporative cooling chambers (ECCs) can be made from locally available materials including bricks, sand, wood, dry grass, gunny/burlap sack, and twine. The space in between the two brick walls is filled with sand, which retains the water that is added. If the evaporative cooling chamber is not build in an area that is well shaded, a shed must be constructed to provide shade. Inside the ECC, food is placed in unsealed plastic containers, which keep the vegetables off the ECC’s floor and allows them to breathe and be exposed to the cool, humid air inside the device. Below is a detailed step-by-step process for building an ECC:Verploegen, E.; Rinker, P.; Edoh Ognakossan, K. (2018). Evaporative Cooling Best Practices Guide. Copyright © Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Accessed on Oct 16,2018). https://d-lab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/inline- files/Evaporative%20Cooling%20Best%20Practices%20Guide.pdf 1) Make a foundation of approximately 165 cm x 115 cm with bricks. The dimensions can vary according to the storage volume needed 2) Mount the double wall at approximately a height of 67.5 cm leaving a cavity of 7.5 cm wide between the walls 3) Wet the walls of the chamber with water 4) Fill the cavity between the two walls with wet sand. It is better to use the sand from a nearby river if possible. 5) Make a frame from wood the same size as the foundation (165 cm 5) x 115 cm). Cover the wood frame with straw, dry grass, or burlap sack and secure with rope or twine. 6)The cover goes over the evaporative cooling chamber to keep the cool air inside the chamber 7) Store your products in plastic crates or baskets in the chamber. Plastic crates containing products must be arranged on top of each other 8) Place a clear plastic sheet over the plastic baskets containing the fruits and vegetable ECC in operation to extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables. 9) If the evaporative cooling chamber is not build in an area that is well shaded, a shed must be constructed to provide shade. Additionally, videos on construction are available.Build your own Zero Energy Cooling Chamber (ZECC) (World Vegetable Center): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enOjVc-kN7QZero Energy Cooling Chamber (Indian Society of Agribusiness Professionals): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8_D5TI-NoIStorage Structure For Fruits Vegetables (Ministry of Food Processing Industries, Government of India): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95RRdoySdjA&t;=245s  Best Practices for Use  It is important that ECCs are correctly used to ensure maximum cooling performance benefit for the user. Improper use decreases the potential benefits and results in a lower cost-benefit ratio. Before starting to build an ECC, a location should be chosen that is close to water, exposed to wind/breeze, and if possible where there is shade to avoid the need of a cover. ECCs should be reinstalled every 3 years with new bricks. The cover of the ECC should be opened as infrequently as possible to keep the cool air in. The sand between the bricks must be kept wet, installing an irrigation system can make this process simpler. Additionally water should be sprinkled on the cover 1-3 times per day. The vegetables that need storage should be carefully considered, since not all produce can be stored together because some release ethylene, which can accelerate ripening or reduce postharvest quality. Like any device for storing food, the ECCs should be kept clean. The surface of the interior cooling space should be sponged off regularly.

It amounted to an attempted Saudi invasion of the Buraimi Oasis. Its roots lay in the partitioning of tribal areas and communities which took place in the Trucial States when oil companies were seeking concessions to explore the interior.  Background  The dispute arose from Saudi Arabia's longstanding claim, made in 1949, of sovereignty over a large part of Abu Dhabi territory where oil was suspected to be present and an area in a 20-mile circle around the centre of the Buraimi Oasis. The claim arose after a geological party from the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco) crossed the 'Riyadh line'. This was a border line negotiated in 1935 by the British on behalf of Oman and Abu Dhabi with Saudi Arabia, which the latter had rejected. The Aramco party was accompanied by Saudi guards and was met by Patrick Stobart, then the British political officer for the Trucial States. Stobart was briefly detained by the Saudis, who disarmed his guards. The incident led the British to formally protest to the king of Saudi Arabia, King Abdul Aziz Al Saud. The Saudis responded by extending their territorial claim to include the right to negotiate with the Sheikhs of the entire Buraimi/Al Ain Oasis and areas of the southern and western part of Abu Dhabi. The Saudis relied on historical precedent (the oasis was under Wahhabi influence on a number of occasions in the period between 1800–1869) for their claims, which were countered by arguments from Abu Dhabi and Muscat based on more recent events. The argument led to the 1950 'London Agreement' whereby all exploration and troop movements would cease in the area until the issue of sovereignty was resolved. Despite ongoing negotiations, the Saudis attempted to take back the oasis.  Invasion of Hamasa  A conference was held in Dammam on 28 January 1952, attended by the Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Rulers of Abu Dhabi and Qatar and the British Political Resident. Following long deliberation, the conference was postponed until February, but failed to reach agreement. On 31 August 1952, a group of some 80 Saudi Arabian guards, 40 of whom were armed, led by the Saudi Emir of Ras Tanura, Turki bin Abdullah Al Otaishan, crossed Abu Dhabi territory and occupied Hamasa, one of three Omani villages in the oasis, claiming it as part of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. They were assisted in this by Sheikh Rashid bin Hamad of the Al Bu Shamis, much to the disgust of the Sultan of Muscat. The Sheikh of the Na'im was also pulled into the dispute, despite trying to remain removed from it initially. Al Otaishan was invited into the village by Sheikh Rashid and proceeded to proclaimed himself governor, and announced that he had come at the call of the indigenous population to “protect them.” Al Otaishan and his men set about distributing gifts of clothes, money and other supplies and held a banquet - a popular move in the impoverished area. In all, he collected some 95 statements of support through his efforts. The Sulṭan of Muscat and Imam of Oman (in a rare collaboration) gathered their forces to expel the Saudis but were persuaded by the British Government to exercise restraint pending attempts to settle the dispute by arbitration. The Sultan of Muscat, Said bin Taimur, and the Imam both raised some 6,000-8,000 tribal forces and assembled at Sohar, preparing to march on Buraimi before being appealed by Britain to stand down. A Standstill Agreement was reached in October 1952. A British military build-up took place, with 100 Trucial Oman Levies (TOL, later known as the Trucial Oman Scouts), a British-backed force based in Sharjah, 300 Aden Protectorate Levies, 7 armoured cars and 14 Land Rovers supported by 4 Lancaster bombers (two based at the British airbase in Sharjah and two at Habbaniyah), 3 Ansons in Bahrain and a section of Meteor fighters based in Sharjah. These were supported by two frigates. These forces were used to blockade the Saudi contingent, with attempts to reinforce them turning back truck convoys and camel trains from Saudi Arabia.Cabinet office memorandum C.(53) 128, 17 April 1953 (UK National Archive reference CAB/129/60) - Marked 'Secret' The TOL was instructed to disarm any Saudi attempting to run the blockade and return them to Saudi Arabia.  Mutiny  The Levies from Aden turned out to be problematic: they had been recruited in a hurry as the TOL was not a large enough force to manage the blockade of Buraimi effectively, and they arrived at the TOL base in Sharjah as a poorly trained force with flawed leadership. Their officer was replaced by Major Otto Thwaites, who had previously trained a detachment from Aden successfully. Trouble soon broke out and it was discovered the men were selling ammunition to local tribesmen and some were in contact with the Saudis. Thwaites returned a number of men to Sharjah, but there was more trouble over the killing of a civilian in an attempt to break the blockade. A mutiny broke out when Thwaites arrested the men concerned, with a number of the Aden Levies firing their guns as they pressed for the release of the men. The Commander of the Levies ordered the men to return to their posts and the ringleaders of the mutiny be sent to Sharjah, but a further incident occurred when Thwaites attempted to send an NCO back to Sharjah. The man refused to go and, together with two others, opened fire on Thwaites, killing him as well as another British officer and a Jordanian adjutant. Having alienated local sentiment, the Aden Levies were judged beyond repair and returned to Aden, leaving behind a considerable vacuum which was eventually filled by a company from the British air base.  Arbitration  Following the Standstill Agreement on 30 July 1954, it was agreed to refer the dispute to an international arbitration tribunal. The Arbitration Agreement allowed for one officer and fifteen men from both the Saudi force and the Trucial Oman Levies to be stationed within the oasis. The Saudi forces were supplied by air as any other route was impractical for them. The arbitration was to take place in Geneva. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia embarked on a campaign of bribery to obtain declarations of tribal loyalty on which its case was to be based. This campaign even extended to Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, brother of Sheikh Shakhbut, the Ruler of Abu Dhabi and at that time the wali of Al Ain. Zayed was approached by the Saudis, first with an offer of 50% of any oil revenues from the area, then a new car and 40,000 Rupees. A third approach offered Zayed 400 million Rupees and finally, he was informed that the Saudi representative, Abdullah Al Qurayshi, wished to present him with three pistols. In 1955 arbitration proceedings began in Geneva only to collapse when the British arbitrator, Sir Reader Bullard, objected to Saudi Arabian attempts to influence the tribunal and withdrew – one of the two judges to resign, the other being the Belgian President. Given these breaches of the agreement, the British government decided to unilaterally abrogate the Standstill Agreement and take the oasis on 25 October 1955.  Invasion of Buraimi  The British planned to use overwhelming force to prevent bloodshed, sending in 220 men, two squadrons of the Trucial Oman Levies, against the small Saudi force. However, the operation was complicated by the presence of large numbers of Bedouin around the oasis, including the Bani Kaab from Mahdah under Sheikh Obaid bin Juma, who were subjects of Muscat but supported Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad of the Al Bu Shamis, themselves a notable force. The Na'im were also, under Sheikh Saqr Al Nuaimi, an unknown quantity. The operation was intended to quickly displace the Saudi force and fly them out of the area. On 25 October, the Trucial Oman Levies quickly took the oasis and captured all fifteen of the Saudi contingent under the Saudi Emir Bin Nami, who was shot and lightly wounded when attempting to resist arrest and save a chest containing some 170,000 Rupees. The Saudi force was flown out on an RAF Valetta, which took them to Sharjah and then on to Saudi Arabia by sea. Most of the fighting took place after the surrender of the Saudis, with the Bedouin force of some 200 men putting up a spirited resistance to the Levies. A Lincoln bomber was called in, but couldn't use its machine guns as the area was populated by civilians.  Ceasefire  Sheikh Zayed and his brother, Sheikh Hazza, were present during the action and agreed to help the British open negotiation with the Bedouin Sheikhs, although they were cautious as they had no involvement in what was an Omani problem – the tribes were dependents of Muscat. However, Zayed had one of his most trusted advisors working behind the scenes to try and stop the Kaabis and Shamsis firing at the Levies. The Levies were planning a night attack on the Bedouin positions, when at 11pm, Sheikh Saqr and Sheikh Rashid arrived at a small encampment established by Edward Henderson, an oil company executive known to the Sheikhs who had been seconded to the Levies. A cease-fire was negotiated and the two Sheikhs and their families and closest followers were sent by air to Bahrain. Sheikh Saqr left behind him a treasure trove, some ten brass-bound chests filled with silver coins amounting to some 175,000 Rupees.  Aftermath  Following the conflict, the British decided to split the territory of Buraimi Oasis, ceding the areas under the Na'im and Al Bu Shamis, Buraimi and Hamasah, to Oman and the territory under Sheikh Zayed, including the village of Al Ain, to Abu Dhabi. The dispute continued to rumble on for many years to come until settled in 1974 by an agreement, known as the Treaty of Jeddah, between Sheikh Zayed (then President of the UAE) and Faisal of Saudi Arabia.  In popular culture  The first episode of the seventh season of The Goon Show was called \\"The Nasty Affair at the Buraimi Oasis\\". The Goon Show often used a piece of contemporary news as a framing theme of the story, even though it equally often diverged from reality shortly into the story.

The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) can then proceed to replicate the negative-sense genome from the positive-sense template. Cap-snatching also explains why some viral mRNA have 5’ terminal extensions of 10-20 nucleotides that are not encoded for in the genome. Examples of viruses that engage in cap-snatching include influenza viruses (Orthomyxoviridae), Lassa virus (Arenaviridae), hantaan virus (Hantaviridae) and rift valley fever virus (Phenuiviridae). Most viruses snatch 15-20 nucleotides except for the families Arenaviridae and Nairoviridae and the genus Thogotovirus (Orthomyxoviridae) which use a shorter strand. In the influenza virus, cap snatching occurs in the nucleus of the cell. The cap snatching endonuclease function is contained in the PA subunit of the RNA polymerase. In Arenaviridae and Bunyavirales, cap-snatching takes place in the cytoplasm.  Steps of cap snatching  Cap-snatching occurs in three general steps: 1) The viral RdRp or N protein binds to the host mRNA 5’-methylated cap-1 or cap-2 structure. 2) Viral endonuclease cleaves mRNA several nucleotides downstream of the cap. 3) Capped RNA utilized as a primer to initiate viral mRNA synthesis carried out by the RdRp.  Cap snatching and transcription in influenza  Cap snatching is best described in influenza viruses, especially influenza A. In Orthomyxoviridae, the viral family of influenza, the RdRp is divided into three subunits: PA, PB1 and P2. PB1 first binds the 5’ end of the viral RNA (vRNA), activating PB2 and causing the 3’ end of the vRNA to form a double-stranded zone with the 5’ end. The PB2 proceeds to bind cellular mRNA at the N7-methyl guanosine (m7G) capped 5’ end. The PA subunit subsequently cleaves the sequence 10-13 nucleotides from the cap structure via endonuclease activity at the N terminus. The exact cleavage location is dependent both on the distance between the PB2 and the PA of the RdRp (around 50 angstroms or 10-13 nucleotides) and also the sequence of the mRNA. Then, the PB1 subunit, which contains the polymerase activity, initially adds on two new nucleotides. The cap snatched primer moves through the product exit tunnel in the PB1 domain to serve as the primer for transcription. The vRNA 3’-UCGUUUU nucleotides are not bound to the polymerase but rather are free for complementary binding with the capped RNA primer to confer stability. Transcription then begins with G or C residue on the 3’ end of the capped primer. Finally, the PB1 subunit completes chain elongation in the canonical 5’ to 3’ direction, releasing the cap, but keeping the 5’ end bound. The viral 3’ poly-A tail is added at the end of transcription by polymerase stuttering from the steric hindrance of the vRNA loop. The resulting viral mRNA looks is identical to host mRNA, allowing endogenous cellular machinery to carry out processing and nuclear export. The de-capped host mRNAs are targeted degradation, which lead to the downregulation of cellular mRNA. Influenza RdRp also interacts with the cell Polymerase II (Pol II) C terminal domain, which potentially promotes viral transcription by changing the conformation of the RdRp. Additionally, by reducing Pol II abundance, influenza can begin to shut off critical host transcription. Cap snatching is not used during replication. Instead, the RdRp performs a “prime and realign” step ensure that the genome is fully copied. In this mechanism, the RdRp sets down a primer internally, then the vRNA is realigned to continue replication. Influenza's PB2 cap- binding domain has a unique fold, but it uses aromatic stacking to execute m7G cap-binding similar to other cap-binding proteins. PA is a member of the PD(D/E)XK nuclease family, which uses divalent metal ions to cleave nucleic acid. However, it has a peculiar active site histidine residue which ligates the Mn2+ ion used for cleavage.  Influenza drug therapy  In October 2018, the United States FDA approved baloxavir marboxil for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza, marking the first new influenza anti-viral drug class in over two decades. The drug utilizes knowledge about cap snatching by targeting and inhibiting the endonuclease function of the PA subunit, which will prevent the virus from initiating transcription. Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) is effective against both influenza A and B.  Cap snatching in Arenaviridae and Bunyavirales  The family Arenaviridae and order Bunyavirales are also segmented negative, single-stranded RNA viruses. A verified Mn2+ dependent endonuclease is located at the N-terminus of the L protein. TN-terminal domain is conserved between various families, suggesting evolutionary similarity. However, the cap-binding domain is not confirmed for every virus family, but it is believed to be located in the L or nucleocapsid (N or NP) protein.[1] In the bunyavirales, endonuclease cleavage and nucleotide motif preferences vary between families, genera and species. This variation occurs because of a need to some base pairing with the 3’ end of the viral genome. The nucleoprotein structure in Lassa virus (Arenaviridae) contains a second nuclease. Researchers propose that it is involved in attenuating interferon response, but it also contains a dTTP-binding site which may be used for cap-snatching. In this model, the L and N proteins cooperate in the cap-snatching process. The two-domain model has also been prosed for hantaviruses, but the N protein in the rift valley fever virus (Phenuiviridae) does not possess the same features.  Cap snatching in Hantaviridae  Cap snatching has also been investigated in depth for the family Hantaviridae (Bunyavirales). There is evidence that the N protein binds to the 5’ cap and protects them from degradation by cellular machinery. The N protein accumulates in cytoplasmic cellular processing bodies (P bodies), sequestering the protected 5’ caps as a pool of available primers for the RdRp to begin viral mRNA synthesis. There are four nucleotides on the vRNA that are adjacent the 5’ cap for binding. The virus preferentially cleaves mRNA cap at a G residue 14 nucleotides downstream from the cap. Additionally, it usually cleaves caps from nonsense mRNA instead of actively translated mRNA. The N protein can guard host mRNA caps without P-bodies, but they are not used as efficiently by the RdRp. The Hantaviridae RdRp can also engage in a “prime and realign” mechanism: The host oligonucleotide primes mRNA transcription and initiates transcription with a terminal G residue. After several nucleotides are added, the nascent RNA realigns by moving two nucleotides backwards on the repeated terminal sequence (AUCAUCAUC) so that the host G is once again the first nucleotide, creating a 5’ end extension. \\\\----  References  Category:Virology Category:Ribonucleases ","title":"Cap snatching"},{"id":"58876263","text":"Abbie Conant is an American trombonist and professor at the Staatliche Hochschule für Musik, Trossingen.

Here she studied contemporary music with Vinko Globokar at L'Accademia Chigiana in Siena. Thereafter she became the first trombonist in the orchestra of the Royal Opera, Turin. Conant became a professor of trombone at the Staatliche Hochschule für Musik, Trossingen in 1992.  Chamber music theatre (The Wasteland Company)  Photo from \\"Miriam\\". Conant describes: \\"Women confront... issues because society imposes roles upon them that limit their human potential. Miriam’s domestic role forces her to wear \\"masks,\\" but her buried authenticity fights back. Women in the workplace face similar pressures since they often confront attitudes and prejudice that limit their development.\\" Conant is married to the composer William Osborne, with whom she produces \\"chamber music-theatre\\" under the name The Wasteland Company. Some of these works involve feminist themes. As an example, their work Miriam is a staged, theatrical work for trombone, soprano, spoken word, pantomime, and computer-controlled piano, which reacts to Conant's experience with the Munich Philharmonic.

The Munich Philharmonic stopped using blind auditions after Conant's success.  Legal trials  In 1988, Conant successfully sued the City of Munich (the Philharmonic's owner) for discrimination and regained the position of first trombone. The first court hearing took place on 17th August 1982, initiated by City of Munich lawyers. Despite this, no ruling could be made as no \\"specific or concrete criticism\\" of Conant in concert was produced.Final judgment, Conant vs. LH München, AGM Aktz: 2 Ca 7022/82, July 18, 1984. The city lawyers also failed to provide the legally required written warnings. A new trial date was set for 16th June 1983, for which city lawyers provided the following basis for demotion: > The plaintiff does not possess the necessary physical strength to be a > leader of the trombone section; she is not in the position to clearly lead > the trombone group. Apart from that, she lacks the required empathy to > translate the artistic wishes of the General Music DirectorBrief, Conant vs. > LH München, AGM Aktz: 2 Ca 7022/82, Febuary 3, 1983. In response to this, Conant went for examinations at the Gautinger Lung Clinic. There, she was made to > breathe inside a sealed cabin and have blood taken from her ear to see how > efficiently her body absorbed oxygen. She had to blow through numerous > machines to measure the capacity of her lungs, and the speed at which she > could inhale and exhale air.

Celibidache attended the second trial, but was not invited to give testimony due to lack of substantiated criticism.Final judgment, Conant vs. LH München, AGM Aktz: 2 Ca. 7022/82, April 12, 1984. The court ruled in favour of Conant on 29th March 1984, citing: > “The suit is permissible because the change in work assignments, due to the > lack of a substantiated argument, is unjustified.” “The accused has not > justified their demotion with facts, but rather generalized value > judgments.” “Above and beyond that, they do not say when (date) the alleged > mistakes happened. They also do not mention when the plaintiff was given a > warning.” “It is therefore not possible for the court to determine what the > plaintiff did wrong, or determinable whether she took the alleged warnings > to heart, or in other words, whether the mistakes were made again after the > warning.”Final judgement, Conant vs. LH München Aktz. Ca 2 7022/82, April > 12, 1984. She then successfully sued the orchestra again for back pay when she discovered that, per Celibidache's orders, she had been paid less than her male colleagues. Malcolm Gladwell said Conant's story was \\"my inspiration\\" for his bestseller, Blink, and it served as the book's concluding chapter. Her story was also told in a 1994 full-length documentary film, Abbie Conant: Alone Among Men by Brenda Parkerson.  Taos studio  Conant and her husband Wiliam Osborne own a studio space in Taos, New Mexico. There is a two-bedroom living space and performance space capacity to seat 60. In addition to their own works, the studio has hosted readings, presentations and concerts from local Taoseña women and fellows of the Wurlitzer Foundation.

It was found to contain one of the largest number of stone tools of any site thus far discovered in Japan. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2004. Overview The site is located on a river terrace near the confluence of the Shinano River and the Uono River, approximately one kilometer south of Echigo-Kawaguchi Station. Four excavations have been conducted so far. Excavated materials are stored in Meiji University (1st survey), Tohoku University (2nd and 3rd surveys), the Nagaoka City Board of Education (4th survey), and at Tokyo National Museum. The site contains the ruins of several villages from approximately 17,000 years ago. The ruins overlap, indicating that a semi-nomadic population repeatedly returned to this site over many centuries. Excavated artefacts included over 6,000 fine grained blades, 1,000 sculptured sword stones and 9,000 sculpted sword spalls, and over 100,000 arrow and spear points. The base materials were mostly hard shale, which is common in along the Sea of Japan coastal areas. It was estimated that the bone, horn and leather products were also actively produced at the site, to make completed spears and arrows, and as such material were also needed as part of the secondary processing to produce very thin sharpened blades. The style of tools found display both Mesolithic and Neolithic traits, and the style of the stone swords was similar to what has been found widely distributed across Siberia and into Alaska.

It is part of the MacGillycuddy's Reeks range in County Kerry. Cnoc na Toinne lies between the Coomloughra Reeks and the Eastern Reeks, and is just above the col of the Devil's Ladder, a popular route for climbing Carrauntoohil, Ireland's highest mountain. Geography Looking down the Devil's Ladder path from the top of the col between Cnoc na Toinne and Carrauntoohil. Cnoc na Toinne is most frequently encountered as the minor summit that forms the col with Carrauntoohil, through which most hill walkers travel on their way summiting Ireland's highest mountain. The col is most commonly accessed from the Hag's Glen (via Cronin's Yard), by ascending a loose rocky path known as the Devil's Ladder (see photo opposite). Because of the deterioration of the Devil's Ladder path, hill walkers also use the Zig- Zag path on the northern side of the north-west spur of Cnoc na Toinne, known as Bóthar na Gíge, as an alternative route. This path brings walkers closer to the actual summit of Cnoc na Toinne. Cnoc na Toinne lies between the Coomloughra Reeks and the Eastern Reeks and effectively separates the two main sections of the MacGillycuddy Reeks range, each section containing half of the Reeks summits that are above 3,000 ft in height. The north-easterly ridge that rises up from the top of the Devil's Ladder col to Cnoc na Toinne, then rises further to neighbouring Cnoc an Chuillinn , where is runs in a straight north- easterly direction, taking in several major summits, connected by a high sharp ridge, before ending at Cruach Mhór . Eastern Reeks section as seen from Carrauntoohil. The large green ridge in the right foreground is Cnoc na Toinne, and the Zig-Zag path is near its left edge Cnoc na Toinne is the 798th-highest mountain in Britain and Ireland on the Simm classification. Cnoc na Toinne's prominence qualifies it to meet the Arderin classification, and the British Isles Simm and Hewitt classifications.

The Lafayette College campus is a 110-acre suburban area located on College Hill in Easton, Pennsylvania. Lafayette College also owns and maintains a 230-acre athletic complex, the Metzgar Fields Athletic Complex, and leases a 1,500 square foot space in New York City. The school is roughly 70 mi (110 km) west of New York City and 60 mi (97 km) north of Philadelphia. The main campus borders the City of Easton to the south, the College Hill Residential Historic District to the north east, and is situated almost directly on the Delaware River. Architecture Planned mainly around a central quad, the campus architecture is highly varied with elements of many styles visible. While the overall architectural style cannot be singularly determined, examples from Beaux-Arts, Postmodernism, Gothic Revival, Richardsonian Romanesque, and Second Empire architecture are clearly visible on campus. In 1909, the Olmsted Brothers, one of the most influential landscape architectural firms at the time, were commissioned to produce a report on Lafayette's campus. In it, they praised the topography and grounds of the college, but lamented at a lack of harmony in architectural style. However, this \\"architectural eclecticism\\" has been a purposeful tradition at Lafayette,Gendebien, pg. 36 and has also been a source of praise; as the campus was not constructed all at once, the style of buildings reflect the time periods in which they were constructed. Academic buildings Acopian Engineering Center Acopian Engineering Center holds the college's programs in mechanical, chemical, electrical, and civil engineering. It is named for Sarkis Acopian, class of 1951, whose contributions to the college allowed for the renovation of three buildings to be combined into one center. The first engineering center in the complex, the Eleanor Dana Engineering building, was completed in 1912 with a fund secured by Andrew Carnegie for the endowment of a course in mechanical engineering. With this fund, the college planned to create a large building with separate wings for their emergent engineering courses.Skillman, vol. 2, pgs. 186-7 On June 13, 1953, a second building in the complex was constructed known as the Alumni Hall of Engineering.Gendebien, pg. 295 In 1966, an addition to that building dedicated as Dana Hall was completed, and the metallurgical engineering department moved there from the basement of Markle Hall.Gendebien, pg. 413 Acopian's donation in 2003 bridged these buildings together under one single center bearing his name. Hugel Science Center Hugel Science Center Hugel Science Center houses Lafayette’s programs in chemistry, physics, and biochemistry. It is named for Charles E. Hugel, class of 1951, and his wife, Cornelia F. Hugel. Originally built as Olin Hall of Science in 1957, the building received a $25 million upgrade in 2001 to renovate the existing 50,000 square foot structure and add 40,000 square feet to its east end. Kirby Hall of Civil Rights Kirby Hall of Civil Rights Second floor oak-paneled library in Kirby Hall of Civil Rights The Kirby Hall of Civil Rights is home to Lafayette's Government and Law Department. It also houses Lafayette's second library, with a collection of over 30,000 volumes related to government and law. It was the first of many buildings to be named after philanthropist Fred Morgan Kirby after he made a donation of 1,000 shares of stock in the F. W. Woolworth Company, of which he was co-founder and vice-president.Skillman, vol. 2, pg. 254 With each share valued at $100, this donation was worth $100,000 in total, though with the swelling of a bull market in the early 1920s the college ended up selling their shares for over $538,000.Skillman, vol. 2, pg. 255 In 1921, Kirby had created an endowment for the Kirby Professorship in Civil Rights. By 1930, in an effort to grow the department, he donated an additional $590,000 ( dollars) to fund the construction of the Hall of Civil Rights. Upon its dedication, Kirby Hall was said to be one of the finest academic buildings on an American college campus. Construction of the Hall began on October 10, 1929 in the footprint of the old gymnasium which had been demolished to make room for its successor. The famed architectural group Warren and Wetmore were hired to construct the building in the Beaux-Arts style. The exterior of the building was built out of Indiana limestone and Woodbury granite, while the interior was decorated in travertine imported from Italy. An ornate oak-paneled library was constructed on the second floor, a large classroom placed on the first, with more classrooms constructed in the basement. Around the four walls of the exterior of the building the following inscriptions were carved in the stone: The front reads a line from the Gospel of Matthew, \\"Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?\\" (Matthew 20:15), while the back reads a line of Herbert Spencer, \\"Every man is free to do that which he will provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man.\\" The north side of the building reads, \\"Every man is the architect of his own fortune\\" (Pseudo- Sallust), while the south reads a line from Ecclesiastes, \\"Whatever Thy hand findeth to do, do with it Thy might\\" (Ecclesiastes 9:10).Gendebien, pg. 37 Additionally, a bust of The Republic was placed over the front door. According to historians, the building was meant to be \\"one of the outstanding college buildings in America,\\" and was rumored to be per square foot the most expensive building of its day. It's also purported to be the first college building of its time expressly made for the study of government and law, with press lauding it as a \\"practical step forward\\". Kunkel Hall Kunkel Hall houses Lafayette's program in Biology. The building was dedicated in 1969 to Dr. Beverly W. Kunkel who had led the school's biology program for 37 years and in that time tutored two Nobel Prize winners; Philip Showalter Hench, and Haldan Keffer Hartline.Gendebien, pg. 269 Before the construction of Kunkel Hall, the biology program was housed unsatisfactorily in Jenks Hall. In 1966, the college received a $700,000 grant from the Longwood Foundation on the condition new buildings break ground by May 1, 1968. A necessary $800,000 was required to plan and construct Kunkel Hall which was provided for in part by federal grants and college supporters.Gendebien, pg. 567 Upon its completion, the 31,000 square foot building contained a warm-animal room, cold-animal room, radioisotope facility, multiple laboratories, a museum for the college's specimen collection, an auditorium, and a two-story greenhouse. A tunnel in the basement connected the building to what is presently Hugel Science Center. Oechsle Center for Global Education The Oechsle Center for Global Education was built in 2014 and houses the college's departments of international affairs, Africana studies, anthropology, and sociology. The 19,600 square foot building was constructed at a cost of $10.6 million, and its construction was launched by Mikhail Gorbachev during a speech he gave to the student body. Like Oeschle Hall, it was named after Walter, class of 1957, and Christa Oechsle who were longtime donors to the college. Oechsle Hall Oechsle Hall Oechsle Hall is home to the college's psychology and neuroscience programs. The building was originally known as the Alumni Memorial Gymnasium and was built as a memorial to the Lafayette alumni who had served in World War 1, a group of over 1,000 students. The cost of the building was $300,000, and it was completed in 1924.Skillman, vol. 2, pg. 253 Originally, this building was the home of the college's intramural sports and the school basketball team, though the size of the building was quickly deemed inadequate due to ever increasing student population sizes.Gendebien, pg. 575 As the largest indoor venue on campus it was also used to host large events hosted by figures such as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Errol Garner, and Bill Cosby. By 1971, a new field house was under construction to host the college's basketball team, and a renovations were undertaken to transform the gymnasium into a hall for concerts and lectures.Gendebien, pg. 277 In 1998, Walter (class of 1957) and Christa Oechsle donated $12 million to the college endowment, with funds meant to re-purpose the building to house programs in psychology and neuroscience. The new building, re-named Oeschle Hall, opened on October 18, 2002. Pardee Hall Pardee Hall on the Lafayette College campus Pardee Hall is the most iconic building on the Lafayette College campus, and at the time of its completion was one of the largest collegiate buildings of its era. Initially created to house the college's science programs, it now houses the school's humanities, social sciences, and mathematics departments. It was designed by John McArthur Jr. in the Second Empire architecture style, and since its initial completion has been renovated three times – twice due to fire, and once after the second World War for modernization. The initial construction of the building began after a $200,000 donation ( dollars) from Ario Pardee in 1871 during the administration of president William Cassady Cattell, who had begun a large fund raising campaign to save the college from financial ruin. Construction of the building took two years, and Pardee Hall was officially designated as the campus scientific building on October 21, 1873.Skillman, vol. 1, pg. 362 A crowd of over 20,000 marched through Easton on the day of dedication,Skillman, vol. 1, pg. 364 and the dedication of the building was delivered by Rossiter W. Raymond.Skillman, vol. 1, pg. 363 The final costs of its initial construction totaled over $250,000. On June 4, 1879, Pardee Hall burned to the ground for the first time. Hot equipment not properly cooled in the chemistry lab on the top floor were to blame for the start of the fire, and late notice, combined with an unorganized firefighting patrol, led to the almost complete gutting of the building before the flames were extinguished.Skillman, vol. 2, pg. 4–7 As the building was the cornerstone of the campus, efforts were made to immediately begin its reconstruction. At the cost of $130,000, Pardee Hall was rededicated on November 30, 1880, in view of an impressive assortment of individuals including General William Tecumseh Sherman, Secretary of War Alexander Ramsey, and President Rutherford B. Hayes. Hayes himself gave a speech during the re- dedication.Skillman, vol. 2, pg. 20 The second burning of Pardee Hall occurred on December 18, 1897, as an act out of revenge by disgruntled professor George H. Stephens. Stephens had made a pile of chairs, books, and other materials in the biology department, and then used gas and matches to set the pile aflame. He escaped to New York after watching the building light up in flame from the New Jersey border, but returned to Easton at the start of the new year to continue acts of vandalism on the campus. In June, he was accosted and admitted to the burning of Pardee. He also admitted to plans to burn down Colton Chapel later in the year.Skillman, vol. 2, pg. 135 As before, Pardee was rebuilt identical to its former self on the exterior, with modern changes to its interior.Skillman, vol. 2, pg. 137 It was re-dedicated, now for a third time, on May 31, 1899, and a Tiffany glass window titled Alcuin and Charlemagne was installed on its front edifice.Skillman, vol. 2, pg. 144 The last renovation of Pardee Hall occurred from 1964 to 1965. While iron railings around the perimeter of the roof were removed for the war efforts in WWII, the interior of building was updated to fit the demands of the college. The building was completely gutted, with every former item moved to a new location, including the Tiffany stained glass window which was later restored and displayed in the renovated Skillman Library. A basement was dug under the foundation, and the entire wooden interior was replaced with concrete offices and classrooms. The exterior was sandblasted and the roof completely removed and rebuilt, though after construction it looked largely like its former self.Gendebien, pg. 412-413 Ramer History House Ramer History House Ramer History House contains the school's history department and is named for Lawrence J. Ramer, class of 1950. The Georgian building in which it resides was originally the fraternity house for Theta Delta Chi built in 1905.Skillman, vol. 2, pgs. 159-60 When the fraternity was removed from campus in 2001 due to disciplinary action the building was left empty. A renovation in 2006 transformed the fraternity building in an academic hall, with classrooms on the main level and offices on the second and third. Rockwell Integrated Sciences Center The Rockwell Integrated Sciences Center was completed in 2019 as the campus's new home for biology, neuroscience, and computer and environmental science. Named for S. Kent Rockwell, class of 1966, the $75 million building began construction in 2017 between Watson Hall and Acopian Engineering Center, and required the removal of the former plant operations and security buildings for its footprint. Mostly serving as an academic space, the center also hosts the new Hanson Center for Inclusive STEM Education, and the Dyer IDEAL Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Simon Center for Economics & Business The Simon Center is the college's home to the economics department. It is named after former United States Secretary of the Treasury William E. Simon, class of 1952, who donated $3 million in 1984 to re-purpose the existing structure, Jenks Hall. Before the renovation, Jenks Hall hosted many different academic departments. Upon its completion in 1867, it housed the chemistry department.Skillman, vol. 1, pg. 275 When that department moved to Gayley Hall in 1902, the biology program moved into Jenks Hall.Skillman, vol. 2, pg. 154 When the biology program moved to Kunkel Hall in 1969, the music and art departments moved in. After the Williams Center for the Arts was completed in 1983, Jenks Hall was temporarily left empty. With Simon's donation the college combined Jenks Hall with a non- functioning steam plant directly adjacent to create the Simon Center. Van Wickle Hall Van Wickle Hall Van Wickle Hall is home to the college's geology department. It was originally called the Van Wickle Memorial Library, and was funded by Augustus Van Wickle (son-in-law to Ario Pardee) who left in his will $30,000 for its construction.Skillman, vol 2, pg. 140 Finished in 1900, it served as the college's first library. The building, constructed in the Romanesque Revival style, is constructed of mottled Pompeian brick with terra-cotta trimmings and a roof made of Spanish tiles.Skillman, vol 2, pg. 150 At the time of its completion, all 30,000 volumes previously housed elsewhere on campus were finally consolidated under one roof. In 1913, the addition of extra stacks allowed the library to hold more books. This addition was expanded significantly in 1939 to double the size of the shelving in order to fit a quickly growing collection of books. When, in 1956 a Middle States Association survey of the college revealed the need for a better library building on campus, the college decided to convert Van Wickle into an academic building and construct the Skillman Library. William C. Buck Hall Buck Hall is one of the few academic buildings located at the base of College Hill, in the college's arts campus. Donated by William C. Buck, class of 1950, it was completed in 2016 at a cost of $21 million. Due to its location in a 100-year flood plain, the entire building is raised above the flood elevation, with the first occupied floors placed on the second level. The 18,000 square foot building contains a black box theater, 180-seat cinema, classrooms, and other various rooms for the college's art programs. The black box theater was named for former college president Daniel H. Weiss and his wife, Sandra Weiss. Williams Center for the Arts Williams Center for the Arts The Williams Center for the Arts holds the music and theater programs. It opened in 1983 at a cost of $8.7 million, and was dedicated to Morris Williams, class of 1922, and his wife.Gendebien, pg. 626 The building is funded in part through the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts which helps maintain an art gallery and a theater for performance arts. Musicians such as Charles Lloyd, and Steve Coleman have performed at the center. It also hosts a travelling exhibition featuring various local artists, or prominent topics from the school's history, such as the college's Tiffany glass collection. Williams Visual Arts Building The Williams Visual Arts Building was the first location in the college's arts campus at the base of College Hill. It opened on April 24, 2001 and was donated by Morris R. Williams, class of 1922, and his wife, Josephine. The $1.7 million building was designed by Joseph Biondo, a local architect, and features several of his architectural models in its foyer. With a clinker brick exterior, the building was awarded the 2013 Citation of Merit by the American Institute of Architects, Pennsylvania Chapter. Administrative buildings Markle Hall Markle Hall Markle Hall is one of the main administrative buildings on campus, and the home of the college's admissions department. Constructed in 1929 through a donation by trustee John Markle for $500,000, the building was originally named the Markle Hall of Mining Engineering, and was built to sustain the college's mining engineering program. However, due to a small number of students enrolled in the program at the time of its construction, the building also housed the college's geology and metallurgy programs,Gendebien, pg. 36 and contained a small mining museum and department library. In 1963, while the new Skillman Library was under construction across the street, the decision was made to convert Markle Hall to an administrative building.Gendebien, pg. 412 The former library, Van Wickle Hall, was converted to house the geology program previously held in Markle Hall, while the metallurgical program remained in the basement until the department merged with the chemical engineering program housed next door in Acopian.Gendebien, pg. 611 Scott Hall Scott Hall Scott Hall is the location of the dean of the college, and the Center for the Integration of Teaching, Learning, and Scholarship. The building was originally the home of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity and was built in 1908 in the Georgian Revival style,Skillman, vol. 2, pg. 176 though their removal from campus in 1993 left the house empty for a number of years. By 2008, the consideration was made to demolish the house due to termite damage and neglect, though the college instead opted to pursue a $3.3 million renovation through Miller, Miller & McLachlan to restore the structure. In 2011, the house was renovated while keeping its original style as a space for growing administrative offices. Miller, Miller & McLachlan later received the 2009 Excellence in Construction Award from the Associated Builders and Contractors of Eastern Pennsylvania for their restoration of this historical building. Residence halls Farber Hall Located on March Field, Farber Hall was constructed in 1978 as a memorial to Charles D. Farber, class of 1965, who had died in an accident in 1969. His father, Jack Farber, also a graduate of Lafayette in 1931 additionally set up a scholarship in his honor.Gendebien, pg. 625 Plans for the building were made as early as 1970, when the college realized a need for additional housing after becoming co-ed.Gendebien, pg. 521 Its architecture is similar to the adjacent Ramer Hall which was built thirteen years later. Keefe Hall Keefe Hall sits at the crest of the hill overlooking downtown Easton. It is a 37,800 square foot residence hall built in the Georgian style which contains multiple \\"special-interest housing\\" blocs for students. Marquis Hall Marquis Hall is a mixed-use building with a dining area taking up the entire first floor, an all-female residence hall on the second and third floors, and offices located in the basement. In the past, it has also been the home of the sociology and anthropology departments, and campus safety. The building was initially constructed in 1960 in Colonial Revival style, and was named for the Marquis de Lafayette.Gendebien, pg. 400-401 South College South College South College is a residence hall for students of all years, and was the first building constructed at Lafayette College. Construction of the building started in 1833, and it was hand built by the students under the supervision and help of the college's first president, George Junkin. In its original iteration, the building consisted of only the middle edifice, and this housed a kitchen, dining hall, recitation room, prayer hall, rooms for the college's two literary societies, fifty dormitory rooms, and apartments for the college president and his family.Skillman, vol. 1, pg. 93-94 The first addition to the building began by the addition of the east wing completed in 1870. Built with $22,000 donated by the city of Easton, the new wing was named Eastonian Hall and contained a two- story tall room which was quickly used to house the college's growing collecting of books.Skillman, vol. 1, pg. 324-6 A second addition, the west wing, was finished by 1873 which contained the college chapel.Skillman, vol. 1, pg. 355 In 1878, the graduating class gifted to the school the clock which still sits along the steeple of South College.Skillman, vol. 1, pg. 398 The following class of 1879 donated the South College Bell.Skillman, vol. 2, pg. 10 With the construction of Colton Chapel in 1916, the West wing chapel was utilized as a basketball court, then underwent renovations in 1921 to separate it into two rooms; one housing a lecture hall, the other hosting the faculty room.Skillman, vol. 2, pg. 260 On March 1, 1956, after years without renovation, the trustees decided to close the east wing of South due to its dilapidation. The following night, March 2, a fire burned much of the west wing and the building's tower.Gendebien, pg. 296 Through the years 1957-8, both of these wings were completely renovated to be used as student housing. In 1961, the entire center edifice was razed and rebuilt in order to make room for more student housing, a book store, and post office. In 2001, the west wing was again renovated, and this time renamed as Jesser Hall, after Ned Jesser, class of 1939. Watson Hall Watson Hall Watson Hall is a residence hall, and was originally constructed in 1949 as the college's school of international affairs. It was donated by Thomas J. Watson, a prominent American businessman who was a college trustee from 1930-1956.Gendebien, pg. 209-210 In 1956 a wing was added to the north side of the building to hold additional student dorms, classrooms, and a dining facility. A second addition in 1964 added a southern wing to the building to bring architectural balance to the building and add an additional residence wing for 40 students and one faculty resident.Gendebien, pg. 412 In 1971, when the college began accepting women, Watson Hall was renovated into a women's residence. By 1973, the building became co-ed and currently exists this way.Gendebien, pg. 521 Greek buildings Delta Kappa Epsilon House The first fraternity building built on campus, the DKE House, was applied for in June 1900 and was completed in 1904.Skillman, vol. 2, pg. 149 Its initial placement on the campus was near the current site of Kunkel Hall.Gendebien, pgs. 402-3 The house was rebuilt in 1962 near March Field following a house fire in 1959. In 2015, the house received an extensive remodel, with an addition of a solarium and larger front edifice. Zeta Psi Fraternity House Zeta Psi House The Zeta Psi house is an historic house, and the only building on the Lafayette College campus to be on the National Register of Historic Places, having been added in 2001. It was constructed on February 2, 1910 by the Tau chapter of Zeta Psi at the cost of $50,000. The style of the house reflects both Colonial Revival and Arts and Crafts in its design and detailing. Note: This includes Due to the suspension of the Zeta Psi fraternity from 2014 to 2018, the building was used as a residence hall. Miscellaneous buildings Colton Chapel The front of Colton Chapel with a statue of General Lafayette in the foreground Constructed in 1916 by Carrère and Hastings, Colton Chapel is the main house of worship on campus. It was constructed in the Beaux-Arts style out of Indiana limestone and featured two Tiffany glass windows in its interior.Skillman, vol. 2, pg. 228-229 The design of the spire is based on the work of Christopher Wren, who was instrumental in the rebuilding of 52 churches in London after the Great Fire. On Easter Sunday, 1965, Colton Chapel caught on fire and was completely gutted. Since the exterior of the chapel was structurally sound, the only costs incurred the renovation of the interior, although the two Tiffany glass windows were destroyed beyond repair. The chapel was rededicated on October 22, 1967 after receiving extensive upgrades to its interior, with a new organ and balcony, with seating for 800 students.Gendebien, pg. 565-567 Farinon College Center One of the most popular buildings on campus, Farinon is the college's main social center. It includes two separate dining facilities, the college store, the post office, a movie theater, meeting rooms, and offices for student and school organizations, including residence life. The main floor hosts a large atrium under a large glass skylight which is a major gathering spot for students. Farinon was constructed by Shepley Bulfinch from 1989 to 1991 at a cost of $16 million. It was named for William B. Farinon, class of 1939, and P.T. Farinon. Hogg Hall Hogg Hall is home to the college's career services, religious & spiritual life offices, an interfaith chapel, and the campus radio station, WJRH. It was originally built in 1902 to house the Brainerd Evangelical Society, a group on campus named after American missionary David Brainerd, with the mission to \\"promote Christian Missions and the Evangelization of the World\\".Skillman, vol. 1, pg. 72-73 Funding for the building, originally known as Brainerd Hall, came from James Renwick Hogg (class of 1878) who donated $35,000 for its completion.Skillman, vol. 1, pg. 305 It was built in the Collegiate Gothic style out of New Quincy granite and trimmed with Indiana limestone. Gargoyles and ornamental buttresses are featured throughout the building, reminiscent of the original Gothic churches. When it was first completed, the building functioned as a meeting area for religious services by the Brainerd Society, as well as a recreation center. It also became a student branch of the YMCA.Gendebien, pg. 52-53 The building contained a bowling alley, billiard tables, reading rooms, a large pipe organ, and a trophy room.Skillman, vol. 2, pg. 157 In 1926, the auditorium was renovated into a Little Theater to host the campus plays.Skillman, vol. 2, pg. 268 In 1944, the name was changed to Hogg Hall to honor its donor. Skillman Library Skillman Library The David Bishop Skillman Library is the main library on the college campus with a collection of over 600,000 volumes. It was built in 1965 to replace Van Wickle Hall as the main library after a 1956 Middle States Association survey of the college revealed the need for a more adequate library facility for a rapidly growing student population.Gendebien, pg. 401 A $2 million campaign was launched to raise money for the new library, which was subsequently named after David B. Skillman, the college's first librarian and biographer.Gendebien, pg. 408 In 2004, the library underwent a $22 million renovation which overhauled the entire interior and exterior and added over 28,000 square feet of space. Upon its completion the library received the 2005 Boston Society of Architects’ Honor Award for Design Excellence and Higher Education Facilities Design Award, the 2006 ALA Institute Honor Award for Interior Architecture in, and the 2007 American Institute of Architects’ AIA/ALA Library Building Award. The library also is the home of the special collections and college archives. Among those items in the collection are: General Lafayette's personal sword, a first edition copy of The Federalist Papers, and many other items authenticated as original possessions of Lafayette. In 1979, a library assistant stole an Egyptian pectoral from the college's special archives, which had been in the college's possession since 1873. The pectoral, dated to the Second Intermediate Period of Egypt (1783–1550 B.C.) was sold in 1981 to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts for $165,000. A law suit against the museum was dropped in 1992 after an undisclosed settlement and transfer of title to the museum. The Skillman Library was awarded the 2014 Excellence in Academic Libraries award by the Association of College and Research Libraries. In 2015 it was featured in the television show Parks and Recreation in its series finale. Athletic facilities On campus The main athletic facility on campus is the Kirby Sports Center, which hosts the men's and women's basketball programs. It also contains a pool, rock climbing wall, indoor track, and the main fitness center. Fisher Stadium is the college's 13,132-seat multi-purpose stadium which mainly hosts the Lafayette Leopards football program. The Bourger Varsity Football House is the home of the fitness center and locker rooms for the football program and sits directly adjacent to the field. Off campus Lafayette also owns a 230-acre athletic complex, the Metzgar Fields Athletic Complex, located about 3 miles away from the main campus in Tatamy, Pennsylvania.

It was broadcast live on CBS November 21, 1956,The Baltimore Sun, TV Program Highlights. and marked the first time the anthology series had presented a musical.The Indianapolis News, Steel Hour a Musical Tonight. Luther said the show evolved from his re-reading of Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer a few years earlier: \\"(W)henever an incident or character gave me an idea for a song, I'd write the music and words,\\" Luther told an interviewer in 1957. \\"By the time I'd reached the end of the book, I found I had written 32 songs.The Boston Globe, Channel 7's Frank Luther Could Set Anything To Music, We're Sure. The cast included John Sharpe as Tom Sawyer, Jimmy Boyd as Huckleberry Finn, Bennye Gatteys as Becky Thatcher, Rose Bampton as Aunt Polly, Matt Mattox as Injun Joe and Clarence Cooper as Jim the Narrator. A cast album was released on Decca Records shortly after the broadcast, featuring several songs omitted from the original show.Clarion-Ledger, McComb's Jim Boyd 'Spins' Tom Sawyer. Luther was commissioned to follow up the show with a musical adaptation of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, also starring Boyd, which was broadcast on The U.S. Steel Hour November 22, 1957.The Boston Globe, Channel 7's Frank Luther Could Set Anything To Music, We're Sure.  Plot  Luther’s teleplay begins with Tom and Huck making plans to steal away to the graveyard at midnight to cure Huck’s warts by hurling a dead cat into the freshly dug grave of Old Hoss Williams. Later, Tom falls in love at first sight with Becky Thatcher as he sees her skipping rope with her friends, Amy and Susie. As Becky goes inside, she casually tosses a flower to Tom, who sits, lovestruck, beneath her window, until a housemaid dumps a basin of water on him. That night, in the graveyard. Tom and Huck witness the murder of Doc Robinson by Injun Joe, who is helping Robinson and Muff Potter in a grave-robbing scheme. Tom and Huck swear to remain silent about what they saw, fearing Injun Joe's retribution. When Becky accidentally tears a page in the schoolmaster's biology book, Tom takes the punishment -- eight whippings -- and wins her love. They share a kiss and become \\"engaged.\\" But Becky spurns Tom after he reveals he and Amy Lawrence were previously engaged. Heartbroken, Tom rounds up Huck and Joe Harper and heads to a nearby island, where they plan to live as pirates. Free to do as he pleases at last, Tom swims, plays, learns to smoke a corncob pipe (with Huck's encouragement) and enjoys the leisurely life for three days. But he secretly travels back to town to look in on Aunt Polly, who is grief-stricken and certain he has died. Soon after Tom returns to the island, a fierce storm hits, giving the would-be pirates second thoughts about staying. Afterward, the boys return home in time to crash their own funerals; the townspeople were all convinced they had drowned. Muff Potter is accused of the murder of Doc Robinson, but Tom testifies Injun Joe, also in court, was responsible. Before Injun Joe can be seized, he hurls himself through a courtroom window and escapes. Tom and Becky make up in time to attend a picnic at McDougal's Cave. While they are exploring the caverns, Tom and Becky run into Injun Joe, who is using the catacombs as a hideout. Injun Joe falls off a cliff, allowing them to escape, and the town rejoices as Tom and Becky return home. The teleplay may have differed from what was actually broadcast: A preview in TV Guide listed \\"You Can't Teach an Old Dog New Tricks,\\" a humorous solo for Aunt Polly, and \\"My Love Has Gone Away,\\" a ballad for Becky, in the program of songs to be performed, but neither of them are included in the original teleplay.

It is characterized by the system failing to reach thermal equilibrium, and retaining a memory of its initial condition in local observables for infinite times.  Thermalization and localization  Textbook quantum statistical mechanicsSakurai JJ. 1985. Modern Quantum Mechanics. Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings assumes that systems go to thermal equilibrium (thermalization). The process of thermalization erases local memory of the initial conditions. In textbooks, thermalization is ensured by coupling the system to an external environment or \\"reservoir,\\" with which the system can exchange energy. What happens if the system is isolated from the environment, and evolves according to its own Schrödinger equation? Does the system still thermalize? Quantum mechanical time evolution is unitary and formally preserves all information about the initial condition in the quantum state at all times. However, a quantum system generically contains a macroscopic number of degrees of freedom, but can only be probed through few-body measurements which are local in real space. The meaningful question then becomes whether accessible local measurements display thermalization. This question can be formalized by considering the quantum mechanical density matrix ρ of the system. If the system is divided into a subregion A (the region being probed) and its complement B (everything else), then all information that can be extracted by measurements made on A alone is encoded in the reduced density matrix ρA = TrB ρ(t). If in the long time limit ρA(t) approaches a thermal density matrix at a temperature set by the energy density in the state, then the system has \\"thermalized,\\" and no local information about the initial condition can be extracted from local measurements. This process of \\"quantum thermalization\\" may be understood in terms of B acting as a reservoir for A. In this perspective, the entanglement entropy S=-Tr ρA log ρA of a thermalizing system in a pure state plays the role of thermal entropy. Thermalizing systems therefore generically have extensive or \\"volume law\\" entanglement entropy at any non-zero temperature. They also generically obey the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). In contrast, if ρA(t) fails to approach a thermal density matrix even in the long time limit, and remains instead close to its initial condition ρA(0), then the system retains forever a memory of its initial condition in local observables. This latter possibility is referred to as \\"many body localization,\\" and involves B failing to act as a reservoir for A. A system in a many body localized phase exhibits MBL, and continues to exhibit MBL even when subject to arbitrary local perturbations. Eigenstates of systems exhibiting MBL do not obey the ETH, and generically follow an \\"area law\\" for entanglement entropy (i.e. the entanglement entropy scales with the surface area of subregion A). A brief list of properties differentiating thermalizing and MBL systems is provided below. * In thermalizing systems, a memory of initial conditions is not accessible in local observables at long times. In MBL systems, memory of initial conditions remains accessible in local observables at long times. * In thermalizing systems, energy eigenstates obey ETH. In MBL systems, energy eigenstates do not obey ETH. * In thermalizing systems, energy eigenstates have volume law entanglement entropy. In MBL systems, energy eigenstates have area law entanglement entropy. * Thermalizing systems generically have non- zero thermal conductivity. MBL systems have zero thermal conductivity. * Thermalizing systems have continuous local spectra. MBL systems have discrete local spectra. * In thermalizing systems, entanglement entropy grows as a power law in time starting from low entanglement initial conditions. In MBL systems, entanglement entropy grows logarithmically in time starting from low entanglement initial conditions. * In thermalizing systems, the dynamics of out-of-time-ordered correlators forms a linear light cone which reflects the ballistic propagation of information. In MBL systems, the light cone is logarithmic.  History  MBL was first proposed by P.W. Anderson in 1958 as a possibility that could arise in strongly disordered quantum systems. The basic idea was that if particles all live in a random energy landscape, then any rearrangement of particles would change the energy of the system. Since energy is a conserved quantity in quantum mechanics, such a process can only be virtual and cannot lead to any transport of particle number or energy. While localization for single particle systems was demonstrated already in Anderson's original paper (coming to be known as Anderson localization), the existence of the phenomenon for many particle systems remained a conjecture for decades. In 1980 Fleishman and Anderson demonstrated the phenomenon survived the addition of interactions to lowest order in perturbation theory. In a 1998 study, the analysis was extended to all orders in perturbation theory, in a zero dimensional system, and the MBL phenomenon was shown to survive. In 2005 and 2006, this was extended to high orders in perturbation theory in high dimensional systems. MBL was argued to survive at least at low energy density. A series of numerical works provided further evidence for the phenomenon in one dimensional systems, at all energy densities (“infinite temperature”). Finally, in 2014 Imbrie presented a proof of MBL for certain one dimensional spin chains with strong disorder, with the localization being stable to arbitrary local perturbations – i.e. the systems were shown to be in a many body localized phase. It is now believed that MBL can arise also in periodically driven \\"Floquet\\" systems where energy is conserved only modulo the drive frequency.  Emergent Integrability  Many body localized systems exhibit a phenomenon known as emergent integrability. Recall that in a non- interacting Anderson insulator, the occupation number of each localized single particle orbital is separately a local integral of motion. It was conjectured (and proven by Imbrie) that a similar extensive set of local integrals of motion should also exist in the MBL phase. Consider for specificity a one dimensional spin-1/2 chain with Hamiltonian H=\\\\sum_i \\\\left [ J \\\\left ( X_i X_{i+1} + Y_i Y_{i+1} \\\\right ) + J^\\\\prime Z_i Z_{i+1} + h_i Z_i \\\\right ] Where the , and are Pauli operators, and the are random variables drawn from a distribution of some width . When the disorder is strong enough () that all eigenstates are localized, then there exists a local unitary transformation to new variables such that H=\\\\sum_i h^\\\\prime_i \\\\tau^z_i + \\\\sum_{ij} J_{ij} \\\\tau^z_i \\\\tau^z_j + \\\\sum_{ijk} K_{ijk} \\\\tau^z_i \\\\tau^z_j \\\\tau^z_k + \\\\cdots Where the are Pauli operators that are related to the physical Pauli operators by a local unitary transformation, the … indicates additional terms which only involve operators, and where the coefficients fall off exponentially with distance. This Hamiltonian manifestly contains an extensive number of localized integrals of motion or \\"l-bits\\" (the operators , which all commute with the Hamiltonian). If the original Hamiltonian is perturbed, the l-bits get redefined, but the integrable structure survives.  MBL as a platform for exotic orders  MBL enables the formation of exotic forms of quantum order that could not arise in thermal equilibrium, through the phenomenon of localization protected quantum order. A form of localization protected quantum order, arising only in periodically driven systems, is the Floquet time crystal.  Experimental realizations  A number of experiments have been reported observing the MBL phenomenon. Most of these experiments involve synthetic quantum systems, such as assemblies of ultracold atoms or trapped ions. Experimental explorations of the phenomenon in solid state systems are still in their infancy.

Prior to going offline with its users' funds, USI-Tech moved its website from a .com top-level domain, to a .io domain, while also appearing on a number of mirror domains. Joseph Rotunda, Director of the Enforcement Division at the Texas State Securities Board, estimates that the scammers were able to extract hundreds of millions of dollars from all over the world.  Promoters  Based on reports from Engadget, USI was initially promoted by Lee Oakey, Kerry Stockton, Rodney Burton, and Michael Faust. Oakey and Stockton are British, and currently live in Australia. Burton (49, in 2018), also known as \\"Bitcoin Rodney\\", was known for purchasing a $350,000 Lamborghini Huracan from Lamborghini Newport Beach in Costa Mesa, California, using Bitcoin. Burton was released from jail in 2010 after serving five years for drug dealing. Dan Putnam, who identifies as the CEO of R&D; Global, a suspected USI parent company, was also seen boasting that a mere $40 investment can grow to US$10 million in just 18 months at Eyeline Trading. Eyeline's homepage was redirected to USI Tech for a brief period, before also going offline. R&D; Global is registered as a limited liability company in Putnam's home state of Utah under the name of Richard Theodore Putnam.  Related companies   Eyeline Trading  As of March 2019, a domain belonging to USI Tech was redirected to Eyeline Trading, another company claiming to be a cryptocurrency and forex platform trading provider. The redirect suggests that the owners of the original website have relaunched the ponzi scheme through Eyeline Trading, following USI Tech's exposure to law enforcement.

Julie Hart Beers, Forest Interior, 1876. Julie Hart Beers Kempson (1835 – August 13, 1913) was an American landscape painter associated with the Hudson River School who was one of the very few commercially successful professional women landscape painters of her day. Life Born Julie Hart in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, she was the daughter of James Hart and Marion (Robertson) Hart, who had immigrated from Scotland in 1831. Her older brothers William Hart and James McDougal Hart were also important landscape painters of the Hudson River School. In 1853, she married journalist George Washington Beers. After his death in 1856 she and her two daughters moved to New York City, where her brothers had their studios. Like most women artists of the day, she had no formal art education, but it is thought that she was trained by her brothers. Well into her forties, with her second husband, Peter Kempson, she moved to Metuchen, New Jersey, where she set up her own studio. She continued to use the surname Beers when signing her artwork. At the time of her death she was living in Trenton. Career By 1867, Beers was exhibiting her paintings. Although she had her own studio in New Jersey, she continued to use William's studio on 10th Street in New York City as a showroom. She was one of very few women to become a professional landscape painter in the America of her day, in part because women were excluded from formal art education and exhibition opportunities. Beers's mature style balances sweeping, well-balanced compositions with telling details. In the 1870s and 1880s, she exhibited frequently at the National Academy of Design as well as at the Brooklyn Art Association, the Boston Athenæum, and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. She was able to sell a good deal of work through the Brooklyn Art Association, but she also took groups of women on sketching trips to the mountains of New York and New England to supplement her income. She also painted some still lifes.

It was founded in 1988 by Marc Andersen, who later left in November 1995. Originally published in the form of a 32-page weekly magazine in 1988 and 1989, it saw monthly 148-page issues (and more) past 1990. It initially sold with one or more floppy disks and then later with several CD-ROMs, and finally, until April 2012, a DVD that included complete copies of video games. In 2012, Joystick ceased distribution. Despite 80,000 unique visitors per month to Joystick's website, it was closed in March 2002 due to the lack of profitability. It reopened in early 2008 as a summary of the magazine, including video game reviews and video game news; it would be updated irregularly until June 2012.  History  The first issue of Joystick Hebdo was published on 9 November 1988 and contained cheat-code listings, game testings and reviews. Sometime between November 1989 and January 1990, Joystick Hebdo rebranded as Joystick and began selling monthly issues. In June 1993, Joystick was purchased by Hachette Digital Presse. In 2003, Hachette Digital Presse was acquired by Future. During this time, many editors left Joystick and created the independent publication Canard PC. In 2011, MER7 (formerly Future France) was liquidated, causing the last issue of Joystick to release on 23 November 2012. On 8 February 2013, based on a decision by the Paris Commercial Court, Anuman Interactive acquired the Joystick brand and announced Joystick Replay in March 2013. On 17 May 2018, ZQSD.fr and Anuman launched a podcast series to commemorate the magazine. It showcases interviews with former Joystick writers and editors.  Joystick Replay  In March 2013, Anuman Interactive announced Joystick Replay, a game label that repurposes retro PC games for the modern age. It has published remakes of games such as Darkstone, Fire & Forget, Moto Racer, North Vs South, Prehistorik, Prohibition 1930 and Titan.  Controversy  On 3 July 2012, in the \\"Summer Special\\" issue of that year, Kévin Bitterlin, a former journalist for Joystick, wrote in a review for the 2013 Tomb Raider game \\"Subjecting one of the most iconic figures in video games to such torture is just great. And I daresay it is quite exciting.\\" Many outraged reactions launched a debate on sexism in video games in France.

Biography  Born in Bilbao, Spain, in 1981, she moved to study in the United States, where she lives. She has a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Bard College in New York and an MA from the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts). She is a professor of Fine Arts and Humanities at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, having taught at the University of California in San Diego and CalArts. Her vocation for cinema began during her studies at Bard College, when she learned about the work of different filmmakers such as Hollis Frampton, Maya Deren and Michael Snow. Her films, mostly shot in 16 mm, are located in natural, urban and domestic spaces in and around Los Angeles, where she has lived for a decade. Included under the generic title \\"Landscape Plus\\", they move between the intimate spaces of interiority and the magnitude of the great open Californian landscapes, with the intention of encompassing a geography transformed by affective and subjective states. In her cinema, the cinematographic forms of narration are diluted and replaced by the revelation of process and materiality. Through an intense work of relationship between images and diegetic sounds, the synchrony creates a sensation of real time and lived experience, a tension between form and that experience that always surpasses it. In this way, the more formalistic or abstract aspect of her cinema, with a structural vocation, is pierced by an emotional tone, at the same time as it gives rise to false clues about ambiguous fictions. Her films include Footnotes to a House of Love (2007), My Tears Are Dry (2009), Cry When It Happens (2010), A Lax Riddle Unit (2011), The Room Called Heaven (2012), Live to live (2015) and 025 Sunset Red (2016) —premiered at the MoMA— In addition to the MoMA, her works have been shown at the Lyon Biennial, the Rotterdam International Film Festival and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid.

Debaine-Francfort starts this archaeological journey with the \\"Birth of Archaeology in China\\" (chap. I), followed by chapters devoted to the artefacts and other findings of the Neolithic Age (chap. II, \\"The Chinese Neolithic: From Singular to Plural\\"), Shang dynasty (chap.

The book has been translated into American and British English, Italian, Japanese, Russian, South Korean, Swedish and Turkish. At the beginning of the 20th century, China opened its doors to the rest of the world: the clash of cultures, the encounter of East and West. Despite this epoch of political chaos, important discoveries were made and scientific bodies for research were established due to the introduction of new field methods made by western archaeologists. After the communists took control of China, from 1949 until 1973, Chinese archaeology went through a period of darkness and retreat. Today the splendours and achievements of ancient China are revealed to modern eyes: a large number of discoveries, major international exhibitions follow one another. From the early Neolithic painted pottery, the Shang and Zhou bronzes, the bronze bells of Marquis Yi of Zeng, the impressive army of the First Emperor, to the lavish tomb of the Marquise of Dai; from the Yellow River to the Blue River, from North to South, China's origins are revealed.

Geologic History, Stratigraphy and Tectonics The K'yŏnggi Massif and Yongnam Massif lie north and south of the Okch'on-T'aebaeksan Zone respectively. They are both polymetamorphic gneiss and schist complexes from the Precambrian and underlie the entire Republic of Korea. Units range in age from the Archean to the Proterozoic, with metamorphic facies from greenschist to amphibolite grade. Some geologists have attempted to correlate the rocks with North China-North Korea Paraplatform and Yangtze Paraplatform rocks although these categorizations are uncertain. Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago) Most Paleozoic rock outcrops are found only in the Okch'on-T'aebaeksan Zone. The Chŏsun Supergroup in the northeast of the zone is cut by a northeast rending fault zone called the Tangyang-Chongsŏn Thrust Zone. It splits the Tuwibong facies marine siliclastic and carbonate rocks from the two kilometer thick Yŏngwol Cambrian and Ordovician fossil-bearing sandstone, mudstone and limestone. The Tuwibong rocks are the same age and reach up to one kilometer thick, beginning with a basal quartzite layer on top of the Yongnam Massif and ascending through limestone, dolomite and mudstone units. The Okch'ŏn Zone likely formed in mid-Cambrian times with faulting, interpreted from olistolith limestone breccia. By contrast to the Chŏsun Supergroup, the Okch'ŏn Supergroup crops out in the central Okch'on-T'aebaeksan Zone with thick sequences of metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks. Some geologists have interpreted the supergroup as a series of nappe formations that took shape in a Cambrian intracratonic basin. Above the volcanic and sedimentary sequence in the middle part of the supergroup are jumbled rocks formed from submarine debris flows during rifting and contain granite, gneiss, quartzite, limestone, mudstone and basic volcanic rock fragments. At first, the Taebo orogeny was credited with the folding, thrusting and metamorphism but Cluzel, Jolivet and Cadet in 1991 named the Okch'on orogeny to explain Silurian and Devonian deformation. South Korea has no Silurian or Devonian sedimentary rocks, but sedimentation began again on a sinking paralic platform inland from the proto-Japan as it formed beginning in the Carboniferous. The P'yŏngan Supergroup outcrops northeast of the Okch'on Zone, subdivided into the Hongjom Formation gray mudstone, limestone and mudstone, Sadong Formation sandstone, mudstone and coal seams, Kobangsan Formation coarse terrestrial sandstone and mudstone, and Nogam Formation green sandstone and mudstone. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) In the Triassic at beginning of the Mesozoic as sedimentation continued in the P'yŏngan Supergroup, the Sŏngnim tectonic event affected the Okch'on-T'aebaeksan Zone, although it only caused slight faulting and warping of the major supergroup strata. Geologists have inferred that the event was related to deformation further west in Indonesia. The event generated dextral strike-slip faulting in intermontane troughs in the Kyonggi Massif in which the terrestrial sediments of the Taedong Supergroup accumulated. The rocks in the basin include two sequences of conglomerate grading to sandstone, mudstone and coal beds. The Taedong Supergroup has extensive fossils, particularly crustaceans. The Taebo orogeny in the Jurassic is broadly similar to the Yenshanian tectonism in China, although its effects are believed to have been less dramatic. The event ended with the batholith intrusions of the Taebo granites which outcrop over 30 percent of the country. The Kyŏngsang Supergroup encompasses more terrestrial rocks, also formed in small basins. The Shindong Group is the oldest: a coarse alluvial fan two kilometers thick, overlain by the five kilometer thick alluvial, lacustrine and fluvial sediments with interspersed basalt and andesite of the Hayang Group. The Yuch'on Group is the top unit, with volcanic rocks and interbedded sediments. In the southern Kyŏngsang Supergroup low shields formed from cooling andesite flows, followed by explosive rhyolite volcanism. The entire supergroup formed in the Cretaceous prior to Japan's southward migration from Asia. Kyŏngsang rocks are intruded by microlite, diorite and granodiorite from the late Cretaceous. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) Volcanic activity continued into the Cenozoic ending 50 million years ago. No Paleogene sedimentary rocks have been found onshore. Yangbuk Group conglomerates and alluvial fan sediments gathered in small fault-bounded basins in the Miocene. During the last 2.5 million years of the Quaternary, Cheju and other offshore islands formed from volcanism.

Episodes Production Development A few months prior to being named co-head writers for Saturday Night Lives 42nd season, Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider spent a week in early 2016 developing the premise of The Other Two. They wanted the show to express the introspection and self-doubt that can happen in your 20s while incorporating elements of pop culture. Kelly said they were intentional about including depictions of the characters' sex lives. Speaking to Vulture, Schneider said they intentionally wrote Chase as a kind person because it would subvert expectations of the story. The pilot was sold to Comedy Central in late 2016. Schneider and Kelly hired Charlie Gruet, who was the director of photography of the television series High Maintenance. In October 2017, The Other Two received a full series order. The series was produced through executive producer Lorne Michaels' entertainment studio, Broadway Video. The first season is set to begin streaming on HBO Max in 2021, where the second season will also stream exclusively, making the series a \\"Max Original\\". Casting In October 2017, it was announced that Drew Tarver, Heléne Yorke, Case Walker, Ken Marino, and Molly Shannon had joined the cast for the series. Kelly and Schneider discovered Walker through social media, where he was known as a top user on the platform Musical.ly and as having over 400,000 Instagram followers. Tarver was brought in based on his comedic work at Upright Citizens Bridge Theatre, while Yorke was cast after Kelly and Schneider became familiar with her work on High Maintenance. It was announced in February 2020 that Gideon Glick would recur during the second season as Cary's new love interest named Jess. Reception The first season of the series holds an approval rating of 94% based on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 8.52 out of 10, on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"With game leads and a wickedly witty sense of humor, The Other Two skewers and celebrates pop culture with equal aplomb.\\" Metacritic assigned the series a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 based on 16 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

Kuwait is a country in Western Asia, situated in the northern edge of Eastern Arabia at the tip of the Persian Gulf. Geologic history, stratigraphy and tectonics The oldest crystalline basement rocks beneath Kuwait are poorly understood due to the thickness of overlying sedimentary rocks. In the early 1960s, a 13,853 foot deep well in the Burgan oil field only reached rocks dating to the Triassic including clay, marl, limestone, shale and anhydrite. This is overlain by 4500 feet of Jurassic rocks, primarily limestone but with 1300 feet of anhydrite, likely related to the Hith Anhydrite in Saudi Arabia. Cretaceous rocks are up to 6000 feet thick in the southeast or 10,000 feet in the northwest, predominantly limestone, shale and sandstone belonging to the Zubair Formation and Burgan Formation. Cenozoic rocks nearer the surface are well researched. Rocks 3500 to 2500 feet thick date to Paleocene and Eocene, with primarily limestone and Rus Formation evaporite. The Kuwait Group outcrops in the southeast with clay sandstone. Wara and Burgan have hills capped with weathered sandstone and chert. In fact, chert limestone is up to two feet thick at Gurain hill. Together, these rocks formed during the Pliocene, Miocene and Pleistocene. The Ghar Formation is identifiable in the Jal-Az-Zor escarpment with coarse-grained or pebbly sandstone and green clay beds from the Oligocene and Miocene. The country has extensive Quaternary deposits such as beach sands welded together with calcium carbonate, deltaic and tidal mudflats at Bubiyan Island and in the northeast as well as windblown sand. The Dibdibba Formation from the Miocene to the Pleistocene overlies the fossil bearing Lower Fars Formation with gypsum bearing sandy clay beds and coarse igneous and metamorphic gravels.

It occurs in shallow water in the tropical Indo-Pacific region. Description Synaptula recta is an elongated sea cucumber growing to a maximum length of about . The mouth is at the anterior end and is surrounded by thirteen feeding tentacles. The colour is variable but it is often a deep colour, ranging from dark reddish-purple to a fairly bright red, olive or a pattern of longitudinal lilac stripes on a pale background. The calcareous spicules in the cuticle consist of anchors with knobbed ends and curved bodies. The tips of these spicules project through the cuticle and help give traction during locomotion which is performed by peristalsis, synaptids having no tube feet. Distribution and habitat Synaptula recta is native to the tropical western Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from the Red Sea, the Maldives and Sri Lanka to northern Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and several Pacific island groups. It inhabits coastal waters and reefs, sand flats and seagrass meadows and occurs at depths down to about . Ecology Synaptula recta is nocturnal and feeds on detritus and planktonic particles which it sweeps into its mouth with its feeding tentacles. It is often found moving over and feeding on debris on the surfaces of sponges. The sexes are separate and fertilisation is external.

Townsend lived in Oyster Bay and passed information to her brother, Robert Townsend, a main member of the ring. She died in December 1842 and is buried at the Townsend Cemetery. The Culper Spy Ring The Culper Spy Ring was assembled in 1778 by Major Benjamin Tallmadge on orders of George Washington. The ring was to be formed inside New York City, the site of British intelligence headquarters. Townsend's brother Robert was recruited to gather intelligence inside the city under the alias \\"Culper Jr.\\" Washington placed special emphasis on the true identities of agents remaining secret and using aliases, and none were able to meet him in person. This was designed to avoid spies being captured and hanged, as Nathan Hale was two years prior to the ring's formation. British officers were stationed at the Townsend home including John Graves Simcoe of the Queen's Rangers, who was often visited by the British army's Adjutant General, John Andre. According to legend, Sarah told Robert about how she overheard Simcoe and André discussing plans to capture West Point thanks to Benedict Arnold's treachery. This information through Robert was sent to Tallmadge's agents, and led to André's capture. André was captured on neutral ground carrying documents with the plans to capture West Point and was soon hanged. It is likely this story is not true, as it did not come into existence until more than a century after Andre's death, and the timeline is incorrect. The Queen's Rangers left Raynham Hall in the Spring of 1779, and the betrayal did not occur until September. Courtship Simcoe courted Townsend for a time and declared his love for her in 1779 in America's first known valentine. In it he asks her to choose him as her valentine. An excerpt reads, \\"Say, must I all my joys forego and still maintain this outward show? / Say, shall this breast that’s pained to feel be ever clad in horrid steel? / Nor swell with other joys than those of conquest o’er unworthy foes? / Shall no fair maid with equal fire awake the flames of soft desire: / My bosom born, for transport, burn and raise my thoughts from Delia’s urn? / “Fond Youth,” the God of Love replies, “Your answer take from Sarah’s eyes.” Townsend, who was about 18 at the time of this proposal, did not choose Simcoe to be her valentine, likely due to greatly differing political sentiments, however it is believed the two had a brief flirtation.Lossing, Benson. “An Ancient Valentine.” In _The American Historical Record Volume 1_. Lossing, Benson. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Chase And Town, 1872. (My primary source is the letter in the chapter) pp. 67-68 The theme of the lengthy valentine revolves around the difficulty of loving an enemy. Townsend was never married, and it is said that the valentine was found among her possessions after her death.

Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), is an optimization technique composed of characteristics from Stochastic gradient descent, a Robbins–Monro optimization algorithm, and Langevin dynamics, a mathematical extension of molecular dynamics models. Like stochastic gradient descent, SGLD is an iterative optimization algorithm which introduces additional noise to the stochastic gradient estimator used in SGD to optimize a differentiable objective function. Unlike traditional SGD, SGLD can be used for Bayesian learning, since the method produces samples from a posterior distribution of parameters based on available data. First described by Welling and Teh in 2011, the method has applications in many contexts which require optimization, and is most notably applied in machine learning problems.  Formal definition  Given some parameter vector \\\\theta , its prior distribution p(\\\\theta) , and a set of data points X = \\\\\\\\{x_i\\\\\\\\}_{i = 1}^N , Stochastic Gradient Langevin dynamics samples from the posterior distribution p ( \\\\theta \\\\mid X ) \\\\propto p (\\\\theta) \\\\prod_{i = 1}^N p(x_i \\\\mid \\\\theta) by updating the chain: : \\\\Delta \\\\theta_t = \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon_t} 2 \\\\left( abla \\\\log p(\\\\theta_t) + \\\\frac{N}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n abla \\\\log p(x_{t_i} \\\\mid \\\\theta_t) \\\\right) + \\\\eta_t where n < N is a positive integer, \\\\eta_t \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(0,\\\\varepsilon_t) is Gaussian noise, p(x \\\\mid \\\\theta) is the likelihood of the data given the parameter vector \\\\theta , and our step sizes \\\\varepsilon_t satisfy the following conditions: : \\\\sum_{t = 1}^\\\\infty \\\\varepsilon_t = \\\\infty \\\\quad \\\\sum_{t=1}^\\\\infty \\\\varepsilon_t^2 < \\\\infty For early iterations of the algorithm, each parameter update mimics Stochastic Gradient Descent; however, as the algorithm approaches a local minima or maxima, the gradient shrinks to zero and the chain produces samples surrounding the maximum a posteriori mode allowing for posterior inference. This process generates approximate samples from the posterior as by balancing variance from the injected Gaussian noise and stochastic gradient computation.  Application  SGLD is applicable in any optimization context for which it is desirable to quickly obtain posterior samples instead of a maximum a posteriori mode. In doing so, the method maintains the computational efficiency of stochastic gradient descent when compared to traditional gradient descent while providing additional information regarding the landscape around the critical point of the objective function. In practice, SGLD can be applied to the training of Bayesian Neural Networks in Deep Learning, a task in which the method provides a distribution over model parameters. By introducing information about the variance of these parameters, SGLD characterizes the generalizability of these models at certain points in training. Additionally, obtaining samples from a posterior distribution permits uncertainty quantification by means of confidence intervals, a feature which is not possible using traditional stochastic gradient descent.  Variants and associated algorithms  If gradient computations are exact, SGLD reduces down to the Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm, first coined in the literature of lattice field theory. This algorithm is also a reduction of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, consisting of a single leapfrog step proposal rather than a series of steps. Since SGLD can be formulated as a modification of both stochastic gradient descent and MCMC methods, the method lies at the intersection between optimization and sampling algorithms; the method maintains SGD's ability to quickly converge to regions of low cost while providing samples to facilitate posterior inference. Considering relaxed constraints on the step sizes \\\\varepsilon_t such that they do not approach zero asymptotically, SGLD fails to produce samples for which the Metropolis Hastings rejection rate is zero, and thus a MH rejection step becomes necessary. The resulting algorithm, dubbed the Metropolis Adjusted Langevin algorithm, requires the step: : \\\\frac { p( \\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}^t \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}^{t+1}) p^* \\\\left( \\\\mathbf {\\\\theta}^t \\\\right) } { p \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}^{t+1} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf {\\\\theta}^t \\\\right) p^* (\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}^{t+1})} < u, \\\\ u \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{U} [0,1] where p(\\\\theta^t \\\\mid \\\\theta^{t + 1})is a normal distribution centered one gradient descent step from \\\\theta^{t}and p(\\\\theta)is our target distribution.  Mixing rates and algorithmic convergence  Recent contributions have proven upper bounds on mixing times for both the traditional Langevin algorithm and the Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm. Released in Ma et al., 2018, these bounds define the rate at which the algorithms converge to the true posterior distribution, defined formally as: : \\\\tau(\\\\varepsilon ; p^0) = \\\\min \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ k \\\\mid \\\\left\\\\p^k - p^* \\\\right\\\\|_{\\\\mathrm{V}} \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon \\\\right\\\\\\\\} where \\\\varepsilon \\\\in (0,1)is an arbitrary error tolerance, p^0is some initial distribution, p^*is the posterior distribution, and ||*||_{TV}is the total variation norm. Under some regularity conditions of an L-Lipschitz smooth objective function U(x)which is m-strongly convex outside of a region of radius R with condition number \\\\kappa = \\\\frac{L}{m}, we have mixing rate bounds: : \\\\tau_{ULA}(\\\\varepsilon,p^0) \\\\leq \\\\mathcal{O} \\\\left( e^{32LR^2} \\\\kappa^2 \\\\frac d {\\\\varepsilon^2} \\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\frac d {\\\\varepsilon^2} \\\\right) \\\\right) : \\\\tau_{MALA} (\\\\varepsilon,p^0) \\\\leq \\\\mathcal{O} \\\\left( e^{16LR^2} \\\\kappa^{3/2} d^{1/2} \\\\left( d \\\\ln \\\\kappa + \\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\frac 1 \\\\varepsilon \\\\right) \\\\right)^{3/2} \\\\right) where \\\\tau_{ULA} and \\\\tau_{MALA}refer to the mixing rates of the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm and the Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm respectively. These bounds are important because they show computational complexity is polynomial in dimension d conditional on LR^2 being \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log d).

History KCTI-FM was first licensed on July 29, 2008 as KZAR, owned by Educational Media Foundation, and used as a repeater for the company's national Air1 Christian format. Educational Media Foundation sold this facility after purchasing 97.7 KLTO in McQueeney, Texas from Univision, moving Air1 to the much larger San Antonio rimshot facility. In March 2016, the KCTI call letters were allowed to be reused by Marantha Church of Laredo, who owned this facility at the time, by former KCTI owner Gonzales Communications, replacing the existing KITG callsign with KCTI-FM. This was challenged by KCTI's new owners, Texas Public Radio, after purchasing KCTI from Gonzales Communications, resulting in a request being sent to the Federal Communications Commission by T.P.R. asking the Commission to force Sun Radio to abandon the callsign they felt rightfully belonged to them, and select another one in its place for this station. In response to Texas Public Radio, the Commission stated that it never would have allowed the use of a secondary call sign without “approval from user” of the primary callsign. In this case, it said the former 1450 KCTI General Manager’s email saying he had no problem with this station using KCTI-FM was good enough, and had approval of the KCTI ownership at the time the deal was made. Therefore, Sun Radio was allowed to continue using the FM side of the KCTI call, even though they do not own the original AM facility, nor have the approval of the present KCTI ownership, for the two facilities to share the longtime heritage Gonzales based calls. Sun Radio Foundation consummated the purchase of KCTI-FM on May 12, 2016.

History The design for the 28 cm Haubitze L/14 i.R. dates back to a similar 20 cm howitzer that was designed in 1903 and offered to the Austro- Hungarian Army. A modified 28 cm version was built by Krupp in 1913 and tested by the German Army but was not accepted for large-scale production and only one prototype was built. It was felt that 28 cm was too small so larger weapons were developed. The 28 cm Haubitze L/14 i.R. belonged to the same class of weapons like the 42 cm M-Gerät or the Skoda 305 mm Model 1911 that were designed to destroy reinforced-concrete fortifications in Belgium, France, and Poland.  World War I  The sole gun of this type was assigned to beta battery No.8 on the Eastern Front during 1915. In February 1915 the battery took part in the unsuccessful bombardment of the Russian Osowiec fortress in Northeast Poland. In June 1915 the battery then took part in the successful recapture of the former Austro-Hungarian fortress of Przemysl. In August 1915 the battery next took part in the successful siege of the Russian fortress at Kaunas in Lithuania. In October the battery then took part in the successful invasion of Serbia and bombarded strong points on the far side of the Danube. During 1916 the battery was moved to the Western Front and participated in the unsuccessful German bombardment of Verdun and during the Somme offensive. The battery served until the end of the war on the Western Front and its last action was during the unsuccessful German Michael Offensive in the Spring of 1918.  Design  The 28 cm Haubitze L/14 i.R. was a short barreled breech-loading howitzer on a two-wheeled box trail carriage with an integrated ammunition hoist and a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism. The gun had a horizontal sliding-block breech and it fired separate-loading, cased charges, and projectiles. There was also a large blast shield to protect the crew during firing. To facilitate towing on soft ground the wheels were often fitted with Bonagente grousers patented by the Italian major Crispino Bonagente. These consisted of rectangular plates connected with elastic links and are visible in many photographs of World War I artillery from all of the combatants. For transport, the 28 cm Haubitze L/14 i.R. could be broken down into two or three separate wagon loads for the barrel and carriage.

The structure is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). This bridge was built in 1914 to replace an iron pivot bridge of 1883 origin, and rehabilitated in 1997. It is a transportation conduit connecting downtown and the historical Fifth Ward. History San Jacinto Street has its origins in the founding of Houston. It was designated as a street in the original plat of Houston from October 1836. Houston constructed its first bridge spanning Buffalo Bayou on San Jacinto in 1883. This conveyed traffic to downtown from the Fifth Ward, where many working-class people lived. Houston's wharf at the foot of Main Street still received and dispatched ships, so any bridge at San Jacinto needed to allow their passage. This first viaduct was made of iron and pivoted on a pedestal installed on Buffalo Bayou's northern bank. Houston constructed a new bridge on San Jacinto in 1914. The area just north from downtown, the Fifth Ward, was a burgeoning industrial area separated from downtown by Buffalo Bayou. Mayor Horace Baldwin Rice was an advocate of the City Beautiful movement, thus was motivated by aesthetic considerations in choosing a bridge design. The new bridge facilitated river traffic with a large “barrel arch ring,” which also contributed to the bridge's appearance and its application of City Beautiful principles. William P. Carmichael Company of St. Louis executed the design of E. E. Sands, an engineer working for the City of Houston. They used reinforced concrete for most of the bridge elements, while pedestrians accessing the bridge walked among the “sidewalk brackets, curved fascia walls and urn balustrade railings.” The “open spandrel concrete arch” is a representative design feature of bridges built during this period, and there were 23 such bridges in Texas still extant in 2007. The bridge spans 325 feet and is in part supported by twenty-foot pilings. A fifty-foot roadbed is flanked by ten- foot cantilevered sidewalks. The San Jacinto Street Bridge was rehabilitated in 1997. Major design features such as the open spandrel arch were retained. The decking was replaced with new reinforced concrete. The original railings with oval apertures were recast with a new concrete balustrade with rectangular openings.

It exists in two forms. Iste confessor Domini sacratus is the original 8th Century hymn and Iste confessor Domini colentes is a 1632 edition, published by Pope Urban VIII with improved Latin style. The hymn is written in Sapphic and Adonic meter. History The earliest versions of the hymn can be found in 8th century manuscripts for the feast of St Martin of Tours (d.397) and this is reflected in the third verse which originally referred to the shrine of St Martin which was an extremely popular pilgrimage site for the sick. Although St Martin was a bishop and confessor, the hymn was gradually extended and came to be used for all confessors, including non- bishops in the Roman Breviary and other Latin liturgical rites. In the reforms following the Second Vatican Council, the 1974 Liturgy of the Hours has attempted to restore the hymn for primary use with bishop confessors, however it retains its more general usage where the pre-1974 Liturgies (such as the Roman Breviary) are used. Text of Hymn The Roman Breviary published by Pope Urban VIII had two variations for the 3rd and 4th lines of this hymn: \\"Hac die laetus méruit beátas Scándere sedes\\" on the day of the confessor's death, otherwise it was changed to \\"Hac die laetus méruit suprémos Laudis honóres.\\" This decree became known as the \\"mutator tertius versus.\\" In 1955, reforms to the rubrics of the Breviary and Calendar removed the decree and kept the latter text, ie. \\"méruit suprémos Laudis honóres.\\" Iste confessor Domini colentes > 1 Iste confessor Domini colentes Quem pie laudant populi per orbem: Hac die > lætus meruit beatas Scandere sedes. [If it is not the day of his death, the > last line is changed to:] Hac die lætus meruit supremos Laudis honores. 2 > Qui pius, prudens, humilis, pudicus, Sobriam duxit sine labe vitam, Donec > humanos animavit auræ Spiritus artus. 3 Cuius ob præstans meritum > frequenter, Ægra quæ passim iacuere membra, Viribus morbi domitis, saluti > Restituuntur. 4 Noster hinc illi chorus obsequentem Concinit laudem, > celebresque palmas; Ut piis eius precibus iuvemur Omne per ævum. 5 Sit salus > illi, decus, atque virtus, Qui super cæli solio coruscans, Totius mundi > seriem gubernat Trinus et unus.

Plot Test pilot Paul Redmond (Richard Dix) was dishonorably discharged from the United States Marines, and needed a second chance. When he encounters Martha Dawson (Karen Morley), the daughter of an aircraft manufacturer, by chance on an airliner, he also meets Martha's father, Colonel E. J. Dawson (Boyd Irwin) and her fiancé, Dana Kirk (Lloyd Nolan). Colonel Dawson owns Dawson Aircraft Corporation, building aircraft for the U.S. Army Air Corps. Dana and Paul are old friends and, subsequently Dana hires his friend as a new test pilot for Dawson Aircraft. During a test flight, Paul establishes a new speed record, but crash-lands. When her father dies, Martha and her brother, Ritchie (William Stelling), who is also a test pilot, take over the company operations. During continuing test flights, many of the company's pilots are killed or injured. Ritchie is emotionally affected by the crashes, and, on the eve of his test flight, he commits suicide. Paul covers up Ritchie's suicide by flying the body in a test aircraft, setting the aircraft on fire, and parachuting out. The investigation into the first accident that Paul caused, reveals he was discharged from the Marines for bailing out on a student flyer. The company test pilots suspect Paul did the same thing to Ritchie. Martha wants to close the company but one last test flight can still save Dawson Aircraft Corporation. Later, Paul learns that Dana is scheduled to perform a dangerous flight test and trying to vindicate himself, Paul knocks him unconscious and performs the test himself. Watched by Army Major T. L. Metcalf (Thurston Hall), Paul wins the Air Corps contract with his flying. Test pilot Jim Barlow (Gene Morgan) tells Dana how Paul covered up Ritchie's suicide. Martha learns that Paul had flown the tests that won the Army contract. With the truth revealed, Barlow unites Martha and Paul by skywriting, \\"Paul, come back to Marty!\\" Cast * Richard Dix as Paul Redmond * Karen Morley as Martha Dawson * Lloyd Nolan as Dana Kirk * Shirley Ross as Eunice * Henry Mollison as Austin Forrester * Gene Morgan as Jim Barlow * Gordon Jones as Tex * William Stelling as Ritchie Dawson * Thurston Hall as Major Metcalf * Gertrude Green as Lulu * Boyd Irwin as Col.

The controversy stems from the June 19 detention of two staffers of President Boris Yeltsin's reelection campaign outside of the Russian White House. Security agents discovered $500,000 in a Xerox (from which the scandal takes it name) copy- paper box that was being carried by one of the men.Boris Yeltsin Bio, Engology.com It was soon discovered that the staffers had been arrested and interrogated at the behest of Mikhail Barsukov and Alexander Korzhakov, both of whom were members of Yeltsin's campaign organization and presidential administration. The scandal, which occurred only two days after the conclusion of the initial round of the Russian presidential election (and approximately two weeks before the second round), resulted in the dismissal of Korzhakov and Barsukov from their roles in Yeltsin's presidential administration and campaign organization, as well as the dismissal of their political ally, Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. Background The scandal occurred while Boris Yeltsin was running for reelection as the president of Russia. The initial round of the election had occurred on June 16, with both Yeltsin and Gennady Zyuganov advancing to the second round (a runoff was necessitated by the failure of any candidate to receive a majority of the first-round vote). The second round was scheduled to be held on July 3. Oleg Soskovets had drafted Yeltsin's original, abandoned, campaign strategy, and had originally been in charge of Yeltsin's campaign, overseeing a management team which had Korzhakov and Barsukov functioning as his deputies By the spring of 1996, Soskovets' leadership of the campaign had begun to dissipate. This culminated in March with the creation of a \\"campaign council\\", which usurped much of the role Soskovets' management team had held in controlling the campaign, followed shortly thereafter with the firing of Soskovets as campaign chairman. These developments meant that the nationalist leaning management team Soskovets had overseen was replaced by a liberal-leaning \\"campaign council\\" and Soskovets, a hardline nationalist, was replaced as campaign chairman by Anatoly Chubais, an avid reformer. This meant the official abandonment of the campaign strategy which Soskovets had crafted. While Soskovets was no longer in charge of the campaign, his allies Korzhakov, and Barsukov remained a part of the campaign, both serving as members of the \\"campaign council\\". However, dissatisfied with the new direction of the campaign, they, in tandem with Soskovets, came into conflict with the new leaders of the campaign. Arrest and initial scandal Staffers were detained while leaving the Russian White House On June 19, at the behest of Korzhakov and Barsukov, security guards detained Sergey Lisovsky (the general director of the company ORT-advertising) and Arkady Evstafiev (an assistant to Chubais) while the two were leaving the Russian White House. The security agents discovered $500,000 in a Xerox copy-paper box that was being carried by one of the men.$15 млн в коробке из-под ксерокса // Власть. — № 24 (527). — 23.06.2003. As a result of this discovery, and at the further behest of Barsukov and Korzhakov, the men were then arrested and interrogated. The motivation of Barsukov and Korzhakov for orchestrating the arrests had likely been Korzhakov's resentment towards campaign manager Antoly Chubais. Korzhakov had been a key individual urging Yeltsin to postpone the election. He had earlier caused a media frenzy in early May by publicly asserting the opinion that Yeltsin should postpone the election. Distrusting and disagreeing with Chubais, Korzhakov and the others were likely attempting to smear Chubais in Yeltsin's eyes, hoping for him to fall out of favor. The arrest and the involvement of Barsukov and Kozhakov was reported within hours by television networks. The main controversy which erupted surrounded the corrupt actions of Barsukov and Korzhakov in orchestrating the arrests in an apparent effort to discredit Chubais. Controversy also arose from discovery of the $500,000, as it raised suspicions of fraudulent finances being conducted by Yeltsin's campaign. Immediate aftermath On June 20 Yeltsin fired Korzhakov and Barsukov, as well as their political ally Soskovets, from their roles in his presidential administration and campaign. Yeltsin alleged that the three of them had been interfering in his reelection campaign. Korzhakov and Barsukov were also fired from their roles in Yeltsin's campaign. In the immediate aftermath of the scandal Chubais and Alexander Lebed managed to quickly persuade Yeltsin into believing that he would lose the election if he kept the three in his administration. Yeltsin desired to distance himself from any corruption investigation that might arise from the event, and therefore had obliged to their firings. Financial fraud allegations stemming from the incident The discovery of $500,000 raised suspicions of fraudulent finances on the part of the Yeltsin campaign. Chubais publicly proclaimed that such allegations were merely the work of political adversaries. However, he privately conspired to cover-up any evidence of illegal transactions. Criminal investigation On July 19, 1996 the Chief Military Prosecutor's office opened a criminal investigation into illegal currency transactions. The investigation was closed in April 1997,Чем прославился Аркадий Евстафьев // Коммерсантъ. — № 101(3185). — 6 июня 2005. was reopened in January 1999, and finally closed in May 1999.Уроки демократии и права для России Нового Времени (к годовщине расстрела Белого Дома) . // Петербургская газета. — 18 сентября 2013.Генпрокуратура закрыла дело о коробке из-под ксерокса . lenta.ru, 02.12.1999.

Also, the remains of the skull show damage to the right eye caused by the penetration of an object (historically recorded to be an arrow).See John Prag and Richard Neave's report in Making Faces: Using Forensic and Archaeological Evidence, published for the Trustees of the British Museum by the British Museum Press, London: 1997. A study of the bones published in 2015 indicates that Philip was buried in Tomb I, not Tomb II. On the basis of age, knee ankylosis and a hole matching the penetrating wound and lameness suffered by Philip, the authors of the study identified the remains of Tomb I in Vergina as those of Philip II. Tomb II instead was identified in the study as that of King Arrhidaeus and his wife Eurydice II. However this latter theory had previously been shown to be false. More recent research gives further evidence that Tomb II contains the remains of Philip II.New Finds from the Cremains in Tomb II at Aegae Point to Philip II and a Scythian Princess, T. G.

Adcock (born April 1968) is Republican who served in the North Carolina General Assembly representing House District 37 in Wake County. He was appointed in September 2018 and was defeated in the subsequent election by Democrat Sydney Batch.  Background and professional experience  Adcock is a lifelong resident of Southern Wake County and graduated from Fuquay-Varina High School. He received a BA in Community & Regional Planning/Geography from Appalachian State University and then went on to receive his Masters in International Relations from the Catholic University of America and his JD from the University of Memphis. Adock is a practicing lawyer in Fuquay-Varina specializing in real estate, civil litigation, estate planning, and land use and zoning issues. Adcock is the manager of three separate LLCs including two real estate holding companies: ADARA Properties (a real estate holding company), Adcock & Adcock LLC, Adcock Hector Creek Farm LLC. Adcock is a member of three chambers of commerce (Fuquay-Varina, Holly Springs, and Apex). He is a registered Republican and has voted consistently in Wake County since 2000.  Political career   2016 campaign for Wake County Commissioner  His first bid for elected office occurred in 2016 when he ran for county commissioner in “super” district B; however, the district was ruled unconstitutional in July by the 4th US district court. Adcock won the GOP primary nomination against former commissioner Phil Matthews after saying he would be more willing to work with Democrats. He also identified himself as a \\"fresh and positive conservative voice\\" for Wake County. According to the Raleigh News & Observer, Adcock was a \\"relative unknown in political circles.\\" Adcock identified raising teacher pay for teachers with advanced degrees and better equipping roads for growth as key issues when he filed to run for Wake County commissioner. He noted during the campaign, \\"I am a strong proponent for raising teachers' salaries to national standards and for providing incentives for teachers to seek advanced degrees.\\" However, he opposed a 3.65-cent-per-$100 increase in the property tax rate to raise teacher pay. Instead, he preferred that school systems redirect funds from central administration to teachers. When asked how he would combat economic inequality in Raleigh, Adcock said he would promote \\"economic development that provides quality employment opportunities.\\" In the same interview, he described himself as a \\"strong advocate for the taxpayer,\\" adding that \\"one of the most important duties of our elected officials is prudent stewardships of the tax payers' dollars.\\" Additionally, Adcock identified transportation as one of the biggest issues facing Wake County revolving around the impact of major growth. He campaigned on improving roads and cited \\"horrendous\\" traffic. However, Adcock later opposed the Wake transit plan, saying it would \\"only serve the more urban areas of our county.\\" He explicitly stated that he did not support the transit plan or the tax increase to fund it. When asked how he would combat illegal drugs in Wake County, Adcock said he had \\"upmost confidence in Sheriff Donnie Harrison.\\" Donnie Harrison's Sheriff Department had previously fallen under scrutiny for keeping a corvette seized in a drug raid. After the election, when the 3rd District Court ruled that the “super-districts” in Wake County were unconstitutional, Adcock expressed disappointment at the ruling and later published an op-ed in the News & Observer advocating for a combination of countywide and district-only elections for County Commissioner. He also said he disagreed with the proposition of returning to the 2011 maps.  2018 campaign for North Carolina House District 37  Adcock announced he would run for HD37 after Rep. Linda Hunt Williams announced that she would not seek re-election. Adcock ran against Sydney Batch. His campaign for county commissioner funded his campaign for HD37. He lost to Batch by very close margin of 50 percent to 48 percent.

The farthest end of Hollywood Boulevard, opposite the entrance, stands a full-scale replica of the Grauman's Chinese Theatre, although Disney couldn't get the rights to use the name \\"Grauman's\\", calling it merely the Chinese Theater.

Hollywood Boulevard is designed to resemble the idealized 1920s star-studded streets of Los Angeles. The street features a Warner-ized version of the Hollywood Walk of Fame, instead of the names being in stars like they are traditionally, on Hollywood Boulevard at Parque Warner Madrid the names appear in the WB Shield. Unlike Disney's, Warner Bros.'s Hollywood Boulevard doesn't imitate actual buildings in Los Angeles rather draws on the aesthetics of the era and makes them their own. The only building similar between both Hollywood Boulevard's are the Chinese Theater. Whereas Disney's is a full scale reproduction, it can easily be seen that Warner Brothers's is not, but instead is drawing on the aesthetics of the original. Another difference is instead of Parque Warner's Chinese theater being distinct at the end of the Boulevard, instead it is tucked away on the path much like the original in Los Angeles. The end of Hollywood Boulevard is dominated by the nearly 400-feet tall drop tower The Revenge of the Enigma.

She is considered the 1st First Lady of Bolivia. Biography Carcelén was born outside of Quito, in the Real Audiencia of Quito of the Spanish Empire. She was the daughter of Felipe Carcelén y Sánchez de Orellana, 6th Marquess of Villarocha, Captain general of San Francisco Borja, and his wife, Teresa de Larrea y Jijón. Her father was a vocal participant in the first government junta of Quito in 1809. Marriage to Antonio José de Sucre Carcelén first encountered Sucre in the city of Quito on 24 May 1822, after the Battle of Pichincha. During the battle, she and her family took refuge in the convent of the Church of Santo Domingo. Upon hearing the celebration of the troops, the family exited the front of the church to watch the procession. When he saw Carcelén, Sucre dismounted his horse, introduced himself to her family, and reassured them that it was safe to return to their home. Before his death in 1823, the Marquess went to visit Sucre in Quito to offer Carcelén, his heiress, in marriage. Although Sucre accepted the courtship, he continued to dedicate himself to the war against Spain, and he and Carcelén exchanged letters for several years. The pair married on 20 April 1828, however because Sucre was the President of Bolivia, General Vicente Aguirre was present during the ceremony as Sucre's representative. Aguirre also visited the Carcelén Mansion, where Sucre and Carcelén would live, and informed Sucre of its condition, as well as oversaw its redecoration. After the marriage, Carcelén became the 1st First Lady of Bolivia, a position she would hold for 8 days until Sucre resigned on 28 April 1828. Sucre returned to Quito on 30 September 1828, and the pair moved into the Carcelén Mansion. Ten months later the Marquise gave birth to their first daughter, María Teresa de Sucre y Carcelén de Guevara. Assassination of Sucre In 1829 Sucre received the order to return to Bogota to preside over the Congress of Gran Colombia in an attempt to avoid its dissolution. He was assassinated in the Berruecos mountains on 4 June 1830. Carcelén learned of his death 2 weeks later and penned a letter to General José María Obando, accusing him of having plotted her husband's murder. Second Marriage On 16 July 1831, Carcelén married a second time to the Colombian general Isidoro Barriga y López de Castro, who had fought alongside Sucre during a campaign in Peru. This was a controversial decision; the custom at the time was for a widow to wait 5 years before remarrying out of respect for the deceased husband. On 16 November 1831, several months after the marriage, Barriga was playing with Teresa, the daughter of Sucre and Carcelén, in his arms, when she fell to the patio, hitting her head and dying instantly. Although there was some speculation that her death was intentional, most historians believe it was a tragic accident, citing Barriga's reputation as a kind and generous man, rather than bloodthirsty. Yet other historians believe that Teresa did not die in an accident at all, and instead succumbed to a stomach virus, a common cause of death in children her age during that time. In 1832, Carcelén gave birth to Manuel Felipe Barriga y Carcelén de Guevara, her only child from the marriage. Barriga died 29 May 1850. Third Marriage One year after the death of Barriga, Carcelén married a third time to José Baltazar Carrión Torres, a lawyer native to Loja. They had one child, Mercedes Soledad Carrión y Carcelén de Guevara, who did not make it to adulthood, likely due to problems related to the advanced age of her mother. Final Years and Death Felipe, Carcelén's only surviving child, married Josefina Flores Jijón, daughter of General Juan José Flores. Carcelén believed that General Flores had played a part in the murder of her first husband, and her relationship with her son suffered as a result of his marriage. Carcelén died on 15 December 1861 at the age of 56, and was buried in Quito. She was mourned throughout the city, where she was well-known for her charity towards the poor.

Active for five decades, much of his work was architectural in style. Biography Façade of the Théâtre Rive Gauche in Paris decorated by Clayette in 1994 Born in Paris in 1930, after high school Clayette attended the Académie Julian where he studied under Jules Cavaillès. On leaving the Académie he was recruited by Cassandre to work in his studio. Clayette's first known professional work was in the mid 1950s. From 1960 he explored a different artistic theme each year, exhibiting virtually continuously each year successively until the early 1990s at the Galerie Charpentier, the Galerie Roger Dulac, the Galerie Emmanuel David and the Galerie Proscenium. At the same time, he collaborated with the magazine Planète as a draftsman, and illustrated the covers or the text of books including the works of Shakespeare (including the series New Penguin Shakespeare), Goethe, Rimbaud, Kafka, etc. In the early 1960s, dramatist Jean Anouilh introduced Clayette to the stage actor and director Jean Le Poulain as \\"A painter of the waking dream\\".Jean Le Poulain, Pierre Clayette, Paris, Phantasmes, Graphedis Publishing, 1989 For Planète he illustrated the poems of Victor Hugo; Gégory Gutierez, 'The speech of the fantastic realism: the magazine \\"Planère\\" ' , University of Sorbonne - Paris IV, UFR of French language, university year 1997-1998 he also illustrated the works of H. P. Lovecraft and Jorge Luis Borges in the Fantasy Realism style. However, like many artists who at one point in their career were associated with the movement such as Pierre-Yves Trémois, Clayette's pictorial production did not stop at the themes of Fantasy Realism.Jean-Claude Guilbert, Fantastic Realism - Forty European Painters of the Imaginary , Opta Publishing, 1973. Although the unusual is a constant of his work, it draws its references in many artistic currents including Romanticism, Baroque, Symbolism, etc. Clayette died in Colombes in France in 2005 aged 75.

Works Scenography (Sets and Costumes) By his own admission,\\"The Avant-scène Theater\\", No. 523, August 1973. Pierre Clayette was interested in scenography and theater design before even considering painting. The influence of Cassandre is evident in an artist who was one of the last representatives of the period between the 1920s and the late 1970s during which theater and opera directors often appeal to leading artists in the world of painting.\\"Letter from the Academy of Fine Arts of the Institut de France\\", No. 62, Fall 2010. As such, Clayette is part of a lineage that included, among others, André Derain, Balthus, Christian Berard, George Wakhevich, Cassandre and Andre Masson. Clayette entered the world of scenography in 1955 for a ballet by Daniel Wayenberg with Pierre Lacotte who entrusted him with his first set of sets. Clayette became famous among the great names of lyric and dramatic scenes, such as Maurice Béjart, Pierre Lacotte, Gabriel Dussurget, Maurice Escande and Jean Le Poulain, maintaining a long involvement with the latter until Poulain's death in 1988. Clayette's talent as a stage designer gave him the opportunity to express himself on the most prestigious stages, such as the Comédie-Française, the Palais Garnier and the International Festival of Lyric Art in Aix-en-Provence.Pierre Clayette - Brief biography on 'Les Atamanes' Scenographic creations *1955 - Solstice - Chor.

She is Chair for Bristol's Race Equality Commission. Previously she was a Professor of History at Bath Spa University. She is an expert on the links between history, memory, and geopolitics in relation to French and British colonial pasts. She is the first black woman to be appointed to a professorial chair in history in the United Kingdom. She is the author of Histoire de l'esclavage transatlantique britannique and Afro- Europeans: A Short History.  Early life and education  Otele was born in Cameroon and grew up in Paris, France. She is of Cameroonian heritage. Otele studied at the Sorbonne University, working on European colonial and post- colonial history. She completed her Bachelor of Arts degree in literature in 1998, and her Master of Arts degree in 2000. She received her Doctor of Philosophy degree in 2005 for a doctoral thesis entitled Mémoire et politique : l'enrichissement de Bristol par le commerce triangulaire, objet de polémique. Her dissertation looked at the city of Bristol's role in the trans- Atlantic slave trade. She describes her motivation for studying history as \\"this urge related to social justice. I wanted to understand the root of racism and discrimination – this idea of hating someone for something they are not responsible for, something that is incredibly random.\\" She believes the most important thing history has ever taught her is kindness. Her greatest influence is the Congolese historian Elikia M'Bokolo. She says the book that has had the greatest impact on her is Nations nègres et culture by Cheikh Anta Diop. Otele speaks French, English, some German, and three Cameroonian languages, Ewondo, Eton and Bulu.  Career  After completing her doctoral studies, Otele was made an associate professor at Université Paris XIII. She was appointed as a senior lecturer at Bath Spa University in 2013. She has written about cultural and collective memory and the memorialisation of the past. She analyses the legacies of European colonisation in post-slavery societies. She has published academic articles about Afro-European identities, including \\"Frenchness\\", British identities in Wales, and what it meant to be British, Welsh, and black. In 2018, at the age of 48, Otele became the first black woman to be made Professor of History in the United Kingdom. She acknowledged that her promotion to the professoriate took longer because she has caring responsibilities as a mother to two children and because she is a woman of colour. The Race, Ethnicity & Equality Report published by the Royal Historical Society in October 2018 found that only 0.5 per cent of historians working in UK universities are black. Until Otele's promotion there had never been a black woman Professor of History in the UK. Otele hopes that her appointment will 'open the door for many hard-working women, especially black women in academia'. On her promotion Otele commented that \\"any success that is used only to improve one's own life is a waste of possibilities. That is why being the first black female history professor does not mean anything to me if I'm not given and can't find means to bring others up.\\" Otele highlighted the difficulties she encountered in becoming a professor: \\"I've worked very hard and kept pushing and had a family...It's hard. I'm tired. It's bleak.\\" The Vice-Chancellor of Bath Spa University, Sue Rigby, described Otele as \\"world- class and internationally respected\\". Otele announced her promotion from her active Twitter account. Otele has participated in several major research grants looking at the African diaspora. She looks at the way the societies of Britain and France address citizenship. She has studied the Atlantic slave trade. Otele was the Principal Investigator for the project People of African Descent in the 21st Century: Knowledge and Cultural Production in Reluctant Sites of Memory, which received £24,022 in funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council. The project ran from May 2017 to November 2018. Otele is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (FRHistS), and a board member of Historians Against Slavery. She is an executive board member for The British Society for the Eighteenth-Century Studies, a member of the Association for Cultural Studies, and a member of the Centre international de recherches sur les esclavages. She also sits on the board of the National Archives Trust and is on V&A; Museum’s research committee. Otele has written for the BBC's HistoryExtra, The Conversation and Times Higher Education. She has written and contributed to several books. Her book, Afro-Europeans: a Short History, is scheduled for publication in 2020 with Hurst Publishers. Her second book, Post-Conflict Memorialization: Missing Memorials, Absent Bodies, is due in 2019 with Palgrave Macmillan. She has participated in programmes on BBC Radio 4. and Dan Snow's History Hit podcast. She is part of the John Blanke Project, a collaboration of artists and historians celebrating black Tudors. Otele spoke at the 2018 Winchester History Weekend, How Africans Changed Early Modern Europe. She considered outstanding Africans and Europeans who are not otherwise remembered in popular history books. It was announced in late October 2019 that Otele had been appointed as the first Professor of the History of Slavery at Bristol University. She assumed her post in January 2020, and began a two-year research project to examine Bristol's connection to the transatlantic slave trade. It is anticipated her study will become \\"a landmark in the way Britain examines, acknowledges and teaches the history of enslavement.\\" In June 2020 Otele was appointed as independent Chair of Bristol's Commission on Race Equality, which is an unpaid role.  Recognition  Otele was named on the BBC 100 Women 2018 List. She appears at number 69, alongside Abisoye Ajayi-Akinfolarin, Nimco Ali, and Uma Devi Badi. Otele gave the keynote address at the Social History Society Annual Conference, University of Lincoln, 11 June 2019. In May 2019 she was elected to Vice- President of the Royal Historical Society. In 2020, Otele was listed by Prospect as the sixth-greatest thinker for the COVID-19 era.

Purvis was a black inventor and businessman who received multiple patents in the late 1800s. His inventions included an updated fountain pen design, improvement to the hand stamp, and a close-conduit electric railway system.  Major inventions  thumb  Fountain pen  According to Purvis, his updated design of the fountain pen was intended to provide a simple, durable, and cheaper construction so the pen could be carried in someone's pocket. Purvis set an elastic tube between the pen nib and the ink reservoir, enabling the tube to return the excess ink to the reservoir. After this improvement, the new pen could evenly distribute the ink when being used. For this design, Purvis received U.S. Patent 419,065 on January 7, 1890.  Close-conduit electric railway system  First installed in New Jersey, Purvis's close-conduit electric railway system set an electromagnet under the center of the railcar. The closed conduit construction was made by insulating material, and installing many soft iron cables on its surface. The cable was attracted upwardly against the top of the space in which it lay, making contact with a brass strip. According to the Dr. John MacFayden, the superintendent of the Installation, the new system was safer and cheaper than the old system, and he believed the new system would replace the old one in the near future.  Improvement to the hand stamp  Purvis's first patent, in 1883, was an improvement of the hand stamp that enabled it to replenish its own ink.

A genetic study showed that is closely related to Prunus bucharica, P. webbii and P. kotschyi, and a full genetic and morphological analysis shows that its closest relative is Prunus bucharica.http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/record/rjp-25579 References kuramica Category:Flora of Pakistan Category:Flora of Afghanistan Category:Plants described in 1960 ","title":"Prunus kuramica"},{"id":"58879981","text":"Nancy Gooch (1811 – September 17, 1901) was an early African-American settler in California and one of the state's most successful 19th-century black female landowners. Gooch gained her freedom when her master moved her and her husband, Peter Gooch, to California from Missouri, where she began to save up money she eventually put into owning land.  From Maryland to California  Nancy Gooch was born a free person in Maryland in 1811 (although it varies based on the census year, her gravestone says 1811). Later on, she became a slave when she moved to Missouri. After working in the fields for a few years in Missouri, Gooch, alongside her husband Peter, were moved to California by their master, William Gooch. However, left behind was Gooch's three-year-old son Andrew, who later on was purchased by a family in Missouri called the Monroe's. Once the Gooch's got to California and gained their freedom, Nancy began to do laundry and other domestic chores for the miners in California. She also lived in a small shack that barely cost her any money, this way, she could begin to gather up enough money to buy her son's freedom. Throughout their entire journey, both Nancy and Peter had one thing in mind, and that was to get their son to California. Peter died in 1861. But, Nancy kept working, and while by the time she had amassed the seven hundred dollars, slavery had been abolished, she was still able to pay for her sons' family to move to California in 1868, and continue to grow the land she had bought with her husband.  Notoriety  Nancy Gooch was one of the first African-American women to succeed in California. Gooch and her husband got to Coloma, California, in 1849, and by 1850 began working at the gold-mining location. While doing domestic chores for the miners, the couple earned enough money to buy 80 acres of land in 1858, a year after they were wed. Eventually, these 80 acres grew into 320 acres, including land at the gold discovery site at Sutter's Mill. The couple also had a good relationship with someone else who worked at Sutter's Mill, James Marshall. Marshall is credited with reporting the finding of gold in California in 1848. California took some of the Monroe's landholdings from Andrew Monroe's son, which included the original site of Sutter's Mill and the site of Marshall's gold discovery. That land is now the foundation of the Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, and the entire Monroe/Gooch family is buried in the park's pioneer cemetery.

Waterford’ (http://www.workhouses.org.uk/Waterford/) (19 Oct. 2018)  History  The Waterford Poor Law Union was established under the Poor Law Union Act in 1838, and covered an area of 230 square miles. During this period in Ireland, the country was divided into Poor Law Unions which each had a workhouse. The establishment of workhouses in Poor Law Unions assured that only those in the deepest of destitution could avail of ‘indoor relief’. ‘Waterford Poor Law Union’ (http://www.waterfordcouncil.ie/media/archives/WATERFORD%20POOR%20LAW%20UNION.pdf) (22 Oct. 2018) The Waterford Union Workhouse was designed by George Wilkinson, and was constructed at a cost of £7,850, to hold 900 inmates. The workhouse in Waterford City was constructed to serve a ‘Union’ area made up of East Waterford and South Kilkenny.Rita Byrne, ‘The Workhouse in Waterford City, 1847-49’ in Des Cowman and Donald Brady (eds), The Famine in Waterford: Teacht na Bprátaí Dubha (Dublin, 1995), pp 119–136. The workhouse was declared fit for the admission of paupers on 15 March 1841, and the first inmates entered the workhouse on 20 April.‘Waterford, Co. Waterford’ (http://www.workhouses.org.uk/Waterford/) (19 Oct. 2018) By November 1846, the capacity at the Waterford Union Workhouse was almost full.Christine Kinealy, This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845-52. Dublin, 1994. A statement dating from 1 May 1847 shows the amount of workhouse accommodation in Ireland. The statement claims that the Waterford Union Workhouse was originally designed for 900 inmates, but that additional sleeping galleries and sheds had been provided for 200 inmates.John O’Connor, The Workhouses of Ireland: The Fate of Ireland’s Poor. Dublin, 1995 The workhouse took advantage of two institutions which were located nearby, the Waterford County and City Infirmary and the Fever Hospital.‘Waterford, Co. Waterford’ (http://www.workhouses.org.uk/Waterford/) (19 Oct. 2018) In January 1847, permission was granted to develop the workhouse, which included a hospital.  Life at the Waterford Union Workhouse  The Waterford Union Workhouse is described as a place of great destitution and misery. It was said at the time that paupers avoided the Waterford workhouse, and instead opted for the New Ross or Dungarvan workhouse. By 1848, the workhouse was overcrowded, and disease was rife. The Waterford Mail reported on 5 April 1848 that the workhouse was \\"Crowded to suffication. Sixty four died during the last fortnight; they were dying like rotten sheep\\". Waterford Mail, 5 February 1848 On arrival to the Waterford Union Workhouse, applicants were ‘tested’ by a committee made up of a relieving officer and two guardians to judge their destitution. If applicants passed the criteria for admittance, they were stripped and given workhouse clothes. Only mothers who were nursing were allowed to keep their infants. Work was required of adults who were deemed capable of it. According to a report of the Waterford Union Workhouse by Inspector Burke, it proved more difficult for men to be resourcefully employed at the workhouse. Burke writes some male inmates could be found wandering around the town, and the majority were in a shed in the men’s yard which was overcrowded. Two schools were provided for children in the Waterford Union Workhouse. The Relief Commission Papers for July 1847 state that the boys' school at the Waterford Union Workhouse is well constructed,Relief Commission Papers 1845-7, 8 Feb. 1847 however, the female school is not the same degree of efficiency and no rolls have been kept by the schoolmistress. Disciplinary actions towards inmates at the Waterford Union Workhouse are recorded as being conducted through the implementing of a restricted diet. Those who misbehaved were given three meals of bread a day for three days, which were to be eaten in isolation.  Waterford Union Workhouse post famine  The medical care of the Waterford Union Workhouse was passed over to the responsibility of the religious order, the Sisters of Mercy in September 1876. The workhouse became St. Patrick’s County Hospital following the creation of the Irish Free State in 1921. From 1921, poor relief was relocated to the County Home in Dungarvan in West Waterford. Since 1958, St. Patrick's County Hospital has been focused on geriatric care.‘Waterford, Co.

The pavilions were designed by NSW Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon in consultation with Mansfield Brothers and built from 1901 to 1904. They was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Albert and Victoria Pavilions were designed as mirror-reverse twin pavilions attached to either side of the Administration Building, Albert for Males and Victoria for Females. They completed the original pavilion plan though their detailed design was contemporary. They were built to commemorate the death of Queen Victoria and were funded by donations. The two Pavilions were built 1901–1904 to a design by the Government Architect in consultation with Mansfield Brothers. The original design is shown on drawings PH213/142, 164 which are signed by W. L. Vernon as Government Architect and by George Oakeshott. The foundation stone was laid by the Duke of York, the future King George V. There is reputed to have been a competition between public and private sectors in the completion on these buildings but this has not been substantiated. The building was originally built as long wards with a central section for nurses, etc. This section projected at the rear (east) forming another wing accommodation, a special ward on the ground floor, and operating theatre on the first, incorporating a lift and stair. Access was by arcaded balcony on the eastern side. Toilet blocks were located at both ends of the pavilion separated by air locks which included a 'dumbwaiter' type lift and a sink. Subsequent alterations included the enclosure of the balconies to form corridors and some sub-division of the wards. In 1907 the operating theatres were completed incorporating the latest design and technology. An undated drawing PH213/48 shows alterations to the operating theatre. The interior is shown in an early photograph. Due to insufficient funds some wards remained closed for some years and nurses were accommodated on the top floor. In 1914 the top two floors were used as accommodation for nurses. Between 1918 and 1926, returned soldiers were accommodated on these floors and the Department of Defence funded and equipped the wards. There have been various subsequent alterations and additions, particularly on the eastern and southern sides. part of the original building was demolished in 1935 to build the Fairfax Institute of Pathology fronting Missenden Road. In 1937 a new X-ray department was established in a single storey brick, flat roofed addition at the rear of the Victoria Pavilion. In 1956 lifts were installed in the building. In 1966 there were further additions to accommodate new equipment including additional storey on the 1937 additions. There were further additions to the rear of these buildings recently to accommodate a medical imaging facility (MRI). The main wing has been converted to offices and the large wards subdivided.  Description  Albert Pavilion Albert Pavilion is located on the northern side of the Administration Block. The original building consists of three levels above a basement, matching that of the Administration Blocks. It is a load bearing brick structure with concrete floors on steel beams and with a terracotta tiled roof. There is a single storey \\"L\\" shaped brick and fibro annex and new concrete and steel additions. The original drawings note the floor as terracotta lumber, balcony and bathrooms with silicate paving on Monier and location of wall vents is noted in detail. Albert Pavilion is in the Federation Free Classical style, and is symmetrical about the projected bay of the central wing which is surmounted by a pediment bearing a copper clad statue of Prince Albert. It is fenestrated by regular banks of shuttered windows. The walls are of high quality red brickwork with stone dressing to sills string courses and the pediment, etc. the central bay and north ends have 'blood and bandages' detailing to the lower levels. Additions are described above and are largely insubstantial and insignificant structures. Most recent is the light weight metal structure forming the ambulance entry on the west (Missenden Road) side and a single and two storey concrete and steel addition on the east side near the Administration Building. Victoria Pavilion Victoria Pavilion is located on the southern side of the Administration Block. The original building consists of three levels above a basement, matching that of the Administration Blocks. There are later date additions to the original building including the 1935 Fairfax Institute of Pathology, the 1969 Haematology Department. The original Victoria Pavilion is a load bearing brick structure with concrete floors on steel beam and with terracotta tiled hip roof. It is in the Federation Free Classical style, and is symmetrical about the pedimented bay of the central wing. There are regular banks of shuttered windows. The walls are of high quality red brick works with stone dressings. The building was originally built as long wards with a central wing for nurses. Access was by arcaded balcony on the eastern side. Toilet blocks were located at both ends of the pavilion separated by air locks which included a \\"dumb waiter\\" type lift and a sink. later balconies were closed to form corridors and wards subdivided. The 1935 four storey extension is a steel and concrete framed structure with brick cladding and stone dressing and slate roof to match the original building. the 1969 addition at the rear of the original building is a two-storey brick structure with a concrete floor and flat roof. The Victoria Pavilion and its later addition appear to be in reasonable condition except for damage from rusting arch bars on the southern wall. Despite substantial additions and internal alterations elements of original design survive such as stairs, toilet towers and external features. Significance Both pavilions are of high significance for the following values: * an integral part of the early development of RPA Hospital * a surviving element of the original, symmetrical, master plan for the hospital * the surviving facades and roof form are finely detailed examples of Federation architecture * together with the Administration Building, the group has an important landmark quality as one of the most imposing facades in Sydney * the relationship of built form and landscaping to Missenden Road is very important to the streetscape * as a major surviving work executed under the Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon  Heritage listing  The Victoria and Albert Pavilions form part of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Precinct which is of high historical and architectural significance. These substantial buildings have high streetscape value. Victoria & Albert Pavilions, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Numbers Over the subsequent decade until the exam was last held in 1878, over 264 candidates took the exam, some of whom were re-takes or additional qualifications meaning that the actual number of individual women who participated was somewhat lower than 264. Of these 139 passed, of whom 53 passed with honours. Of the 139: * 44 were pupils of Cheltenham Ladies College * 40 prepared by private study or tuition * 28 were pupils of the North London Collegiate School * 27 attended other schools and institutions. In 1878, there were 42 candidates of whom 24 passed. Legacy The certificate ceased to be offered from 1878 as it provided evidence that there was no necessity to examine men and women separately. Women were allowed to study for University of London degrees from that year and the women-only colleges of Westfield and Royal Holloway were founded in 1882 and 1886 respectively. In 1895, 10% of the university's graduates were women, and 30% by 1900.

It was designed by George Allen Mansfield of Mansfield Brothers and built from 1876 to 1882. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  A public meeting in Sydney on 20 March 1868 resolved to build a new hospital to commemorate the recovery of Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, following his attempted assassination by Henry O'Farrell at Clontarf on 12 March. The Parliament of New South Wales passed an Act to incorporate Prince Alfred Hospital on 3 April 1873 and appointed Mansfield Brothers as architects. The first building erected was a cottage, later the gardener's cottage, near the southern entrance from Missenden Road. Construction started on the Administration Building and C and D Pavilions in 1876. The gardens were established at this time with assistance from the staff of the Botanical Gardens. The Hospital was opened in 1882. On opening, the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital cost 495 pounds per bed, compared to the Sydney Hospital's 379 pounds per bed. The rear wing was removed 1980. The major public spaces were redecorated 1986 as part of the alterations made in building E block; the architects for this work were McConnell, Smith and Johnson P/L.  Description  The entrance is located on a central axis. Originally the plan was \\"H\\" pattern. The eastern position of the building was demolished to construct the Duke of Edinburgh building, leaving only the front part of the block together with the central hall extending into the newer building. The building is Victorian Free Classical in style, built symmetrically about a three-storey portico. Built with a cream brick façade and sandstone embellishments, with red bricks emphasising the ground floor arched openings. The entrance portico has grey granite columns. The roof covering was originally slate, but is now terracotta tiling. Within the ground floor is a vast lobby, with marble flooring, elaborate plaster work to both walls and ceiling and several very fine stained glass windows, depicting the Royal Coat of Arms, Queen Victoria, Caritas etc. The rear of the lobby has a pressed metal ceiling and a \\"Lyncrusta\\" Art Nouveau dado. The southern side hall has a floor of very fine High Victorian tiles, probably the whole lobby floor was originally to this pattern.  Heritage listing  The Administration Block, both internally and externally, is an item of exceptional significance. It is a major surviving item of the original hospital; the historic core that has been in continuous use. The building is a fine example of the work of George Allen Mansfield, first president of the Institute of Architects. The three surviving facades and roof form are a finely detailed example of Victorian architecture. Together with the Victoria & Albert Pavilions, the group has an important landmark quality as one of the most imposing facades in Sydney.Heritage Group, State Projects, NSW Dept. of Public Works & Services, 1997 Admission Block, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The hospital was established as a charity hospital, with the beds being funded by subscribers. The colonial government, as a major subscriber, was entitled to issue tickets of admission as were the individual subscribers or \\"bed donors\\". Subscription to charity institutions such as the hospital was seen as being prestigious and lists of subscribers were published regularly. In later buildings, such as King George V Hospital plaques recorded the donors names. The hospital was intended to care for the poor, who could not afford medical care in their own homes. In order to help develop an ethic of \\"self-help\\" amongst the working classes all patients were encouraged to pay an appropriate level of fee. The hospital admitted private patients from the start, particularly those who did not have friends or relatives living in Sydney. Additional private facilities were provided in the late 1930s with the construction of Gloucester House. The system of tickets of admissions to hospitals gradually vanished, with the majority of the funding now being provided by the government rather than by public subscription. From the 1920s onwards people were being admitted to hospital who previously would have been cared for at home. This care was particularly evident in the case of maternity care.Heritage Group, State Projects, NSW Dept. of Public Works & Services, 1997 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The survival of historical artefacts and records in both the hospital and the medical school gives the potential for future research on the types of patients and illnesses, nursing and hospital practice, the development of the hospital and on medical and nursing training. There is also information related to particular individuals. The original hospital buildings were designed according to the latest known techniques, and include the use of steel beams with small span concrete or corrugated iron vaulting between. The technique was designed not only to be fireproof but would also provide a medium that would not permit the transmission disease. More recent buildings have been constructed using similar materials with a similar aim. In addition the layout was designed to provide for the movement of patients around the hospital , on trolleys before the widespread use of lifts. The movement of patients in the open air was obviously considered appropriate when the hospital was constructed however enclosed walkways have subsequently been constructed to link areas of the hospital. Some of the surviving features of the various buildings demonstrate technical developments in medical care and technology. Some features are part of the design, others are part of the equipment and services. These features, when known, are identified in the inventory but more work remains to be done in this area. Additional features are likely to be discovered during building works. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The hospital continues to be held in high regard by the community, by the staff and by the patients. It has a high reputation for the quality of medical care generally and for its specialised medical and research facilities. Hospitals are places of major events in the lives of individuals in the community, births, serious illnesses, accidents and deaths. Individuals and families have strong feelings and associations with the place as the site of these major events in their lives. Generations of NSW residents, in particular Sydneysiders have memories of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. The staff, both the doctors and the nurses have strong associations with the place, particularly because of eth length of time many spent within the institution as a student. As a major teaching hospital it has a strong impact on many nurses and doctors practicing today. The expansion of the hospital to the south created community opposition, particularly to the demolition of residences. This opposition has subsided in recent years now that the major phase of demolition has been completed, but there is still some concern regarding the impact of the hospital on the community, particularly regarding parking issues.

The town stood near the shore in the inner part of the bay, in the middle of which is the island Aegileia, now called Stouronisi. Styra is mentioned by Homer along with Carystus in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad. Its inhabitants were originally Dryopians, though they denied this origin, and claimed to be descended from the deme of Steiria in Attica. In the First Persian War (490 BCE) the Persians landed at Aegileia, which belonged to Styra, the prisoners whom they had taken at Eretria. In the Second Persian War (480-479 BCE) the Styrians fought at the battles of Artemisium, Salamis, and Plataeae. They sent two ships to the naval engagements, and at Plataeae they and the Eretrians amounted together to 600 men. They afterwards became the subjects of Athens, and paid a yearly tribute of 1200 drachmae. The Athenian fleet was stationed here in 356 BCE.Demosthenes c. Mid. p. 568. Strabo relates that the town was destroyed in the \\"Maliac War\\" by the Athenian Phaedrus, and its territory given to the Eretrians; but as the Maliac War is not mentioned elsewhere, we ought probably to substitute Lamian War for it.

She is currently a professor at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, working within the Institute of Archeology. The majority of her field work is centered in the Horn of Africa, with a primary focus on Ein Qashish, Israel and Eastern Ethiopia. Her research concentrates on the development of the use of symbolism during the Levantine Middle Palaeolithic and Middle Stone Age. Other research interests include lithic technology, taphonomy, and general behavior of early hominids..  Early life and education  Hovers was born in Haifa, to parents who immigrated to Israel from eastern Europe after the Holocaust. In 1979, Hovers received her B.A. in Archaeology and Geography at The Hebrew University. In 1988, she obtained her M.A. in Prehistoric Archaeology, also from The Hebrew University, graduating Cum Laude. In 1998, she received her PhD from the Hebrew University, Summa Cum Laude. From 1998 until 1999, Hovers was a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University.  Discoveries in research  Erella Hovers has significantly furthered general knowledge on the behaviors and actions of hominids such as early Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis. In 2001, Hovers found evidence that Neanderthals located in Israel were able to exploit the fauna around them for their own benefit. According to Hovers' article \\"The Exploitation of Plant Resources by Neanderthals in Amud Cave (Israel): The Evidence from Phytolith Studies,\\" by measuring Phytolith preservation in the sediments of the Amud Cave, it was determined that Neanderthals used wood to build and fuel fires, while herbaceous plants were used for both bedding and food. Hovers uses this study to dispute the previously held notion that the subsistence and mobility of pre-modern hunter-gatherers was primarily dependent on animal migrations. Instead, she proposes that it was due to the spatio-temporal distribution of particular fauna. Hovers’ research also significantly furthered the scientific community’s understanding of modern human behavior in early hominids. In her 2006 article, \\"’Now You See it, Now You Don't’ -Modern Human Behavior in the Middle Paleolithic”, Hovers suggests that the reason that modern human behavior is only rarely seen in the Middle Paleolithic hominid fossil record is not because the hominids were unintelligent or had a minimal brain capacity. Rather, she proposes the idea that such examples of modern behavior simply go unrecognized. This is because only a small portion of their activities were progressive in nature, meaning that they do not lead from a particular situation to a particular goal. Furthermore, because the twenty- first century ideals of innovativeness differ significantly from that of early hominids, many people simply cannot recognize what would have been considered “innovative”. In 2016, Hovers' work drew renewed attention to a previous theory that the Levantine corridor was the primary land route used by early hominins to migrate out from Africa into Eurasia. Through her discovery of Nubian Levallois cores in the Negev highlands of Israel, Hovers found evidence that early hominins had, at one point, migrated through that regionGoder- Goldberger, M., et al., “Diffusion with modifications”: Nubian assemblages in the central Negev highlands of Israel and their implications for Middle Paleolithic inter-regional interactions, Quaternary International (2016), http:// dVxie.wdpuoblic.aotiorngst/at1s 0.1016/j.quaint.2016.02.008 . This in turn indicates the route by which human dispersal took place. In 2017, Hovers led the discovery of the remains of two Neanderthals, along with a set of stone tools and some animal bones, from the Middle Paleolithic open-air site of Ein Qashish in northern Israel. Because these findings, the scientific community was able to tie material culture remains of neanderthals to an open- air site, where previously they had been solely associated with cave sites. This discovery proved the versatility of neanderthals, and shows that they were not merely simple hominids confined to caves. Instead, they could adapt somewhat to their environment. In addition to being a professor in the department of prehistoric archeology in the Institute of Archeology at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Hovers is also an International Research Affiliate for Arizona State University with a concentration in Plio- Pleistocene archaeology in East Africa.

History  Vereshchagin painted Suppression of the Indian Revolt in 1884 after a trip to British India. Having already visited the Holy Land in the same trip and been inspired by its history, Vereshchagin began to consider producing a series of paintings depicting various forms of executions.

Education  Hopkins was born on 16 April 1913 in south London, son of Sybil (nee Bateley) and Robert Thurston Hopkins (1884–1958), a bank cashier and prolific author of topographical works, ghost stories, and biographies of British writers Oscar Wilde, H. G. Wells and Rudyard Kipling. The family lived in Sussex and Godfrey, who came to be known as Thurston, was educated at St Joseph’s Salesian school at Burwash, near Kipling’s home in East Sussex, and at Montpelier college, Brighton.  Early work  Hopkins studied under Morgan Rendle at Brighton College of Art in graphic art and taught himself photography, his pictures being used for some of his father's books. He found employment with a publisher adding decorative frames to portraits of Edward VIII, which the King's abdication on 10 December 1936 brought to an abrupt end. With the shift to photography from illustration amongst newspaper publishers, he joined the PhotoPress Agency.Craig, Charles. (1982).

They lent him his first camera; a Goerz Anschutz which he found cumbersome. It wasn't until serving in the RAF Photographic Unit during the Second World War in Italy and the Middle East from 1940 that he acquired a more portable 35mm format, Leica which apart from occasional use of a Rolleiflex, he continued to prefer for the rest of his career.  Picture Post  After being demobilised, Hopkins hitchhiked around Europe for a while taking photographs. Back in England he worked for Camera Press, the agency founded in London in 1947 by Tom Blau. Having seen issues of Picture Post at military posts everywhere during his service he developed a keen ambition to work for this. Founded in 1938 and funded by publisher Edward Hulton, the magazine's first editor was Hungarian émigré Stefan Lorant (1901–1997) assisted by Tom Hopkinson (1905–1990), who took over as editor from 1940. The image-centric format, left-leaning and reasonably-priced publication was highly successful and circulation soon rose to over a million. Its photographers, including Bert Hardy, Kurt Hutton, Humphrey Spender, Leonard McCombe, John Chillingworth and Bill Brandt, went out with the writers on stories together, working as colleagues, not competitors. By producing a dummy issue composed entirely of his own features, Hopkins persuaded Picture Post to take him on as a freelancer, and from 1950 as a staffer working exclusively for the magazine.Jay, B. (1993). Album: Two Editorials. History of Photography 17 (1), 10–12. One of his first essays was his popular 'Cats of London' (24 February 1951),Brown, S. (1999). On View: Feline Fancy. The British Journal of Photography, 145 (7240), 16–17. a series made whilst working on other stories during which he would find stray cats living in the many bomb sites and back alleys. His best known photograph drew on this talent with animals. Entitled La Dolce Vita, Knightsbridge, London, 1953 the picture shows a limousine owner-driver with a regal poodle sitting bolt upright in the passenger seat. Ripe for commercial exploitation, it became a best selling postcard, poster and calendar image. In support of the Post's social consciousness, Hopkins produced stories on children playing on the city streetsHopkinson, A. (1993). On View: Street cred. The British Journal of Photography (Archive: 1860–2005), 140 (6919), 26–27. in an effort to have the need for dedicated playgrounds recognised. His 1956 story on the slums of Liverpool, however, was spiked when the municipal administrators protested to the magazine's proprietor Edward Hulton, over its negative portrayal of the city. At Picture Post Hopkins met, and in 1955 married, another photographer: Grace Robertson, who worked under the byline Dick Muir to get work at Simon Guttman's Report agency in an era when women were at a disadvantage in the industry.Gross, J.

It was cast in 1966 in an edition of 3+1 (three casts for sale, plus one artist's copy). The four casts are displayed at the Barbara Hepworth Museum, the Norton Simon Museum, Churchill College, Cambridge, and the Mayo Clinic. Description The large sculpture comprises five quadrilateral slab-like metal elements: a horizontal base, on which stand two thick parallel square slabs on edge, on which stand two similar parallel square slabs at right angles to the lower two. Each of the standing slabs is pierced off-centre by a round hole. Although the five slabs are similar in appearance, each around square, so approximately the height of a typical person, each differs slightly in its linear dimensions, convexity, and surface detail. One of each pair of the standing elements is slightly larger than the other, so they are arranged in echelon. The holes are not perfect circles, and they taper and change shape slightly through the thickness of the slabs. The interior and exterior surfaces have different patination - greenish outside, reddish within, particularly inside the holes. The holes may once have been polished and lacquered, to contrast with the dull exterior: they appear reflective in early photographs, but as the works are displayed outdoors they have also weathered. Hepworth intended the viewer to engage directly with the sculpture, to notice the surface details and the differences between the pieces: literally, to walk around and through the sculpture. In comments published in 1971 by her son-in law, the art historian Alan Bowness, Hepworth agreed that part of the motivation for the monumental work was her diagnosis with cancer of the throat in 1965. Churchill College Background Squares with Two Circles Unlike Henry Moore, Hepworth did not usually make maquettes - small preliminary studies of the composition - before proceeding to the full- size work. However, in this case, she make several smaller works on similar themes. The sculpture develops the geometrical theme of quadrilateral planes pierced by circles from her 1963 bronze Squares with Two Circles (BH 347). Parallels can also be drawn to the abstract paintings and panel relief sculptures of Hepworth's former husband Ben Nicholson (they were divorced in 1951). In 1966 Hepworth made two slate sculptures, the high Maquette for Large Sculpture: Four-Square (Four Circles) (BH 407) in an edition of 3, and then the unique high Four-Square (Four Circles) (BH 416). The larger slate sculpture was cast in bronze in 1966 as Four-Square (Four Circles) (BH 428) in an edition of \\"7+1\\" (seven casts for sale and one artist's model). Scaling up these smaller sculptures, Hepworth made a plaster model of the full-size sculpture, , on an aluminium armature. The five slab-like elements were then cast separately in bronze by the Morris Singer foundry in London. The separate pieces were welded together to create the completed sculpture, in an edition of \\"3+1\\" (three casts for sale, plus one artist's copy). The artist's copy (0/3) is owned by the Hepworth estate, and is displayed on loan in the gardens of the Barbara Hepworth Museum in St Ives, Cornwall. Cast 1 has been held by the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena since 1969. Cast 2 has been displayed in the grounds of Churchill College, Cambridge since 1968, where students are encouraged to walk or with within the work; it was allocated to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 2000, after being accepted in lieu of inheritance tax by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, from the estate of the artist. Cast 3 was donated to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota in 1979, as a memorial for Constantine P. Goulandris, member of the Greek shipping dynasty that included Basil Goulandris and Nikos Goulandris. An example of the slate maquette was put on sale at Bonhams in 2003, estimated at £40,000 to £60,000, but failed to sell. An example was sold in England in 2009 for £60,000, and resold in at Deutscher and Hackett in Australia in 2014 for AUS$348,000. An example of the bronze Four-square (Four circles) was sold at Christie's in 2010 for US$314,500, and one at Sotheby's in 2017 for £488,750.

Branche (1933 - December 22, 1992) was a civil rights leader from Pennsylvania who worked as executive secretary in the Chester, Pennsylvania branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and founded the Committee for Freedom Now (CFFN). In the early 1960s, he and George Raymond partnered to challenge minority hiring practices of businesses and initiated the Chester school protests against de facto segregation of schools which made Chester one of the key battlegrounds of the civil rights movement. He protested with the Cambridge Movement in Dorchester County, Maryland and worked with Cecil B. Moore to desegregate Girard College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He worked with the Greater Chester Movement and the Black Coalition in Philadelphia. He ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Chester in 1967 and twice for U.S. Congress in 1978 and 1986. He left the civil rights movement and ran multiple businesses including co-ownership of a nightclub in Philadelphia with drug kingpin, Major Coxson. In 1989, he was convicted and sentenced to 5 years in federal prison for his participation in an organized crime collection scheme. Early life and education Branche served as a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division and the 127th Regimental Combat Team in the Korean War. He was decorated three times. After the war, he attended the Combs College of Music and the Pennsylvania Institute of Criminology with the intent to be a policeman. Civil rights career Branche participated in the Cambridge Movement in Dorchester County, Maryland as the field secretary for the NAACP. He returned to Chester in 1962 and his wife Anna introduced him to George Raymond, president of the Chester branch of the NAACP. Branche was initially assigned to the campaign to desegregate the Great Leopard Skating Rink. Branche and Raymond partnered to successfully challenge the minority hiring practices of large department stores, clothing shops, shoe stores and other specialty shops in downtown Chester. By the fall of 1963, Branche became frustrated with the gradualist approach of Raymond and the NAACP. He resigned and created a new activist organization named the Committee for Freedom Now (CFFN) along with the Swarthmore College chapter of Students for a Democratic Society and Chester parents to end de facto segregation of public schools and improve conditions at predominantly black schools in Chester. In 1962, Branche and the CFFN focused on improving conditions at the predominantly black Franklin Elementary school in Chester. Although the school was built to house 500 students, it had become overcrowded with 1,200 students. The school's average class-size was 39, twice the number of nearby all-white schools. The school was built in 1910 and had never been updated. Only two bathrooms were available for the entire school. In November 1963, CFFN protesters blocked the entrance to Franklin Elementary school and the Chester Municipal Building resulting in the arrest of 240 protesters. Following public attention to the protests stoked by media coverage of the mass arrests, the mayor and school board negotiated with the CFFN and NAACP. The Chester Board of Education agreed to reduce class sizes at Franklin school, remove unsanitary toilet facilities, relocate classes held in the boiler room and coal bin and repair school grounds. Emboldened by the success of the Franklin Elementary school demonstrations, the CFFN recruited new members, sponsored voter registration drives and planned a citywide boycott of Chester schools. Branche built close ties with students at Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania Military College and Cheyney State College in order to ensure large turnouts at demonstrations and protests. Branche invited Dick Gregory and Malcolm X to Chester to participate in the \\"Freedom Now Conference\\" and other national civil rights leaders such as Gloria Richardson came to Chester in support of the demonstrations. In the spring of 1964, huge protests over multiple days ensued which resulted in mass arrests of protesters. The mayor of Chester, James Gorbey, issued \\"The Police Position to Preserve the Public Peace\\", a ten-point statement promising an immediate return to law and order. The city deputized firemen and trash collectors to help handle demonstrators. The State of Pennsylvania deployed 50 state troopers to assist the 77-member Chester police force. The demonstrations were marked by violence and charges of police brutality. Over six hundred people were arrested over a two-month period of civil rights rallies, marches, pickets, boycotts and sit-ins. Branche acted as press spokesman, community liaison, recruiter and chief negotiator. Governor William Scranton convinced Branche to obey a court- ordered moratorium on demonstrations. Scranton created the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission to conduct hearings on the de facto segregation of public schools. All protests were discontinued while the commission held hearings during the summer of 1964. In November 1964, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission concluded that the Chester School Board had violated the law and ordered Chester School District to desegregate the city's six predominantly African-American schools. The city appealed the ruling, which delayed implementation. In June 1964, Chester city leaders formed the Greater Chester Movement (GCM), an umbrella organization intended to coordinate activities of groups working toward the improvement of Chester. When President Lyndon Johnson initiated his War on Poverty, the GCM became a conduit through which federal dollars were distributed in Chester. Branche had originally set up a competing organization named the Committee on Economic Opportunity (CEO) however it was incorporated into the GCM with Branche serving on the steering committee. In 1968, Branche formed the Black Coalition Movement, a multiracial group formed in the wake of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.. He worked with Cecil B. Moore to desegregate Girard College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Branche and seven others were arrested when they tried to trespass in the school. Branche was arrested approximately 225 times during civil rights protests. Post civil rights career He left the civil rights movement, moved to Philadelphia and ran several businesses including nightclubs, a security firm, a taxicab company and shoe repair shops. Branche had an unsuccessful run for mayor of Chester in 1967. He co-owned a nightclub, the Rolls Royce Lounge in Center City Philadelphia with a drug kingpin, Major Coxson and was known to travel throughout Philadelphia with Muhammad Ali. Branche ran for U.S. Representative of Pennsylvania's 1st Congressional District in 1978 but lost to Tom Foglietta. He had another unsuccessful run for Congress in 1986 In 1979, Branche was recruited by W.M. Anderson Co., a mechanical contractor, to become the sole stockholder and chairman of the board. That same year, Branche and an associate Gus Lacy were charged with bribery involving a medical student's attempt to get into Hahnemann Medical College. The charges were dropped in 1980 when a key witness died. In 1985, Branche partnered with the activist lawyer William Kunstler to file a lawsuit on behalf of MOVE member Louise James in an attempt to force Philadelphia District Attorney Ed Rendell to investigate the Wilson Goode administration's controversial bombing of the MOVE headquarters in West Philadelphia. Branche was convicted in 1989 and sentenced to five years in federal prison for extortion. A key piece of evidence was an FBI recording of Branche and George Botsaris, a leader of the Philadelphia Greek Mob. Reverend Jesse Jackson was among those that wrote to the parole board in support of Branche's parole. He died on December 22, 1992 of a heart attack.

Her research focuses on analyzing natural, plant-based medicine of Mediterranean indigenous cultures to help combat infectious disease and antibiotic resistance. In particular, she studies bacterial biofilm inhibition and quorum-sensing inhibition of botanical extracts for inflammatory skin conditions.  Early life and education   Childhood  Born in Arcadia, Florida, Quave's interest in science and medicine began early, stemming from the extended time she spent in hospitals. At age three, congenital birth defects prompted an amputation below the knee in her right leg. After surgery, she required follow-up treatment for complications from an MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) infection. This experience would provide the basis of her adolescent science fair project about drug resistance in Escherichia coli, as well as her later research projects.  Undergraduate education  In her undergraduate years at Emory University, she pursued a double bachelor's of science in Human Biology as well as Anthropology, which she earned in 2000. A college course in tropical ecology coupled with trips to Peru shifted her interest from medical school to instead pursuing a PhD through researching ethnobotany. In Peru, she saw the work of a traditional medicine man on children with parasitic worm infections in villages without access to pharmaceutical drugs. To her, the encounter illustrated how modern Western medicine has undermined the usefulness of traditional medicine.  Doctoral education  After earning her bachelor's degrees, Quave started her ethnobotany fieldwork in southern Italy between 2001 and 2003, before pursuing a doctoral program in biology at Florida International University. Under Dr. Bradley C. Bennett's guidance, she completed her doctoral dissertation in 2008, titled \\"An ethnopharmacological approach to multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureas: Evaluation of Italian Plants used in the Traditional Healing of Skin Disease.\\"  Post-doctoral fellowships  Quave completed her first post-doctoral fellowship in microbial pathogenesis at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences between 2009-2011. Specifically, she continued her study of medicinal plants in Italy, focusing on anti-biofilm properties in MRSA. Additionally, Quave completed a second post-doctoral teaching fellowship between 2011-2012 with the Emory University Center for Human Health.  Research contributions   Bacterial biofilm inhibition  The defensive mechanism of bacterial biofilms in resisting antimicrobial drugs comes from the ability of microbes to develop and hide within a protective extracellular matrix. Quave's work during her first post-doctoral fellowship focused on the significant biofilm-inhibiting activity of 10 individual botanical extracts from unique species of plants, something she believes could be utilized in new drug therapies. Since then, one of her current research projects focuses on finding the specific compounds in the elmleaf blackberry plant (Rubus ulmifolius) that contribute to the property. In doing so, Quave hopes to translate the biofilm inhibiting extracts into a wound management device such as bandages.  Quorum-sensing inhibition  Another major project of Quave's has been studying quorum-sensing inhibiting (QSI) activity in medicinal plants that prevent bacterial cells from effectively communicating, colonizing, and releasing toxins. Her focus has been upon both the Brazilian pepper tree extracts (Schinus terebinthifolia) and the European chestnut (Castanea sativa). According to Quave, these QSI extracts could help in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. However, she acknowledges a number of difficulties of the drug development process. Aside from receiving FDA approval, there are the added difficulties of isolating the active compound and understanding the complex pharmacology of multiple extracts, if pursuing a mixture for increased efficacy.

Description Levi Scofield, c. 1894 The monument features life-size bronze statues of seven men — Salmon P. Chase, James A. Garfield, Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, Philip Sheridan, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Edwin Stanton — as well as a bronze statue of the Roman Cornelia. The sculptural group stands at the northwest corner of the statehouse grounds (Capitol Square). It honors military and political leaders from Ohio who significantly contributed to the Union during the American Civil War. The monument's name is from an ancient Roman anecdote about the wealthy Cornelia. When asked by her well-dressed friends where her jewelry was, Cornelia left and returned with her sons, saying \\"These are my jewels!\\". Cornelia personifies Ohio, presenting its best leaders during the time of crisis.http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/about/capitol-square/statues-and- monuments/these-are-my-jewels The monument was designed by Levi Scofield, known for his Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument on the Public Square in Cleveland. History Detail of the sculptural group, 2013 The sculptural group was conceived by General Roeliff Brinkerhoff, one of the founders of the current-day Ohio History Connection. Brinkerhoff wanted a monument for the Ohio Pavilion in the World's Columbian Exposition, the 1893 Chicago world's fair. It was moved to Columbus at the fair's end. The statue originally displayed six Ohioans, though Ohio governor and later president William McKinley led efforts to add on a statue of Rutherford B. Hayes, his former commanding officer. The act led the monument to depict three of the eventual eight U.S. presidents from Ohio. The monument was dedicated in 1894, and rededicated on June 10, 1965 and November 5, 1992. The artwork was surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution's \\"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\\" program in 1993.

Sea level changes were predicted, and a tsunami advisory was issued. Reports of sea level change of up to 20 centimeters were reported in Greece and Italy. The epicenter was located about 133 km from Patras. The earthquake occurred 14 km below the surface. Power outages were reported on the island of Zakynthos, and a 15th century monastery was also damaged on the islands of Strofades. The port of Zakynthos also sustained major damage, and a state of emergency was declared in the municipality. Services around Zakynthos were affected, and schools were closed on October 26. Tax relief was also extended into January in order to support the local tourism industry. Other structures were damaged, but despite the magnitude of the event, there were no reported serious injuries or casualties. About 120 homes were left uninhabitable, and the town laterally shifted 5 centimeters as a result of the earthquake. A strict building code was cited as a possible reason for the limited amount of damage, as Zakynthos suffered major damage from a 1953 earthquake. The event was felt in eight countries, including in the Balkans, Italy, Malta as well as coasts of Africa and Turkey. The main shock was followed by multiple aftershocks in the following days, including undersea aftershocks of magnitude 4.4 and 5 over a week after the initial earthquake. The largest reported aftershock was of magnitude 5.6 the day of the initial earthquake.  References  Further reading *Efthimios Sokos, František Gallovič, Christos P.

It saw action in numerous regional conflicts as well as World War I. History After the Franco-Prussian War, the German Army began to study replacements for its existing C/61 breech loaded cannon. Although the breech-loaded steel C/61 had outclassed its French muzzle-loading bronze rivals during the war, its Wahrendorff breech was unpopular with gun crews. The new gun, designated the C/73 would retain the same caliber of the C/61, and would equip cavalry artillery regiments of the German Army. Krupp was also active on the export market at this time and one of their stock models was the C/80, which although similar to the C/73 had a longer 27 caliber barrel. Despite being called an 8 cm cannon in the Krupp catalog, it actually fired ammunition. The German and Austro-Hungarian Army during that period rounded up to the nearest centimeter. To confuse things even further the C/80 was often given model numbers by their customers based on the year they were purchased or when their armories began licensed production. The C/80 armed the Ottoman Empire and the Balkan states during the late 1800s and during World War I. These were either purchased from Krupp, produced under license or were captured from the Ottomans during the Balkan Wars. The Turks used C/73's and C/80's that they had converted to makeshift anti-aircraft guns as late as 1922. Design The C/80 was of built-up construction with a central rifled tube, a reinforcing hoop from the trunnions to the breech and used new smokeless powder for greater muzzle velocity and range. The C/80 used the same type of breech as the C/73 known as a cylindro-prismatic breech that was a predecessor of Krupp's horizontal sliding-block and the gun used separate- loading, bagged charges and projectiles. Since the C/80 had limited elevation +8° to +24° it was a direct fire weapon meant to fire on infantry in the open and the most common types of shells were common, canister and shrapnel. Like the C/73 the C/80 was normally assigned to cavalry artillery batteries. The C/80 had a box trail carriage built from bolted steel plates instead of wood. The C/80 did not have a recoil mechanism or a gun shield. For transport, the gun was attached to a limber for towing by a 6-horse team. The limber also had seats for crew members plus ammunition and supplies. There were also seats attached to the axle of the gun carriage for the crew.

He went to Australia to collect specimen for Ferdinand von Mueller and served as medical officer and botanist for the Victoria Exploring Expedition (better known as the Burke and Wills expedition) in 1860. Life Hermann Beckler grew up as one of five childrenGerman wikipedia: Hermann BecklerHeider, J. (1954) Hermann Beckler. In: Lebensbilder aus dem bayerischen Schwaben 3.(ed. Konrad Anton) . His parents, Kaspar Beckler and Franziska Speth, were married on 13 February 1827 in Höchstädt an der Donau. Hermann Beckler studied medicine in Munich, Germany. On 20 June 1855, he graduated with a thesis entitled, Ueber die Uterinblennorrhoe. On completing his studies on 30 September 1855, he left Hamburg for Australia on 30 September 1855 on the Godeffroy Line's Johann Caesar to work there as a doctor. He arrived at Moreton Bay on 2 February 1856, living in Ipswich, Brisbane, Tenterfield and Warwick (1856-1858), struggling to earn a living as a doctor, since he lacked the money to buy medical equipment and the necessary doctor's licence for New South Wales, and soon lost interest in working as a doctor. A former professor from Munich put him in touch with fellow German expatriates Ferdinand von Mueller and Georg von Neumayer, both in Melbourne. By January 1859, Beckler was working at the Melbourne Hospital. He was also employed by Ferdinand Mueller at Royal Botanical Gardens Melbourne from 1859 to 1860, collecting specimens around the Hastings, Macleay, Richmond and Clarence Rivers in New South Wales, and Moreton Bay (Queensland - at that time part of New South Wales). Recommended by a colleague at the Melbourne Hospital, Dr. William Gillbee (a member of the Exploration Committee of the Royal Society of Victoria), and supported by Neumayer and Mueller (also members of the society), he was appointed to the Victoria Exploring Expedition (VEE) at a meeting of the Exploration Committee on Friday, 13 July 1860, as both scientific and medical officer on a salary of £300 p.a. On 18 August 1860, he signed the Memorandum of Agreement at the Royal Society of Victoria. Burke's erratic leadership of the expedition which led to the resignation of his second-in-command, George Landells, at Menindee, triggered Beckler's resignation from the expedition. The resignation of Mr. Landells, and Burke's splitting the expedition in two at Menindee, meant that no one was in charge in Menindee. Beckler's resignation was accepted but he agreed to stay with the men and supplies left at Menindee, which were meant to follow and form a depot at Cooper's Creek. Waiting for a replacement and despite his resignation, Beckler stayed until the bitter end, fulfilling his original obligations to the expedition both as doctor and scientific observer. With the failure of the expedition, he was called before the commission of inquiry into 'the sufferings and death of Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills' in 1862. He found himself accused of betrayal and abandonment both in Australia and in Germany. After his return to Germany in 1862, he wrote a valuable account of the expedition in order to rehabilitate himself, which was not published at the time,Voigt, Johannes H.: Einleitung. In: Hermann Beckler: Entdeckungen in Australien. Briefe und Aufzeichnungen eines Deutschen 1855-1862. Stuttgart: Thorbecke, 2000, S. 7–24. but which was finally published in 1993 in English as A Journey to Cooper's Creek. During his few years in Australia, Hermann Beckler wrote a large number of letters to his younger brother, Karl Beckler, describing his experiences, 19th-century Australia, and encounters with Australian aborigines. On his return to Germany, he practised as a doctor in Fischen im Allgäu until his death in 1914. In 1962, a plaque marking the birthplace of Dr. Hermann Beckler was displayed on the outside wall of a former bank building in Höchstädt an der Donau. During remodeling of the building in subsequent years, the plaque was placed in storage in an old city museum on Oberer Weberberg Strasse then was later moved to the new historic museum located in the former Rathaus building in the market square. On 17 June 2012, the plaque was reinstalled on the birth house of Hermann Beckler at Herzogin Anna Strasse 2 and was unveiled in a public ceremony in the presence of Dr. Werner Stirnweiss, members of the Höchstädt Historische Verein, mayor Hildegard Wanner, and interested citizens.Höchstädt an der Donau, Mitteilungsblatt, 27 June 2012, page 1, \\"Gedentafel zu Ehren Hermann Becklers\\"Augsburger Allgemeine, 18 June 2012, online, \\"Damit der Forscher nicht in Vergessenheit gerät, Gedenktafel zu Ehren Hermann Becklers wurde gestern in Höchstädt enthüllt\\" Von Simone Bronnhuber A street was named Hermann-Beckler-Strasse in the Ensbach settlement of Höchstädt an der Donau with a sign, \\"Arzt und Forschungsreisender 1828 in Höchstädt geboren.\\" Career *Career position - Medical practitioner in Australia *Career position - Employed by F.

It led to the deposition of Prime Minister Louis Lansana Beavogui, who held the office since 1972, and assumed interim presidential powers on 26 March, when the long-time President Ahmed Sékou Touré died during an emergency heart operation at the Cleveland Clinic in the United States. The coup Andrews AFB in Maryland, arriving for a state visit to the United States on 29 June 1982, twenty-three months before his death and the 1984 coup. The military struck just hours before the Politburo of the Democratic Party of Guinea (PDG), the only legally permitted party in the country, was to select a new leader. Interim president Beavogui was expected to win. Under the Constitution, the new leader would have been automatically elected to a seven-year term as president, and would have been confirmed in office via a referendum. Colonel Conté suspended the constitution and dissolved the PDG, the National Assembly and all mass organizations. The Military Committee of National Restoration (CMNR) was created as the ruling junta. He ordered the release of political prisoners held at Camp Boiro, a concentration camp within the capital Conakry. Conté was named new President on 5 April. Aftermath Eventually, a power struggle developed between Conté and a fellow member of the CMNR, Diarra Traoré (who briefly served as Prime Minister in April–December 1984), with the latter being executed in the aftermath of a failed coup attempt in July 1985. Conté took advantage of the coup attempt to execute several of Ahmed Sekou Touré's close associates, including his half-brother Ismaël Touré (former chief prosecutor at Camp Boiro), Mamadi Keïta, Siaka Touré (former commander of Camp Boiro), Moussa Diakité, and Abdoulaye Touré (former Minister of Foreign Affairs).

It was designed by George Allen Mansfield and built in 1859 by Thomas Abbott. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The first Methodist services were held in brick cottages at the corner of King and Eliza Sts from about 1840. In 1847 the church decided to build a chapel, and in 1849 land was purchased at the corner of King St and Erskineville Rd, with the chapel completed by 1850. The current church was constructed in 1859 as Newtown Methodist Church on a new site to accommodate the growing Methodist population in the Newtown area during the period of rapid expansion. The western gallery was erected in 1864. The interior was extensively altered in 1875. The eastern stained glass windows were added in 1882. The organ loft was added in 1910. Further renovations took place in 1923 and 1940. It adopted its current name in 1977 following the Methodist Church's amalgamation into the new Uniting Church of Australia. Description It is a two-storey Victorian Gothic style church constructed of face brickwork on sandstone base with stone dressings, buttresses and gable roof. The building is symmetrical, with triple gothic arched leadlight windows with stone tracery above panelled doors at ground-floor level. Remnant elements of cast-iron palisade fencing and gates with sandstone gateposts survive.  Heritage listing  The church and its pipe organ were listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999, having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Uniting Church, formerly the Wesleyan Chapel, has important associations for Australian Wesleyan Methodists in that its origins were determined by the ideas promulgated by Frederick J. Jobson, secretary of the Wesleyan Methodist Conference in 1842. Out of the deliberations of the conference came the decision to hold a competition for a \\"Model Church\\" It was the winning design that formed the basis for this building, albeit modified by George Mansfield. The organ was designed by a renowned firm of organ makers and has been a part of the church since 1878. The modifications made to it in 1910 were carried out by a prominent Australian firm. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. It was the first example of the \\"Model Plan\\" church to be erected in Australia and has been described as the \\"Mother Church of Australian Victorian Methodism\\". In view of its antecedent it can be said to be of international style, with its adaptation to Australian requirements, first by Mansfield and later by Rowe, being of particular significance. Technically the organ was of a very advanced design and high standard of workmanship. The modifications made to it in 1910 were done with a similar standard of technical excellence and with respect for its provenance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It is significant for its 130 years of community relationship both of a religious and more recently of a secular nature. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The church is rare in that only two examples at Mudgee and Parramatta are thought to have survived. The organ is rare in that only two other such organs are thought to exist in the state, and, apart from its early modifications in the early 20th century, it has not been altered since.

Life Neville was a younger son of Alan de Neville and a daughter of the lord of Pont Audemer. Neville is first mentioned when King John of England gave him lands in 1204. In 1207, Geoffrey served briefly as a steward of the Household, before he was appointed the King's Chamberlain. He served in 1207 for a short time as Sheriff of Wiltshire and in 1210 he was sent with reinforcements to the Angevin County of Poitou. In 1213, King John sent him as an envoy to Count Raymond VI of Toulouse and King Peter II of Aragón. In 1214 he tried to get the nobles of Poitou to support the campaign of King John. In gratitude for his loyalty, the king gave him some possessions of dispossessed members of the baronial opposition in England. In July and August 1214 Neville served as Seneschal of Gascony and in July and August 1215, as Seneschal of Poitou. Both offices he had to hand over to Reginald de Pontibus. During the First Barons' War he was until 1 October 1215, in the entourage of the king, who gave Neville the Governorship of Scarborough Castle on that day, receiving funds from the king to strengthen the fortifications of the castle. In the winter of 1215-1216 he defended York Castle and York against the troops of the baronial opposition. In early 1216, Neville was appointed Sheriff of Yorkshire, which he remained until 1223. Unlike many other barons, he remained a loyal supporter of the king until the death of King John in October 1216. In November 1217, Neville was part of the re-recognition of Magna Carta by the regent William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke. In March 1218, he was confirmed as the Sheriff of Yorkshire, remaining the governor of the royal castles of Scarborough and Pickering. In 1218 he was in Worcester when the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Iorwerth signed a peace treaty with the regency council. In May 1218 he was reappointed seneschal of Gascony, Poitou and Périgord. In Gascony, he put down the rebellion of Hugh X of Lusignan and the Lusignan family, with Niort besieged in 1219. At the end of May 1219, he threatened the government that, in the face of insufficient support from England, he would rather go to the Holy See crusade instead of remaining in Gascony, and in September 1219 he again complained that he had insufficient funds and troops to defend Gascony. In October 1219 he gave William Gauler the administration of Gascony and returned to England, where he reached Dover on 1 November. As seneschal he had taken on debts, which the citizens of different cities of Gascony demanded in 1220. In England, the government commissioned him in 1220 to negotiate with Scotland the marriage of Princess Joan, a sister of King Henry III of England, with King Alexander II of Scotland. On 23 January 1221, the king summoned him to Northampton against the rebellious William de Forz, Earl of Albemarle, who had occupied Fotheringhay Castle. In 1222, he paid the king £100 to obtain guardianship for Alexander de Neville, presumably a second cousin of his and possessions in Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, and Cumberland. On 4 December 1222, he was instructed to verify compliance with the negotiated treaty between Hugh X of Lusignan in Gascony. In 1223, Lusignan complained to the English king of the then Seneschal of Gascony Savary de Mauléon and requested the reinstatement of Neville as Seneschal. The king sent Neville in August 1223 to negotiate with Hugh X of Lusignan in Gascony. In January 1224, Neville had returned to England after his negotiations with Lusignan had been unsuccessful. In May 1224 he was sent with a small force, including at least 15 knights of the royal household, as well as 2000 marks as reinforcement to the County of Poitou, reaching Poitou in June. Neville's small force was not enough to withstand the forces of King Louis VIII of France. Neville returned to England in 1224 after the loss of the County of Poitou. In February 1225, he testified the re-recognition of the Magna Carta by King Henry III. Neville was again sent in March 1225, under the command of Richard of Cornwall in Gascony, where he probably died.

Don Markstein of Toonpedia characterized General Features as \\"a small newspaper syndicate that handled more columns than comics (but also had at least one other comic of note, Jeff Cobb), and had none that made a significant mark on the world.\\"  History  General Features Corp. debuted in 1937 with three weekly comic strips (with alliterative titles): Bill Seidcheck's Betty Brighteyes, Ed Brennon's Bing and His Buddies, and Larry Whittington's Daisy Daily and Dotty Dawn. Little ran General Features Corp. for six years before suspending operations to serve in the military during World War II. Little re- started the company in 1946. Jerry Costello was an editorial cartoonist for General Features during the years 1946–1949. The syndicate also distributed Be Smart, an illustrated fashion feature, in the late 1940s. The syndicate's longest-running strips all launched in the 1950s, with the most notable comic strips being Robert Morgan & Pete Hoffman's Why We Say (1950–1978), a single- panel strip that explained word and phrase origins in laypersons' terms; the \\"Air-Western-Adventure Strip\\" Gene Autry, produced beginning in 1952 through an arrangement with Whitman Publishing;Knoll, Erwin. \\"New Autry Strip Has Cowboys, Spies, Space,\\" Editor & Publisher (July 26, 1952).

Mell Lazarus, later to have much success with his strip Momma, created two children's strips for General Features, Li'l Ones and Wee Women, both of which debuted in 1955 and ended in 1974 (with the later work of Jim Whiting). John Henry Rouson had a number of strips with General Features, including Ladies Day and the long-running Boy and Girl and Little Sport. The last new strip to debut with General Features was Phil Evans & Tom Cooke's space adventure strip Drift Marlo, which started syndication in 1961. From that point forward, the syndicate stuck with strips that had begun their runs in the 1950s. In early 1967, General Features was sold to the Los Angeles Times Mirror Company for an estimated $1 million.

The work for the declaration of Filipino Heritage Month was started by Paulina Corpuz of Toronto, Ontario, through a petition. Through the sponsorship of Councillor Neethan Shan, a motion was submitted at the City of Toronto Council and with the endorsement of about 50 people and organizations, the motion was approved by the council unanimously. It was finally declared in Canada on October 30, 2018, in the Filipino Heritage Month Act 2017, through the authorship of MP Salma Zahid, Liberal MP, Scarborough Southwest. History The work to declare June as a Filipino Heritage Month started in November 2016. Paulina Corpuz, Toronto-based community leader and President of the Philippine Advancement Through Arts and Culture (PATAC), first raised this idea with Ontario New Democratic Party Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs). With the help of Laura Casselman, Corpuz met with the NDP MPP and was advised to submit a petition through the OLA process. Signatures were gathered at various community events held from June 2016 until August 2017. In October 2017, Corpuz attended a Filipino Workers consultation organized by Neethan Shan, a Toronto City Councillor (Ward 42, Scarborough Rouge River). In that consultation, Shan offered to sponsor a motion to declare the month of June as Filipino Heritage Month, at the Toronto City Council. A Filipino Heritage Month motion was introduced by Councillor Neethan Shan, in November 2017 with the help of Corpuz who had started the petition in November 2016, gathered endorsements from 50 individuals and organizations. The City council passed the motion unanimously. As a result of the motion passed at the City of Toronto, the provincial government of Ontario and the federal government of Canada took notice. Several days after the passing, MPP Raymond Cho of the Progressive Conservative presented a motion to declare June as Filipino Heritage Month. This was defeated. Recognizing the importance of the Filipino Canadian community but not willing to work together, the three political parties forwarded their own members' bill version to declare June as Filipino Heritage Month. * New Democrats Party (NDP) by MPP Peter Tabuns, November 23, 2017 * Progressive Conservatives (NDP) MPP Raymond Cho, Bill 185, December 5, 2017 * Liberal Party (LP) MPP Mike Colle, Bill 10, March 20, 2018 Liberal Party MP Salma Zahid of Scarborough Southwest also started a petition in British Columbia . The first Filipino Heritage Month celebrations Starting in 2018, Toronto celebrated Filipino Heritage Month, becoming Canada's first municipality to mark June as Filipino heritage month in perpetuity. Alberta was the first Canadian province to do so. The Toronto Catholic District School Board also voted on May 17, 2018 to declare June 12th as Filipino Heritage Day and June as Filipino Heritage Month, across all Catholic elementary and secondary schools in Toronto. As of June 2018, there are 168 elementary schools, 31 secondary schools, and three combined (elementary and secondary) schools. Montreal also named June as Filipino Heritage Month, by the local Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Council in February 2018, introduced by Councillor Marvin Rotrand and Councillor Lionel Perez. However, Calgary organization leaders petitioned for Philippine-Canadian Heritage Month, instead of Filipino Heritage Month, to be celebrated in September, conflicting with the Edmonton organization leaders' petition, a motion started by Marco Luciano, to celebrate Filipino Heritage Month in June. On March 15, 2019, MP Salma Zahid led officials in launching Filipino Heritage Month in Canada in her federal riding of Scarborough Centre. The event kicked off the initial celebration, which will begin on June 1, 2019, the first commemoration across Canada. In the Greater Toronto Area, the June 1 festivities will be held at the Albert Campbell Square in the eastern suburb of Scarborough. The Filipino community in the GTA plans to put up several festivities related to the month- long event.

The city of Sparta had at least two sanctuaries dedicated to Aphrodite. There was a Temple of Aphrodite Areia and an oracle of Aphrodite Ambologera, as well as a statue of Aphrodite Olympia in a sanctuary of Zeus, and a statue of Aphrodite Hera. The Temple of Aphrodite was built upon a hill. It was an unusual temple, as it was reportedly built in two stories, something which likely made it unique. Both storeys of the temple was dedicated to Aphrodite, but the upper floor was dedicated to her as Aphrodite Morpho. The first storey contained a wooden statue of the goddess in arms, and the Aphrodite Morpho was depicted seated, veiled and with fettered feet. Pausanias described the temple in the second century: :\\"A little farther on [in Sparta, Lakedaimonia] is a small hill, on which is an ancient temple with a wooden image of Aphrodite armed. This is the only temple I know that has an upper storey built upon it. It is a sanctuary of Morpho (the Shapely), a surname of Aphrodite, who sits wearing a veil and with fetters on her feet. The story is that the fetters were put on her by [the mythical king] Tyndareus, who symbolized by the bonds the faithfulness of wives to their husbands. The other account, that Tyndareus punished the goddess with fetters because he thought that from Aphrodite had come the shame of his daughters, I will not admit for a moment. For it were surely altogether silly to expect to punish the goddess by making a cedar figure and naming it Aphrodite.\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 3. 15. 10 The temple of Aphrodite in Sparta was regarded to be peculiar in the rest of Greece because the goddess was depicted in full armour. However, it is acknowledged that all the gods and goddesses depicted in Sparta was wearing armour, and though this may not have been technically true, it was regarded as a Spartan trait.

It has been integrated into many coupled climate system models as well as global ocean and weather forecasting models and is often used as a tool in Arctic and Southern Ocean research. CICE development began in the mid-1990s by the United States Department of Energy (DOE), and it is currently maintained and developed by a group of institutions in North America and Europe known as the CICE Consortium. Its widespread use in earth system science in part owes to the importance of sea ice in determining Earth's planetary albedo, the strength of the global thermohaline circulation in the world's oceans, and in providing surface boundary conditions for atmospheric circulation models, since sea ice occupies a significant proportion (4-6%) of earth's surface. CICE is a type of cryospheric model. Development Output from CICE within a coupled climate model: Averaged 2000-2004 (a) March and (b) September Antarctic sea ice thickness and extent (sea ice with greater than 15% concentration) of five ensemble members from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) large ensemble. The magenta contour is the measured ice edge according to the NOAA Climate Data Record. Development of CICE began in 1994 by Elizabeth Hunke at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Since its initial release in 1998 following development of the Elastic-Viscous-Plastic (EVP) sea ice rheology within the model, it has been substantially developed by an international community of model users and developers. Enthalpy-conserving thermodynamics and improvements to the sea ice thickness distribution were added to the model between 1998 and 2005. The first institutional user outside of LANL was Naval Postgraduate School in the late-1990s, where it was subsequently incorporated into the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) in 2011. The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) was the first to incorporate CICE into a global climate model in 2002, and developers of the NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM) have continued to contribute to CICE innovations and have used it to investigate polar variability in Earth's climate system. The United States Navy began using CICE shortly after 2000 for polar research and sea ice forecasting and it continues to do so today. Since 2000, CICE development or coupling to oceanic and atmospheric models for weather and climate prediction has occurred at the University of Reading, University College London, the U.K. Met Office Hadley Centre, Environment and Climate Change Canada, the Danish Meteorological Institute, the Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organisation, and Beijing Normal University, among other institutions. As a result of model development in the global community of CICE users, the model's computer code now includes a comprehensive saline ice physics and biogeochemistry library that incorporates mushy-layer thermodynamics, anisotropic continuum mechanics, Delta-Eddington radiative transfer, melt-pond physics and land-fast ice. CICE version 6 is open-source software and was released in 2018 on GitHub.  Keystone Equations  There are two main physics equations solved using numerical methods in CICE that underpin the model's predictions of sea ice thickness, concentration and velocity, as well as predictions made with many equations not shown here giving, for example, surface albedo, ice salinity, snow cover, divergence, and biogeochemical cycles. The first keystone equation is Newton's second law for sea ice: m\\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf{u}}{d t}=-mf\\\\mathrm{k}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{u}+\\\\tau_a+\\\\tau_w-m\\\\mathrm{\\\\hat{g}} abla\\\\mu+ abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma} where m is the mass per unit area of saline ice on the sea surface, \\\\mathbf{u} is the drift velocity of the ice, f is the Coriolis parameter, \\\\mathrm{k} is the upward unit vector normal to the sea surface, \\\\tau_a and \\\\tau_w are the wind and water stress on the ice, respectively, \\\\mathrm{\\\\hat{g}} is acceleration due to gravity, \\\\mu is sea surface height and \\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma} is internal ice the two-dimensional stress tensor within the ice. Each of the terms require information about the ice thickness, roughness, and concentration, as well as the state of the atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers. Ice mass per unit area m is determined using the second keystone equation in CICE, which describes evolution of the sea ice thickness distribution g(h) for different thicknesses h spread of the area for which sea ice velocity is calculated above: \\\\frac{dg}{dt}=\\\\theta + \\\\psi - g( abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u}) where \\\\theta is the change in the thickness distribution due to thermodynamic growth and melt, \\\\psi is redistribution function due to sea ice mechanics and is associated with internal ice stress \\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma}, and -g( abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u}) describes advection of sea ice in a Lagrangian reference frame. From this, ice mass is given by: m=\\\\rho\\\\int_0^\\\\infty h \\\\, g(h) \\\\, dh for density \\\\rho of sea ice. Code Design 243x243px CICE version 6 is coded in FORTRAN90. It is organized into a dynamical core (dycore) and a separate column physics package called Icepack, which is maintained as a CICE submodule on GitHub. The momentum equation and thickness advection described above are time-stepped on a quadrilateral Arakawa B-grid within the dynamical core, while Icepack solves diagnostic and prognostic equations necessary for calculating radiation physics, hydrology, thermodynamics, and vertical biogeochemistry, including terms necessary to calculate \\\\tau_a, \\\\tau_w, \\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma}, \\\\theta, and \\\\psi defined above. CICE can be run independently, as in the first figure on this page, but is frequently coupled with earth systems models through an external flux coupler, such as the CESM Flux Coupler from NCAR for which results are shown in the second figure for the CESM Large Ensemble. The column physics were separated into Icepack for the version 6 release to permit insertion into earth system models that use their own sea ice dynamical core, including the new DOE Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), which uses an unstructured grid in the sea ice component of the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS), as demonstrated in the final figure.

The Trocadero was built during the boom economy of the late 1880s in response to a fad for indoor roller skating. The Sands Directory includes listings for at least 25 roller skating rinks in Sydney for the years 1889 & 1890\\\\. The Trocadero was reputed to be the biggest and best. It was certainly very elaborate and was purpose built as a skating rink unlike many others. During the depression of the 1890s most rinks closed. In 1891 Sands lists only two rinks under \\"Places of Amusement\\". The Trocadero closed in 1893. It was left empty until coach builder Sydney Simpson bought the building in 1895 and used it for his own business while leasing space to several other small businesses. In 1903, the building re-opened as Williams Skating Rink and Music Hall, having been thoroughly renovated. The extent of redecoration at this time is not known but the spaces between the rink and the shops on King Street was completely re-arranged including the entry through no 73 King St. There was a separate entry for the second floor which was used as factory spaces and a residence. It was purchased by the Grace family (of Grace Bros department stores) in 1909 and renamed Elite Rink and Cafe Trocadero. The building later operated at various times as the Trocadero Picture Palace and as a venue for vaudeville shows and boxing. The Sydney University Women's Settlement used the upper club room as a centre for soldiers wives and mothers between 1916 and 1922. Propert's Motor Body Company Limited moved into No 73 in 1920 and leased the hall as part of their workshops in 1927. By 1922 Propert's were the major motorcar works in the area with some 60 employees. They purchased the building in 1945 and continued its occupation until the firm's closure in 1979, after which time a motor repair business occupied the site. In 1976, the building was purchased by the Anglican Church of Australia for the Moore Theological College. In 1981, they leased the building to a secondhand furniture business. The building was vacated for a planned fire safety renovation in 1994, and subsequently remained disused and neglected for many years until the college carried out an extensive restoration of the building in 2006. In February 2014, it was leased as offices to children's cancer charity CanTeen. The college advertised the building for sale in 2017, ultimately selling the building to CanTeen for $13 million. The shops to King Street have been utilized by many different occupants and businesses since construction in 1889 including refreshment rooms, confectioners, clothing shops, bootmaker, saddler and second hand furniture showroom. The original billiard saloon and club rooms have been used by various factories, the soldiers wives and mothers, residence and studio.Design 5 Architects 1995  Description  The Trocadero consists of a three-storey commercial/residential building facing King Street, and a large hall at the rear with access to both King and Campbell Streets. The two sections are linked by a two-storey vestibule flanked by service spaces. The southern section of the building facing King Street is of rendered brick construction with a mansard roof clad in corrugated steel roofing. The King Street facade is built in a highly decorated Flemish style overlaid with Victoria Free Gothic style details. The arrangement is five bays wide and symmetrical about an oriel window at first floor level. However, at ground level the central opening has been altered so that the western pier no longer connects to the ground as it originally did. The facade is divided into three levels. At ground level there are three shop fronts, the two eastern ones being original with fine timber framing and large areas of glass. The entry doors to these two shops are set back from the facade, a detail typical of the period. The western shopfront is a replacement from the mid 20th century. The adjacent shop front has been removed, the opening enlarged and a roller shutter installed. At the first floor level the windows are Gothic in form and are arranged symmetrically about the central oriel window. At the second floor level, elaborate Flemish style gabled dormer windows project from the mansard roof above a parapet. Externally the skating rink/hall is of face brick construction with circular arched window openings. The rear elevation to Campbell Street is symmetrical in arrangement with a classical appearance. There is evidence of a covered verandah having been removed from the skating rink level of this elevation. At street level the openings have been altered several times with the installation of roller shutters and fire egress doors. Windows introduced below the two central arched windows at the skating rink level during the mid twentieth century have caused structural instability in the outer brick skin of the wall due to the lack of suitable lintels. Semi-circular arched windows are arranged at regular intervals along the eastern and western walls of the hall. Windows have been introduced during the mid 20th century. At the rear of the easternmost shop is the substantial remaining portion of an earlier terrace house. This was built of much softer and redder brick than the rest of the building, and is thickly rendered and marked out as ashlar. This terrace house still shares its roof with its pair on the neighbouring allotment. The interior finishes are generally of plastered brickwork and the ceilings of timber boarding. The floors of the shops are of concrete but with upper floors timber. The ceilings in the former billiard saloon feature very bold diamond shaped panels of timber boarding and ventilated metal ceiling roses. There is evidence of the original location of the stairs behind the westernmost shop and the second shop from the east. The two staircases appear to have been moved from their original 1889 location and re-configured to suit the new location. Both are of timber with fine newel posts and turned balusters. There is also evidence of the cupola roof structure over the centre of the large second floor room. The spaces immediately behind the original shop front rooms have been altered extensively except for the remains of the terrace already mentioned and the high top-lit vestibule which connects the front of the building with the former skating rink hall. This vestibule retains its clerestory windows and roof structure and evidence of stairs on the east and west walls to a now removed landing and doorways. Internally the eastern terrace survives relatively intact beyond the front shops and retains its fine mid C19th geometric timber stair and most of its joinery, flooring, plasterwork and one chimney piece. Beyond the front range of building is a large timber floored iron roofed hall. The roof sheeting is visible from below and is supported by a row of fine wrought iron trusses, spanning clear across the space. These trusses in turn support a raised central roof with clerestory windows either side extending almost the full length of the hall. The trusses are fixed at their supports by iron straps bolted through the walls. Remains of a perimeter gallery with timber floor and cast and wrought iron brackets survives but with the balustrade missing. The gallery brackets are also fixed to the iron straps. Evidence exists for the original location of the stairs from this gallery to the north end of the space. The northern half of the hall is filled with a makeshift mezzanine structure at this gallery level while the southern half is open. The northern end of the hall floor retains the remains of the narrow boarded floor which followed the line of the roller skating path around the hall. The remainder of this floor is either covered or replaced with later material. The walls t the hall are divided into regular bays by classical pilasters with Corinthian capitals and a high base. The walls are plastered brickwork. Within most of the bays are arched recesses above the gallery level and square ones below. The main cornice to the walls has fine moulded plaster medallions, some of the recesses are pierced by original windows (some sheeted externally). Or later windows. At each end of the hall is a raised cornice section on pilasters surmounted by a large semi-circular fanlight fitted with timber windows. Evidence exists of the picture theatre use. Much of the damage to plasterwork appears to result from the most recent use as a second hand furniture shop. There are regular gaslight outlets around the walls. Beneath the large hall and accessed from it by a broad timber stair is a concrete floored space with a roller shuttered access door and another timber door to Campbell Street. The space extends to approximately half the length of the hall above. The walls are plastered brickwork with later infill work at the north east corner in painted brickwork. The ceiling is generally boarded and where exposed the roof structure above is packed with sawdust between the joists, presumably as acoustic insulation against the skating rink. This structure is supported on plain steel columns.

Heritage listing  The Trocadero is a rare example of a purpose built roller skating rink of the late 1880s. At the time it was built it was also reputed to be the largest and most elegant rink in Australia. The wrought iron roof trusses over the rink are very fine, elegant and early examples, typical of railway buildings of the time, and represent the development of iron and steel technology in the late 19th century. The operable roof over the clerestory is also of technological significance and extremely rare in Australia, possibly unique. The building is a rare Sydney example of a Victorian Flemish style commercial building with free style Gothic detailing. Trocadero was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 March 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Trocadero is a rare example of a purpose built roller skating rink of the late 1880s At the time it was built it was also reputed to be the largest and most elegant rink in Australia.The retention of the 1857-60 terraces within the structure of the Trocadero building, the building of the elaborate King Street facade and Hall in the boom time of the mid 1880s in response to the fad for indoor roller skating, the demise of that use in the 1893 depression years and the subsequent variety of uses such as Propert's Motorcar works, etc. are a significant record of the history of King Street, Newtown and the fluctuations in economic fortunes of the state from 1857 up to and including the current fire order on the building. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Trocadero is a wonderful and rare example of a Victorian Flemish style commercial building with free style Gothic detailing. The building contributes greatly to the nineteenth century streetscape of King Street, newtown, being one of the most elaborate facades in the street. The bulk and industrial/warehouse nature of the Campbell Street facade dominates that streetscape. The interior retains several significant spaces: the skating rink hall, the billiards saloon, the second floor club room and tower (demolished), and the vestibule. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building contains the remnants of terrace housing, a hall associated with the social and recreational life of the local community of Newtown and the wider Sydney community for over twenty years, shops and meeting spaces used by a wide section of the community variously for social functions, refuge, residence and factories and is associated with the development of the motor car industry in NSW through Propert's use and ownership of the building. The building is a significant record of the response and adaption of community and commercial sectors to the fluctuation of the economy of NSW from 1889 to 1998. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The skating rink features a very light weight roof supported by fine wrought iron trusses spanning across the building. Iron straps bolted through brick piers transfer the load to the ground. The internal balcony is supported off the same straps and piers. The roof and its structure is fully visible from floor level. The design of the wrought iron trusses is early and similar to railway construction although the roof and structure as a whole is unusual. The smaller clerestorey roof runs almost the length of the hall and could be opened by turning a crank to allow the two sides to slide back over the main roof structure. The mechanism is still sustantially intact. It may be that this type of mechanism, once common in European theatres and very rare in Australia is unique and therefore highly significant. It is reputed that the whole of the building was lit by electricity when opened in 1889. As no general supply was available this must have been by generator on an adjacent site. This has not been confirmed by physical evidence of wiring . Gas lighting was introduced in 1903. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building is a rare Sydney example of a Victorian Flemish style commercial building with free style Gothic detailing. The operable roof over the clerestory is extremely rare in Australia, possibly unique. The building is probably the last remaining purpose built skating rink of the late 1880s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. It is representative of, and reputed to be, the largest and most elegant purpose built rink in Australia of the mid to late 1880s. The fine wrought iron trusses and brackets are representative of the iron and steel technology of the late 19th century.

It was a significant shrine of Artemis and arguably the foremost center of her cult in Northern Greece. Archeological excavations reveal the date of founding to the 6th-century BC. The sanctuary is mentioned by ancient authors from the 3rd-century BC until the 3rd-century AD. According to Callimachus in the 3rd century BC, the temple was established by AgamemnonCallimachus, Iambi Fragment 6a (trans. Trypanis) and often referred to as the temple of Artemis Kolainis (Hornless), \\"because Agamemnon sacrificed to her a hornless ram made of wax.\\"Callimachus, Iambi Fragment 6b (from Scholiast on Aristophanes' Birds 873) Strabo described the sanctuary: :\\"The village Amarynthos, which is seven stadia distant from the walls [of Eretria in Euboia], belongs to this city . . . As for the power the Eretrians once had, this is evidenced by the pillar which they once set up in the temple of Artemis Amarynthia. It was inscribed thereon that they made their festal procession with three thousand heavy-armed soldiers, six hundred horsemen, and sixty chariots. And they ruled over the peoples of Andros, Teos, Keos, and other islands.\\"Strabo, Geography 10. 1. 10 (trans. Jones) The temple was the center for the cult of Artemis in Northern Greece, and the destination for the annual procession from Eretria during festival of Amarysia. Pausanias described the shrine as the place where the main festival of Amarysia took place in the honor of Artemis, though he stated that the Amarysia celebrated in Athens was \\"no less splendid than the Euboian.\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 1. 31. 5 (trans. Jones) Aelian stated in the 3rd-century that \\"The people of Eretria [in Euboia] sacrifice maimed animals to Artemis at Amarynthos.\\"Aelian, On Animals 12. 34 (trans. Scholfield) If the temple was still in use by the 4th-century, it would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, when laws against non- Christian religions and their sanctuaries where enacted by the Christian emperors. Researchers have been trying to locate the remains of the temple since the 19th-century. However, using the description made by Strabo, who claimed the temple to be seven stadia (1.5 kilometers or 1 mile) from the town of Eretria, the temple could not be located until excavations made since 2007 has been confirmed to be of the temple. The site was finally located at the foot of the Palaioekklisies hill near the small fishing town of Amarynthos on the Greek island of Euboea, about 10 km from the place where the temple was wrongly thought to be located.https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2017/09/lost-greek-temple- found-on-greek-island.html#LEmVVED1ctoeYdkP.99 The remains has revealed structures from the 6th-century to the second BC, containing an underground fountain, inscribed bases, sealed tiles, and coins containing the name \\"Artemis\\".

Rashwan began his career in Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in early 80s as a researcher and has been an expert scholar over there since then and many years later in 2011 he became the Director of the Center. Rashwan was a dissident during the Mubarak era, and was a founding member of Kefaya movement which was the seed of the 2011 revolution. Rashwan is also a member of the board of trustees of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights since the 1980s. In 2010 he nominated himself in the parliamentary elections against the candidate of the ruling National Democratic Party contesting the seat of Armant, however he lost to the NDP candidate due to widespread rigging of the elections by Mubarak's government. In March 2013 Rashwan was elected president of the Egyptian Press Syndicate however he failed to secure a reelection for a second term. Rashwan as chief of the Press Syndicate strongly opposed the government of President Mohamed Morsi and was an ardent supporter of the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état. Rashwan was chosen to be appointed to the 50-member constitution committee during the second transitional period to draft Egypt's current constitution. The constitution was later approved by popular referendum in January 2014.

Early life and education  Stephanie Skalisky was born in Sacramento, California. She is part Polish, part Czech on her father's side, part Italian on her mother's side and, in her own words, \\"part of an old Sacramento family that breeds like rabbits.\\" She started pursuing her art at a young age by painting on the glass windows of her childhood home. Her mother and teachers at Shingle Springs Elementary School noticed her aptitude for art early on and encouraged her to pursue her talent. Her early art teachers believed in her so much she was encouraged to paint in a room separate from the other students. After changing schools when she was sixteen, Skalisky would work on art rather than sit in the cafeteria alone. Skalisky was encouraged to find her own unique style by her art teachers at the high schools she attended. Later Stephanie Skalisky went to receive her BA and an MFA in art at California State University, Sacramento. During her schooling, Skalisky spent nine months in Italy, studying art.  Career  Skalisky made her start as a cartoonist when she was recognized for her \\"unusual vision\\" by Lee Lorenz,The New Yorker's art editor at the time. Skalisky was exhibiting self-portrait of herself as George Washington during a trip to San Francisco when she was found by Lorenz. Lorenz urged her to submit drawings to The New Yorker after seeing one of her exhibits in California. Before being encouraged by Lorenz, Skalisky says she never thought of cartoons as art and never imagined doing cartoons as a job. Skalisky was active with The New Yorker from October 2, 1989 – February 22, 1993 and sold more than 30 cartoons to them within that time. Skalisky is also credited for using her watercolors to paint some covers for The New Yorker. One of which is The New Yorker's 1991 holiday special that depicts a Santa Clause playing a slot machine. Other Specific ones are unknown and unaccredited to her. She also has sold 8 cartoons to PULSE! magazine, a music critic-focused magazine based out of Sacramento, California. Skaliksy's authentic cartoons are known to sell for $500 and up while her watercolor covers for $3,000. Despite living out of the public eye, since 1991, Skalisky has been teaching art to adults with disabilities at Short Center North in Sacramento. As of 2014, she is still mentoring students and exhibiting art with them. As of 2018, she still presents at several galleries in Sacrament, California, including Gallery 2110.  Style and themes  Skalisky has defined her own art style as an \\"odd mix of neurotic, sarcastic off-colored humor that even when I was a kid was funny to me and very accessible\\". Skalisky owes a lot of her humor to the women in her family before her and says \\"[My humor] is a survival mechanism that genetically got passed on to me\\". During her time at California State University, Skalisky was inspired greatly by art historian John Fitz Gibbon. This professor influenced Skalisky's love for Italian primitives and painters of the trecento. According to Donnelly's \\"Funny Ladies: The New Yorker's Greatest Women Cartoonists and Their Cartoons\\", Skalisky's art style has been described as similar to Roz Chast's, another female comics creator for The New Yorker, work. Skalisky's work has also been described as \\"Chast on drugs\\". According to Renee Crist's \\"Skalisky Leaping\\", Skalisky draws from the pop culture of the 1990s. It has been described as a \\"startling blend of trash culture stuff and classicism.\\" Skalisky Skalisky juxtaposes various components in her compositions to draw interest and uncomfortability from her viewers. Although Skalisky is more well known for her cartoons with The New Yorker, she also exhibited what she calls her fine arts, a distinction from her cartoons she is adamant to make. Glass painting, carving, watercolor painting and drawing are the art mediums that Skalisky defines as her \\"fine arts\\". Some of Skaliksy's favorite work is polychromes on wood paneling carvings that have been known to sell for $3,500.  Awards and exhibitions   Grants and awards  One of Skalisky's earliest awards was third place at the California State Exposition Competition in 1983 in the Mixed Media category. Skalisky has received two grants from the Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission. The first grant was for a project using layered glass shadow boxes in 1988, and the second was for a limited edition alphabet book that Skalisky made using watercolors titled The Alphabet for Extraordinary Children and Eccentric Adults which was exhibited in 1989. Both of these works were presented in The Himovitz Gallery, a subdivision of The Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission . In 1991, she took first place in the Visual Arts category for the Dewar's Young Artist Recognition Award for her work in wood carving. In 1997, Skalisky was the recipient of a \\"New Works\\" grant awarded by the Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission.  Exhibitions  Skalisky has shown at the Recent Acquisitions of the Achenbach Foundation show, which was held at the California Legion of Honor in San Francisco in 1987. Skalisky has also had one work that was in a show at the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco in 1987 called Self Portrait of my Father. The Himovitz in Sacramento, California has had many shows that include both Skalisky's fine arts as well as her cartoons and sketches. As of 1990, she has had group and one-person shows at the Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles, the Parsons School of Design in New York, the Hatley-Martin Gallery in San Francisco and the Himovitz Gallery in Sacramento. Her work is included in several museums, most notably the Achenbach Foundation collection at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. In 1991, The Himovitz housed the exhibit titled \\"Recent drawings and wood panel work, drawings from The New Yorker,\\". Skalisky worked with an after-school program, along with Steve Vanoni, in which the students painted various furniture to present to the audience in the exhibit titled \\"Funartchair,\\" as a fundraiser for the Grant High School art workshops. In 2000, Some of Skalisky's work was exhibited in a dinner venue/ art bar, named Pegase Restaurant, as the talking piece of a table made out of a shadow box. Although the work is not identified as to which one is on this abnormal display, it was rumored to be sold for $1,200, not including the shadow box. In 2004, Skalisky showed work titled Some People Just Disappear at the Solomon Dubnick Gallery. Skalisky showed art in a 2006 exhibit titled \\"Everything Nice\\", which was a feminist art work by only woman artists at the Toyroom Gallery. Skalisky was said to be a part of an exhibit at the Pence Art Gallery named Shimmer in 2010. In 2014, Stephanie was also part of a group exhibit titled The Point of No Return at FE Gallery. In 2015 she presented in a group show with her artwork, \\"ice fishing\\" at Gallery 2110.

He is known mainly from his activities in England and France. He was the chief financier of King Edward II of England from 1312 until 1319. Pessagno belonged to a family of vicecomital rank long established in Genoa. The names of his parents, however, are unknown. His date of birth can be estimated by the fact that he was not yet 25 years old in 1313. His wife, Leona, belonged to the powerful Fieschi family, and his brother Emanuele became the hereditary admiral of Portugal in 1317. His own naval experience recommended him to Edward II's ministers. In 1306–07, Pessagno was established in England as an exporter of wool. By 1310, he was supplying the royal court with luxury goods, such as spices, and modest loans. By 1311 no Italian merchant in England had more money on hand: 12,000 florins of Florence. In that year he became the first foreigner to take possession of the English crown jewels, including the Eagle Crown, as security on his loans. When the Lords Ordainers forced the Florentine firm of the Frescobaldi into bankruptcy before the end of the year, Pessagno was in a position to become, as a royal document of 5 April 1312 styles him, \\"the king's merchant\\" (mercator regis). At that time, the king already owed him £2,086. On 10 October 1312, he returned the crown jewels to the treasury. On 16 February 1313, a Frescobaldi agent could write that Pessagno \\"fears nobody … and is so generous in the court … that everybody likes him\\". By 1313 the king's debt had grown to £7,380. In 1313–14, Pessagno received on behalf of Edward II the loans advanced by King Philip IV of France and Pope Clement V. He himself then loaned the king £21,000. These monies were used to finance the invasion of Scotland in June 1314. Pessagno also provided more than half the supplies used by the army. For his part in the Scottish war, Edward II knighted him on 1 November 1315. During the Great Famine of 1315–17, Pessagno imported grain from the Mediterranean, much of it for the castles on the Scottish border. He held a monopsony (monopoly of purchase) on tin in Devon and Cornwall until 1316, when it was taken away following complaints. He was appointed seneschal of Gascony on 17 November 1317, but after a year he was removed from office following complaints against him by the Gascons in November 1318. By April 1320 his fall from grace was complete and he left England. He had not got on well with the Despensers, Edward II's new favourites. During the period lasting from April 1312 through January 1319, Pessagno loaned a total of £143,579 to the king—a higher annual average than any other royal banker under Edward I and Edward II. The interest he accrued, in the form of pledged \\"gifts\\", came to at least £6,782. During the War of Saint-Sardos rumours circulated that Pessagno was planning a naval attack on England with Genoese and Portuguese ships. After the fall of Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer in October 1330, Pessagno returned to England and was with the royal court at Christmas. He was recognized with the rank of banneret. Through the intervention of William Montagu, Earl of Salisbury, he secured repayment of an outstanding £8,141. Perhaps he had assisted Montagu in overthrowing Isabella and Mortimer. Pessagno is last heard of when he was acting as an English envoy to the Papacy in 1334.

Derived from Japanese wattle and daub (木舞, 小舞), Bamboo-mud wall differs from Japanese processor in its materiality, using bamboo instead of wood for woven lattice.  History  In conjunction of modernization, the Japanese built large concrete public buildings throughout Taiwan, at the same time, Japanese officials and government employees from mainland Japan demanded a significant amount of housing. To solve this need, the Government-General in Taiwan issued Standard Building Drawings of Officer’s Residences in 1922, and thus built a large number of standard housings based on traditional Japanese wood structures. Non governmental houses followed this technique soon afterwards. The transformation from Japanese wattle and daub to Taiwanese Bamboo-mud wall, is due to the fundamental difference of climate and flora between two regions. Although largely built on the island of Taiwan, some are torn down during the World War II to prevent wildfire among wood structures during Allies's heavy raid on Taipei and other cities. These houses applying Bamboo-mudwall flourished until 1945, when Allied took over Taiwan from Japan's reign. Republic of China (Taiwan) soon retreated from Chinese Civil War and relocate the government to Taiwan, houses built for Japanese officials serve the new government's officials seamlessly, as a result, many of the houses are kept intact and taken cared of.  Description  Isometric sectional construction view of bamboo-mud wall. Bamboo-mud wall is a common filling in wood frame walls found in Taiwan. Bamboo wattle reinforce mud wall structure by weaving themselves together, including thicker, wider horizontal strips called lî-kīng (籬梗) and thinner, narrower horizontal strips called lî-á (籬仔). For larger walls, builders add timber strips, about 6 cm in width, called àm-kīng (暗梗) between vertical frame edge columns to facilitate adhesion of mud to the housing structure. Similarly to àm-kīng, there are sometimes horizontal reinforcing timber strips locked on the columns called tshīng-á (穿仔). Generally speaking, lî-kīngs are 24 –30 cm apart from one another, and àm- kīngs are added for spans over 45 cm. Mud is cured compound composed with clay and chaff, daubed onto the bamboo wattle on both sides, roughly 3.5 to 4.5 cm thick altogether. Hemp plaster daubed last for finish layer.  Conservation  # Light intervention: reapplying hemp plaster and surface clay and chaff. # Medium intervention: reapplying hemp plaster and most of the clay and chaff, but not the bamboo strips. # Deep intervention: involving new bamboo strips and reweaving thoroughly. Before the conservation, an evaluation on timber frame integrity and load path continuity is necessary. And if new bamboo strips are to be used, they should have anticorrosive and fireproof treatment beforehand. During conservation, should apply same weaving pattern of bamboo strips to prevent structural alteration; if there are pipelines in the wall, a layer of hemp net should apply on the pipes to reinforce the adhesion; and the contraction of clay should be calculated and refined after drying. After conservation, many examples in Taiwan left a half-opened wall to demonstrate the traditional technology for educational purposes.

It was designed by architects Sulman & Power and built from 1892 to 1924, with Bignell and Clark responsible for the initial construction. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 April 2005.  History  Aboriginal associations with the site now known as the University of Sydney Material in rock shelters reveals that Aboriginal people inhabited the Sydney region at least from 20,000 years ago. About 3,000 years ago there appears to have been a major population increase of Aboriginal people in the area (and elsewhere throughout Australia), suggested by the evidence of many camp sites that seem to have come into use from that time.Haglun, 1996 The traditional owners of the Sydney city region are the Cadigal people.http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/barani/themes/theme1.htm The foundation of the British penal colony at Sydney Cove in 1788 allied with the effects of a smallpox epidemic in 1789-1791 caused a massive disintegration of Aboriginal social structure around Sydney within the first decade of colonisation. Although there are accounts of some of the interactions between the early British arrivals and the indigenous people by writers such as Collins, Tench and Dawes, Aboriginal concepts of the cultural meanings of the Sydney landscape and its features were not recorded in detail. Other information about Aboriginal culture in Sydney before colonisation is embedded in physical traces left from their activities in the daily round of getting, preparing and eating food. No such traces have yet been recorded by the National Parks and Wildlife Service within the grounds of the University of Sydney, which is sited just four kilometres from Sydney Cove. The cleared land policy for the edge of the stockade meant that much evidence of Aboriginal occupation in this part of Sydney is long buried. Further information is held within the oral history traditions of surviving Aboriginal families from the area. Dennis Foley from the University of Sydney's Koori Centre points out that the University of Sydney is situated between two Aboriginal tracks which were paved over to become Parramatta Road and City Road. According to family stories he has been told, the land in the corner where these tracks met, now known as Victoria Park, was an important \\"sit down\\" site for indigenous people because of the fresh water provided by its natural springs. That land, now adjacent to the main campus of the university, continued in this function as a meeting place for some years even after the British occupation until Aboriginal people were forcibly removed around 1820. There are several archaeological studies planned for different heritage sites within the university and these are likely to uncover further evidence of the Aboriginal occupation of the land. For example, Foley considered that there might be some indigenous women's sites in the vicinity of the Women's College. The University of Sydney and its affiliated colleges The University of Sydney was the first university in the Australian colonies. The preamble to its 1850 Act of Incorporation enunciated the social and non-sectarian context in which its educational objects were to be promoted: 'to hold forth to all classes and denominations of Her Majesty's subjects resident in New South Wales, without any distinction whatsoever, an encouragement for pursuing a regular and liberal course of education'. The University of Sydney had features of both the University of London and the Queen's Colleges in Ireland, combining secular teaching by the University with provision for independent denominational colleges. It was a system never tried anywhere before. An 1854 Act to provide for the establishment and endowment of Colleges within the University of Sydney specified the colleges' role: to provide \\"systematic religious instruction, and domestic supervision, with efficient assistance in preparing for the University lectures and examinations\\". In 1855 the University was granted 126 acres at Grose Farm, as a site for its own buildings and to enable it to make sub-grants for affiliated colleges of the four major denominations (Church of England, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian and Wesleyan). In 1881 the University of Sydney Senate resolved to open the University to women \\"on an equal basis with men\\", following the lead of the University of Adelaide in 1877. Melbourne did likewise in the same year and quickly provided residential accommodation for women when Dr Alexander Leeper, the Warden of Trinity College, persuaded his Council to establish the 'Trinity Women's Hostel', the first university hostel for women in Australia, which opened in 1886. A permanent building was opened in 1891 but it was not until 1961 that Janet Clarke Hall (as it was renamed in 1921) became an independent affiliated college of the University of Melbourne. A College for Women When moves began in Sydney to provide accommodation for women students it was on a different basis from the University of Melbourne model. A collegiate residence for women was proposed by a group of University and professional men and in May 1887 a public meeting resolved that a \\"College for Women\\" should be established under the terms of the 1854 Colleges Endowment Act but that it would be not be attached to any religious denomination. No change to the 1854 Colleges Endowment Act was necessary to accommodate such a college but because of the Act's requirement for \\"systematic religious instruction\\", the new college was subject to the provision that \\"no religious catechism or formulary distinctive of any particular denomination\\" should be taught. The College was to be non-denominational, but not without religion. The proposal was practical (it was unlikely that there would be enough women students to support separate denominational colleges), was in accord with current educational philosophy, exemplified in Parkes' 1880 Education Act and was financially astute. As an affiliated college of the University, the College for Women would be eligible for a government building subsidy (matching public subscriptions) and for an annual endowment for the Principal's salary. In 1889 the \\"College for Women\\" was established and endowed by the New South Wales legislature and being named in its Act as 'The Women's College' had to use this name thereafter. By 1891 sufficient funds had been raised to meet the conditions of the Endowment Act and the first College Council was elected. Louisa Macdonald, a Scot and classical scholar, was appointed principal at the end of 1891 and arrived in Sydney in March 1892 when the College opened in temporary premises in Glebe. Australia's first university was now home to the first University college for women in Australia. It had just four students. The site and building designs In July 1891 the College Council requested a site for the College within the University grounds and eventually accepted a treeless paddock with a frontage to Bligh Street (later Carillon Avenue) next to St Paul's College. Like the other colleges, the Women's College would be located at the furthest remove from the University and without any direct means of access to it. In October 1891 a sub-committee of the Council invited plans for the new building in a limited architectural competition and four months later recommended designs by the firm of Sulman and Power. Opposition from fellow Councillors and public criticism from members of the architectural profession for conflict of interest in its selection procedures caused any decisions to be held over until the arrival of the new Principal, when, working with a new committee, Sulman and Power were formally appointed the college's architects. Work began in December 1892 and the new building was officially opened in May 1894. The new building The building committee broke away from the sandstone Gothic Revival architecture of the University, choosing instead the \\"Federation Free Classical\\" style, appropriate to the climate and to the College's finances. Essentially domestic in style and arrangement, the building was more akin to a large family residence than an educational institution. Even the Principal's quarters were comparatively modest for her rank (thanks to the College Endowment Act) as the highest paid woman in New South Wales. As originally built, the College housed twenty-six students, the Principal and five domestic staff. The design owed much to that of the Thomas Walker Convalescent Hospital at Concord, recently completed by Sulman and Power, and an obvious and much commented on connection between the firm, the Women's College Treasurer James Walker and one of its major donors, Eadith Walker. The grounds Work began on the grounds began in 1893. The main element of the landscaping was contributed by the architects whose design accommodated the sloping site by creating four levels linked by steep banks: an upper level to the east of the main building; the platform for the main building; the entrance drive; and the lower garden. These terraces and banks created a dominant but entirely artificial setting for the College in an otherwise featureless landscape, facing west towards St Andrew's College and ignoring the street frontage. The first trees, a long row bordering the lawn on the western boundary, were \\"ceremonially planted by a number of men and women whose names were more or less closely connected with the history of the University and the College\\" in the winter of 1893. Plants, shrubs, bulbs and flower cuttings were provided by well wishers, including James Walker and his wife from their home, Rosemont in Woollahra while trees and shrubs were supplied from the Thomas Walker Convalescent Hospital. Slow progress and plans for the future When the new building opened in 1894 the College had six students and it was not until about 1906 that it was fully occupied. The earliest students came mainly from Sydney and its suburbs and from Queensland and it was not until about 1911 that the College began to accommodate a significant number of country students. From the beginning, its academic stance was serious and scholarly but not without other diversions. In its earliest years, College students comprised 10-20% of all women in the University and made a substantial contribution to University sports teams and other student organisations. In 1909 the Council was considering the future and the College was granted an additional piece of land to the north of its existing grounds. By 1914 there was enough in the Extension Fund to request the remainder of the government endowment and a small \\"garden pavilion\\" ('Cottage') was built in 1916. In 1918 a house on Bligh Street (The Maples) was rented and was purchased the following year. When Louisa Macdonald retired in 1919, after twenty-seven years as the College's founding Principal, the Council resolved to erect an additional building 'in recognition of Miss Macdonald's services to the College and to the cause of women's education in Australia'. The proposal prompted consideration of what form any additions to the College should take. After a period of acute indecision the Council finally decided to forgo a master plan for future development based on the original design but instead to build more student rooms on the east side of the existing building and then to build a new dining hall as the Louisa Macdonald Commemoration. Joseph Porter Power, now in partnership with John Adam, continued as the College architect. Fifteen student rooms were completed in 1923 while additions to the servants' wing provided three more and quarters for the Bursar. The scale and design of the new dining hall, completed in the following year, announced the transition from \\"house\\" to College; from the domestic scale of the 1890s to the institution of the 1920s. With the completion of the Louisa Macdonald Commemoration Hall, the original dining room became a student common room and the common room at the other end of the building became an addition to the library. With the remaining funds from the government endowment, the back wing of The Maples was pulled down in 1928 and a three-storey wing added, providing accommodation for seventeen undergraduates, two graduates, a tutor, the gardener and a maid. 1920s-1930s Under Miss Macdonald the College community functioned as a late Victorian or Edwardian household with the Principal as its head. Its daily routine, begun with prayers, centred on the communality of meals. Changes instituted in 1919 by the new Principal, Susie Williams, transformed the College into a different institution, with additional administrative and academic staff and a more business like Council. The Maples was leased then purchased in 1918. Major alterations and additions occurred in 1928 with surplus funds from the government endowment funding the partial demolition of the back wing of The Maples and the addition of a three-storey wing providing accommodation for seventeen undergraduates, two graduates, a tutor, the gardener, Miss Warren, and a maid. In the summer vacation The Maples was used by staff and students who chose to remain in residence while the main College building closed for the holidays. In the inter-war period the College grounds matured, creating \\"an oasis in the drabness of an industrial suburb\\". The strength of the original landscaping was still visible, but softened by mature trees and shrubs. Memorials to former students, Mary Dunnicliff and Marjorie Gladwin, beautified the garden: a sandstone seat on the lowest terrace; and a sundial in the back quadrangle. Flags of stone or cement gradually replaced asphalt paths. In 1932 the area between the Principal's flat and the common room was transformed into a small brick paved courtyard. Miss Williams continued the tradition of inviting friends of the College to plant trees. Along the boundaries, fences were replaced and on the Carillon Avenue frontage an impressive brick wall was built. In 1936 the timber gates were replaced with wrought iron. By the early 1930s the College had over 70 students. The Great Depression caused a temporary decline in numbers but in 1936 the College was overfull and the Council decided to build. The Williams wing 1936-1937 The architect for the new wing was R. G. Simpson and the design was part of a larger scheme for future development, although there is no evidence that this was ever endorsed by the Council. A quadrangle, formed by the new wing, the dining hall and a cloister, following the line of the original terracing, was the focal point of the new accommodation which provided fifteen students' rooms, a visitor's room, large bathrooms and pantries. All of the student rooms faced inwards, leaving the corridor and services on the Carillon Avenue side where a 20-foot belt of trees gave protection from traffic noise and privacy from \\"the undesirable class of building opposite\\". With the construction of the connecting cloister, the ground to the west was excavated and that to the east was filled in, accentuating the difference in level between the two parts of the garden. The scale and materials of the new two-storey wing were in sympathy with the College's existing architecture with features such as the artificial stone dressing on the projecting bay providing visual links between the old and the new. In similar fashion the arches of the cloister were modelled on the verandah of the original building. Work began in November 1936 and the building, named the Susie Jane Williams Commemoration Wing in honour of the second Principal of the College (1919 to 1935) was officially opened on 6 July 1937. The expanding University 1920s-1930s In the 1920s and 1930s the University began to encroach on the colleges. Originally centred on the Main Quadrangle and then, from the 1880s, extending along Science Road, in the early 20th century major new science facilities were built at some distance from the main University buildings. Physics (completed in 1925) and the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine (opened in 1930) were both built on the south side of the hockey oval while the New Medical School (andopened in 1930) was sited close to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. In 1928 the rough road built by St Andrew's College from Bligh Street to their Principal's lodge was extended to the corner of the new Physics building to make the first part of Western Avenue, finally giving the Women's College a \\"street frontage\\", albeit within the University grounds. Wartime and its aftermath Restrictions, rationing, labour shortages and lack of materials made adequate maintenance of the College buildings almost impossible for the duration of World War II and even when the war ended there was little improvement. Only the most urgent repairs could be contemplated, if the necessary labour and materials could be found and basic maintenance took years to achieve, due to a shortage of good quality materials. Changing lifestyles Until the late 1940s the type of accommodation and pattern of communal living embodied in the design of the original College continued to be adaptable to contemporary needs. The College was supported by resident domestic staff and the other academic and administrative staff, of whom there were few, were single women and lived in ordinary College rooms. All meals were taken communally. By the late 1940s this style of domestic life was changing and so, with an increase in the size of the College, was the administration. An extension to the College was planned in the late 1940s, despite post-war restrictions, but fund raising was a slow process. Pressure on student accommodation continued. In 1954 the College had 89 students in residence and 14 in hostels in Carillon Avenue owned by Moore College. Reid wing 1958 Additional accommodation became a reality in 1955 thanks to a substantial private donation. The Council decided that the optimum size of the College would be about 150 \\"for the present\\", so that the whole student body could still be accommodated in the existing dining hall. Reid Wing, named in honour of its donor, was Ellice Nosworthy's first large commission for the College and provided rooms for 31 students, a small flat for the Assistant Principal and a common room and music rooms. It was the largest single increase in the size of the College in its history, enlarging the college community to 129 students, graduates and tutors. The Reid Wing was partially demolished and the rest refurbished in the mid 1990s. The Murray Report 1957 & AUC funding; 1958-1970 In 1957 the Commonwealth Government's Committee of Inquiry into the Future of Australian Universities, chaired by Sir Keith Murray proved the impetus and the means for a massive building programme within the University of Sydney and all its affiliated colleges. The College Council's initial response to AUC funding was another piecemeal solution. Additions were made to the Williams wing and to the staff quarters behind the kitchen and when these were completed in 1960 the College reached its target size of 150 students and tutors. In preparing submissions for funding in the 1964-1966 and 1967-1969 triennia the Council opted for radical change and decided to double the size of the College with a new residential wing for 120-130 students and an extension to the dining hall by J. L. S. Mansfield of Fowell, Mansfield & Maclurcan. Work began on the dining hall additions in January 1965, a flat-roofed extension, with low ceiling, on the south side of the existing hall. Some of the original windows and frames were reused in the new south wall. Changes to the Main building 1965 An important concomitant of the projected growth of the College was the impact that this would have on the administration, including the need to provide adequate out-of-hours coverage by residential staff. The use of the College during vacations also had a significant impact upon staff, managerial and maintenance requirements. The College had been used for educational conferences and meetings, and specifically for women's groups, from Miss Williams' time, albeit on a fairly small scale. By the time extensions to the College were planned in the 1960s the \\"conference trade\\" was an important adjunct to College finances. New facilities needed to serve a double purpose for students in term time and conferences and visitors in vacations. In 1965 the whole of the ground floor of the Main building was converted from residential to administrative office use. The Langley wing and the New Common Room 1964-1969 A major feature of the plan for the new accommodation was that it could be built in two stages, funded over two triennia of AUC grants. The location for the new four-storey building, designed in a Y-shape with a central stair, was the paddock. In addition to student rooms, there would also be small flats for tutors and provision for married couples. Stage 1 of the new residential wing, the central stair and south-east arm of the Y-shaped building, was occupied in Lent Term 1966 and to provide secure access between the new building and the old, a covered way was provided at first floor level, modelled on the arches of the original building, as R. G. Simpson had done in the 1930s. Work on Stage 2 of the new wing began in 1967 and was completed by 1969, bringing the number of student places in College to 251. The Women's College was now the largest residential college within the University of Sydney. The final part of the expansion scheme was a new common room, built on the site of the Cottage, which was demolished in December 1967. The design provided for a large, multi-purpose hall that could be used for theatrical performances, conferences, dances and other social functions. The Menzies Common Room was opened by Sir Robert Menzies on 5 July 1969 when the new wing was also officially opened and named in honour of Miss Langley. Following the completion of building works, the Menzies courtyard was landscaped and native trees and shrubs were planted around the Langley wing, with hibiscus on the west side of the north wing and a rose garden on the east. Social change in the 1960s-1970s The 1960s and 1970s saw considerable changes in social and sexual mores that were inevitably played out in College and University life. In 1973 all students were provided with keys to the front door security system. All students were now free to come and go, as and when they chose, and to bring visitors into College at any time. Such freedom came at a price and security, noise, the nature of community life, the limits of personal freedom and the costs of maintaining it were frequent topics of discussion. The conversion of the Maples into postgraduate accommodation in the 1970s was another significant step. Alterations and additions by architects Joseland and Gilling converted the building's living quarters into self-contained two-room units for married couples, or to twin share by students. The refurbishment program was completed in May 1971. In 1977 the Women's College went even further along the path of social change when it amended its Act to allow the admission of men to the College and the possible appointment of a male Principal. The College remained a College for women undergraduates, but admitted male graduates in the role of Tutors or Senior Residents. Fire safety and the computer revolution 1980s-1990s In the early 1980s work began on the long and expensive process of improving fire safety throughout the College, the need for which was emphasised early in 1989 when an arsonist set fire to the area beneath the dining hall, one of a number of such attacks in Sydney at the time. In the 1990s new fire stairs, sprinkler systems, self-closing doors and emergency lighting were installed throughout the College and The Maples. In the early 1990s the Principal Dr Ann Eyland, drew attention to the need to upgrade student computer facilities. The outcome was the concept of a Resource Centre, combining conventional library resources (still poorly housed in the Main building) with computer rooms and additional tutorial space. The design, by Gerry Rippon and Ken Reynolds, provided for a new building (on the site of the old Reid wing music rooms and bathrooms) with storage space in the basement, a reading room on the ground floor and new student rooms above. An addition to the south side of the remainder of Reid wing provided tutorial and meeting rooms with accommodation above, while the rest of the ground floor was remodelled as a part of the Resource Centre. The Vere Hole Resource Centre, named in honour of benefactor, College historian and former student Dr Vere Hole, was opened on 23 March 1996. Through the generosity of Mrs Caroline Simpson and members of the Fairfax family, the garden at the back of the Main building was landscaped and the old library rooms were remodelled and renamed the Miss Mary Elizabeth Fairfax Rooms, to complement the new work. The restoration of the Main building 1999-2001 By the late 1990s, after a century of use, the original building was in need of substantial repair and restoration and in 1998-1999 a Conservation and Management Plan was prepared by Otto Cserhalmi & Partners. A grant from the Commonwealth Government Federation Cultural Heritage Projects Program enabled major works to proceed, supported by additional funds raised by the College Foundation. This work included the: repair and conservation of brickwork and stonework; restoration of early rainwater goods and the conservation of the roof of the Main Common Room; restoration and repair of the front steps and landings in slate; removal of the bronze entry doors (installed in 1966) and making good the front entry porch; the replacement of floor and lights in the entrance hall and the installation of a new reception office; the replacement of floor and lights in the Main Common Room; and the refurbishment of study bedrooms. Otto Cserhalmi & Partners were the architects for the project, the completion of which was celebrated in May 2001.

Description  Building complex The Women's College comprises a collection of brick buildings set within landscaped gardens adjoining the grounds of other affiliated colleges of the University of Sydney. Seven phases of institutional building, carried out between 1892 and 1996, are represented on the site, demonstrating the growth of the College and changing architectural styles over more than a century. The original building was designed to accommodate 26 students and the College now houses over 280 students. ;Phase 1: Main Building 1892-1894: architects Sulman & Power The original (Main) building was completed in 1894 to the design of John Sulman and his partner, Joseph Porter Power and consists of an entrance hall, staff offices, Principal's accommodation, common rooms, meeting rooms, and student accommodation. It is a three-storey brick and stone building planned along an elongated north-south axis, terminating in a projecting wing with bay windows at the northern end and a four-storey Italianate tower at the southern end. Decorative sandstone elements on the sills, pediments, chimneys and column capitals are used as ornamental features. The red brickwork is laid in Flemish bond with tuck pointing. The Principal's Flat forms a small wing to the south west of the tower. The main building sits prominently and dramatically at the top of artificially constructed grassed terraces, affording views to the surrounding gardens. The building was designed in the \\"Free Federation Classical Style\\", a free interpretation of the Italian Renaissance style adapting elements from the Queen Anne period. The stylistic details of this original building are predominantly neo-Italian Renaissance. Although the original building has had many additions and alterations over the years it is still possible to identify the early fabric and components of the original design. The high quality of workmanship and building materials of the original building contribute to its aesthetic and technical significance. These materials include the dressed sandstone detailing, brick chimney details, French doors and timber shutters on the exterior. Interior elements include the timber panel joinery and plaster details of the original entrance hall, original timber doors, architraves and pediments, circular feature windows, and the details of the staircase including carved timber balusters newel posts and handrails, the four stained glassed windows within the stairwell. The strong form of the grass embankments and terraces is an important component within this setting, as these were designed and constructed at the same time as the main building and complement the scale and simplicity of the architecture. The terracing is important in maintaining original views to and from the main western elevation. The wisteria on the main western elevation, the oak tree on the lower grass terrace and the continuous tree canopy along the western boundary are all individual landscape plants of considerable significance. The trees on the western boundary provide a sense of enclosure to the western terrace and main building. ;Phase 2; Additional student accommodation and the Louisa Macdonald Commemoration Hall 1923-1924: architects Power & Adam In 1923-1924 an addition to the original building designed by Power & Adam was built on the east side of the main corridor, formerly occupied by the eastern verandah to provide 15 student rooms. In order to accommodate the increased number of students and to create a memorial to the work of the first principal, the Louisa Macdonald Commemoration Hall, designed by Joseph Porter Power of Power & Adam was added to the southeast of the main building. Accessed via a second staircase leading off the original entrance hall the building consisted of a dining room, kitchen, utility rooms, offices and some student accommodation. The most striking feature of the Dining Hall is the extensive use of timber, particularly in the elaborate roof consisting of substantial beams with truss detailing in curved and circular timber sections. Timber panelling on the walls directs the eye to the bull's eye clerestory windows featuring elaborate timber surrounds, along the north and south walls. There is also a timber \\"minstrels' gallery\\" at the west end of the dining room. The moulded timber skirting and the timber floor are original, with the exception of the narrower floor boards. Other original or early details include the large double-hung windows with original hardware located under the circular windows and the plaster-battened mansard ceiling with circular vents. The hall was enlarged in 1965-1969 and the southern wall removed and replaced by a series of columns. The original windows were used in the south wall of the later extension. The Maples, a Victorian house on an adjoining lot, was leased before being purchased in 1918. Major alterations and additions occurred in 1928 with surplus funds from the government endowment funding the partial demolition of the back wing of the Maples and the addition of a three-storey wing providing accommodation for seventeen undergraduates, two graduates, a tutor, the gardener and a maid. In the summer vacation the Maples was used by staff and students who chose to remain in residence while the main College building closed for the holidays. ;Phase 3: The Susie Jane Williams Wing: architect R. G. Simpson 1936-1937 A two-storey brick addition with tiled roof, linked by cloisters to the south side of the entrance to the Louisa Macdonald Commemoration Hall with 14 student rooms and associated facilities.This building was later extended in 1959-1960 The building incorporates many details that complement the original design, including the decorative sandstone details, face brick construction, double hung windows and terracotta tiled hip and gable roofs. ;Phase 4: The Reid Wing: architect Ellice Nosworthy 1957-1958 A two-storey face brick addition with aluminium windows and sandstone sills and a hipped roof of terracotta tiles adjoining the north end of the Main building with 31 students rooms, a small flat for the Vice Principal, a common room and music rooms. [Part demolished and the remainder adapted in 1994-1996 as part of the Vere Hole Resource Centre] ;Phase 5: Additions to Williams wing and to the staff accommodation at the back of the kitchen [Back Alley] 1959-1950: architect Ellice Nosworthy Two-storey brick additions with tile roof to north and south ends of the kitchen wing staff quarters [Back Alley] and two and three-storey brick additions with tile roof to east and west ends of the Williams Wing for student and staff accommodation. ;Phase 6: Langley wing & connecting walkway, the Menzies Common Room and an addition to the dining hall: architects Fowell, Jarvis, Mansfield and Maclurcan 1965-1969 The College doubled in size with the help of AUC funding in the 1960s. The main elements of this expansion were: a four-storey residential block of brick with metal roof, in Y-shaped configuration with central staircase providing student and staff accommodation (Langley wing) and connecting walkway to Main building; a large students' common room and all- purpose hall (Menzies Common Room) and; a single-storey flat roofed addition to the 1924 dining hall, reusing some elements of the original (windows and frames). The Menzies Common Room is two storeys high internally and is linked to the north side of the Dining Hall and to the Main Building by means of a corridor which blocks off all natural light from the main staircase and obstructs the lower stained glass windows. ;Phase 7: The Vere Hole Resource Centre; architects Gerry Rippon & Ken Reynolds Part of Reid wing demolished (laundries and music rooms) and remainder refurbished. With additions to provide library and archive offices, storage and reading room, computer rooms, common rooms, teaching rooms and student accommodation. Setting The landscape setting of the Women's College is important in maintaining original views to and from the main western elevation of the original Sulman & Power building and its elevated position atop the tiered levels. The wisteria (Wisteria sinensis) vine on the main western elevation of the building, the oak (Quercus robur) tree on the lower grass terrace and the continuous tree canopy along the western boundary are all individual landscape plants (sic: elements) of considerable heritage significance.Otto Cserhalmi & Partners, 2015, 6 Landscape and gardens The Women's College was built on a treeless paddock immediately to the west of St Paul's College. Although the site had a frontage to Carillon Avenue the building with its main axis at right angles to the street, facing west towards St Andrew's College. The original entry road from Carillon Avenue was a gravel driveway terminating in a circular turning area outside the front steps. This has now been replaced by a bitumen roadway. The grounds of the main building comprise three (of the original four) distinct levels with steep, grass embankments in between that were constructed in 1893 and which formed the most significant feature within the original landscaping. These embankments, combined with the layout and design of the building facilitated the passive cooling of the building by cross ventilation, a feature characteristic of the work of Sulman and Power. From the 1890s, when many plants were donated by well wishers, the gardens developed through to the 1940s reflecting a gardenesque landscape more commonly seen in grand residential properties. The existing garden bed at the base of the upper embankment includes small flowering trees and shrubs: crab apples, cherry, azaleas and assorted annuals. Under the influence of Professor Wilkinson in the 1920s and 1930s, flags of stone and cement gradually replaced asphalt paths but in later years discordant paving materials were used diminishing the unifying elements of the whole landscape. When the College was first built, the scale and simplicity of the building and its dominant roofline were accentuated by the open nature of the surrounding landscape and absence of any soft vegetation close to the building. Today, the mature trees around the north, east and west boundaries enhance the sense of enclosure and privacy within the College grounds. By the 1940s creeping fig (Ficus pumila var.pumila) nearly covered the front walls, bay window and tower. This created a dramatic leafy effect, particularly combined with the maturing flowering shrubs in the lower gardens. In 1947, the creeper was removed and a mauve- flowered wisteria (Wisteria sinensis) retained and this is now a significant feature of the College each spring. The different architectural styles of the associated buildings within the Women's College contribute to the similarly disparate treatment of green spaces with the introduction of native plants, large areas of garden beds and the increased use of a variety of paving materials. The principal courtyards at the Women's College include: the Central Courtyard located behind the main building, which contains a sundial; the two courtyards adjacent to the Williams Wing comprising the Upper Level Courtyard which is enclosed to the west by a covered walkway and to the east by a densely planted garden bed including a mature jacaranda, and the Lower Level Courtyard which features a brick wall at the base of a covered walkway. The small brick paved courtyard located between the Principal's Flat and the Main Common Room was built in 1933 and designed by Miss Peggy MacIntyre. ;Significant Trees In 1894 trees were planted by friends and supporters of the College including: Lady Duff, Mr Walker, Miss Woolley, Mrs W. R. Campbell, Miss Deas Thomson, Mrs Badham, Sir William Manning, Miss Windeyer, Lady Darley, Mrs Gurney, Miss Eadith Walker, Miss Jane Russell, and Miss Fairfax. Lady Duff planted an oak, possibly the existing Holm Oak (Quercus ilex) which is located about the centre of the western boundary tree plantings. ;Front Gates The front gates on Carillon Avenue are wrought iron and were a gift to the College from Mr S. S. Cohen in 1936. The original gates were timber. The existing gates are supported by stone piers which contrast with the adjacent brick wall piers. ;Memorial Seat The sandstone seat on the lower grass terrace was designed by Leslie Wilkinson in the 1920s as a memorial to Miss Mary Dunnicliff, a student of the College from 1895-1897 and afterwards a teacher at Sydney Girls' High School and Fort Street Girls' High School. The Sydney yellow block stone seat rests on a stone foundation and bears the carved initials \\"M.C.D.\\" and the dates \\"1895-1897\\". The stone was supplied from the Harbour Bridge excavations by J. J. C. Bradfield who was a member of Council. The hedge surrounding the seat comprises a number of species including privet (Ligustrum ovalifolium) which may have been planted later and which has been clipped into a high hedge and now provides an intimate but restricted space around the seat. ;Sundial Located in the central courtyard is the sundial, the plinth for which was designed by Professor Leslie Wilkinson and installed in memory of Miss Marjorie Gladwin who was a student in College from 1925 until her death from diabetes in May 1927. Donated by her mother and brother, the sundial was erected in the quadrangle on 5 November 1928. The bronze dial bears the date 1720, the maker's name \\"T. Mills LONDON\\", and the inscription Use well the present moments as they fly. The sandstone plinth bears the inscription \\"Love alters not with his brief hours and week\\".  Heritage listing  The Women's College within the University of Sydney, opened in 1892, was the first university college for women in Australia. The earliest section of the College, designed by the architectural firm of Sulman & Power and completed in 1894, is a fine example of an institutional building in the \\"Federation Free Classical\\" style of architecture. This original wing of the college exhibits a high quality of workmanship and retains the intended relationship with its terraced landscape. The integrity of this part of the College, which retains many original or early fittings and items of furniture, contributes substantially to its rarity value. Substantial additions to the original College throughout the twentieth century demonstrate the growth of the institution, changing architectural styles, social mores and teaching requirements. The College contains many items of moveable heritage - furniture, commemorative objects and works of art that contribute to the aesthetic significance of the place. The college is the only non- denominational affiliated college established under the 1854 University of Sydney Affiliated Colleges Act and has occupied its present site since 1894. The Women's College is of State significance for being in continuous use as a university college for women for over one hundred years and for its high standard of academic excellence and achievement in collegiate activities including sports and the arts. The Women's College is significant for its role in raising the status of women through higher education and by actively promoting a broader role for women in public life. It is held in high esteem by its alumnae and is also significant to the broader university community's sense of place. Women's College building was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 April 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Women's College is of State significance as the first university college for women in NSW, Australia and indeed within the British Commonwealth. It is also of State significance for being in continuous use as a university college for women for over one hundred years and for its high standard of academic excellence and achievement in collegiate activities including sports and the arts. The Women's College is significant for its role in raising the status of women through higher education and by actively promoting a broader role for women in the management of the College and in public life. The College archives provide a significant resource for the history of the place, its students, staff and Councillors. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Women's College is of State significance for its close association with many of the early women students of the University of Sydney and its continuing association with subsequent generations of women students of the University, many of whom were pioneers or outstanding practitioners in their chosen disciplines. The College also has a significant association with the architectural firm of Sulman & Power and its successors, Power & Adam and Power, Adam & Munnings and with other architects who have made a substantial contribution to its built form including R G Simpson; Ellice Nosworthy; Leslie Wilkinson; and Fowell, Mansfield & Maclurcan. The College contains a number of memorials commemorating its historical associations with former Principals, alumnae, Councillors, benefactors and friends of the College. These include buildings (the Louisa Macdonald Commemoration Hall; Williams Wing; Langley Wing; Reid Wing & the Vere Hole Resource Centre); architectural features (the Wedgwood Memorial in the Main Common Room); plaques; named rooms; furniture, pictures and other moveable heritage items. The Women's College is also of State significance for being closely associated with the life and work of many women and men who were prominent in the history of the College and in university and public life including its earliest principals: Louisa Macdonald; Susie Williams, Camilla Wedgwood and Betty Archdale; Councillors: Senator James Walker, Dame Eadith Walker, the Rt Hon Sir George Rich, Jessie Street, the Hon Sir Philip Street, Katherine Ogilvie, Julie Fitzhardinge, Dr Margaret Mulvey, Jane Foss Russell (Mrs Barff), Mary Fairfax, Emmeline Woolley, Margaret Windeyer, Professor Marie Bashir; and Benefactors: Professor Walter Scott, Dame Eadith Walker, Mrs Mary Read, and the Fairfax family. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The earliest section of the College, designed by the architectural firm of Sulman & Power, is of State significance a fine example of an institutional building in the Federation Free Classical style of architecture. It exhibits a high quality of workmanship and retains many of its original features. Despite considerable additions to the site, the original building is still clearly evident, and maintains its original relationship with its terraced setting and garden. Subsequent additions to the original College buildings include representative examples of collegiate architecture of the 1930s, 1950s, 1960s and 1990s, demonstrating changes in architectural fashion, building, engineering and technological requirements throughout the College's history. The College contains many items of furniture, commemorative objects and works of art that contribute to the aesthetic significance of the place. Many of these were donated by individuals and families who have had a long association with the history of the College since its establishment. The architectural style originally chosen for the Women's College broke away from the traditional sandstone Gothic Revival style typical of early University of Sydney buildings, to establish an alternative architecture appropriate to the needs of women students. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Socially the Women's College is of State significance for its long-term function as a residence for women students of the University of Sydney and more recently as a site for academic conferences and seminars. The buildings and landscape of the Women's College suggest the influence of the \\"Oxbridge\\" ideal of university architecture. The Women's College is held in high esteem by its alumnae for whom the original building remains the most identifiable and iconic element of the place. It is also significant to the broader university community's sense of place. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Sulman and Power building within the Women's College is of State significance for providing evidence of the innovative constructional techniques develioped by John Sulman and his attempts at developing an Australian style of architecture. The original building of the Women's College is also significant for providing evidence of the way of life of early women students of the University of Sydney and in particular of their domestic and social arrangements and has the potential to demonstrate this to future generations. The building is complemented by items of moveable heritage that enhance this understanding and by archival holdings that provide documentary and pictorial evidence of this way of life. Subsequent additions to the College have the potential to demonstrate fashions in institutional architecture and changes in the social and domestic life of students throughout its history. Further research, including oral history and landscape analysis may yield additional information about the buildings and grounds of the College and their use over time. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Women's College is of State significance as the first university college for women in Australia and in the British Commonwealth. It remains the only non-denominational college within the University of Sydney. The Women's College is a rare example of an educational institution designed specifically for the accommodation of women university students in the late 19th century. The integrity of the original building contributes substantially to its rarity value. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Women's College is of State significance as the best and most intact example of the educational and institutional works of Sulman and Power in Australia. Other examples of their work include The Armidale School (opened 1 February 1894) and the New England Ladies College (1888). The architectural style and features of the Women's College, specifically defined by the Italianate tower, bear striking similarities with the Thomas Walker Convalescent Hospital (1893) and Upton Grey (1894). The expansion of the Women's College in the later 1950s and 1960s is representative of the impact of the Murray Report on Australian universities and residential colleges at this period and of the significance of AUC funding to their development.

Christopher Murphy. The film stars Samara Weaving as a newlywed who is hunted by her spouse's evil family as part of their wedding night ritual for Satan. Mark O'Brien portrays her husband, with Adam Brody, Henry Czerny, and Andie MacDowell as members of his family. Ready or Not was theatrically released on August 21, 2019 by Fox Searchlight Pictures. It grossed $57 million against a $6 million budget and received generally positive reviews from critics, for its blend of subversive humor and crowd-pleasing thrills. Plot As a child, Daniel Le Domas is confronted in his family's mansion by a wounded man named Charles, who begs him for help. Instead, Daniel alerts his family, who arrive wearing ceremonial masks and robes. Despite the pleas of his bride, Charles is shot with a speargun and dragged away, as Daniel's mother tells him that she is proud of him. Thirty years later, Daniel's younger brother Alex returns home to marry Grace, a former foster child happy to join his family, who run the successful Le Domas Family Games company. Grace meets the Le Domases: Alex's brother Daniel and his snobbish wife Charity; Alex's cocaine-addicted sister Emilie, her husband Fitch, and their young sons Georgie and Gabe; Alex's dour aunt Helene; and Alex's parents Tony and Becky. After the wedding, Grace and the family gather, and Tony explains that his ancestor made a deal with a man named \\"Le Bail\\" to build the Le Domas fortune in exchange for the family observing a tradition: every new member draws a card from Le Bail's puzzle box, naming a game they must all play. Grace draws \\"Hide-and-Seek\\" and is sent to hide, believing they are merely playing a game; the Le Domases arm themselves with antique weapons to hunt her down. Unwilling to participate, Alex escapes into the mansion's secret passages and finds Grace, who witnesses Emilie kill a maid she mistakes for Grace. Alex reveals the Le Domases' curse: everyone who marries into the family must play the game determined by Le Bail's box, or die mysteriously. Only hide-and-seek also requires the family to kill the newcomer; the card was last selected by his aunt Helene's husband Charles, on their wedding night thirty years ago. With the mansion locked down, Alex leaves to disable the security system and allow Grace to escape. She is discovered by Daniel, who is disillusioned with the family and gives her a head start before alerting the others. As the Le Domases bicker, determined to capture Grace and use her to perform a ritual before dawn, Emilie accidentally kills another maid. Alex unlocks the house, but Grace's escape is blocked by the family butler, Stevens. Alex destroys the security system before he is knocked out and restrained by Daniel and Tony. Grace is discovered by another maid, but the maid accidentally crushes herself to death in a dumbwaiter. Grace escapes to the stables and finds Georgie, who shoots her in the hand. Punching him unconscious, she falls into a pit filled with the corpses of the Le Domases' previous sacrifices and climbs out, impaling her bullet wound on a nail to do so. She squeezes through the property's fence and flags down a motorist, who drives off. Pursued by Stevens, she fights him off and takes his car. She tries to call the police using the car's onboard system, but the operator informs her the car has been reported stolen and remotely shuts off the vehicle. Stevens subdues Grace with a tranquilizer gun and drives her back to the mansion, but she awakens and attacks him. The car crashes, killing Stevens, and Daniel captures Grace. The Le Domases prepare to sacrifice Grace, drinking from a ceremonial cup. Before Tony can stab Grace, the family all vomit blood, and Daniel frees Grace, revealing he laced the cup with a non-lethal dose of hydrochloric acid. Charity shoots Daniel in the throat, and Grace disarms and pistol-whips her; Daniel succumbs to his gunshot wound. Grace bludgeons Tony with a lantern, starting a fire, and is attacked by Becky, whom she beats to death with Le Bail's box. Alex escapes his restraints and goes to rescue Grace, but she pulls away from him. Realizing that she will never trust him now, he subdues her, and the family prepare to complete the ritual. Grace breaks free, and the family realizes dawn has arrived. When they realize that nothing has happened to them after the failed ritual, Helene still tries to kill Grace, but one by one, the Le Domases explode; Alex begs for Grace's forgiveness, explaining that it was their love for each other that was still keeping him alive, but she rejects him and he explodes as well. Le Bail appears momentarily, nodding to Grace in respect. Soaked in blood, Grace lights a cigarette outside the burning mansion as the police arrive. Questioned about what happened, she replies, \\"In-laws\\".

The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Smart, subversive, and darkly funny, Ready or Not is a crowd-pleasing horror film with giddily entertaining bite.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on reviews from 37 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an overall positive score of 71% (including an average 3.5 out of 5 stars) and a 50% \\"definite recommend.\\" Peter Debruge wrote in Variety that \\"This deliciously diabolical sophomore feature, which hails from the resourceful low-budget trio known as Radio Silence, represents a departure for indie distributor Fox Searchlight, which has a real winner on its hands — that rare Get Out-like horror movie capable of delivering superficial diversion alongside deep cultural critique.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called the film \\"a decadent blast to watch a comic takedown of the rich done with the rude energy of a horror thriller and the courage of its own manic anti- marriage convictions.\\" Writing for IndieWire, David Ehrlich describes the film as \\"wickedly entertaining from start to finish, and painted with enough fresh personality to resolve into something more than the sum of its parts.\\" Leah Greenblatt wrote in Entertainment Weekly, \\"Come for the crossbows, etc., and to watch Weaving's star be born in real time; stay for the socio-economic lessons and sweet, sweet revenge.\\" David Sims of The Atlantic wrote, \\"The real fun in Ready or Not comes from the ways it subverts its time-tested story, balancing wry commentary and straightforward horror in its portrait of fumbling arrogance and curdled privilege.\\" Bobby LePire rated the film 10/10 and wrote in Film Threat that \\"The acting is incredible, the directing striking and intense, and the screenplay is unbelievably brilliant and funny.

The agency is responsible for the management of public housing and Section 8 vouchers for primarily low-income housing. While the agency is based in and has jurisdiction over San Francisco, it is operated independent of the city's government and is chartered by the state government of California. History The agency was established in 1938, a year after the federal Housing Act of 1937, in order to build and run public housing developments in San Francisco. Due to lobbying from local residents, the agency primarily built its public housing buildings in low-income neighborhoods. For example, proposed public housing in the city's Richmond District was protested, with residents claiming they wished to keep their neighborhood a \\"first-class residential district, rather than a ‘slum housing project.’\\". By 2012, the San Francisco Housing Authority was considered a \\"troubled\\" agency by HUD, the federal agency that oversees local housing authorities, with a backlog of deferred maintenance on its properties. In 2013, Mayor Ed Lee pushed to reorganize the failing agency. Among the measures adopted was to enter all of the 29 of the Authority's public housing buildings into the Rental Assistance Demonstration program, which would privatize the buildings by transferring their management to non- profit housing organizations In 2018, the Authority came under scrutiny for discovering that it had a $29.5 million shortfall in its budget due to poor accounting practices. The agency plans to bridge the budget gap with the help of the federal HUD agency and with financial assistance from the San Francisco government. Due to the agency's failures in accounting and administration, HUD sent a letter in March 2019 ordering the Authority to cede the administration of its programs either to the federal government or to the municipal government of San Francisco.

In the Anglo-French dynastic conflict, he was a strong supporter of John, King of England. He left Poitou three times to fight infidels: the Third Crusade, the Reconquista in Spain and the Seventh Crusade. He is distinguished from his uncle, Renaud de Pons, Seneschal of Gascony, in contemporary documents by the epithets senior (the elder) and junior (the younger). He is possibly the same person as the troubadour Rainaut de Pons. Life Renaud was the eldest son of Geoffroy III de Pons and Agnès de Matha. He succeeded his father as lord of Pons in 1191. In the same year he left to join the Third Crusade, confirming his father's donation to the almonry of Chansac before he left. He was probably at least twenty years old at the time. Returning from the crusade, Renaud married Marguerite, lady of Montignac, the only child and heiress of Taleyrand, lord of Montignac. She was thus a niece of Count Elias V of Périgord. Her mother was probably Maeuz, the lady celebrated by the troubadour Bertran de Born. In 1202, John, King of England, entrusted the castle of Cognac and its dependencies to Renaud II de Pons, Pons de Mirebeau and Robert de Torneham, then seneschal of Poitou. Renaud and Pons were uterine brothers. This was territory that rightfully belonged to the Count of Angoulême but had been controlled by his suzerain, the Count of Poiou since the 1180s. In 1206, Renaud was one of those who swore on John's behalf to uphold the two-year truce concluded with Philip II, King of France, extending the peace that had ended the Anglo-French war in 1204. On 6 April 1212, Renaud pledged to pay an indemnity of 20,000 sous of Poitiers for damage his men had done to the property of the abbey of Saint-Jean-d'Angély during a military campaign. He was at the time, \\"willingly entering the land of Spain to meet the Saracens for the defence of the Christian faith\\" (Sarracenis Hispaniae terram intrantibus volens occurrere pro defensione fidei christianae). He probably joined the campaign that resulted in the Christian victory at the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa on 16 July 1212. Following the declaration of war against France by Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1213 Philip II called up his barons. Renaud was one of them, but like most Poitevins he ignored the summons and remained loyal to John, who landed at La Rochelle with an army to assist Otto in February 1214. The result of the war was a French victory at the battle of Bouvines. Renaud was one of the guarantors of the Truce of Chinon (September 1214), of which his uncle had been a negotiator on the English side. After the death of King John in October 1216, Hubert de Burgh, seneschal of Poitou, had Cognac seized, sparking a war with Renaud II. Cognac was to be a source of friction for many years. John's widow, Isabella, heiress of Anoulême, reasserted her rights over Cognac and enfeoffed her new husband, Hugh X of Lusignan. Renaud continued to wage war to keep his control of Cognac and its dependencies. Nothing is known of Renaud II's life from contemporary documents between 1214 and 1226. It is probable that he took part in the war between John's son, Henry III of England, and Philip's son, Louis VIII of France, over Poitou in 1224. In 1226, he did homage to the new French king, Louis IX, for the fiefs he held in the counties of Angoulême and La Marche, as well as the castle of Montignac (which he had from his wife) and a fief at Pons which Louis had conferred on him as a reward for unspecified services. Despite this, Renaud's loyalty to the French crown was weak. In 1234 and again in 1236 Henry III appointed him enforcer (dictator) the treaties signed with Louis IX. In 1241 he joined the coalition being formed by Hugh X of Lusignan against Louis IX and his brother, Alphonse, count of Poitou since 1225. His younger son Pons went to England to convince Henry III to lend his aid to the rebels. This mission was apparently successful, for in the resulting war in the Saintonge, Henry III came to France with an army and even stayed for eight days at Pons. Following the surrender of Saintes to Louis on 28 July 1242, however, Renaud abandoned the pro-English party. Louis and Alphonse camped beneath the castle walls of Pons and there Renaud did homage for the lordship to Alphonse. Louis appointed him dictator of the Treaty of Bordeaux (7 April 1243), which ended the brief war. Renaud, around 80 years old, joined his lord, Alphonse, on the Seventh Crusade being organized by Louis IX in late 1248. He left his eldest son, Geoffroy IV, in charge in his absence. He died overseas on 11 June 1252, having drawn up a will. Marriage and issue With Marguerite, Renaud had the following known issue: *Geoffroy IV of Pons (died 1247), married Agathe de Lusignan, had issue. *Raimond de Pons, Lord of Viroul, Lorzines, Nianc and Pré des Angles. *Pons de Pons, Bishop of Santes *Jean de Pons *Mahaut de Pons *Agnès de Pons, married firstly Savary IV of Thouars and secondly Guillaume IV de Sainte Maure, had issue.

It was built from 1889 to 1891. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Erected in 1889 by the Hydraulic Power Company, the pumping station is of technological significance as the centre for the now abandoned city hydraulic power network. This network was crucial to the dock, warehouse and other commercial development of Sydney. It is a substantial contributor to the townscape quality of the Haymarket Conservation Area, with its substantial and picturesque Italianate facade. At the end of the 19th century, before electric motors were perfected, the principal sources of power for industry and commerce were steam engines, some gas engines and hydraulic pressures. A public system of high pressure hydraulic power was introduced to Sydney in 1891. Before that several privately owned hydraulic systems were operating hoists and lifts. The effect of the introduction of hydraulically powered lifts on the architecture of Sydney was dramatic. Commercial, residential and warehouse buildings could now be constructed up to eight storeys high instead of the usual three of four. Builders were quick to seize on the new technology and use it to meet the mounting commercial pressure for more buildings on less land. The Sydney and Suburban Hydraulic Power Company was established in 1889 and built the pumping station in Pier St which was completed in 1891. By 1926 the Company's operations had expanded and the more efficient electric lifts were being installed and maintained by them in many of Sydney's buildings. The company then became the 'Hydraulic Power Electric and Hydraulic Lifts Ltd.' In 1955 the company, in an attempt to prevent a takeover by the Council of the City of Sydney, split into \\"Elevators Pty Ltd\\" and \\"Hydraulic Power Pty Ltd\\". These two companies were taken over by Lend Lease Corporation in 1960. The Pier St station was the first and largest pumping station in Sydney. t was sited between the central business district and wool presses of Pyrmont and Ultimo wool stores. It provided water at 800psi in an area bounded by Broadway, the Pyrmont wharves, Circular Quay, and the eastern end of Cowpers Wharf Road. Water for the system was tapped initially from the city water supply. However, as demand for service increased this became too expensive and a dam was constructed on 4ha of land near Mount Rennie, which is now the Moore Park Golf Club. This dam was increased in size from 2.8 million litres to 4.5 million litres and water was pumped by the low pressure Waterloo Pumping Station to the Pier Street Pumping Station reservoir. High pressure water from the Pier Street Station was pumped through 30 km of 150mm and 100mm high pressure mains to operate many of the lifts, hoists, cranes, bank doors and wool dumping presses scattered throughout the city. By the 1920s hydraulic pumping sub-stations had been erected at Cowpers Wharf Road, Woolloomooloo and Pyrmont to cope with the increased demand, principally from the wool presses. In 1926 the Waterloo pumping station was converted from steam to electricity and the first change in the Company's name occurred. The demand for power increased steadily to 250 million litres/year. In 1952 the steam plant was replaced by electric pumps to try and meet this demand. The growth of the number of lifts and hoists operated by hydraulic power increased steadily from 1891 to the 1920s when electrically powered lifts became pre-eminent. From the 1920s most new buildings had electric lifts installed as hydraulic lifts were seldom suitable for more than four or five stories and the number of lifts remained relatively static. However, the increased use of hydraulic lifts already in place lead to a steady increase in the amount of water consumed up until the late 1950s. There was a steady decline in the demand for hydraulic services from the commencement of the 1950s building boom. There was also a need to upgrade much of the plant. Consequently, operations ceased 1975 The shutdown of the system in 1975/6 was when Pyrmont Street Ultimo was extended from Fig Street to Quarry Street (as part of the North Western Freeway Construction) and the hydraulic power main which was under the railway line serving the Bond Store (Cnr Fig and Pyrmont Streets) was broken during the road construction (unaware it was a live power main). At the time the users on the clip board in the Pump Station indicated 7 active users – one was the Jacoby Mitchel building - Susses and Druitt Street (the plaque “Built by The Sydney Hydraulic and General Engineering Coy Ltd Lift No 967” was on the wall of the lift car. The employee at the time was under KPMG the liquidators. . The high pressure water supply was discontinued in sections. It appears that the interior of the building was renovated after 1975, with the basement and access to the base of the accumulators covered by a new floor. The original staircase which led to a platform on the head of the accumulators and gave access to the roof has been demolished, presumably at the same date. By 1988 the building had become a microbrewery and a hotel, the entrance had been realigned with a balcony and verandah attached and the interior massively renovated. In 1999-2000 the interior of the building was again renovated and the microbrewery removed. The balcony and verandah were changed and the rear of the building was joined to a large new hotel complex. In 2018, the building operates as Pumphouse Bar and Restaurant.  Description  The Hydraulic Pump Station is a three-storey Italianate/Baroque facade with rich decorative plaster/stucco elements. It features detailing includes matching pairs of pedimented dummy windows with square Corinthian pilasters flanking a central arched window on each storey, also with Corinthian pilasters plus stucco moulding and keystone. The arched windows are repeated on the second storey sides, below a circular vent, also with stucco moulding. The ground storey features stucco quoins which extend on the eastern side to simulate ashlar masonry on the facade on an extension which also features ornate Italianate plasterwork. The facade third story of the accumulator house rests on a corbelled string course and consists of a returning balustrade, punctuated by impressive pillar and stylised pediment which reads in relief \\"SYDNEY SUBURBAN HYDRAULIC POWER ESTD COMPANY 1889\\". The building still houses two accumulator cylinders. The walls are massive load-bearing brick with a riveted iron girder and timber ceiling. The Engine House behind and adjacent to the accumulator house, supports a huge cast iron water tank on massive load bearing brick walls and a double row of large riveted iron box girders. The facade, like the accumulator house is Italianate with ornate stucco decoration, an arcade of arched windows. The water tank is constructed of large square cast iron plates with raised circular and diagonal strengthening ridges on the interior. Cast inscriptions on two of the plates on the tank read \\"J COATES ENGINEER COLLINS STREET MELBOURNE\\" and \\"J ABBOT & CO LD MAKERS GATESHEAD ENGLAND\\". The building has been realigned, the entrance is now from the original southern wall and a balcony and verandah have been constructed on it. As at 15 October 2002, The exterior of the building was in excellent condition as at 15 October 2002, although the renovation and realignment of the entrance obscures some of the features of the facade. The interior of the building has been renovated but substantial original features remain. The floor of the building has been renewed, a new concrete mezzanine which has no relationship with the original open space has been added and access to the base of the accumulators and the basement has been removed. However, there could be significant archaeological potential. The building facade, internal walls, roof, hydraulic accumulators and the largest cast iron water tank in Sydney still survive and are sympathetically incorporated to the renovation of the building as a pub.  Heritage listing  Hydraulic Pumping Station No.1 played a pivotal role in the industrial, commercial and architectural development of Sydney. As the city's first and major public provider of hydraulic power, it has strong historical associations with many prominent buildings and firms. The elegant structure of the remaining building is one of the very few industrial landmarks remaining in this part of the city. Hydraulic Pump Station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Pier St Number One Pumping Station was the first public hydraulic pumping station to commence operations in Sydney. The success of this station led to the widespread acceptance and use of hydraulic power. The station was directly associated with the development of may prominent Sydney firms. The station was also directly associated with the construction of many prominent Sydney buildings. The provision of hydraulic power from this station was an important contributing factor in the operations of the Pyrmont and Darling Harbour woolstores and the wool boom of the 1890s. Hydraulic power led directly to changes in the building industry which permanently altered the city profile. The station continued to provide an essential service to the city for nearly a century. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Pier St Number One Pumping Station was the first and largest hydraulic pumping station to be built in Sydney. The station represents the arrival of a new technology which had a major impact on the building industry by furthering the construction of multi-storey buildings. It contains the largest extant set of hydraulic accumulators and the largest cast iron water tank in Sydney. The building structure in the engine house shows an unusual small scale application of massive load bearing brick wall and riveted iron girder technology. The accumulator house facade shows, in its picturesque Italianate elevations, an elegant nineteenth century approach to the decoration of a purpose built industrial structure. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The advent of hydraulic power altered forever the conditions and environment of Sydney's office workers. The pumping station is a well known landmark at the southern end of the city. Pier St Pumping Station is, today, the last major vestige of a suite of industrial structures in and around Darling Harbour. It is therefore of major social interest as the principal tangible evidence of the area's industrial history. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The history of the site is well documented, particularly its steam operations. Together with the surviving fabric, these records provide an invaluable resource for explaining hydraulic technology. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Pier St Number One Pumping Station was the first and largest hydraulic pumping station to be built in Sydney. It is the last major vestige of the industrial history of Darling Harbour. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Pier St Number One Pumping Station is representative of the important role of hydraulic power in developing the architecture and industry in Sydney. It was the first and the largest public hydraulic pumping station built in Sydney.

Because of his father's military career, Joslin attended a number of grade schools and then four different high schools in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and California.Witty, Jim, \\"Outside looking in - Retired Forest Service worker still actively trying to keep America wild\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 29 November 2005.Gilbert, Dave, \\"Introducing Les Joslin, Team Lead High Desert Ranger Station\\", High Desert Voices, High Desert Museum, Bend, Oregon, July 2015, p. 5.Joslin, Les, Life & Duty: An American Adventure, Xlibris Publishing, Bloomington, Indiana, 2014, pp. 17, 20, 31, 60. Joslin attended San Jose College, graduating in 1966 with a bachelor's degree in geography and a minor in natural resources conservation.\\"Forestry 352 Wilderness Management\\", Sample Course Syllabus, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, 2011.\\"Legendary Locals of Bend\\", Cascade A&E;, Bend, Oregon, 6 January 2016. During the summers from 1962 through 1966, he worked for the United States Forest Service as a seasonal firefighter and fire prevention office assigned to the Toiyabe National Forest's Bridgeport Ranger District in eastern California and western Nevada. During his first year on the district, Joslin work from a small one-room office at the Bridgeport ranger station.Anderson, John Gottberg, \\"Historic Forest Service Cabins\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 23 June 2013.Jasper, David, \\"Lone ranger station lives on\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 4 July 2009,Jasper, David, \\"Retired ranger highlights cabins - Les Joslin profiles historic U.S. Forest Service ranger stations in book\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 29 May 2012.  Navy career  In 1967, Joslin was commissioned as a United States Navy officer after completing Aviation Officer Candidate School in Pensacola, Florida. Following additional training at Pensacola, the Navy sent him to the military's joint air intelligence officer school at Lowry Air Force Base in Denver, Colorado. After he finished his training in 1968, Joslin was assigned as an air intelligence officer in an A-6 Intruder squadron at Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia. He was then deployed aboard the USS Saratoga.Joslin, Les, Life & Duty: An American Adventure, Xlibris Publishing, Bloomington, Indiana, 2014, pp. 160, 232-263, 325. In 1970, Joslin married Patricia King. Together, they had two daughters. In addition, Joslin earned two advanced degrees while serving in the Navy. In 1974, he received a Master of Arts in political science from the University of Colorado in Boulder. He was awarded a Master of Philosophy degree in geography from the University of London in 1984.\\"About the Author\\", \\"Legendary Locals of Bend,\\" www.arcadiapublishing.com, Arcadia Publishing, Charleston, South Carolina, accessed 3 October 2017. Joslin served as a navy intelligence officer for 22 years. Over the course of his career, his assignments included an extended tour at sea on the USS Kitty Hawk and multiple shore postings around the world. These included assignments as an intelligence analyst in Washington and an intelligence liaison officer in London.Joslin, Les, Life & Duty: An American Adventure, Xlibris Publishing, Bloomington, Indiana, 2014, p. 263-344. Joslin also served a tour on the faculty of the Defense Intelligence College (now the National Intelligence University) and was an intelligence officer at the Center for Naval Analyses. His duties as an intelligence analyst, especially his three-year tour in Washington, helped him develop a clear and concise writing style.Madsen, Peter, \\"Bend's Legendary Locals\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 23 April 2016. Joslin retired from the navy in 1988 as a commander.  Post-naval careers  After retiring from the Navy, Joslin moved to Sunriver in Central Oregon. In 1989, he began teaching geography courses at Central Oregon Community College. He later taught political science classes there as well. In 2001, he became an adjunct instructor at Oregon State University, teaching a wilderness management course on-line and at Oregon State's central Oregon campus. He left the community college faculty in 2005, but continued teaching at the university through 2011. In 1990, Joslin resumed working with the Forest Service. He performed seasonal patrols in the Three Sisters Wilderness and worked in public information and education capacities for the Deschutes National Forest for 14 years. He then took a full-time position leading the recreation, heritage, and wilderness resources team for the forest's Bend-Fort Rock Ranger District. Joslin left the Forest Service in 2005. Bridgeport cabin at the High Desert MuseumWorking with central Oregon's High Desert Museum, Joslin helped develop a Forest Service centennial exhibit for that museum in 2005. After that project, he worked with the museum to relocate the old one- room Bridgeport ranger station office which had been moved to Nevada and then abandoned by the Forest Service. This was the same ranger's cabin that Joslin worked from in 1962. The cabin was successfully moved to the High Desert Museum in 2008. Once the cabin was relocated, it was restored and opened to the public as a permanent exhibit in 2009.Richard, Terry, \\"Restored ranger station at High Desert Museum\\", Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 26 June 2009. Joslin also helped restore the historic Elk Lake Guard Station located along the Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway in the Deschutes National Forest. The guard station now serves as a Forest Service visitor center and interpretive site.Elk Lake Guard Station\\", The Oregon Encyclopedia, Portland State University and the Oregon Historical Society, Portland, Oregon, accessed 7 October 2018. After Joslin retired from teaching and the Forest Service, he focused on writing and volunteer work. He is a fellow of the High Desert Museum and has served as president of the Deschutes County Historical Society's board of directors.Himstreet, Kim, \\"Pictorial history of Deschutes Forest\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 30 March 2017. He has also written six articles for The Oregon Encyclopedia. In 2017, Joslin joined the board of directors for the Waterston Desert Writing Prize, an annual literary prize that recognizes excellent nonfiction writing that highlights aspects of the high desert environment.\\"Business People on the Move\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 4 August 2017.\\"Les Joslin\\", Waterston Desert Writing Prize Board of Directors 2017-2018, Waterston Desert Writing Prize, Bend, Oregon, accessed 7 October 2018.

The rest of his books were published by Wilderness Associates, a small specialty publishing house located in Bend, Oregon. Joslin's first book, Toiyabe Patrol: Five U.S. Forest Service Summers, was initially published in 1993. It is the story of Joslin's summers work as a Forest Service firefighter and fire prevention officer in the Toiyabe National Forest. He later revised and retitled the book. The revised edition was published in 2006 under the title Toiyabe Patrol: Five U.S. Forest Service Summers of the High Sierra in the 1960s. Joslin's second book was published in 1995. Uncle Sam's Cabins: A Visitor's Guide to Historic U.S. Forest Service Ranger Stations of the West, combines Forest Service history with architectural details about seventy-five ranger stations located across twelve western United States. A revised version of the book was published in 2012. In 1999, Joslin published his third book. It told the story of Walt Perry, an early-era forest ranger who served in Oregon and New Mexico.\\"Walt Perry : An Early-Day Forest Ranger in New Mexico and Oregon\\", Amazon.com, Seattle, Washington, accessed 27 April 2018. Joslin's next four books explored various aspects of forestry and forest history. The Wilderness Concept and the Three Sisters Wilderness: Deschutes and Willamette National Forests, Oregon was published in 2000. A revised edition was published in 2005. Seventeen Summers at Paulina Lake Guard Station was published in 2006. It was co-authored with Dick and Dave Robins.\\"Seventeen Summers at Paulina Lake Guard Station\\", Amazon.com, Seattle, Washington, accessed 8 October 2018. The following year, Ponderosa Promise: A History of U.S. Forest Service Research in Central Oregon was published by the Forest Service's Pacific Northwest Research Station. Ponderosa Promise traces the history of forest research east of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon and Washington from 1897 through the founding of the Forest Service's modern silviculture laboratory and experimental forest in the mid-1990s. In 2008, Joslin prepared a new edition of a 1936 book by John Riis called Ranger Trails: The Life And Times of a Pioneer U.S. Forest Service Ranger in the West on the La Sal, Santa Barbara, Cache, and Deschutes National Forests, 1907-1913.Ranger Trails: The Life and Times of a Pioneer U.S. Forest Service Ranger in the West on the La Sal, Santa Barbara, Cache, and Deschutes National Forests, 1907 1913, Goodreads, San Francisco, California, accessed 8 October 2018. Bend: 100 Years of History was written by a Deschutes County Historical Society committee and published in 2005. In 2009, Joslin revised the book and it was republished under the title Images of America: Bend. The revised version retained the historical society authorship.\\"Bend and Redmond Pictorial Histories Available at Des Chutes Historical Museum Bookstore\\", www.deschuteshistory.org, Deschutes Historical Museum, Bend, Oregon, accessed 10 October 2018. Five years later, Joslin published an autobiography, titled Life & Duty: An American Adventure. That book records Joslin's life story including his early life, naval career, and subsequent pursuits. Joslin's next book was Legendary Locals of Bend, published in 2016. Legendary Locals highlights remarkable people associated in some way with Bend, Oregon. The book includes 120 short biographies including stories about fur trapper Peter Skene Ogden, explorer John Charles Fremont, Bend's founder Alexander M. Drake, publisher George Palmer Putnam, Olympic gold medalist Ashton Eaton, and many other interesting people. In 2017, Joslin published a book about the Deschutes National Forest. His book Deschutes National Forest documents the history of one of eastern Oregon's largest national forests.

'Victoria Cross for animals': Military dog Kuga posthumously awarded Dickin Medal for bravery, Jordan Hayne, ABC News Online, 2018-10-26 Early life Kuga was born on 23 April 2007, and began training with the Australian Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) in January 2008, aged eight months. Kuga was assigned to his handler (who can not be named for security reasons) in April 2009, and in June 2010 they deployed to Afghanistan for their first tour. Award situation On 26 August 2011, during the pair's second tour, a SASR patrol was airlifted by helicopter into Khas Urozgan District in central Afghanistan, with a mission to locate a high value Taliban. Unknown to the patrol was that an ambush had been established by the Taliban fighters. Kuga's handler, ranked Sergeant, let Kuga off-lead to patrol ahead and scout. Kuga went to the left and ahead, then down a creek bank. While Kuga was swimming across the creek, the Taliban engaged him with automatic gun fire. The handler observed rounds hitting the water around the dog, which continued to the other side of the creek. Kuga left the water and charged at the shooter, grasping onto him. The shooter then targeted Kuga directly with his AK-47 rifle, hitting him with at least one round. Kuga released his grip on the Taliban fighter who then escaped but not before targeting the dog again, ultimately hitting him five times: twice in the ear, once in the toe, once in the cheek (which exited through the neck) and once in the chest, which exited the shoulder and broke his upper-left leg. Kuga also received shrapnel wounds to his lower spine. The Australian patrol had been well alerted to the ambush and began to engage the insurgents. The handler observed Kuga lying on the ground injured, near the bank of the stream. The handler called Kuga, who responded by slowly crawling to and entering the water and swimming over to rejoin the handler. The handler provided immediate first aid, and an emergency medical evacuation was called for. Aftermath Kuga was evacuated and then treated by veterinary staff in Afghanistan, Germany and Australia, with the aim of rehabilitating him. However, the stress and injuries were too much, and he died on 24 July 2012. Kuga's death is officially recorded as ‘Died of Wounds’. On 26 October 2018, Kuga was posthumously awarded the 71st Dickin Medal for bravery by the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA). The medal was received on Kuga's behalf by a Victoria Cross recipient, Mark Donaldson VC, who was also a Special forces dog handler, along with another military dog, Odin. A spokesperson for the PDSA said, \\"The reason he got the Dickin Medal was he just was so courageous. He saved the lives, without doubt I think, of that patrol.” Donaldson said, \\"I personally am of the opinion that he saved lives that day. … The ambush would not have been sprung early enough so they would have stumbled into that killing zone. … If you take Kuga out of the equation … with reasonable doubt they wouldn't have known the enemy was there.\\" Kuga's handler said, \\"I'm pretty proud of what Kuga did that day.

It was built from 1879 to 1895. It is also known as Cross & Scott Street Terraces. The property is owned by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority (SHFA). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 August 2017.  History  Until recently it has been assumed that the original indigenous peoples who inhabited the Pyrmont Peninsula were the Gadigal clan group of the Eora Nation. There are about 29 clan groups of the Sydney metropolitan area, referred to collectively as the Eora Nation groups in the Sydney area. With the invasion of the Sydney region, the Gadigal people were decimated but there are descendants of the Eora still living in Sydney today. The surrounding bush land contains remnants of traditional plant, bird and animal life with fish and rock oysters available from Blackwattle Bay.Barani Sydney people history, Anita Heiss Eora being a European nomenclature for the original \\"nation\\" that inhabited the land However, recent research suggests that the Gadigal habitually used the land east of the ridge that runs down the spine of central Sydney, separating Tallawolodah (The Rocks) and Tar-ra (Dawes Point) from what became known as Millers Point, while those who lived around Go-mo-ra (known to Europeans as Darling Harbour) may have formed a separate clan from the generally recognised Gadigal. Tentatively named the Gommerigal, this group has yet to be officially recognised but early settler documents point to its existence. The first governor, Arthur Phillip, listed the Gomerrigal [sic] in 1790 as among \\"other Tribes that live near us\\". Early records locate these people at Long Cove, the place that eventually became known as Darling Harbour, and as late as 1830 Absalom West recognised a 'Darling Harbour \\"tribe'\\". The probable territory of the Gommerigal included land around Darling Harbour from Millers Point on the east, and Pyrmont on the west, at least back to Blackwattle Bay. Disease and dislocation altered the clan and nation affiliation of the Indigenous people who frequented Pyrmont, probably known to them as Pirrama, but sparse European settlement and the presence of a good natural spring of fresh water, rock shelters, sandy beaches and good fishing grounds ensured that they continued to visit the place until well into the 19th Century. Springs, where freshwater continually seeped out of cracks in outcrops of sandstone, were particularly valuable to Aboriginal people and then the European colonists on rocky peninsulas like Pyrmont, because freshwater creeks lay some distance away. One of these springs was located at Pyrmont and became known as Tinker's Well. This spring was located in a large sandstone overhang, and water collected into a natural dish in the sandstone floor of the shelter. In the early 20th century, an old Pyrmont resident recalled that \\"through the mosses and ferns\\" of the overhang \\"trickled musically a small stream of pure, cold water\\". Other Pyrmont residents recalled evidence of the Aboriginal use of Tinker's Well, describing \\"numerous mussel shells\\" and other shellfish that were still visible near the spring in the early 20th century. These were almost certainly signs of an Aboriginal campsite, or midden. Residents also recalled that the natural bowl under the spring had been \\"roughly carved out\\" long before it was enlarged by European quarrymen, and it seems likely that this was done by Aboriginal people using the spring. Aboriginal people continued to live in the Pyrmont area into the 19th century, but quarrying and intense industrial and urban development in the area has destroyed most traces of their presence both before and after the arrival of Europeans. The shelter containing Tinker's Well was destroyed in the early 20th century, but water continues to flow down sandstone outcrops behind a modern apartment building nearby in the vicinity of the original spring. (Irish and Goward) Colonial history Early settlers, without regard to Indigenous ownership of the land, received land grants from the Crown in the late 18th century. The majority of the Pyrmont peninsula was granted or acquired in the early years of the colony by Surgeon John Harris, with the exception of of the point facing Darling Harbour, which was granted to Thomas Jones, a private in the NSW Corps in 1795. The Old Pyrmont Cottages are located within Jones' . The land was not developed for many years. It was acquired by Sergeant Obadiah Ikin before being sold in 1799 to the prominent colonial businessman, John Macarthur. Macarthur is said to have named the area \\"Pyrmont\\" in 1806 after a spa town in Germany because of the freshwater spring known as Tinker's Well. Macarthur briefly manufactured salt at Pyrmont and constructed a windmill there. After Macarthur's death, his son Edward began clearing the land for subdivision, the windmill was demolished and Harris Street was extended to the estate in 1836. The initial subdivision was placed on the market in 1839-40 and sold well, however when the next lots were released an economic depression had begun and most of these blocks, including the site of the Old Pyrmont Cottages, did not sell. In the nineteenth century Pyrmont proved more attractive to quarrying, waterfront industry and commercial property speculators than those wanting to build large residences. The main development that took place after the 1840s depression was based around the maritime industry and related industrial activities. Pyrmont remained isolated. The continuing rural nature of the adjoining, undeveloped Ultimo Estate retarded easy access, although there was a ferry. The first Pyrmont Bridge opened in 1858, providing better access to the city and encouraging the council to improve the streets and water supply but this did not result in the expected growth and development at the northern end of the peninsula. Stone quarrying in Pyrmont had been primarily for local purposes until the 1850s when the superior quality of its sandstone was recognised. Orders for the construction of Sydney University marked the first move towards large scale quarrying operations. Growth in the residential population of Pyrmont remained slow and despite shipping activity in Pyrmont Bay and the development of the Darling Harbour goods yards in the 1870s, much of Pyrmont remained underdeveloped until the Colonial Sugar Refinery (CSR) began operations there in 1879. The population of the whole Pyrmont peninsula grew and peaked somewhere between the 1891 and 1901 censuses at around 20,000 people. Thereafter the population fell as the refinery, wool stores, flourmills and other industrial operations expanded, reaching a low of around 1,600 people in the 1981 census, when Pyrmont was being deindustrialised and urban renewal had not yet begun. The land on which the Old Pyrmont Cottages are sited was leased by Edward Macarthur to George Wigram Allen in 1854, but initially he did little with it. Then in the late 1870s Allen began sub- leasing the lots to various people who built cottages there in response to the stimulus provided by the establishment of CSR and the Saunders Quarries. Cross and Young (later Scott) Streets were laid out, named and numbered. By 1879 some of the Old Pyrmont Cottages were in existence and being taxed by council. The last of the five cottages to be built was No 8 Scott St, constructed in 1895. The timing and diversity of the cottages' construction suggests that sub-leaseholders were developing the properties individually. It is likely that the cottages were not built by landlords then rented to tenants. Instead tenants rented the land and built a modest cottage in \\"vernacular\\" styles with whatever materials and construction techniques were readily available and without council supervision. These tenants were followed by other tenants who lived in and continually adapted the buildings to suit their residential needs. This was a common practice in the inner city and elsewhere during the 19th century. Twentieth-century developments In 1911 ownership of the block on which the Old Pyrmont Cottages are located was transferred to the Camden Park Estate, as part of the Allen family company holdings, where it remained until . The houses remained tenanted but resumptions for railway extensions in 1914 lead to the demolition of houses around the site. By the 1950s most of the housing and commercial buildings in the block were considered decrepit, and the conditions that tenants endured attracted media attention.SMH, 23 July 1951 The oldest cottages on the same block, in Bowman Street, were demolished and there was increasing pressure to demolish the rest, including the Old Pyrmont Cottages, initially to make the land available for industrial uses and later for residential use. City Council, which had owned the block bounded by Bowman, Cross, Scott and Harris streets since 1952, and Landcom made an agreement in 1981 to clear the old housing stock for a new housing development - even the roadways were closed in preparation. Pyrmont squats In the 1970s, extensive areas occupied by inner city housing were designated by the NSW Department of Main Roads (DMR) as being required for a complicated system of freeways and roads planned to connect the western suburbs to the city. These would have obliterated parts of the residential stock of Pyrmont in the process. Hundreds of houses became \\"DMR affected\\" and residents all over the inner city became politically active in a campaign to stop these freeway developments. By the mid-1970s many of the plans had been shelved, but not before houses had become run down and in some cases tenants had been evicted. These places soon became occupied by squatters - people who moved into unoccupied premises and lived there without formal tenancy or paying rent. The idea of using surplus inner urban properties to house the unemployed and the poor had evolved into a movement and squatting was elevated to a social right. Even some elected members of the City Council supported the rights of squatters, especially in places such as Pyrmont where the community was under stress as industry left and places stood empty. In 1978 all tenants on the block occupied by the Old Pyrmont Cottages had been evicted in anticipation of a proposed residential project but when the re- development work paused, squatters quickly moved in. Squatters remained there until 1994 despite a NSW Supreme Court ruling in favour of their eviction in 1984. The Supreme Court judge remarked that he found it distasteful to find against the squatters as the current level of social security benefits were \\"inadequate for people to live at a level which is above the poverty line,\\" but it was not his role to require council to provide emergency accommodation. At various times Sydney city aldermen and even the State Minister for Housing supported the squatters' tenure, using arguments that ranged from heritage issues to concern for housing the city's poor and unemployed in the context of housing shortages. Squatting occurred in many different parts of Sydney at this time of housing shortages, but the \\"Pyrmont Squat\\" including the Old Pyrmont Cottages and also houses and commercial buildings in adjoining blocks was possibly the most tenacious and long lasting. Although the practice of squatting was widespread in the 1980s, it was also, by its very nature, undocumented and largely unrecorded. The Pyrmont Squat is unusual for being subject to several legal cases, including Supreme Court rulings that document the practices of squatting. The squatters kept up a level of maintenance and weatherproofing which ensured the survival of the cottages. The recollections and private collections of squatters interviewed for the 2005 and 2011 CMPs also illustrate how they decorated and modified the Old Pyrmont Cottages and other nearby buildings, with internal and external murals and painted floors, holes in adjoining walls to facilitate light, access and escape, and the construction of shared bathroom facilities. The ways in which the squatters regulated their own communities, came together for music and other creative ventures, furnished their living spaces, and raised money for court cases with a speak-easy on the corner of Harris and Scott Streets is also documented. The squatters were involved in community based organisations such as the Pyrmont Self-Help Housing Co-operative, and the tongue in cheek Republic of Pyrmont, which argued for secession on the grounds that local taxes were contributing to local destruction. These and other resident action groups were active in gaining support from the churches and trade unions in opposing the redevelopment of Pyrmont. Following extensive demolition of nineteenth century streetscapes throughout Sydney in the post-World War II period, the general public was beginning to appreciate the historic value, charm and increasing rarity of nineteenth century vernacular buildings and streetscapes. The \\"Cross St Group,\\" including the Old Pyrmont Cottages,' consisting of 109-19 Bowman St, 1-5 Cross St, 42-52 Harris St and 2-8 Scott St, were recorded by the NSW chapter of the National Trust and included on their heritage register in 1982. Then the National Trust, the RAIA (the architects' association) and RAPI (the planner's association) all supported nomination of the block for listing on the statutory heritage list of the Australian Government, the Register of the National Estate, which finally took place in 1998. Several studies of the Old Pyrmont Cottages were commissioned in the early 1990s. The heritage consultants Godden Mackay prepared a conservation plan in 1993 for City West but this remained a policy document rather than being endorsed as a conservation plan because entry to the buildings could not be obtained with the squatters still in residence. Another conservation plan was prepared by Schwager Brooks in 1994, which drew heavily on the Godden Mackay report. In the face of calls for demolition because of the dilapidated state of the buildings, all the reports argued for retention of what was by then considered to be a culturally significant remnant of nineteenth century housing stock. They also noted the significance of the cottages housing people employed in local industries and those associated with creative endeavours. The terraces on Scott Street were depicted in 1949 by the well-known artist, Sali Herman (1898-1993) in his painting \\"Near the Docks.\\" Artist John Santry (1910-1990), who grew up at No 8 Scott Street, illustrated a comic strip written by Betty Rowland for The Sydney Morning Herald in the 1940s and 50s, \\"The Conways.\\" His \\"Point Street, Pyrmont\\" painting of depicts the area in decay. Some of the squatters themselves were also artistic. Toby Zoates (William Arthur Tobin 1946- ) lived at 6 Scott St from 1979 to 1990, where he wrote and illustrated student newspapers and made films. His animated film, \\"The Thief of Sydney\\" had its first screening at the Old Pyrmont Cottages while it was still a squat. Zoates' design work is evident in some of the political fliers and advertising material generated by the squatters. In 1994 the squatters were rehoused in by the NSW Department of Housing and the buildings handed over to City West Development Corporation, which was tasked with redeveloping 300 hectares of inner Sydney including Pyrmont, the Bays precinct, Eveleigh and the area around Central railway station. The corporation's functions were taken over by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority in 1999. In 1995 a decision was made to sell all the cottages on the block except for the Old Pyrmont Cottages at 6 & 8 Scott Street and 1, 3 and 5 Cross Street. The buildings at 42-52 Harris Street have since been adapted for commercial use, mostly restaurants, and the adjoining block between Point Street and Cross Street was completely redeveloped into a new housing complex. The Old Pyrmont Cottages instead would be redeveloped and leased as a craft centre, partly in recognition of their previous associations with creative endeavours. The creation of studio spaces required substantial physical alterations to the interiors and rear sections of the houses, which sometimes privileged functional needs over conserving significant heritage fabric. Conservation work began in 1995 by heritage architects Clive Lucas Stapleton Partners. In 1997 a decision was made to build a modern extension connecting four of the five cottages internally, which reconfigured to provide six studios, one residential studio and one communal workshop. The cottages were leased to the not-for-profit Centre for Contemporary Craft in 1998. The centre surrendered the lease in 2002, which was taken up by the Jewellers and Metal Workers Group until 2006. The property was unoccupied until it was taken over by \\"Culture at Work,\\" a community arts charity which provides community workshops and an artist-in-residency program with the support of the City of Sydney.  Description  Dating from 1879-1895 the Old Pyrmont Cottages consist of five former single-storey houses grouped around a corner in the inner Sydney suburb of Pyrmont near the mouth of Darling Harbour. Three of the cottages are on Cross Street (Nos 1, 3 and 5) and two are on Scott Street (Nos 6 and 8). One of the cottages is still in its original function as a residence (1 Cross Street) while the other four cottages have been interconnected and in 2016 are consolidated together as a community arts centre. Their back yards have also been consolidated into one terraced open space. A small brick building housing a toilet for No 1 Cross Street survives on the north east corner of the consolidated backyard. No 6 Scott Street is a two roomed, single storey, brick, rectangular plan, hipped roof cottage. It was constructed in 1879 for Henry Anderson, a blacksmith, and is an example of a vernacular version of a Victorian Georgian-styled cottage. Built on the street alignment, its facade features a pair of double hung sash windows either side of an offset central front door. Originally roofed in timber shingle, the roof is now clad in corrugated iron. Its rear external wall and an internal wall have been removed, and a single storey metal clad extension added at the rear, with other internal alterations and additions. No 8 Scott Street was built in 1895 on the last vacant site on the block. It is built in brick with an iron roof on a corner site, facing both Scott and Cross Streets. Its front elevation facing Scott Street has an offset central doorway flanked on either side by a single double hung sash window below a hipped roof, with a single window facing the Cross Street elevation. The mid-1990s conservation works involved the provision of a covered way between the two cottages at 6 and 8 Scott Street, the re-roofing of the buildings and a new fence to the street. Its original form is similar to No 6 but less altered internally. Outbuildings between these two houses have been demolished, and they are now connected by a covered way. Attached to No 8 Scott Street are two of the Cross Street cottages, nos 3 and 5. They are both single storey brick cottages, clad in weatherboards. At no. 5 Cross Street only the street facade and one original front room survives, while at no 3. only the street facade and two original front rooms survive. The street elevation to both nos 3 and 5 Cross Street have an offset centrally placed double hung sash window and front door with a convex verandah roof supported on brick fin walls. The rear wings and outbuildings of nos 3 and 5 Cross Street have been demolished and replaced by a single-storey metal clad extension across both former houses. The cottage at no. 1 Cross Street is a typical worker's cottage in the Victorian Georgian style. First recorded in 1882, it is a single storey freestanding weatherboard house with main gable iron roof and a timber framed verandah facing Cross Street. The original utility wing at the rear has been removed and a new skillion replacing it. The cottage is attached to No.3 Cross Street but remains a separate residence, independently tenanted in 2016. It has had an attic storey added within the original roof volume. Within no. 1 Cross Street the wall and ceiling linings are timber-boarded. All of the five cottages (old and new) are roofed in corrugated steel. Internally, where brick walls survive within the brick houses they are plastered and painted. Ceilings to original rooms are plasterboard or (in a few cases) lath-and-plaster and floors are timber boarded, with some surviving areas of original or early boards. There are remnants of checkerboard paint on some of the floors in nos 3 and 5 Cross Street surviving from the days when they were used as a squat. The additions linking the cottages, which were added by Clive Lucas Stapleton Partners heritage architects in the mid-1990s, have ripple iron linings to walls and ceilings and floors are covered with sheet vinyl.  Condition  As at 4 July 2016, the fabric of the buildings is partially intact and gives many indications of the techniques used in constructing vernacular housing in the1870s. The place itself is only a moderately good source of information on the number of changes that have been carried out during its lifetime because physical evidence has been lost or obscured by later work. The building's fabric is good to excellent; and its archaeological potential is moderate.  Heritage listing  As at 19 September 2016, the Old Pyrmont Cottages, dating from 1879-1895, are of state historical significance for their historical, associational, rarity and representative significance. The cottages have historical significance as a surviving example of inner city working class housing built in vernacular style and used for many decades as rental accommodation. They offer some demonstration of the lifestyle and living arrangements of ordinary people who lived in inner Sydney before the 1970s, which is otherwise rarely documented. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s as part of the \\"Pyrmont Squat\\", one of the longest lived and most well- documented Sydney squats, the Old Pyrmont Cottages were a focus of the Sydney squatter movement and as such, contribute to the history of the urban conservation movement in Australia. The Old Pyrmont Cottages are of state heritage significance for their association with a variety of artistic endeavours by people who lived there or who depicted them, including the Swiss-born artist Sali Herman's 1949 painting, \\"Near the Dock\\", which depicts one of its street facades. The Old Pyrmont Cottages have state significance for their rarity as a surviving example of late 19th century small-scale, working class housing in inner city Sydney, which was once common in Sydney. They are also rare for having been used in the squatting movement of 1970s-1990s and having numerous associations with creative endeavours. The cottages are a representative example of the Victorian Georgian vernacular style typical of late 19th century single-story worker's housing. Old Pyrmont Cottages was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 August 2017 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Old Pyrmont Cottages are of state historical significance as a surviving example of inner city rental properties built in vernacular style using materials to hand. For many decades providing rental accommodation for industrial workers and their families, this cottage group is historically associated with nearby industrial employment on the Pyrmont peninsular. The Old Pyrmont Cottages have historical significance for their demonstration of the history of ordinary people, with fabric that demonstrates something of the lifestyle and living arrangements of the ordinary, working class people who lived in inner Sydney before the 1970s. From the late 1970s, the Old Pyrmont Cottages became one of the longest lived and most well-documented Sydney squats, known as the \\"Pyrmont Squat\\". These cottages formed a focus for the Sydney squatter movement, and the impulses of social justice and heritage conservation that converged in this movement. Thus, the Old Pyrmont Cottages are significant to the state of NSW for their contribution to the history of the urban conservation movement. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Old Pyrmont Cottages are of state heritage significance for their association with a succession of artists who created works while residing in the cottages and/or included images of the cottages in their works. Swiss-born Sali Herman is the best known of these artists. Herman painted the Scott Street streetscape in his 1949 painting, \\"Near the Dock\\", which is in the collection of the Art Gallery of NSW where it is described as part of Herman's \\"catalogue of characteristic views\\" of \\"inner city architecture and life\\". Other artists associated with the Old Pyrmont Cottages are John Santry, who grew up there, and Toby Zoates who squatted there for many years. The continued use of the place for a community art centre maintains this association of the cottages with creative endeavour. The cottages are continually building associations with communities of artists via the Culture at Work artist in residency program. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The cottages have local landmark qualities as a group of nineteenth century vernacular weatherboard and brick cottages, small in scale, within an urban environment now dominated by high- rise apartment buildings. It was this simple, nineteenth century, working people's aesthetic which inspired Sali Herman's painting, and the creative endeavours of the squatters, who adapted and decorated the cottages, and the conservationist impulse of those squatters and the diverse set of groups and individuals who supported them and the retention of the cottages into the present. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Old Pyrmont Cottages displayed local social significance following the proposals for their redevelopment, which roused an enormous amount of local interest in their future in the early 1990s. Many local community groups in Pyrmont were involved in meetings concerning the future of the block.Godden Mackay 1993 The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Old Pyrmont Cottages have local heritage significance for their potential to yield information relevant to the construction techniques and materials associated with the most modest dwellings of the c.1880 period. There is potential for sub surface deposits associated with the early development of Pyrmont and with working class lifestyles and values. The group has the potential to provide an educational and tourism resource for Pyrmont. Its streetscape and small-scale remaining rooms demonstrate something of a way of life once common on the peninsula. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Old Pyrmont Cottages are of state heritage significance as one of the few Sydney squats for which a significant documentary record survives. The cottage group also has significance for NSW for their rarity as a mixed group of cottages, including several weatherboard buildings, and some associated open spaces including night soil lanes and areas that were essential to their functioning in the 19th century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Old Pyrmont Cottages have state heritage significance as a surviving example of late 19th century small-scale, working class housing in inner city Sydney, built in close proximity to industrial sites that provided work for its inhabitants. Such housing was once common in Sydney but most has been demolished for redevelopment throughout the 20th century. These cottages are a representative example of the Victorian Georgian vernacular style typical of late 19th century single-story worker's housing.

Well known virtual assistants include Alexa, made by Amazon, and Siri, produced by Apple. Other companies, such as Google and Microsoft, also have virtual assistants. There are privacy issues concerning what information can go to the third party corporations that operate virtual assistants and how this data can potentially be used. Because virtual assistants similarly to robots or other artificial intelligence are often considered \\"nurturing\\" bodies, consumers may overlook potential controversies and value their convenience more than their privacy. When forming relationships with devices, humans tend to become closer to those that perform humanly functions, which is what virtual assistants do. In order to allow users both convenience and assistance, privacy by design and the Virtual Security Button (VS Button) propose methods in which both are possible. One layer versus multilayer authentication The Virtual Security Button, which would detect motion, has been proposed as a method of adding multilayer authentication to devices that currently only have a single layer; devices with single layer authentication solely require a voice to be activated. This voice could be any person, not necessarily the intended human, which makes the method unreliable. Multilayer authentication requires multiple layers of security to authorize a virtual assistant to work. The Virtual Security button would provide a second layer of authentication for devices, such as Alexa, that would be triggered by both movement and the voice combined. A specific instance in which there are issues with the lack of verification necessary to unlock access to the virtual assistants and to give them commands is when an Amazon Alexa is left in a living quarters unattended. Currently, there is only one layer of authentication which is the voice; there is not a layer that requires the owner of the virtual assistant to be present. Thus, with only one barrier to access all of the information virtual assistants have access to, concerns regarding the security of information exchanged are raised. Such privacy concerns have influenced the technology sector to think of ways to add more verification, such as a Virtual Security Button. Voice authentication with Siri The \\"Hey Siri\\" function allows the iPhone to listen through ambient sound until this phrase (\\"Hey Siri\\") is spotted. Once this phrase is spotted, Siri is triggered to respond. In order to not always be listened to, an iPhone user can turn off the \\"Hey Siri\\" function. Without this function turned on, the device will not always be listening for those two words and other information will not be overheard in the process. This voice authentication serves as a singular layer, since only the voice is used to authenticate the user. Examples of virtual assistants Amazon Alexa This virtual assistant is linked to the \\"Echo\\" speaker created by Amazon and is primarily a device controlled by the voice that can play music, give information to the user, and perform other functions. Since the device is controlled by the voice, there are no buttons involved in its usage. The device does not have a measure to determine whether or not the voice heard is actually the consumer. The Virtual Security Button (VS Button) has been proposed as a potential method to add more security to this virtual assistant. The benefits of adding a VS button to Alexa The VS button uses technology from wifi networks to sense human kinematic movements. Home burglary poses a danger, as smart lock technology can be activated since there will be motion present. Thus, the VS button providing a double-check method before allowing Alexa to be utilized would lessen such dangerous scenarios from occurring. The introduction of the Virtual Security button would add another level of authentication, hence adding privacy to the device. Apple’s Siri Siri is Apple Corporation's virtual assistant and is utilized on the iPhone. Siri gathers the information that users input and has the ability to utilize this data. The ecosystem of the technological interface is vital in determining the amount of privacy; the ecosystem is where the information lives. Other information that can be compromised is location information if one uses the GPS feature of the iPhone. Any information, such as one's location, that is given away in an exchange with a virtual assistant is stored in these ecosystems. Hey Siri \\"Hey Siri\\" allows Siri to be voice-activated. The device continues to collect ambient sounds until it finds the words \\"Hey Siri.\\" This feature can be helpful for those who are visually impaired, as they can access their phone's applications through solely their voice. Siri's level of authentication Apple's Siri also has solely one level of authentication. If one has a passcode, in order to utilize various features, Siri will require the passcode to be inputted. However, consumers value convenience so passcodes are not in all devices. Cortana Cortana, Microsoft's virtual assistant, is another voice activated virtual assistant that only requires the voice; hence, it also utilizes solely the singular form of authentication. The device does not utilize the VS button previously described to have a second form of authentication present. The commands that the device utilizes mostly have to do with saying what the weather is, calling one of the user's contacts, or giving directions. All of these commands require an insight into the user's life because in the process of answering these queries, the device looks through data which is a privacy risk. Google Assistant Google Assistant, which was originally dubbed Google Now, is the most human-like virtual assistant. The similarities between humans and this virtual assistant stem from the natural language utilized as well as the fact that this virtual assistant in particular is very knowledgeable about the tasks that humans would like them to complete prior to the user's utilization of these tasks. This prior knowledge makes the interaction much more natural. Some of these interactions specifically are called promotional commands. Automated virtual assistants in ride sharing Ride sharing companies like Uber and Lyft utilize artificial intelligence to scale their scopes of business. In order to create adaptable prices that change with the supply and demand of rides, such companies use technological algorithms to determine \\"surge\\" or \\"prime time\\" pricing. Moreover, this artificial intelligence feature helps to allay privacy concerns regarding the potential exchange of confidential user information between Uber and Lyft employees. However, even the artificial intelligence utilized can \\"interact\\" with each other, so these privacy concerns for the companies are still relevant. Accessibility of terms of use The terms of use that one has to approve when first getting their device is what gives corporations like Apple Corporation access to information. These agreements outline both the functions of devices, what information is private, and any other information that the company thinks is necessary to expose. Even for customers that do read this information, the information is often decoded in a vague and unclear manner. The text is objectively a small font and is often considered too wordy or lengthy in scope for the average user. Privacy by design Privacy by design makes the interface more secure for the user. Privacy by design is when a product's blueprint incorporates aspects of privacy into how the object or program is created. Even technology uses that have little to do with location have the ability to track one's location. For example, WiFi networks are a danger for those trying to keep their locations private. Various organizations are working toward making privacy by design more regulated so that more companies do it. If a product does not have privacy by design, the producer might consider adding modes of privacy to the product. The goal is for organizations to be formed to ensure that privacy by design is done using a standard; this standard would make privacy by design more reliable and trustworthy than privacy by choice. The standard would have to be high enough to not allow for loopholes of information to infringe upon, and such rules may apply to virtual assistants. Various patents have controlled the requirement of technology, such as artificial intelligence, to include various modes of privacy by nature. These proposals have included Privacy by Design, which occurs when aspects of privacy are incorporated into the blueprint of a device. This way, corporations do not have to build privacy into their designs in the future; designs can be written with privacy in mind. This would allow for a more fail-safe method to make sure that algorithms of privacy would not leave even edge cases out. Artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence as a whole attempts to emulate human actions and provide the menial services that humans provide, but should not have to be bothered with. In the process of automating these actions, various technological interfaces are formed. The problem that has to be solved has to do with the concept that in order to process information and perform their functions, virtual assistants curate information. What they do with this information and how the information can be compromised is vital to note for both the field of virtual assistants and artificial intelligence more broadly. Controversy There have been controversies surrounding the opinions that virtual assistants can have. As the technology has evolved, there is potential for the virtual assistants to possess controversial positions on issues which can cause uproar. These views can be political, which can be impactful on society since virtual assistants are used so widely. Crowdsourcing is also controversial; although it allows for innovation from the users, it can perhaps act as a cop-out for companies to take credit where, in reality, the customers have created a new innovation. Wizard of Oz approach One way to research human-robot interaction is called the Wizard of Oz approach. Specifically, this approach aims to have a human leader of a study fill in for a robot while the user completes a task for research purposes. In addition to humans evaluating artificial intelligence and robots, the Wizard of Oz approach is being introduced. When technology becomes close to being human-like, the Wizard of Oz approach says that this technology has the ability to evaluate and augment other artificial intelligence technology. Moreover, the method also suggests that technology, in order to be utilized, does not necessarily have to be human-like. Thus, in order to be utilized, as long as they have useful features, virtual assistants do not have to focus all of their innovation on becoming more human-like.

They were most popular during the 1820s, being erected at the site of infamous murders. They mostly serve to commemorate the life of the victim or to warn of the consequences of committing such acts, while at least one warns women to take more care to avoid becoming a victim. Many of the stones are now regarded as local landmarks and some have been granted protection as listed structures.  Description  Murder stones are engraved stone monuments placed at or nearby the scene of a murder, often where crimes had caused particular shock or outrage within a community. The majority of stones known today were erected within a hundred year period, with the majority placed in the 1820s. One stone, a rough-cut boulder with the simple inscription \\"murder\\", near Ardwell in Scotland is traditionally dated to 1551 and associated with the murder of the Laird of Castle Clanyard by a member of Clan McCulloch though historians believe that it too is of 19th-century origin. All of the stones known today are in countryside areas, with none in cities. They are relatively widespread in England but only a handful are known in Wales, one being at Cadoxton, and the Ardwell stone is the only one documented in Scotland. Most stones mark the scene of crimes where the perpetrator was detected and brought to justice, but some mark unsolved killings. They seem to have been erected by prominent local people; religious leaders, landowners and justices of the peace are among those known to have commissioned murder stones. Their purpose varies with many simply commemorating the life of the victim. Others warn unknown perpetrators or those who might consider similar crimes of the consequences of their actions - either at the hands of the courts or by divine judgement. The stone at Cadoxton is said to have been placed to face the house of the chief suspect for the crime, who was not brought to justice, and warned: \\"Although the savage murderer escaped for a season the detection of man yet God hath set his mark upon him either for time or eternity, and the cry of blood will assuredly pursue him to certain and terrible righteous judgement\\". One at Akebar in North Yorkshire simply carries the date of the killing and the words \\"do no murder\\". Another stone, dated 1817, lays part of the blame with the female victim for having \\"incautiously repaired to a scene of amusement, without proper protection\\".  Legacy  Many of the stones are now local landmarks and some have been granted the protection of a listed structure. One of the more famous stones is that to the Unknown Sailor, an unidentified man murdered at Hindhead in Surrey in 1786. The stone was mentioned by Charles Dickens in his 1838–39 work The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby. Dickens has the principal character of his work come across the stone at the Devil's Punch Bowl during his journey to London.

She is a professor of mathematics at Bucknell University. Education and career Gorkin earned bachelor's and master's degrees in statistics from Michigan State University in 1976. She then shifted to pure mathematics for her doctoral studies, completing her Ph.D. at Michigan State in 1982, the same year she joined the Bucknell Faculty. Her dissertation, Decompositions of the Maximal Ideal Space of L, was supervised by Sheldon Axler. At Bucknell, she was Presidential Professor from 2001 to 2004. Books With Ulrich Daepp, Gorkin is the author of the undergraduate textbook Reading, Writing, and Proving: A Closer Look at Mathematics (Springer, 2003; 2nd ed., 2011). With Daepp, Andrew Shaffer, and Karl Voss, she is the author of Finding Ellipses: What Blaschke Products, Poncelet’s Theorem, and the Numerical Range Know about Each Other (Carus Mathematical Monographs, MAA Press, 2018). The book studies a connection between Blaschke products, Poncelet's closure theorem, and the numerical range of matrices. A Blaschke product is a certain kind of mapping of the unit disk in the complex plane to itself, and the ones considered in the first part of the book have order three (they map the unit circle three-to-one to itself, so that each point on the unit circle has three preimages). These triples of preimages form triangles that are all inscribed in the unit circle, and (it turns out) they all circumscribe an ellipse. Thus, they form an infinite system of polygons inscribed in and circumscribing two conics, as Poncelet's theorem describes. The ellipse is the boundary of the numerical range of a certain matrix derived from the Blaschke product, a region within which the eigenvalues of the matrix can be found, and in this case the eigenvalues are at the foci of the ellipse. The book tells \\"a story of discovery\\" outlining these connections, extends similar results to Blaschke products of higher order, and outlines a plan for further research in this area.

It is a deciduous, terrestrial orchid with one large and one small leaf and between six and twenty pale green or yellowish flowers with purple markings. It grows in rainforest and grassy forests.  Description  Eulophia venosa is a deciduous, terrestrial herb with two dark green, narrow lance-shaped leaves long and wide, one leaf larger than the other. Between six and twenty pale green or yellowish flowers with purple markings, long and wide are borne on a wiry flowering stem long. The flowers are resupinate and shaped like a star. The sepals are narrow triangular in shape, long, about wide and spread horizontally and widely apart from each other. The petals are elliptic in shape, long and about wide. The labellum is long, wide, has deep purplish red veins and three lobes. The middle lobe turns downwards and is wavy but the side lobes are upright. Flowering occurs between July and November. Taxonomy and naming The pointed corduroy orchid was first formally described in 1858 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Dipodium venosum and published the description in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. In 1873, George Bentham changed the name to Eulophia venosa and published the change in Flora Australiensis. The specific epithet (venosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"veiny\\". Distribution and habitat Eulophia venosa grows in woodland, grassy forest and on the edge of rainforests. It is variously reported as occurring in northern Queensland, the Northern Territory, New Guinea, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Taiwan.

It includes many interconnecting creeks, rivers, lakes and inner bays that are navigable by shallow draft powerboat, kayak or canoe. The official Wilderness Waterway route is 99 miles long, but a traveler can use various additional route options to greatly extend or slightly shorten the trip. The 99-mile Wilderness Waterway connects Flamingo and Everglades City. Most paddlers allow at least eight days to complete the trip. This route is recommended for experienced paddlers only. There are many areas of very shallow water that may be encountered along the Wilderness Waterway. Powerboats over 18' long may have to detour around Alligator Creek and Plate Creek. The “Nightmare” pass is passable only to paddlers at high tide. To prevent prop dredging, which results in increased turbidity and the destruction of submerged natural features, boats with drafts of two feet or more, including the propeller, should not use the waterway. Navigation charts The NOAA charts that cover the wilderness waterway are 11430, 11432 and 11433. Camping along the Wilderness Waterway Map of Everglades Wilderness Waterway and camping sites There are around 40 camping designated sites along the waterway which include beach, ground and chickee campsites. Plate Creek Chickee 12.25.2016 East Cape Sable Beach camping * Beach sites are located along Florida Bay and Gulf of Mexico. During ideal conditions, insects may be scarce, but mosquitoes and no-see-ums (tiny biting insects) may be present, especially at sunrise and sunset. Gulf waters at beach sites can become rough; seas can exceed 3 feet. Low tides often expose large mud flats, which may make beach access difficult. Campfires are only allowed below high- tide line. * Chickees are located along rivers and bays where dry land is inaccessible. They are elevated 10' x 12' wooden platforms with roofs. A walkway leads to a self-contained toilet. You'll need a free–standing tent, since stakes or nails are not allowed. No campfires are allowed on chickees. Some paddlers have difficulty accessing chickees from their boats. A loop of heavy rope may be helpful.in Wilderness Trip Planner * Ground sites are mounds of earth and shells a few feet higher than the surrounding mangroves, located along interior bays and rivers. They tend to have more insects than chickees or beach sites. No campfires are allowed on ground sites but gas grills or stoves are permitted. Wood, charcoal, or coal fueled grills or stoves are not permitted. Outside Route The additional 75-mile Outside Route extends along Florida Bay and the Gulf of Mexico from Flamingo back to Everglades City. This route can be used to avoid shuttle service and usually adds 5 more days of paddle. Travelers will have to portage their paddle boats over a small freshwater/saltwater dam that separates the 99-mile \\"inside route\\" from the open water of Florida Bay. in Paddle Across Florida Trip Report The campsites along the Outside Route are: * East Clubhouse * Clubhouse Beach * East Cape, Middle Cape, and Northwest Cape Sable * Graveyard Creek * Highland Beach * Hog Key, Turkey Key, New Turkey Key, Mormon Key, Pavilion Key and Rabbit Key - all part of the Ten Thousand Islands Archipelago. Permits Campers can obtain permits at the Flamingo Visitor Center and the Gulf Coast Visitor Contact Station daily, from 8:00AM to 4:30PM. Campers must register in person. Permits are currently free and obtainable no more than a day in advance of the start of a trip. All backcountry campsites are open. Please note that campers should expect that chickees north of Harney River will not have roofs (due to Hurricane Irma devastating the area in 2017). Broad Creek and \\"The Nightmare\\" between the Broad River chickee and Harney River chickee are currently impassable.in Everglades Backcountry Camping Notable features and landmarks * Nauti Buoy Chickee - the last remaining private property within the Everglades National Park. * Shell mounds built by Calusa people. Most of the ground campsites are situated on the shell mounds of various sizes and state of preservation. * Watson's Place - a shell mound site occupied by a sugar cane farmer and criminal Ed Watson in the early 20th century. * Darwin's Place - a shell mound occupied by Arthur Darwin, a hermit of the Everglades from 1940s to 1980. Anyone who attempted to paddle the waterway would have to pass Darwin's place on the way so he became famous among the paddling community.

It is a harm reduction strategy designed to provide safe access to mifepristone and misoprostol for women and trans men in the United States who may not otherwise have access to abortion or miscarriage management services. People are able to self-manage their own abortion with remote access to a physician and help-desk for any questions. The website is available in English and Spanish. Aid Access was founded by Rebecca Gomperts, a Dutch physician, in March 2018.  Services provided  Aid Access offers mifepristone in combination with misoprostol and misoprostol alone for medical abortion. Services available depend on the which state the person lives in. An online consultation process is required, which includes questions to assess for the medical eligibility and safety of providing medical abortion by mail. In California, New Jersey, New York, and Washington, a doctor can directly mail the medications required. In most other states, the physician provides a prescription and instructions for it to be filled with a pharmacy in India, which then mails the medication to the patient in the United States. Due to shipping from outside of the United States, pills can sometimes take 3 weeks to arrive. Between January 2019 and April 2020, 49,935 requests were made to Aid Access with the online consultation form.  Safety  There are no data addressing the safety of Aid Access in particular. Self- induced abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol can be performed safely, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO recommends that determination of eligibility for medical abortion is done by a health provider, but self-administering the medications at home and self-assessing the completion of the abortion are recommended in specific circumstances. This aligns with the care provided by Aid Access.  FDA lawsuit  Aid Access was sent a letter by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on March 8, 2019 warning Aidaccess.org to cease selling \\"a misbranded and unapproved new drug\\" in the United States. In a statement, the National Women's Health Network saw this as a politicized attack against medical abortion, rather than a broader attempt to curb online drug sales. In response to this letter, 117 member of Congress sent a letter thanking the FDA for this action. Gomperts did not comply with the warning and clarified that she was not selling medications in the United States, since she sent the prescriptions to an independent pharmacy, which then dispensed the medications. On September 9, 2019, on behalf of Aid Access, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts sued Alex Azar, then Secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, and other federal officials for seizing packages containing medications and blocking transfer of payments to Aid Access. The goals of the suit were to stop these actions as well as stop the prosecution of Dr. Gomperts and Aid Access by the FDA in providing constitutionally protected abortion access. A motion to dismiss this suit was filed by the FDA on November 15, 2019, followed by a response letter back to the FDA on December 19, 2019.

This car is the fourth addition in the McLaren Ultimate Series, after the Senna, the P1, and the F1. The car is also part of the 18 new cars or derivatives that McLaren will launch as part of its Track22 business plan. The Speedtail was unveiled on October 26, 2018. Speedtail side view Slated for release in February 2020, the car recharges while driving.  Specifications  The Speedtail is powered by a modified M840T from the 720S and a hybrid powertrain to generate . The Speedtail uses a carbon fibre monocoque, with the passenger seats integrated into the chassis, as well as dihedral doors like other McLaren models.  Performance  The company claims that the Speedtail has a top speed of and can accelerate from in 12.8 seconds.  Technology  The car recharges while driving, though a wireless charging pad is included with the car, trickle-charging it when not in use. The Speedtail is fitted with electrochromic glass, which darkens at the push of a button, eliminating the need for sun visors and also incorporates LED lights in the interior. Similarly, the Speedtail does not feature door mirrors, instead using HD cameras mounted on the front guards that pop out when the ignition is turned on, and retract inside when the \\"Velocity mode\\" is activated, which the company states is to reduce drag. The front wheels feature carbon fibre static covers to further reduce drag. On the exterior, it features hydraulically actuated active rear ailerons which are formed in flexible carbon fibre and are an integral part of the rear clamshell.  Interior  The Speedtail has a 3-seat layout, similar to the preceding F1, which has the driver sitting at the center of the car, and slightly forward of the two passenger seats. On the original F1, this layout was used to provide better visibility than a conventional seating layout. The interior of the Speedtail features \\"directional leather finish\\" which McLaren says “makes it easy to slide into the seat but then subtly holds the occupant in place while they drive.” and is strong enough that it can be used in place of carpet on the floor of the Speedtail. It also features \\"Titanium Deposition Carbon Fibre\\", which is when \\"a micron-thin layer of titanium is fused directly onto the weave and becomes an integral part of the carbon fiber’s construction.\\", as well as Thin-Ply Technology Carbon Fibre (TPT), consisting of countless 30 micron thick layers of carbon fibre. The company also offers bespoke luggage for Speedtail owners, a practice implemented when the F1 went on sale.  Production  Testing was done in Florida at the Kennedy Space Center at the Johnny Bohmer Proving Grounds. The shuttle landing runway was used for the tests. It also tested in tracks in Germany, Spain and Italy. In November 2018, McLaren planned to build 106 examples of the Speedtail, all of which have already been sold, at an MSRP of around £2.1 million. Due in part to its use of cameras in lieu of side mirrors and no side-mounted airbags, the Speedtail is not street legal in the United States, even though around 35% of the total cars were bought by American buyers. A spokeswoman for the company stated that the car may be legal, pending approval by NHTSA, to be imported into the U.S. under the “Show or Display” law, which exempts cars that are “historically or technologically significant\\" from NHTSA safety standards but requires that owners not drive the vehicle more than 2,500 miles in a 12-month period. McLaren has made it clear that they will not offer assistance with importing or registering the Speedtail in the U.S. Production of the McLaren Speedtail commenced in the United Kingdom after high-speed testing was completed by December 2019. The prototype XP2 version had \\"reached its terminal velocity more than 30 times,\\" topping out at 250 mph (403 km/h), and able to go from a standstill to 186 mph (300km/h) in less than 13 seconds.

It is located in close proximity to Sarita Vihar and Kalindi Kunj, about 1 kilometers from the Uttar Pradesh border. It was created in 2004 when the slum dwellers from across Delhi were forcefully evicted and relocated to the urban peripheries. Since its formation, the community has undergone massive structural, political, economic, and social changes affecting the lives of the community. The transformation of Khadar is underscored by several challenges ranging from the provision of basic amenities, mobility, and the condition of women's safety. History \\"Khadar\\" refers to the black loamy soil found in this region; a natural feature caused by the low-lying areas of fertile floodplains. Since most of the land is on the slopes of canals running through the colony, local building regulations prohibit the construction of houses higher than three floors. For over 100 years, a village called Madanpur Khadar had existed in this area, until new waves of migrants in the 1970s and 1980s going to Delhi in search of jobs and working in the industries and factories in Delhi's urban peripheries began to change its landscape. In 2000, a landmark judgment was passed by the Indian Supreme Court. During the summing up of a Public Interest Litigation brought by a ‘concerned citizen’, the judge labeled slum dwellers as ‘pickpockets’, ‘encroachers’ and ‘trespassers’. Widely known as the Almitra Patel case, this ruling overturned the earlier political patronage of slums that had enabled its residents to live and flourish in the city, even though the land they lived on was not formally owned by them. As Dr. Ayona Datta wrote in 2012, \\"While the Indian courts till the 1980s had followed an implicit understanding that access to affordable shelter and infrastructure services was a basic human right, this ruling set the trend for interpreting squatting as a criminal offense in most regional states of India\\". Shortly after, Madanpur Khadar area was assigned by the Government of India as a relocation site for evictees from various slums across Delhi. The name JJ Colony is a derivative of \\"jhuggi-jhopri\\" a colloquial name for unauthorized slums. Madanpur Khadar JJ Colony was formed after the Supreme Court ruling in 2000 when the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) acquired land from the village of Madanpur Khadar, subdivided it into plots and sold it on a lease (Rs7000 for 22m2 plots and Rs 5000 for 12m2 plots) to thousands of families who were evicted and relocated from slums across Delhi. The eligibility for relocation was set as those slum dwellers holding ration cards by 31 January 1990. Later, it was modified to make those holding ration cards up to 31 December 1998 eligible to plots of 12.5m2. Over four years, people from Nehru Place, Kalkaji Mandir, Raj Nagar, R. K. Puram, Nizamuddin, Green Park, Alaknanda, and ITO were relocated to the JJ colony under extremely challenging and difficult conditions. Although its residents are now legal leaseholders of their plots, it was named a JJ Colony since the inhabitants were previously slum dwellers from Delhi. A report by Delhi Janwadi Adhikar Manch in 2001 highlighted the challenges that newly evicted slum dwellers faced when resettled in the Madanpur Khadar JJ Colony. The land was mainly agricultural and had not been developed or serviced with basic infrastructure connections. Although most residents moved to the Colony around 2000, they did not receive electricity connections till 2004. There was no direct sewage connection, resulting in many people defecating in the open. Despite the construction of public toilets later, they are poorly maintained and mostly unused. Other infrastructures, such as water and sanitation, were also lacking at the time of settlement. Water supply was unpredictable and residents often had to rely on tankers or hand pumps. Drainage was via uncovered channels along the internal roads.  Local neighborhood  Madanpur Khadar is approached by the main road which is lined by scrap dealers on both sides. This road crosses the Yamuna canal and enters the resettlement colony. Across the canal is agricultural land owned by the residents of Madanpur Khadar village. As one crosses the canal, Bablu Dairy is located on the left, selling buffalo and cow milk. The only government alcohol shop in the area is adjacent to it. The first square on entering the colony is known as Samosa Chowk, followed by Nirman Chowk, after which is Jalebi Chowk and Sri Ram Chowk, which then leads on to the road to Kalindi Kunj. Shops around the Nirman Chowk sell building material. These are found between Jalebi Chowk and Samosa Chowk. While there are grocery and vegetable shops on each block, the main markets are the vegetable market near Jalebi Chowk and the Saturday market (Shani bazaar), which is set up near the Shani mandir (temple). The vegetable market opens daily. Jalebi Chowk and the adjacent market is the most popular destination for evening snacks and vegetables, which runs on a daily basis; it also has an SBI, Canara Bank and ICICI ATMs. There are 8 blocks in total in the resettlement colony, namely A1, A2, B1, B2, C block, D block, A pocket and Phase 3. In both A pocket and B2, the constructions are a bit beneath the land level. File:Shri Ram Chowk.jpg|Shri Ram Chowk File:Jalebi Chowk.jpg|Jalebi Chowk File:Shani Bazaar Road, Madanpur Khadar JJ Colony .jpg|Shani Bazaar Road Accessibility Different types of private transport operate out of the colony. E-rickshaws take people from here to the two nearest metro stations- Sarita Vihar on the Violet Line and Kalindi Kunj on the Magenta Line. Apart from this, private mini-buses and vans offer their services through Jasola-Okhla-Harkesh Nagar to Nehru Place and back. Despite being one of the biggest resettlement colonies, with hundreds of workers going outside to work, the Delhi Transport Corporation has no buses that run along these routes, making the residents entirely dependent on private transportation and, more recently, the Delhi Metro. Education and employment There are 6 government schools in the JJ colony and about 15 private schools. Prior to the opening of these schools, the children from the resettlement colony attended the Sarita Vihar Government School. Men of the colony are typically employed as daily wage workers, in hotels, or call centers. Women also work in these places, but typically also find employment in the flats/homes of Sarita Vihar and Kalindi Kunj as domestic laborers.  Demographics  Current residents of Khadar are typically first or second generation migrants from regional states such as West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, or Rajasthan. The population is estimated around 25000 people, the majority of which are Hindus. Residents are primarily engaged in low-wage jobs such as unskilled laborers, drivers, domestic workers, security guards, rag pickers, vendors, and construction, industrial, and commercial workers. Women typically work as domestic workers, factory workers, taxi drivers, street hawkers, and NGO workers. Hindi is the local language. Governance The ward number of the JJ colony is 103, and the current counselor is Santosh Devi, who won on a ticket from the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP.) in 2017. Physical and Social Infrastructure Madanpur Khadar brings out the stark contrast in the city's planning and infrastructure, encapsulated succinctly in an article in a leading national daily, which stated, \\"Madanpur Khadar – sandwiched between the blue-glass fronted corporate offices and spanking new malls of Sarita Vihar, adjoining the imposing Apollo Hospital – does not have a primary health center.\\" The Urban Services Programme for resettlement colonies mandates that Pay and Use toilets be made available at the ratio of 1 seat per 10 families. However, the number of public toilets in the entire locality ranges from about 15-20. The number of public toilets in each block typically depends upon the size of the block. B1 has 5 toilets whereas A1 has 3 and B2 has 2. The toilets also only operate on specific times, from 6-11am in the mornings and 4-8pm at night. Safe and free drinking water is difficult to find in this colony, as the supply water is non-potable and hard. This has led to a growing water-distilling business in the region which provide 20 liters for Rs10 on average. Private water distribution The nearby Badarpur Thermal Power Station on Mathura Road creates long term health risks of exposure to fly ash and dust particles. However, there are no primary health centers; only one government dispensary is functional in the area, though many private clinics also exist. Health remains a major area of concern, with diseases such as diarrhea, typhoid and respiratory diseases common among children. According to a study by Delhi Forces Neev, 2 percent of the children in Madanpur Khadar were severely malnourished as of 2010. For any major illnesses, residents have to travel more than 15 km to AIIMS or Safdarjung Hospital. The lack of access to basic civic amenities and essential services is a problem for all, but disproportionately affects women and young girls in such situations. As a Guardian article recently reported, \\"Faced with prohibitive costs of unregulated private transport, fear of harassment by men on long journeys and few employment opportunities in their new settlement, they have little choice but to remain at home\\". The challenges of mobility for women are further exacerbated by high incidences of gender-based violence, including sexual harassment, sexual assault and domestic violence. NGOs such as Jagori have worked in this settlement raising awareness about Violence Against Women (VAW) since 2004. There are close to 40 anganwadis (crèches) in the JJ colony. While most of them are run by the government, some of them were sub-contracted to NGO's briefly. The further operational status of these remains undetermined. There are many NGO's currently working in Madanpur Khadar, such as World Vision India, Jagori, Agragrami India, Etasha Society, Prayatan, Casp Delhi. They work on issues such as health, education, women's empowerment, craft making, vocational training, and placements. Most of these organizations focus on women's and children's rights.

Young and Michael Roemer. The documentary was produced for NBC White Paper, a television series that ran on NBC from 1960 to 1980. The film details the lives of inhabitants living in a Sicilian slum (Cortile Cascino), in Palermo, Italy. The main focus of the film is 23 year old Angela Capra and her family. After viewing footage of the film, NBC deemed it too extreme for American viewers and two days before it was scheduled to be broadcast, NBC abruptly cancelled it. In 1987, Britain's public-service television Channel 4 indicated they wanted to broadcast the film, and asked Young to create a 10-minute update on the fate of Capra and her family. Young's son Andrewand his wife Susan Todd took an interest in the project and traveled back to Sicily, where they found Capra and her relatives still living in Palermo. Andrew and Todd instead made their own documentary, Children of Fate: Life and Death in a Sicilian Family, detailing what had transpired in Capra and her family's lives during the preceding 30 years. Background Robert Young had been one of the main contributors to NBC White Paper during its first two seasons, making three documentaries for the series. For Cortile Cascino, Young asked Roemer, an accomplished filmmaker, to collaborate with him on the project. Upon arrival in Palermo, Young wanted to immerse himself in the lives of the inhabitants residing in the slum area, while Roemer was hesitant to live without running water and sanitary conditions. The pair decided they would film the production in the vérité genre, filming first and arranging the footage later. They conducted interviews of the residents first, making English voice-over dialogue for the interviews, while the remainder of the filming was conducted after the structure was written, with two editors cutting the footage daily. The main character in the film, 23 year old Angela Capra, is shown feeding her children on stale and stolen pasta, while frequently enduring beatings from her alcoholic and unemployed husband. Capra relays to the filmmakers how one of her daughters came down with a fever, refused to eat and died of malnutrition. Capra is also shown giving birth to her fourth child with assistance from her female friends. The rest of the documentary is split into different sections examining the lives of the occupants. Scenes in the film show the different jobs the residents hold, with men and boys digging through the city dump, weaving rope from human hair clippings collected off barber shop floors, children sorting rags, collecting metals and polishing furniture. Additionally, the film depicts residents employed by the various enterprises the Sicilian Mafia control, gambling, prostitution, illegal slaughter-houses and meat markets. The Mafia also controls concessions for funerals, showing gravediggers removing previously buried remains, making room for new ones. The documentary ends with a reversal of the beginning of the film, showing the two filmmakers leaving the slum riding out on the train. Cancellation by NBC Cortile Cascino was originally scheduled to be broadcast on May 18, 1962 on White Paper, but a few days before the airing, NBC abruptly cancelled the premiere. In addition to the graphic images of poverty and despair portrayed in the slum, Irving Gitlin, producer of White Paper, also objected to \\"chronological manipulations\\" in the film. Gitlin complained that a wedding showed another couple, instead of the actual couple, they ended the film with the death of Capra's daughter, and had also staged the birth of Capra's fourth child because they were leaving Italy and she hadn't given birth yet. Young wanted to add a disclaimer to the film, but NBC insisted he change it instead. When Young refused, he was fired, and the film was \\"vaulted\\" and never aired. However, Young and Roemer both argued that the liberties they took \\"captured the truth about life\\" in the slum more accurately than following the actual chronological timeline of the events. In an interview with the author of Robert M. Young: Essays on the Films, Young speculated that \\"Gitlin's complaints were motivated by political reasons\\". Young said the Kennedy administration was supporting the Democratic Italian government, to prevent Italy from becoming a communist society, and the administration's endeavor would have been threatened by the portrayal of such intense poverty depicted in the film. Roemer said the real reason was because of an \\"intense personal animosity\\" between Young and Gitlin. Epilogue The 1993 documentary by Andrew Young and his wife Susan Todd find Angela Capra, now 53 years old, divorced from her abusive husband, and living nearby in an apartment and supporting herself as a cleaning woman. Her children still live near her, with one son spending time in prison. The documentary is interspersed with scenes from the earlier film, and won the prize for Excellence in Cinematography Award Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival in 1993, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. The documentary was also the first time that footage from the original film was shown. See also *Robert M.

The development was designed by Thomas Heatherwick and opened in October 2018. History The two Victorian coal drops sheds were used to receive coal from South Yorkshire and trans-ship it to narrowboats on the Regents Canal and to horse-drawn carts; they processed 8m tonnes a year. Coal was the only form of energy available to heat and light the buildings of London, either directly or after having been converted to coal gas in the adjacent gas works. Coal use was challenged by electricity, and electricity prevailedthe coal drops were redundant and fell into decay. They were used as warehouse units; one was gutted by fire in 1985 and another used by Bagley’s nightclub, which closed in 2007. The night clubs complemented a vibrant night life of easy drug access, raves and prostitution. The coal drops The Regent's Canal was named in 1820 after the Prince Regent, who became George IV the same year. After his demise, the Kings Cross monument was raised at the junction of New Road and Battlebridge Road (Euston Road and York Way); this gave the name to the area, but it was removed in 1845. This was former common land, and open to development. An 1846 Act of Parliament prohibited the railway companies from building south of Euston Road. The London and Birmingham Railway (London and North Western), with George Stephenson connections had built their terminus at Euston Square in 1833-1837. The Great Northern Railway's London & York Bill received royal assent in 1846 and they built at King's Cross; the Midland Railway built at St Pancras in 1863–8. Their goods yards were north of the canal with lines opening onto wharfs and basins. The topology changed with the rapidly developing economy and technology. The coal drops were in the Great Northern's western goods yard. The eastern coal drops were built in 1851. They were essentially a long three-storey, 48-bay (cell) shed reached from the north by a viaduct. The trains came in on four tracks on the third storey; the waggon's bottom was opened, and the goods fell down chutes to the hopper floor below where they were sorted, before being lowered to the road vehicles waiting on the ground floor. The goods were often coal that needed to be graded, but could be potatoes or any heavy loose load. The hopper floor was supported on cast-iron columns and beams. The western coal drops were built in 1860; they presented a simplified and more advanced design. The roof span was . The rails came in on an open cast-iron viaduct that terminated under the roof. Beneath was the Coal and Stone Basin, allowing direct transhipment to canal boats. This was filled in when the adjacent Western Goods Shed was built in 1897–99. The Western coal drops became a general-purpose warehouse. The Coal offices and the Wharf Road Viaduct and Wharf Road Arches close the site to the south, where they follow the arc of the Regent's Canal. The arches were used as stabling for some of the Great Northern's large stock of horses. There were 200 horses in 1850, and 867 in 1867, eventually rising to 1500. Great Northern had a fleet of 2-tonne and 4-tonne road vehicles, as they also delivered coal directly to the customers. The horses were well stabled, and the company had its own farriers and a horse infirmary. Change of use In 1866, Samuel Plimsoll opened his own coal drops, south of the canal in Cambridge Street; to reach it John Jay built an independent viaduct between the buildings and over the canal. Plimsoll had invented an advanced mechanism that reduced the damage to the coal as it was 'dropped'. This reduced wastage and thus increased profit. From 1870, business moved away from both the Eastern and Western coal drops. By 1879 both of them had ceased to function as staithes, and were used for warehousing. The Eastern Coal Drops was sold in 1876 to the glass bottle manufacturer, Bagley, Wild and Company. They were founded in 1871 in Knottingley, Yorkshire, specifically as it was close to the railway, so they could easily move their goods to London. In the 1930s, Joseph Bagley & Co Ltd were transporting thirty waggons of bottles a day to the yard. The nightclubs In 1986 the rave scene started in London. Disused warehouses were used to stage illegal raves, a form of partying fuelled by House music from Chicago and the illicit drug ecstasy. The scene developed and spawned several legal clubs such as The Clink, Shoom and Heaven and by the early-to-mid 1990s became centred on three bars in King's Cross. There was Billy Reilly’s bar, 'Fabric' under the arches of the Coal Offices (which inspired a successor club, also called Fabric), 'The Cross' and 'Bagley’s', which took over three floors at the southern end of the Eastern Coal Drops. Bagley's, which was later called 'Canvas', lasted till 2008. It could accommodate 2500 clubbers on a Saturday night. It was reputed to have some of London's best DJs. By 2008 the buildings had become derelict again. Both the global financial crisis of 2008 (which caused a recession) and the ban on smoking indoors were blamed. Redevelopment Argent Group, the overall developer for the King's Cross Central site, appointed Thomas Heatherwick as architect for the redevelopment of the Coal Drop Yards as a retail park in 2014. Heatherwick worked in conjunction with engineers Arup, and the plans were approved in December 2015. BAM Construct undertook the construction work, which started in February 2016, following a two-year pre-construction phase to survey the condition of the Victorian era buildings and carry out demolition work as necessary. Work was completed and the development opened on 26 October 2018. Design The £100m project called for the listed Victorian sheds to be converted into a new high-end, 9,290 sq metre, shopping complex and privately owned public space. Thomas Heatherwick took the two converging arcaded sheds and connected them with the 'kissing roof. The two brick and wrought iron coal drops were designed at different times so were structurally different, but shared a common roof line. Heatherwick's scheme takes the analogy of how a strip of paper can be twisted, and does the same to the slate roof finish. He uses the brick sheds as a base, and constructs the plastic form of the roof from steel tubing. The result is an additional glazed space, in the roof, two storeys high that adds of space. The 35m wide roof adds no extra weight to the wall structures; it is supported on a 54 steel columns that are embedded within the building. The slate used in the roof comes from the same seam in the same Welsh slate quarry as was used in the original roof. There are 9290 square metres of shopping space, in units ranging from 15 to 1,800 square metres.

It is a High Level Architecture (HLA) federation object model developed for distributed simulation applications of defense and security. RPR FOM is listed in the NATO Modelling and Simulation Standards Profile AMSP-01. The RPR FOM provides backwards compatibility with simulations using the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) standard. It is standardized by Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) as SISO- STD-001-2015. The standard consists of two parts: * SISO-STD-001-2015 Standard for Guidance, Rationale, and Interoperability Modalities for the Real-time Platform Reference Federation Object Model (“GRIM”), which provides guidance for use of the RPR FOM. * SISO-STD-001.1-2015 Real-time Platform Reference Federation Object Model, which provides the object model in XML format for use in HLA Federations.  History and versions When the High Level Architecture was introduced by the US Department of Defense in 1996 the RPR FOM effort was initiated to facilitate the migration from DIS to HLA. RPR FOM version 1.0 This first RPR FOM version was released in 1998. It supports the capabilities of DIS version IEEE 1278.1-1995 (DIS 5). The standard provides a FOM supporting HLA version 1.3. RPR FOM version 2.0 This updated version was released in 2015 as SISO-STD-001. RPR FOM 2.0 supports the capabilities of DIS version IEEE 1278.1a-1998 (DIS 6). The development of RPR FOM 2.0 started in 2000, but came to a halt in 2007, resulting in a widely used draft version 17. The work was restarted in 2012 and finalized with a published standard in 2015. The standard provides FOMs supporting the following HLA versions: 1.3, IEEE 1516-2000 and IEEE 1516-2010 (“HLA Evolved”) in both modular and monolithic formats. RPR FOM version 3.0 Development of this upcoming version was started in 2016 by the SISO DIS and RPR FOM Product Support Group. In 2018, the development was handed over to a dedicated Product Development Group. The goal of RPR FOM version 3.0 is to support the capabilities of DIS version IEEE 1278.1-2012 (DIS 7).  Object model  The RPR FOM defines the information exchanged at runtime in a number of FOM modules: # Physical Module with key object classes Aircraft, Amphibious vehicle, Ground vehicle, Multi- domain platform, Spacecraft, Submersible vessel, Surface vessel, Human, Non- human, Munition, Expendables, Radio, Sensor and Supplies. # Aggregate Module with the key object class Aggregate entity. # Warfare Module with key interaction classes Weapon fire and Munition detonation. # Communication Module with the key object classes Radio transmitter and Radio receiver and several interaction classes for Radio signals. # Synthetic Environment Module with the key object classes Gridded data and several Environment objects (Areal object, Linear object and Point object) and a number of interaction classes with transactions for Environment objects. # Minefield Module with the key object class Minefield and a number of interaction classes supporting transactions for Minefields. # Logistics Module with a number of interaction classes for Repair, Resupply and Service. # Underwater Acoustics Module with key object classes Active sonar beam and several types of Underwater acoustics emissions. # Distributed Emission Regeneration Module with key object classes Designator, Emitter system, Identification friend or foe (IFF), Radar beam and Jammer beam. # Simulation Management Module with key interaction classes Start/Resume, Stop/Freeze, Set data and similar management services. Additional supporting modules include Foundation Module with a few basic data types, Enumerations Module with enumerations like types of platforms and equipment, Base Module with commonly used data types and generic object classes and Switches Module with runtime switches for the RTI.  Relationship to other standards  The RPR FOM is related to a number of other standards. * HLA: The RPR FOM follows the HLA Object Model Template (OMT) standard. * DIS: The RPR FOM inherits its information exchange model from the DIS standard. * SISO Enumerations. The RPR FOM includes a module with the SISO standard enumerations (SISO-REF-010). This module can be replaced when new versions of the enumerations are released. * Link 16: A Base Object Model (BOM), similar to a FOM module, that supports the exchange of Link 16 information is available as SISO-STD-002-2006. This module is compatible with the RPR FOM. * NATO Education and Training FOM (NETN FOM): This standard provides a number of FOM modules that extends the RPR FOM with support for multi-resolution modeling, initialization (based on Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL), transfer of modeling responsibilities, logistics, CBRN defense, interoperability with Command and Control systems, based on Coalition Battle management language (C-BML) and simulation control. * Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL): This standard is supported through NETN FOM above * Coalition Battle management language (C-BML): This standard is supported through NETN FOM above  References  Category:Distributed computing architecture Category:Modeling and simulation Category:Simulation software ","title":"RPR FOM"},{"id":"58883236","text":"Kajioka (written: ) is a Japanese surname.

It was built from 1902 to 1903. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Enginemans Resthouse was built in 1902-03, when the Railway Commissioners resumed land on Brandling Street for the construction of a new barracks or dormitory to provide accommodation for train drivers, firemen and guards when they were away from their homes. The Eveleigh Railway Workshops, adjacent to the site, had a major locomotive depot for the storage and servicing of running steam locomotives. For such depots, it was normal practice to have a nearby \\"barracks\\" building to accommodate staff between shifts. It replaced an earlier barrack which had been close to the running shed in the locomotive yard at the Eveleigh Railway Workshops, and had been requested by a proposed extension of the workshops. The Brandling Street site was selected due to its closeness to the workshops while being in a quiet neighbourhood. It was built at a cost of £2000. The new accommodation was a large two-storey building of an expanded domestic design with 13 principal rooms, a kitchen, a dining area and a 6ft. verandah on three sides. The dining area was occasionally used as a conference room. The building was used by the State Rail Authority's fire protection services during the 1980s and 1990s. It is now used as a private residence. It remains little altered from its original appearance and layout.  Description  The former Enginemans Resthouse is a two-storey Edwardian mansion on a quiet street featuring single or double storey late Victorian or Federation dwellings. The building is of Federation/ Edwardian style. It is surrounded by gardens and has verandas on three sides, paved with flagstones. The corridors runs in the middle of the house at both floor levels. The middle entrance is flanked with 2 windows on the ground level and 5 windows are displayed at the first level. All external walls are rendered and painted and the hipped roof is clad with corrugated iron roofing.  Heritage listing  Enginemans Resthouse was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. It is the largest of the few surviving railway barracks buildings in the State.

Diệu was the husband of female general Bùi Thị Xuân. He and Vũ Văn Dũng, Võ Ðình Tú, Nguyễn Văn Tuyết (Commander Tuyết), Lê Văn Hưng, Lý Văn Bưu, Nguyễn Văn Lộc (Commander Lộc) were known as \\"Seven Tiger Generals of Tây Sơn dynasty\\" (, ). The couple joined the Tây Sơn army in early time. Diệu was promoted to Thiếu phó (, \\"Junior Tutor\\"). In 1789, Diệu was appointed the governor of Nghệ An. There, he was ordered to build a new citadel, Phượng Hoàng trung đô (). Nguyễn Huệ planned to use it as the future capital, but later it was abandoned.Đại Nam chính biên liệt truyện, vol. 30 In 1792, Diệu was sent to attack Laos together with Lê Trung. In the same year, he was called back to Phú Xuân when Nguyễn Huệ was critically ill. Huệ ordered Trần Quang Diệu and other ministers to support the successor Nguyễn Quang Toản on his deathbed. In 1794 Diệu was sent to attack Diên Khánh. A coup d'état occurred in the next year, the regent Bùi Đắc Tuyên was executed by Vũ Văn Dũng, Phạm Công Hưng and Nguyễn Văn Huấn. Diệu was not trusted by the three generals because his wife was a niece of Tuyên. Getting the information, Diệu led his army retreated from Diên Khánh, and marched north. When the army reached Quy Nhơn, Nguyễn Văn Huấn came to meet him and asked for pardon. Diệu did not blame him. Finally, his army stayed at An Cựu. In the same time, an army under Vũ Văn Dũng and Nguyễn Văn Danh also marched there to defense. A civil war might break out at any moment, which made the young emperor afraid. Later, the crisis was settled by mediation of Phạm Công Hưng; Diệu was persuaded to reconcile with Dũng, and came back to Phú Xuân. He was appointed as one of regents together with Vũ Văn Dũng, Nguyễn Văn Huấn, and Nguyễn Văn Danh. Not long after, he was removed from military leadership.Việt Nam sử lược, Quyển 2, Tự chủ thời đại, Chương 12 Nguyễn Ánh besieged Quy Nhơn in 1799. Trần Quang Diệu and Vũ Văn Dũng was sent to reinforce. When marched to Thạch Tân, they found the road was blocked by Nguyễn Văn Thành and unable to reach there. Dũng was defeated by Nguyễn army. Diệu concealed the fact. Dũng was thankful, and made friends with him. Hearing the news of defeat, Quy Nhơn surrendered to Nguyễn lord, its name was changed to Bình Định. Diệu and Dũng stayed at Quảng Nam. Trần Viết Kết and Hồ Công Diệu, spoke evil of Diệu, the young emperor ordered Dũng to kill Diệu. But, Dũng showed the letter to Trần Quang Diệu. Trần Quang Diệu marched to Phú Xuân, the young emperor had to arrest Trần Viết Kết and Hồ Công Diệu and transferred them to Trần Quang Diệu. In 1800, Diệu and Dũng besieged Quy Nhơn. The siege of Quy Nhơn continued for over a year to June 1801, when the citadel's food provisions were exhausted. In the same year, Nguyễn Ánh attacked the capital Phú Xuân, and captured it. Diệu and Dũng planned to resumed the capital, but the road was blocked by Lê Văn Duyệt. Diệu besieged the citadel more actively. Võ Tánh, the Nguyễn general guarding the citadel, requested him to spare soldiers in exchange for Tánh's own life. Tánh committed suicide, Tây Sơn army captured the citadel. The citadel was used as a base camp to attack Nguyễn lord. 30 thousand men under the young emperor marched south to resume the lost territory, but was utterly beaten in the mouth of Nhật Lệ River. The young emperor fled to Thăng Long. Diệu and Dũng abandoned Quy Nhơn. Diệu retreated to Laos, then to Hương Sơn District. He did not reached the destination, Thăng Long. Finally, he was captured in Thanh Chương District together with his wife, and transferred to Huế, in where he was beheaded.

Built in 1908-9, Yiu Ming Temple is one of the oldest surviving Chinese temples in Australia and a globally rare intact example of the traditional Chinese village temple form. While commonly known as the \\"Yiu Ming Temple\\" (after the names of two towns in Guangdong province in China, where the community that founded the temple came from), its formal name is Hong Sheng Gong or Hung Sheng Gong (), which indicates that it is a Hung Shing Temple. It is also sometimes known as Yiu Ming Hung Fook Tong Temple(), which is strictly the name of the previous temple used by the same community. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 September 1999.  History  The earliest temple records of the Yiu-Ming Hung Fook Tong stem from the 1870s. Members then, as now, come from two districts, Gaoyao District and Gaoming District, in Guangdong Province in China. A temple named Hung Fook Tong serving the community originating from Gaoyao and Gaoming (hence Yiu- Ming, from the second syllables of the two place names) was first built in Arncliffe in 1870. However, the temple was small and could not accommodate all attendees, so the Gaoyao-Gaoming community began raising funds in 1904 to purchase a larger plot of land for the temple. In 1908, land was purchased in Alexandria to build a community hall and a new temple to be called the Hung Sheng Gong, with some houses adjacent to the temple retained to be leased at low rents to new arrivals from Gaoyao-Gaoming or elderly community members who were unable to return to China. 楊永安 (Yang, Yong'an) (2014) 長夜星稀 澳大利亞華人史 (Lonely Star on Lonesome Nights - A History of the Chinese Australians 1860-1940), Commercial Press (Hong Kong), pp.121-122 The Hung Sheng Gong is so-named because the principal deity worshiped is the sea god Hung Shing. The 1880s-era rate books of the Municipality of Alexandria list many Chinese community members. By 1890, it was estimated that about 100 Chinese community members lived in Retreat Street. Construction of the temple took place 1908-1909, with further work to the interior in 1917. The temple's figurative ceramic roof titles were imported from Foshan ceramic works. Two private companies, Tiy Loy and Co. and Wah Hing and Co. were established by society members, with premises on Botany Road, adjacent to Retreat Street. Society records from 1910 also list members in Rose Bay, Botany, northern Sydney, Canberra, Bombala and Newcastle. During the 20th century, attendees at the temple extended beyond the Gaoyao-Gaoming community to include Chinese migrants from other counties in Guangdong province. In the 1980s, society membership increased dramatically as a result of increased Chinese immigration. In May 1981, the pailou and tile-capped wall were added to the temple, enclosing Retreat Street. In 1990, the Committee for the Yiu Ming Society was formed, with the first committee members elected, replacing an earlier system where officials were appointed. The name of the Society was changed and shortened from Yiu Ming Hung Fook Tong Society to Yiu Ming Society. In 1995-96, conservation documentation of both the temple and Retreat Street was completed. A fire broke out in the temple in December 1996, but was quickly extinguished. In 1997-98, the building and associated objects were restored and cleaned in conjunction with community artisans and architects as well as Powerhouse Museum staff, informed by the earlier conservation documentation. The temple roof was replicated using imported Chinese tiles. Damaged timber panels from the temple interior were restored. Undamaged wooden items were cleaned. The main light fitting of the temple was reconstructed around the original frame. The altar table, which was completely destroyed, was replaced. The altar itself was cleaned and the central painting was re- painted. The temple was re-wired and repainted. The garden was tiled. The main burner of the temple was moved outside to minimise smoke damage and the sunken floor area which housed it has been filled in by the addition of removable timber panels. The temple reopened around Chinese New Year in 1998-99. Around that time, the associated terrace houses were refurbished, improving living conditions for the elderly residents.  Description  Elaborately decorated door to the main hall. The temple remains much as it was when originally built. Most of the internal fittings date from this time. The temple walls are of red-faced brick, originally tuck pointed. The internal floor is of tessellated tiles with a white marble edging. Many internal details are of timber. The area is lit and ventilated by a \\"roof lantern\\" over a sunken floor section designed for burning incense and oil. Doors and fittings, including the main altar, are original. The physical fabric of the temple and its associated objects retain evidence of the historical, architectural, social and spiritual significance of this site.  Heritage listing  The temple is of historical, architectural, religious and social significance to a section of Sydney's Chinese community. The Yiu Ming is one of the oldest and largest Chinese Societies. For approximately 130 years, the temple and its community and environment have provided practical assistance and spiritual support for community members seeking to establish themselves in Australia. Architecturally, the building is significant for its blending of traditional design, local materials and Federation detailing. The building has not been significantly modified since construction. The most significant modifications, following recent fire damage, replicated original form and materials as much as possible. The elaborate fittings of the temple provide evidence of community commitment to the temple and also demonstrate the skill of Chinese artisans at the beginning of the 20th century. As many village temples in China no longer exist, this fine, intact example is considered to be of both local and international significance. Yiu Ming Temple was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 September 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site has a recorded history of continuous Chinese occupation since the 1870s. The temple and many fittings and associated objects have remained substantially intact. The site and the temple are associated with many significant Chinese community members. These include Sam Warley, who operated a large import business with branches in Perth and Hong Kong, John Hoe, who operated a large timber business and formed the NSW Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Deen Bong, a successful cabinet maker who was an early manager of Tiy Loy and Co. Many society members have been influential in the introduction, growing, marketing and distribution of Chinese vegetables and food. Society members have also helped to maintain Chinese festivals and celebrations, including the lion dance The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. It represents a unique blend of Chinese temple design and Federation detailing. It seems likely that Federation detailing drew heavily on the decorative elements of the Chinese building tradition. The building is an example of the aesthetic of village temples. Standardised building codes and systems meant that temples build outside China strongly resemble those built within China. Exposed rafters and purlins demonstrate traditional Chinese roof structure and demonstrate the flexibility of this system. The highly coloured decorative paintwork used throughout is a very strong aesthetic statement the figurative ceramic roof ridge tiles are a very strong element of the external architecture of the temple. The interior fittings and objects, commissioned from China, represent excellent examples of Chinese decorative arts at the time the temple was built. Many similar pieces have been destroyed in China so that the aesthetic significance of this material is very high. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The complex has remained a cultural, religious and social centre for the community. The temple society has assisted community members, especially those newly arrived in Australia, by providing low cost housing, financial support and employment opportunities. This support was especially important when government policy meant that many community members were forced to live with only irregular contact with partners and families, who were still in China. Before the practice was banned, following the Chinese Revolution of 1949, Society members also arranged to return the bones of dead members to China for burial. Painted panels inside the temple list donors at the time of construction of the temple. These panels often refer to loyalty, brotherhood and the wish for happiness, prosperity and longevity. Many current Society members are able to identify the names of grandfathers, great uncles and other forebears on these panels and in the written records of the Society. The temple strongly communicates a sense of community identity and continuity. The Yiu Ming temple siting, orientation and layout follow principles of Chinese cosmology commonly known as feng shui. The main deity of the temple is Hong Sheng. \\"god of the southern seas\\". Hong Sheng is not a common deity either for Chinese Australians or for people from southern China. Cai Shen and Guan Di are other gods represented in the temple. The temple iconography includes much Daoist symbolism, including representations of the 8 Immortals and 8 precious things. There is also reference to Buddha. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The temple illustrates various technical adaptations to local conditions and materials. It also demonstrates the internationally recognised versatility and innovative skills of Chinese carpenters during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Given the scarcity of examples of this scale of \\"village\\" temple, even in China, the general adherence to traditional design principles is also of technical interest. Inscriptions on the painted panels inside the temple provide much information about society members enabling further research into the history of the Society and its members. The records and documents of the Society appear to have been maintained. The Society's relationship to business, market gardening and the Chinese cemetery area at Rookwood are all significant areas for further research. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This temple is one of only a small number (9?) of Chinese temples that survive in Australia. It also illustrates traditional Chinese architecture in transition, displaying various adaptations to local conditions and materials. The temple houses a range of movable objects that were specially commissioned by the community from artists and craftsmen in Guandong at the time that the temple was constructed. In mainland China, many village temples of this period have either been destroyed or are used for other purposes. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The building is an example of Chinese village temple design with distinctive local elements. Retreat Street represents a community approach to survival and adaptation to life in a new country.

Three years later, he undertook an apprenticeship as a sheet metal worker, joining the Manchester Society of Braziers and Sheet Metal Workers.Edmund and Ruth Frow, \\"Munro, William John (Jack)\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.VII, pp.189-191 Munro became interested in socialism, and was an early member of the Independent Labour Party, and later also the Openshaw Socialist Society. Through this, he came to know George Peet and Harry Pollitt. He and Jim Crossley were the Socialist Society's two delegates to the 1911 Socialist Unity Conference, which founded the British Socialist Party, and he later followed the party into forming the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). Munro worked at Crossley Motors during World War I, becoming a shop steward, taking a leading role in the city's shop stewards movement, and a 1917 strike at the factory. After the war, he was a founder of the Manchester Labour College, at which he tutored in several subjects. He also remained active in his trade union, representing it at the 1920 conference which led to the formation of the National Union of Sheet Metal Workers and Braziers, and serving on that union's first executive committee. He frequently stood to become president of the union, finally winning it in 1930/31. Munro was also active in the Manchester and Salford Trades Council, becoming a delegate in 1920, vice president in 1922/23, president in 1924/5, and treasurer from 1926. That year, he resigned from the CPGB, unhappy that it had criticised leaders of the Trades Union Congress during the UK general strike. In 1936, he was elected as secretary of the trades council, aligning himself with the Labour Party and becoming increasingly opposed to the CPGB. He retired in 1944, after suffering increasingly poor health.

The building is located adjacent to Johnstons Creek. It was built from 1902 to 1904 by the New South Wales Public Works Department. It is also known as SPS 3, SP0003, Booth Street Sewage Pumping Station and Annandale Sewage Pumping Station. The property is owned by Sydney Water. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  In 1859 Sydney's sewerage system consisted of five outfall sewers which drained to Sydney Harbour. By the 1870s, the Harbour had become grossly polluted (especially with the nearby abattoir at Glebe island) and there were outbreaks of typhoid fever throughout the period 1870s - 1890s. As a result, the Government of New South Wales created the Sydney City and Suburban Health Board to investigate an alternative means of disposing of the City's sewage. This led to the construction of two gravitation sewers in 1889 by the Public Works Department: a northern sewer being the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer and a southern sewer draining to a sewage farm at Botany Bay. Low-lying areas around the Harbour which could not gravitate to the new outfall sewers continued to drain to the old City Council Harbour sewers. Low level pumping stations were therefore needed to collect the sewage from such areas and pump it by means of additional sewers known as rising mains, to the main gravitation system. The first comprehensive low level sewerage system began at the beginning of the 20th century when the Public Works Department built a group of 20 low level pumping stations around the foreshores of the inner harbour and handed them over to the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage in 1904, of which this is one. Overall, greater Sydney now has over 600 low level sewage pumping stations.  Description  SP0003 is a low level sewage pumping station located adjacent to the Johnstons Creek stormwater channel in Annandale. It consists of two distinct parts: a superstructure comprising a rectangular single-storey loadbearing brick building, and a substructure constructed of concrete which houses machinery and sewage chambers. Architecturally, the building was designed in a utilitarian version of the Federation Queen Anne style. Externally there is a corrugated iron gambrel roof with timber louvered gable vents and exposed eaves with timber sarking boards; double casement timber windows with multi paned fanlights; dark red-brown tuck pointed brickwork laid in English bond with a splayed brick plinth and engaged brick piers capped with rubbed sandstone; rock faced sandstone sills and lintels; quadrant eaves gutters with galvanised steel and cast iron downpipe. Internally, the ceiling is lined with tongue and grooved boarding and walls are rendered and lined out to simulate ashlar coursing. The substructure is divided into a machinery well comprising two vertical spindle centrifugal pumps, each direct coupled to electric motors. Adjacent are two sewage wells and an inlet well. The walls are finished to match the superstructure. External to the building is an original wall mounted lifting crane. The station is not visible from public areas. It is reasonably intact with reversible alterations. It is the only first-generation station which has its original lifting crane intact. The original timber gates are intact. The slate roof has been replaced. Timber double doors were replaced with a roller shutter. The original plunger pumps plus the DC current were replaced before 1913. Most of the mechanical and electrical components were upgraded during the 1970s.  Heritage listing  SP0003 is of historic, aesthetic and technical/research significance. Historically it was part of an original network of twenty low level sewage pumping stations constructed at the end of the 19th century. The station along with the construction of the Southern Outfall Sewer (ten years earlier) formed a part of the major advance in the protection of the public health of Sydney by ending the discharge of sewage into the Harbour. They were built as a direct response to the outbreaks of Enteric Fever (Typhoid) which plagued Sydney from the 1870s to 1890s and the recommendations of the Sydney City and Suburban Health Board (which was established by the government in 1875 to report on the best means of sewage disposal) which proposed the establishment of outfall sewers. Aesthetically it is good example of a low level sewage pumping station designed in the Federation Queen Anne style. In its surviving fabric, SP0003 reflects the importance of Federation Period public utilities which is evident in the overall design and technical excellence of the traditional construction techniques and craftsmanship such as the stone dressings and tuckpointed brickwork. The pumping station is technically significant for continually fulfilling its role nearly a century after its introduction as a low level sewage pumping station as originally designed and constructed, apart from minor mechanical and electrical modifications. It has educational and interpretation potential to reveal information about the development of sewage pumping engineering, and in architectural taste in a period when utilitarian buildings were given as much careful attention as public buildings. The significance of the place is enhanced by the intactness of external elements, including the original lifting crane and timber gates. Sewage Pumping Station 3 was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. SP0003, Annandale was built in 1902 and was among the original network of 20 low level sewage pumping stations constructed to serve Sydney. The pumping stations along with the construction of the Bondi and Southern Outfall Sewers, formed a part of the major advance in the protection of the public health of Sydney by ending the discharge of sewage into the Harbour. The construction of SP0003 evidences the growth of Sydney and expansion of municipal services during the early part of the 20th century. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. SP0003 is a fine example of a robust and well proportioned small scale industrial Federation Queen Anne style building which displays in its fabric a combination of superior utilitarian design, construction and craftsmanship. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The excellent design of the superstructure by the Department of Public Works reflects the body of work emanating from the then Government Architect, Walter Liberty Vernon. With community awareness of the cultural significance of these group of SPSs the heritage community at least is likely to hold these stations in high regard. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. SP0003 has the potential to reveal information about construction techniques and design of the concrete substructure relevant to its intended use. The pumping station still fulfils its role nearly a century after its introduction as a low level sewage pumping station as originally designed and constructed albeit with some mechanical upgrading. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. SP0003 is unique as part of the network of first generation low level sewage pumping stations. It served the historically significant Southern Outfall Sewer (later Southern and Western Suburbs Ocean Outfall Sewer) The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The superstructure is a representative example of a small scale Federation Queen Anne style industrial building. SP0003 is a representative example of a low level sewage pumping station on the Southern and Western Suburbs Outfall Sewer.

Launched in May 2017 to power the Aerion AS2 supersonic business jet, its initial design was completed in 2018 before its detailed design in 2020 for the first prototype production. Its high-pressure core is derived from the CFM56, matched to a new twin fan low-pressure section for a reduced bypass ratio better suited to supersonic flight. Development At the May 2017 EBACE, Aerion announced its selection of GE Aviation to power the Aerion AS2 supersonic business jet. GE then launched the Affinity program. The final engine configuration is a core with billions of operational hours – suggesting the CFM56 – and a new low-pressure section optimised for supersonic speed. The CFM56 is derived from the B-1's GE F101. In February 2018, Aerion released the GE engine configuration. Thrust will be reduced at takeoff to meet Chapter 5 noise regulations, requiring a longer balanced field takeoff as an acceptable compromise. Chapter 5 applies from 2018 to over 120,000 lb (54,400 kg) aircraft and all aircraft from 2021. The initial design of its Affinity medium-bypass-ratio turbofan was completed by October 2018. Its detailed design review should be completed by 2020 for the first prototype production.  Design  GE Aviation needs to develop a configuration accommodating reasonably well requirements for supersonic speed, subsonic speed and noise levels. Managing the high intake temperatures at high altitudes is a key challenge for the initial design. An engine for supersonic flight needs a lower bypass ratio than modern turbofans, having a higher flow speed for better efficiency. This is limited by noise regulations at takeoff, and a lower compression core like the CFM56 is better suited to higher temperatures encountered supersonically. The engine is a compromise between a big core for power and a small fan for wave drag, and Mach 1.4 is a compromise between higher speed and enough range. The high-pressure core is derived from the nine-stage compressor and single-stage turbine of the CFM56, matched to a new low-pressure section optimised for supersonic speed with a 133 cm (52in) diameter fan instead of the 155-173 cm (61-68.3in) fan of the 6:1 bypass ratio CFM56. The twin-shaft, twin-fan engine with FADEC has a service ceiling of 18,300 m (60,000 ft). It lacks an afterburner, and has a combustor with advanced coatings and uses additive manufacturing technologies. The GE Affinity has a nine-stage HP compressor, a single-stage HP turbine and a two- stage low-pressure turbine. Preceded by fixed inlet guide vanes with movable flaps, the twin blisk fans have wide-chord titanium blades. The exhaust mixer is similar to the GE Passport ceramic matrix composite design. The Mach 1.4-to-1.6 speed requires no variable-geometry inlet and the variable-area nozzle has a cone moving longitudinally, replacing a convergent-divergent nozzle. The bypass ratio is around 3 to lower the ram drag, and it should produce at Mach 1.4 and FL500, with a cruise fuel consumption increased by 50% over the Mach 0.78 CFM56-5.

The car the girls were driving, a 1972 Oldsmobile 98, was left behind in the Sears parking lot at the mall, but the girls have not been seen since.  Victims  The oldest of the girls, Mary Rachel Trlica (née Arnold), was 17 years old at the time of her disappearance. She is known to go by her middle name of Rachel. She is a Caucasian female, in height, , with long brown hair, green eyes and has a chipped upper front tooth and a small scar on her chin. She was a married high school student at Southwest High School in Fort Worth and drove a 1972 Oldsmobile 98, the car the girls took to the mall that day. At the time of her disappearance, Rachel had been married to her husband, Tommy Trlica, for about six months and she wore a wedding ring. Lisa Renee Wilson was 14 years old at the time of her disappearance. She is known to go by her middle name of Renee. She is a fair-skinned Caucasian female, in height, , with light wavy brown hair, brown eyes and has a scar on the inside of one of her thighs. Clothing she was known to be wearing when she disappeared includes bluish-purple hip hugger pants, a white pullover sweatshirt with \\"Sweet Honesty\\" in green letters (some have reported it as a pale yellow T-shirt with green letters), red and white oxford shoes, and a promise ring with a single clear stone. The youngest of the girls, Julie Ann Moseley, was 9 years old at the time of her disappearance. She is a Caucasian female, in height, , with shoulder-length sandy blonde hair and blue eyes. She has a small scar under her left eye, a scar in the middle of her forehead and a scar on the back of her calf. Clothing she was known to be wearing when she disappeared included a red shirt with dark pants (jeans) and red tennis shoes. The case shocked Fort Worth and left the families to painfully adjust to life without their children. Thousands of leads have been followed, dozens of searches completed and hundreds of people interviewed. All have proven fruitless.  Disappearance  On the morning of December 23, 1974, a little before noon, Rachel Trlica, Renee Wilson, and Julie Ann Moseley set out to go Christmas shopping. Julie Ann asked to tag along at the last minute because she “didn’t want to spend the day alone”. The older girls told her she would need to get permission to go. Julie Ann ran inside and called her mother, Rayanne Moseley. She would later recall, \\"I was working for an electrical contractor, and my husband and I were separated. It was a bitter, bitter time. I remember that Julie called and wanted to go to Seminary South. I said, 'No. You don't have any money. You just stay home.' I knew Renee and her mother, but I really didn't know Rachel. But she [Julie] kept whining about how she wouldn't have anybody to play with. . . . I finally gave in, but I told her to be home by 6”. The older girls, specifically Renee, wanted to be back by 4 p.m. because she had a Christmas party she wanted to attend with her new boyfriend who had given her a promise ring that morning. She wanted plenty of time to get ready. The girls first headed to the Army Navy store in Fort Worth to pick up some layaway items that Renee had waiting. From there, they headed to the Seminary South Shopping Center at 4200 South Freeway in south Fort Worth. Several witnesses had reported seeing the girls in the mall that day. When the girls did not return home, the families became concerned and traveled to the shopping center to search for them. They arrived around 6 p.m. that evening to find the car was parked in the Sears upper-level parking lot. It appeared the girls had made it back to the car that afternoon because the gifts they had purchased were found in the car. The family stayed at the mall all night waiting for the girls to return.  Search and investigation  When the girls did not return, the Fort Worth Police Department was called and the case was quickly handed over to the Youth Division of the Missing Persons Bureau. The girls were presumed to be runaways by the police. As if to prove this point, the next day Tommy Trlica, Rachel's husband, received a letter in the mailbox at their home that appeared to be written by Rachel. It read: \\"I know I'm going to catch it, but we had to get away. We're going to Houston. See you in about a week. The car is in Sears' upper lot. Love Rachel\\" Strangely, the letter was written in ink but the addressed envelope was written in pencil, and the letter was written on a sheet of paper that was wider than the envelope. It was addressed to Thomas A. Trlica, instead of the less formal Tommy, as Rachel called him. ”Rachel” was written in the upper left-hand corner of the envelope. It appeared to be initially misspelled, as the “l” in her name was written as a lower-case “e”, but then it had been gone over again to form the correct “l”. The postmark did not contain a city, only a blurred zip code that appeared to be “76083”, however the number “3” appears to either be backward, as though maybe it was applied by a hand-loaded stamp, or a partial “8”. It is assumed that the zip code was meant to be either 76038, which comes from Eliasville near Throckmorton, Texas, or 76088, which comes from Weatherford, Texas. During the 1970s and '80s, handwriting experts across the nation examined the letter including the FBI, who examined it three times, but each time the results came back inconclusive. Despite receiving the letter, the families did not believe that it was written by Rachel nor that the girls had run away. Rayanne Moseley, Julie Ann's mother, stated, \\"I know my daughter, and I know those other girls and they are not runaways\\". Judy Wilson, Renee's mother, is noted to have said: \\"I could have told you that night that they didn't run away. [Renee] wanted to go to that party. And no nine-year-old is going to run off two days before Christmas. Everybody knows that!\\". Francis Langston, Rachel's mother, believed the girls had been abducted saying: \\"A lot of people may think they left with someone they knew, but I'll always think—until the day I die—that the girls were taken\\". Not willing to give in, the families continued their search by distributing handbills and missing person fliers throughout the state and contacting newspapers across the country. Eventually, tips began to come in and witnesses began to come forward. In early 1975, one young man claiming to be an acquaintance of Rachel's stepped forward and said that he saw them in the record department of a store inside the mall just before they disappeared. Apparently he and Rachel saw each other and spoke briefly. The man claimed that another person appeared to be with the girls. During this same time, some women's clothes were found in the Justin, Texas, area and were investigated, but it was determined that they did not belong to the girls. By spring of 1975, the families grew frustrated with the Police investigation and decided to hire a private detective named Jon Swaim. In August 1975, Swaim discovered that a 28-year-old man was making a string of obscene phone calls in the area. This man had worked for a store in south Fort Worth where Rachel had applied for a job just before Christmas. It was discovered that he was using his position to obtain information from young women who had either applied for a job at his store or who were listed as references. Six women who had applied at this store had been receiving obscene phone calls. He also once lived in the neighborhood of Rachel's parents but moved away shortly before she married. In the end, nothing ever came of this suspect. In April 1975, Swaim went to Port Lavaca with 100 volunteers to search under bridges in the area after receiving a tip that the girls had been killed and taken there. However, no trace of the girls was found. A year later, it was reported that three skeletons were found in a field outside of Alvord, Texas, by an oil drilling crew. Mr. Swaim had the bones checked against x-rays and dental records of the girls, but it turned out that the bones belonged to a teenage boy about 15–17 years of age and two other females who were not identified as being any of the girls. In March 1976, a psychic called one of the families and told them that the girls could be found near an oil well. For some reason, the searchers focused on the small community of Rising Star outside of Abilene, but nothing was ever found. In 1979, Jon Swaim died following a drug overdose; his death was subsequently ruled to be suicide. Upon his death, he ordered that all of his files on the case be destroyed. In the spring of 1981, police investigators were called to a location in Brazoria County after human remains had been found in a swampy area. After a month of investigation, they discovered that the bones did not belong to the three girls. In January 2001, the case was reopened and assigned to a homicide detective, Tom Boetcher. He believes the girls left the mall with someone they trusted. He stated, \\"We can say that they were at one point seen with one individual, but we believe there was more than one involved\\". In 2018, two cars were raised from Benbrook Lake because they were thought to have a connection to the case. These efforts, however, yielded no results. Over the years, searchers have continued to comb through Texas brush and have explored hundreds of back roads. The families have walked creek beds and country roads only to come up with nothing. Decades after the girls disappeared, there have been no reports of new developments in the case.  Other possible witnesses  A store clerk came forward around the time of the girls' disappearance and said that a woman told her that she had seen the girls at the mall that day. The woman reported that she saw three girls being forced into a yellow pickup truck near Buddies grocery store at the mall. The truck was described to have lights on top of it. This witness, however, could never be located by police and the story never verified. In 1981, years after the disappearance, a man said he had been in the parking lot that day and had seen a man forcing a girl into a van. The man in the van told him it was a family dispute and to stay out of it. In April 2001, Bill Hutchins, a former Fort Worth policeman and security guard at the Seminary South Sears outlet, said that he saw the three girls with a security guard on the night they disappeared.

The camera was in museum storage from 1976 to 2006, when it was rediscovered and rebuilt by the inventor's daughter, artist Susanna Kraus.NY Times article History In 1970, physicist Werner Kraus was commissioned to photographically document the Daimler-Benz Wankel engine’s combustion cycle. For this purpose, he invented a photo-optical system which captured images on a 1:1 scale. Later, based on the same system, Kraus, together with the artist and sculptor Erhard Hößle, built the Imago Camera. The camera and its photographs were exhibited in Munich during the Fluxus-movement. It operated for several years, but was archived in 1978 due to cessation of production of the photographic paper, which was essential for its operation. It was later stored in the archive of the Pinakothek der Moderne museum in Munich. Restoration In 2005, photographs taken by the camera were rediscovered by Kraus' daughter, Susanna Kraus, which renewed her interest in Imago, and prompted her to restore it.fototv.de Imago 1:1 feature film June 4, 2009 During the following year, Susanna Kraus searched for a manufacturer who would produce the necessary photographic paper. When she convinced Ilford Switzerland in 2006 to develop and start the production of the direct positive paper, the curator of the New Collection of the Pinakothek der Moderne museum Florian Hufnagl agreed to release the camera from the archive and return it to the inventor's daughter.Die Zeit Online February 4, 2010 At the end of 2006, the first exhibition of the photos made with the restored Imago Camera was held in Vienna. After several years of travelling and exhibitions, in 2011, the camera inhabited a new photo studio started by Susanna Kraus in the Aufbau Haus on Moritzplatz, Berlin Kreuzberg. It has been operating at this location since.The Aufbauhaus Characteristics Imago is a large format camera measuring 6.85 × 3.9 × 3.55 meters. It is designed to capture life-size analog images of subjects inside it. The camera is equipped with an optical system, specifically constructed for it, with an extremely high focal length allowing pictures to be taken on a 1:1 scale, without warping. The camera features a special internal setting of six strobe lights providing a high intensity light necessary for production of the large direct exposure images on paper, which is considerably less photosensitive than film. The Camera produces 62 × 200 cm sized black and white prints on Imago and Harman Direct Positive Paper. Inside the camera, one can see a true-sided reflection of oneself in a special mirror, serving as a viewfinder. The picture is taken by the subject releasing a trigger.Photo-forum Magazine, January 2014 Imago photographic paper Imago Camera uses silver gelatin direct positive photographic paper developed in cooperation with Ilford Switzerland and HARMAN Technology specially for Imago.Imago Photo-paper on Fotoimpex.de It is made for direct exposure and reacts as soon as an image is exposed onto it.

He is depicted in historiography as the main responsible party for the Murder of Greifensee, the mass execution of 62 men of the garrison of Greifensee Castle after their surrender, on 28 May 1444. As Landammann of Schwyz, Reding represented Schwyz in the Tagsatzung (Swiss Diet). He also represented the Swiss Confederacy at the Council of Constance (1415). He succeeded in greatly expanding the territory of Schwyz by consent of king Sigismund, acquiring jurisdiction over Einsiedeln, March, and Küssnacht. In 1424, he even acquired the patronage of Einsiedeln Abbey without the knowledge of the abbot. He was also successful in the dispute with Zürich over the inheritance of the counts of Toggenburg, acquiring the Toggenburg as a co-dominium of Schwyz and Glarus in 1436. Zürich reacted with a trade embargo, forcing Schwyz to import wheat from Aargau and the Alsace. Tensions escalated into the Old Zürich War in 1439/40. Ital Reding as the leader of the Schwyz force harried the canton of Zürich in 1440, forcing Zürich to revoke the embargo. Zürich then made a defensive pact with the House of Habsburg, effectively reneging their membership in the Swiss Confederacy. The Swiss again invaded the territories of Zürich, capturing Grüningen in 1443 and advancing to Greifensee in the spring of 1444. They besieged Greifensee castle from 1 May 1444. The garrison surrendered on 28 May under the condition of safe conduct on 27 May. On the following day, 62 men of the garrison, all except for one Ueli Kupferschmid who was spared for being a native of Schwyz, were executed by the Swiss. This massacre, dubbed the \\"Murder of Greifensee\\" (Mord von Greifensee) was perceived as an unprecedented crime in the military history of the Confederacy. Ital Reding as the ranking commander is seen as the responsible party for the massacre. He retired from all offices in the following year, but there is no positive record of a direct connection of the massacre with his resignation. In contemporary sources, Schwyz chronologist Hans Fründ only gives a very brief mention to the massacre and does not mention Reding's name in connection with it. By contrast, Zürich chronist Gerold Edlibach is unambiguous in blaming Reding for commanding the massacre. Werner Schodoler and Diebold Schilling the Younger also mention Reding's responsibility for the massacre. Schilling even claims that Reding insisted that he would personally kill the men if the executioner would refuse to do his duty. In modern historiography, Theodor von Liebenau (1870) based on letters written by eye witnesses concluded that the decision to execute the garrison had been taken by consensus of the commanders of all cantons present (Schwyz, Uri, Unterwalden, Glarus, Bern, Lucerne, Zug).Theodor von Liebenau: Zwei Schreiben über die Kapitulation der Festung Greifensee 1444. In: Anzeiger für Schweizerische Geschichte. 1/4 (1870) S. 302–304. Reding died in 1447, and was succeeded by his son, Ital Reding the Younger, as Amman of Schwyz. Reding appears as a character in fictionalized depictions of the Murder of Greifensee, including Heinrich Zschokke's Der Freihof von Aarau (1823), Gottfried Keller's [Der Landvogt von Greifensee (1878) and Albrecht Emch's Ital Reding, der Eisenkopf von Greifensee oder Die Mordtat von Greifensee (1867).

The longest-serving leader of a British trade union, he also served as chair of the General Federation of Trade Unions. Head was born in Cradley, then in Worcestershire. He left school when he was thirteen, and soon found work at a chain-making factory. He completed an apprenticeship and worked at a number of local factories, also joining the Chain Makers' and Strikers' Association (CMSA). In the late 1910s, he became works secretary for the union, and also served on its executive.Eric Taylor, \\"Head, Albert (Bert) Edward\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.VII, pp.111-113 In 1933, the union discovered that its secretary, Charles Sitch, had been embezzling its funds, and although the union had more than 1,000 members, fewer than 250 had actually paid membership. Sitch was removed from office and later jailed for the crime, while Head beat three other candidates to become the union's new general secretary. As full-time leader of the union, Head decided to rebuild it by visiting all the factories at which it had members, and meeting as many of them as possible. This proved a success, and by 1939, its paid up membership was again more than 1,000. Membership peaked at 1,800 after World War II, but then fell in line with employment in the industry. Head was elected to the management committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU) in 1940, and he was chair of the federation in 1957-1958\\\\. He remained leader of the union into the 1970s, but by this point, membership was less than 200, and in 1972 it was expelled from the GFTU and Trades Union Congress for defying their policy and registering with the government. Due to these setbacks, the union was dissolved at the end of 1977, Head by this point being the oldest trade union leader and the longest-serving, in the UK.

Recently, it is subject to gentrification, such as through The Seven (with a price per square meter of up to 22,000 euros) in the Müllerstraße 7 or numerous hipster shops. The gay and lesbian communication and cultural center (SUB) has its counseling center at Müllerstraße 43. At number 11, there is a commemorative plaque for the poet Franz Stelzhamer. On the third floor of the building is the office of Little Teddy Recordings: Liam Lynch, Pete and the Pirates and Stereo Total have already released records under this label. In the street there are numerous clubs and bars, such as the Pimpernel, M. C. Müller, or the Ochsengarten, which opened in 1967 and is the first Leather-Bar in Germany, to which admission is reserved for men only. Freddie Mercury is known to have been seen there. Former clubs in the Müllerstraße were the gay club construction (with darkroom) and the bank. In the Müllerstraße 2-6 is the migration and cultural center Bellevue di Monaco, which opened in 2018. In Müllerstraße 14 is the Gay Outdoor Club Munich. On Müllerstraße are the tram lines 16 and 18, and N27. Müllerstraße is the location of the cultural history trail: Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt.  History  Müllerstraße is named after the numerous mills that were located on the, not yet dried, streams in front of the city in the 19th century. There was also the \\"women's outdoor pool in the bathhouse in the Müllerstraße\\" located on the stream. Müllerstraße 40 is the location of the former \\"Optical Institute\\" by Joseph von Utzschneider, later in March, a palatial, classical building, richly structured and decorated, built in 1829 by Joseph Höchl; on the facade of the house is a statue of the Virgin Mary and a bust representing Fraunhofer and Utzschneider, which was created by Halbig and is inscribed with the year 1866. At the Müllerstraße 7, at the location of \\"The Seven\\" the tower of an unused power plant was converted to Munich's most expensive apartments, on the grounds of which first stood the Bavarian military hospital and then until the destruction by bombs in 1944 the Luitpold-Gymnasium. Albert Einstein went to school there from 1888 to 1894. In the time of the Münchner Räterepublik (Munich Soviet Republic) in April 1919, the high school was the scene of violence, as the Red Army killed ten supporters of the folk Thule Society. The Free Corps retaliated in early May 1919 with merciless terror and multiple murders. In 1940/41, the Müllerstraße Hochbunker was built there, followed by the Müllerstraße heating plant in 1954-1956.

Admission to the prosecution career is made by a public exam between persons who have a degree in Law and who meet the required capacity requirements (EOMF § 42). The exam for admission to the judicial and prosecution careers are joint, so that all those who satisfactorily pass the theoretical tests have to proceed to the election of entry into one or another career. Those who choose the prosecution career must complete a training course at the Center for Legal Studies, after which they enter the prosecution career with the corresponding oath and take possession of the place of destination (EOMF § 45). Functions To accomplish with the mission entrusted to this body by the Constitution, the Prosecution Office Organic Regulation establish as functions: * Ensure that the jurisdictional function is exercised effectively in accordance with the laws and in the terms indicated therein, exercising, where appropriate, the actions, appeals and relevant actions. * Exercise all functions attributed by the law in defense of the independence of judges and courts. * Ensure respect for constitutional institutions and fundamental rights and public freedoms with as many actions as their defense requires. * Exercise criminal and civil actions arising from crimes and faults or oppose those exercised by others, when appropriate. * Intervene in the criminal process, urging the judicial authority to adopt the appropriate precautionary measures and the practice of diligences aimed at clarifying the facts or directly instructing the procedure within the scope of the provisions of the Organic Law regulating the Criminal Responsibility of the Minors, being able to order the Judicial police those diligences that it considers opportune. * Take part, in defense of legality and public or social interest, in the processes related to civil status and in the others established by law. * Intervene in civil proceedings that the law determines when the social interest is compromised or when they may affect minor, incapable or defenseless persons as long as the ordinary mechanisms of representation are provided. * Maintain the integrity of the jurisdiction and competence of judges and courts, promoting conflicts of jurisdiction and, where appropriate, competition issues that arise, and intervene in those promoted by others. * Ensure compliance with judicial decisions that affect the public and social interest. * Ensure the procedural protection of victims and the protection of witnesses and experts, promoting the mechanisms provided for them to receive effective assistance and assistance. * Intervene in the judicial proceedings of amparo as well as in the unconstitutionality issues in the cases and manner provided for in the Organic Law of the Constitutional Court. * File the appeal for constitutional protection, as well as intervene in the processes known to the Constitutional Court in defense of legality, in the manner established by law. * Exercise in matters of criminal responsibility of minors the functions entrusted to it by specific legislation, and must direct their actions to the satisfaction of the best interests of the minor. * Intervene in the cases and in the manner provided in the laws in the proceedings before the Court of Auditors.

Organization chart The Public Prosecution Ministry is composed of numerous bodies, most of them in every judicial body but also in other special jurisdictions and matters (EOMF § 12): * The Office of the Attorney General. * The Prosecution Council. *: It's a body composed with the highest prosecutors entrusted with the advisement of the Attorney General; to establish the organization of the Prosecution Ministry; to resolve disciplinary files and incompatibility matters and to resolve appeals against certain prosecutors decisions, among others (EOMF § 14). * The Board of Chamber Prosecutors. *: The Board assists the Attorney General of the State in doctrinal and technical matters, in order to form the unitary criteria of interpretation and legal action, the resolution of consultations, preparation of reports and circulars, preparation of projects and reports that must be elevated to the Government and any others, of an analogous nature, that the Attorney General deems appropriate to submit to its knowledge and study (EOMF § 15). * The Board of High Prosecutors of the Autonomous Communities. *: Its function is to ensure the unity and coordination of the performance and functioning of the Prosecutor's Offices throughout the country, without prejudice to the powers attributed to the Prosecution Council (EOMF § 16). * The Prosecution Office of the Supreme Court. *: The Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office is headed by the Attorney General and it's also composed by the Lieutenant Attorney, the position that historically assumed the competences that today has the Attorney General. The Lieutenant Attorney acts as a second- in-command prosecutor replacing the Attorney General when this can't exercise its powers and directs the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office by delegation of the Attorney General (EOMF § 17). * The Prosecution Office before the Constitutional Court. * The Prosecution Office of the National Court. * The Special Prosecution Offices. *: There are two Special Prosecution Offices: the Anti-drug Prosecution Office and the Prosecution Office against Corruption and Organized Crime. This prosecution offices are characterized by having its own police units (provided by the State Police law enforcements) (EOMF § 19). * The Prosecution Office of the Court of Auditors. * The Military Prosecution Office. * The Prosecutor's Offices of the Autonomous Communities. * The Provincial Prosecutors. * The Area Prosecutor's Offices. Principles The article 124 of the Constitution which regulates the Prosecution Ministry, in its second paragraph establish the main four principles that should govern the action of the Public Prosecution: Principle of unity of operation This principle refers to the fact that, like the judiciary, the prosecution is unique to the entire country, a fact that emphasizes the Organic Regulation of the Prosecution Ministry making it clear that the name Ministerio Fiscal can only be used by this body (EOMF § 2). It is the Attorney General who holds the superior office of the Public Prosecution and who represents it throughout the Spanish territory, corresponding to this position the issuance of convenient orders and instructions and the direction and inspection of the Prosecution Ministry. With all this, the Attorney General is empowered to delegate functions in other Prosecutors related to the subject matter of its competence, although the delegation may be revoked at any time and will be automatically extinguished with the dismissal of the Attorney General (EOMF § 22). In order to preserve the principle of unity in the performance of the Public Prosecution Office, the periodic celebration of all its components has been established by law, which will be useful to study matters of special importance or to establish positions with respect to certain questions. The agreements reached will have the character of a report, although if the opinion of the Chief Prosecutor is contrary to the agreement, the criteria of the Chief Prosecutor will prevail. Within the Prosecution Ministry, the action criterion is imposed by the higher bodies with respect to the lower ones. (EOMF § 24). Principle of hierarchical subordination The hierarchical dependence on the organization of the Prosecution Ministry is considered one of the essential notes that characterize it at the same time that distinguishes it from other bodies with which it shares a field of action, such as jurisdictional ones, since the latter must be prevented from all kinds of internal influence. Thus, judges and courts, their governing bodies or the General Council of the Judiciary are not empowered to issue instructions, whether general or specific, addressed to their inferiors, on the application or interpretation of the legal system they make (LOPJ § 12). In the exercise of its jurisdictional function, moreover, if an action of this kind is carried out, a very serious disciplinary offense is being committed (LOPJ § 417). This happens because the framework of jurisdictional bodies is not valid within the scope of the Prosecution (which si not part of the Judiciary although is integrated on it), structured hierarchically, with the Attorney General at the top, and subordinate to him, the other organs. Principle of the rule of law By the principle of the rule of law, also called principle of legality, the Public Prosecutor will act subject to the Constitution, laws and other regulations that make up the current legal system, ruling, informing and exercising, where appropriate, the actions from or opposing those improperly acted to the extent and how the laws establish it (EOMF § 6) Principle of impartiality Due to the principle of impartiality, the Public Prosecutor will act with full objectivity and independence in defense of the interests entrusted to it (EOMF § 7). Although it may seem that to say that the Public Prosecutor must be impartial, it is a contradiction in terms, since being impartial presupposes not being a party and what this body does is to intervene in the process in a position of part, the validity of the principle of impartiality supposes the absence of direct or indirect implication of the dependent employee of the Prosecution Office in the specific case in which he must act, thus preventing possible defects in his actions. In no legal provision of the Spanish legal system is the recusal of the representative of the Public Prosecution for the mere fact that this is a procedural part, but contrary to this, the Organic Act of the Judiciary establish that any official that is part of the process and has any conflict of interest must be self- abstain to be a part of the process. This clause is interpreted extensibly to the prosecutors (LOPJ § 219). If the prosecutor does not comply with this clause, the parts of the conflict can go to its hierarchical superior to order him not to intervene in the process (EOMF § 28). History Centuries before the creation of the Prosecution Ministry already existed officials who represented interests of the monarch in the judicial procedures. This official received names like «King's Man» or «Fiscal Prosecutors» and over time they became truly civil servants who tried to be an imparcial part in the judicial procedures even when the judge and the prosecutors had their legitimacy in the absolute monarch. However, the direct antecessors didn't arrive until the 19th century. In 1835, under the regency of Queen María Cristina, it was approved the Provisional Regulation for the Administration of Justice which didn't especiffically mention the Prosecution Ministry but established an state-level prosecution organization topped by the Attorney of the Supreme Court. It was by the Organic Act of the Judiciary of 1870 that the Prosecution Ministry was officially created. It was regulated in the Title 20 of the Act and consisted in 91 articles which established its nature, organization, competences, uniform and the process ot access in the prosecution career. The original mission of the Ministry wasn't too much different from now: In the 1880s, two new laws are approved that affected the Prosecution Ministry: the Civil Procedural Act and the Criminal Procedural Act. These laws included the prosecutor into both procedures but its competences are very confusing in the Civil Procedural Act, differending it from the rest of the parts of the conflict but, at the same time, equipping it with the Solicitor General (which was no a real part in the process). In the Criminal Procedural Act, however, established clearly that the prosecutor is a part of the process. Soon after, in 1886, the Prosecution Ministry lost the competences over the defence of the interests of the Public Treasury in favour of the Solicitor General's Office. Under the francoism, the Ministry lost most of its competences and was just a body to execute orders and to act as a channel of communication between the executive and the judicial power. With the arrival of democracy and the approval of the Constitution of 1978, the Ministry recovered its competences and were granted with new ones, defending not only the interest of the State but also the interest of the citizents, their rights and freedoms and to watch over the independence of justice. The Constitution integrate it in the Judiciary but at the same time give it full autonomy without being under the authority of the General Council of the Judiciary. It also stops being a communication channel between the executive and judicial power and breaks with the historical dependence from the Government, being able the executive to communicate with the Prosecution only with related matters of public interest and it's the Attorney General, with the advice of the Board of Chamber Prosecutors, who decided if accepts this communications or not.

The father loaned and rented out his two daughters to a number of different men, who sexually assaulted the girls, who were born in 1994 and 1997 respectively. The case was acted on, on 4 August 2005, when police in Sønderborg received an anonymous tip that later resulted in an investigation on the matter. About three weeks after this tip, the parents were arrested and the girls placed in foster care. While the abuse was happening, the local government received at least 14 different notices about suspicion of child neglect, and the local child authorities held meetings on the matter upwards of 30 times - without doing anything about the matter. The Minister of Social Affairs at the time, Eva Kjer Hansen, refused for four months after the reveal of the case in 2005 to criticize Løgumkloster Municipality due to \\"there not being enough evidence to criticize their treatment of the case\\". Tønder Municipality was, however, criticized by the minister, and a key person in the municipality was fired as a result of the case. The family was living in Tønder Municipality at the start of the investigation, despite the abuse having started while they still lived in Løgumkloster Municipality. Since the arrest of the family, 14 additional arrests have been made. Including the father, 15 men were sentenced to a total of 45 years of prison for abusing the elder daughter. It was later revealed that the father had been abusing both the younger and older daughter. The father was sentenced on charges of incest, sexual relations with minors and indecent exposure, which in February 2007 resulted in a prison sentence of 10 years. The father was also fined 200.000 DKK and 50.000 DKK in damages to the older and younger daughter respectively. The mother was, due to her being diagnosed with Schizophrenia, sentenced to indefinite involuntary commitment for being an accomplice to the father's incest. After the sentences, a signature collection started to petition the Folketing to enact harsher punishment for the abuse of children. The collection was started by mechanic Peter Petersen, a citizen from Sønderjylland, and resulted in a total of 30.000 signatures, which were delivered to then Minister of Justice, Lene Espersen. Espersen commented, that she interpreted the aggressive requests, that were stated in the petition, as an expression of displeasure aimed towards the fact that sentences in paedophilia cases didn't didn't reach the harsher end of the spectrum. The two girls received a total of 1.215.000 DKK in damages, with the older one receiving 880.000 DKK and the younger 320.000 DKK. On the 6. March 2014, Tønder Municipality elected to grant the older girl an additional 300.000 DKK as an apology. In February of the same year, Tønder Municipality was sued on behalf of the older daughter, by her lawyer, Nikolaj Nielsen. The aim of this suit was to get the municipality to further admit their guilt in failing to live up to their responsibility in regards to the case. The municipality reacted by handing over the suit to their insurance company, who promptly made additional replacement money available through the municipality's insurance. The case has been described in numerous newspaper articles, books and documentaries, as well as the drama film Himlen Falder from 2009, which was directly inspired by the case.  Summary of the case  A total of 16 arrests were made, including the girls' parents. The sexual abuse started in Løgumkloster Municipality, but when the family moved to Tønder, the charges were handed over to Tønder Municipality, who failed to take action in time, allowing the abuse to continue unhindered.  Brief timeline of the case  * 4. August 2005: The police in Sønderborg receive an anonymous tip, resulting in an investigation being started. * 24. August 2005: The parents are arrested, and both girls are placed in foster care with a surrogate family. * 11. January 2006: A 40-year-old man was arrested as the eleventh man in the case.  The Parents  The father (who was on disability pension due to a heart failure) was put on trial for having loaned and rented out the girls to a large amount of unrelated men, who had then sexually assaulted the girls. The father had also sexually assaulted the girls himself. The father attempted suicide in December 2006 during his remand in Vejle Jail. While the sexual assaults and forced prostitution was happening, the father was a member of Satanisk Forening, a Danish satanist cult. The mother (an organist in a local church) was put on trial for being an accomplice to, as well as attempting to participate in the copulation with the girls. In regards to the younger daughter, the mother received the same charges in a separate trial, where she had also been an accomplice to the assaults. The mother spoke in an interview to TV 2's criminal magazine Station 2, where she proclaimed herself as an innocent victim.  The Authorities  It was revealed that the family had been investigated by the local authorities in 2004, while they were still living in Løgumkloster Municipality, due to the mother's mental illness. The girls were, because of this investigation, offered a relief family (a family they could stay with when the mother's illness got particularly bad) and were nominated for regular psychiatric evaluation at Helsehjemmet Treatment Institute in Haderslev. The family moved to Tønder because of this. Shortly after this nomination, the mother left the family. While she was missing, the girls were finally (half a year later) taken to the Treatment Institute for evaluation, on orders of the local municipality. The results of the evaluation were unclear, and resulted in no further action from the municipality. This later resulted in critique of the involved government institutes, who were accused of insufficient communication amongst themselves about the families situation and lacking treatment. On the 5. March 2014, Tønder Municipality paid 300.000 DKK in damages to the elder daughter after a lawsuit because of the aforementioned neglect. The Director of Children, School and Culture in Tønder Municipality stated that the municipality paid willingly to avoid an actual lawsuit.  The Trials  The 47-year-old father in the Tønder Case was on the 20. February 2007 in the local court in Tønder, sentenced to 10 years in jail for the sexual abuse of his two daughters. He was sentenced after having confirmed his admission of guilt in regards to the sexual assault accusations. He only partially admitted having rented out the daughters to various other men (many of whom had already been sentenced at this point). He was, along with the prison sentence, forced to pay 200.000 DKK in damages to the older daughter, and 50.000 DKK to the younger one. The 47-year-old man's was charged with having sexually abused his older daughter, as well as having rented her out to other men for various sexual acts, while she was still only 10–11 years old. In a later court session in Tønder, the father also admitted to the other 19 accusations (in regards to the other men), and after the prosecution and defence rested their case, it only took Judge Henriette Frölich half an hour to hand out the ruling. The mother was sentenced separately on the 11. December 2006 in the same court (in Tønder) and was sentenced to indefinite involuntary commitment at a psychiatric hospital. It was revealed that she had been suffering from schizophrenia since 1983.  Other sentences related to the case  * 58-year-old man from Flensburg with Turkish background.

The labellum is long, wide and pale green with three lobes. The middle lobe turns downwards and is wavy but the side lobes are upright. Flowering occurs between September and November in Australia and in June China. Taxonomy and naming The green corduroy orchid was first formally described in 1825 by David Don who gave it the name Bletium bicallosa and published the description in Prodromus Florae Nepalensis. In 1966, Peter Francis Hunt and Victor Summerhayes changed the name to Eulophia bicallosa. The specific epithet (bicallosa) is derived from the Latin prefix bi- meaning \\"two\\" or \\"double\\" and callosa meaning \\"with a hard skin\\", referring to two ridges on the labellum. Distribution and habitat Eulophia bicallosa grows in woodland and rainforests in coastal regions of Queensland and in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.

The name Hungerball was created by Andu's son and Hungerball's co-founder Toma Iordache. It comes from the game's aim of improving participants' hunger for possession of the ball while also referencing The Hunger Games.  Early adoption  In 2015, Hungerball launched in New Zealand. Hungerball launched in Brisbane, Australia in 2016 and in Muskoka Woods, Canada in 2018. In 2017, it was first played by Mangere Refugee Resettlement Centre, church youth groups and tertiary students at AUT.

Types of games  There are currently two main types of Hungerball games; \\"competition\\" and \\"social\\". During competition games, there are two ways to play: # There is a fixed time period. The person who scores the highest number of goals, minus goals conceded - wins. # It is played as an elimination challenge. Upon conceding three goals, the player is eliminated until there is only one left, who is then the winner. During social games, players in large groups use a fast rotation system whereby whoever concedes is replaced by someone in a line waiting to get on the pitch. There are then multiple social games for players which are based on training and development. The rules are: ;Singles – 1 vs 1 x 6 (Hungerball meets soccer) * Dice throw decides which of the six players starts from the centre. * Other players to remain in their goals, can come out once the ball is touched. * One ball, no hands. * Players can score in any of the other five goals. * One point added for each goal scored, one point taken off for goal conceded. * Own goal counts as goal conceded (only). * Player who concedes a goal resumes play from the centre. * Handball sanctioned with penalty shot to empty goal of guilty player from goal of player who last touched ball prior to hand ball. * Similarly, fault sanctioned with penalty shot into empty goal of guilty player. * If responsibility or benefit of fault or handball unable to be established, dice throw to decide who resumes play. ;Team * 2 vs 2 x 3 – two goals per team – similar to challenges for individuals. * 3 vs 3 – three goals per team, best team wins.” ;Field hockey adaptation In New Zealand, Hungerball was adapted to field hockey. It plays with the same rules as the soccer version but with the inclusion of a hockey ball and bat per player instead of a conventional football.

During the incident, David Mesher, a 70 year old white man from Birmingham, racially abused Delsie Gayle, a 77 year old black woman from East London, who was seated next to him. After she was slow to move from her seat, he became abusive, using expletives against her and referring to her as a \\"stupid ugly cow\\" and an \\"ugly black bastard\\". Various passengers and staff asked Mesher to desist from his behaviour. Staff ultimately decided that he should remain in his seat rather than being removed from the plane, with Gayle being asked to move seats instead. Another passenger, David Lawrence, filmed the incident and posted the footage to social media; he commented that he wanted to raise wider public awareness of the racist incidents that black Caribbean people experience. There it gained widespread attention; international mainstream media coverage followed. A number of prominent politicians condemned the incident and Ryanair's response to it. Ryanair were criticised for not removing Mesher from the plane and handing him over to Spanish police; for moving Gayle rather than Mesher; and for failing to appropriately apologise to her after the incident. Several days later, police revealed that they had discovered Mesher's identity and gave the information to the Spanish authorities. Barcelona City Council announced that it had instructed its public prosecutor to determine whether his actions constituted a hate crime under Spanish law. A week after the incident, Mesher publicly apologised to Gayle on the ITV Breakfast television show Good Morning Britain and rejected the idea that he was racist. Gayle did not accept the apology; her daughter rejected his claims to not be racist. Background At the time of the incident, David Mesher was seventy years old. A former railway worker, he was once employed by British Rail at the ticket office of Waterloo Railway Station and later by London Midland Railway as a train announcer. He formerly lived in Barking, East London with his mother, but after her death had moved to Birmingham, where by 2018 he was living in a sheltered accommodation housing block in the Yardley Wood area of the city. One former colleague expressed surprise at Mesher's actions during the incident, noting that when \\"was in the ticket office at Waterloo station[…] [he] was always so polite. He would not be rude to anyone, otherwise he would not have been dealing with the public. It was a real shock to see him and the vile language that he used\\". While in Yardley Wood, he had had problems with various neighbours; reporters found one who called him \\"a racist pig and bully\\", while another said \\"no one really likes him. He keeps himself to himself and we don't know much about him\\". One resident living adjacent to him called him a \\"strange man\\" and noted that they \\"had problems\\" with him in the past. One related that Mesher had \\"no respect for other people\\", and that in one incident Mesher had been \\"driving me mad by playing music loudly and continuously on a loop. I banged on his door to ask him to turn it down and he wasn't even in. How inconsiderate is that?\\" At the time living in East London, Delsie Gayle was seventy-seven years old and was a retired care assistant; she had moved to Britain from Jamaica during the 1960s as part of the \\"Windrush generation\\". In late 2017, her husband—to whom she had been married for over fifty years—died. Her daughter observed that she was \\"feeling really down and depressed\\" and decided to take her on a holiday to Spain so that it might \\"raise her spirits\\". Incident The incident took place on 19 October 2018 on the Ryanair flight FR9015 from Barcelona to London Stansted; it occurred before take-off, while the plane was still on Spanish territory. In the incident, Mesher sought to get past Gayle, who was in the aisle seat, to access his window seat. Gayle, whose mobility was affected by arthritis, was slow to move out of his way. At this point, Gayle's daughter explained to Mesher that her mother was disabled. Mesher's response was that \\"I don't care whether she's fucking disabled or not - if I tell her to get out then she gets out.\\" A flight attendant appeared and asked Gayle if she would like to move; she responded that she wanted to remain close to her daughter. At this, Mesher stated: \\"Move her to another seat... I can't get in while she's sat there.\\" Gayle responded with: \\"You smell. You need a wash\\", to which Mesher followed with \\"If you don't go to another seat, I'll push you to another seat.\\" The argument continued. After she spoke to him in English with a Jamaican accent, Mesher said: \\"Don't talk to me in a fucking foreign language you stupid ugly cow.\\" Another passenger intervened, asking Mesher to stop being abusive. His response was that \\"I will carry on as far as I can with this ugly black bastard.\\" Several passengers called for Mesher to be removed from the plane. A flight attendant told him that he was being \\"super rude\\" and asked him to calm down before stating that he would have to ask his supervisor what course of action should be taken. Ultimately, Mesher was not removed from the flight. He was allowed to remain in his seat while Gayle was asked to move from hers, which she did; Mesher then told staff that \\"I'm alright, now she's gone\\". Gayle's daughter subsequently related that the cabin crew denied hearing Mesher use racial slurs and told her to call Ryanair customer services on 22 October. A fellow passenger, David Lawrence—who like Gayle was of Caribbean heritage—filmed the incident and posted it to social media. He explained that \\"for many years a lot of the West Indian community have gone through these types of incidents in Britain, but have never been able to share it with the public or the world. So I decided that I had the opportunity to film this, as difficult as it was\\". In his view, it was important that the public be made aware \\"that these incidents take place\\" and that this was something that could now be achieved through \\"the power of social media\\". He noted that one fellow passenger called him \\"childish\\" for filming the incident. Lawrence criticised the response of both fellow passengers and the plane's staff, adding that he had seen individuals escorted off of planes before for less serious actions. After being uploaded on the 20 October, the footage was widely circulated on social media and attracted the attention of mainstream media in both the UK and abroad. Within several days, it had been viewed millions of times. Response Various politicians spoke out at what they regarded as Ryanair's lack of appropriate action in the incident. Chris Grayling, the Secretary of State for Transport, appeared on the BBC's Today programme, where he stated that the incident was \\"totally unacceptable\\" and expressed the hope that \\"police would want to take action in such an extraordinarily unacceptable case\\". Karl Turner, the Member of Parliament for Kingston upon Hull East, tweeted that Mesher \\"should have been removed from the flight and handed over to the police\\". Turner added that if the plane was in the UK at the time of the incident then a criminal offence had definitely been committed. Later speaking to BBC Radio 4's World at One, Turner expressed concern that Mesher would escape criminal prosecution because there was no extradition arrangement for events of this nature and thus Mesher might not face Spanish prosecutors unless he handed himself over willingly; \\"I doubt whether he's going to do that.\\" Stuart McMillan, the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Greenock and Inverclyde, tweeted to state that \\"This is really appalling Ryanair. You will know the identity of the man and the level of training given to your staff.\\" The MSP Margaret Ferrier tweeted that the footage was \\"utterly disgusting\\" and that the flight attendant was \\"incapable of responding appropriately\\" to the \\"racist male passenger\\". Ferrier later tweeted that Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary should personally call Gayle to \\"apologise profusely for the incompetence of his flight attendant in handling this racial abuse incident properly.\\" The MP Dawn Butler wrote a letter to Ryanair, accusing them of \\"empowering a racist\\" by failing to act against Mesher at the time of the incident. She added the view that it was \\"particularly sad\\" that this occurred during Black History Month. Gayle's local MP, John Cryer, stated he would raise the issue through an early day motion in the House of Commons. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, expressed his intention of contacting Gayle about the incident. After the footage appeared online, various calls were made to boycott Ryanair over their response; among those endorsing such a boycott was the MP David Lammy. A Change.org petition was launched calling on Ryanair to apologise and compensate Gayle for her experience. On 21 October, Ryanair tweeted that it had reported the issue to Essex Police and that \\"As this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further\\". This public statement did not include an apology to Gayle. Ryanair stated that they contacted Gayle on that same day, with a letter sent both by post and email. Reporter Jeremy Vine tweeted his criticism of Ryanair, stating that \\"they need to explain how this man's disgusting racial abuse of the black lady in the seat next to him ends up with HER being asked to move. It is beyond belief.\\" Writing in The Independent, Helen Coffey noted that the incident raised questions regarding \\"the rules of jurisdiction\\" when it comes to aviation, highlighting that it was often a \\"grey area\\". Also in an op-ed for The Independent, Biba Kang highlighted the fact that the incident came to light on the same day that the Doctor Who episode \\"Rosa\\"—featuring an encounter with the African-American civil rights activist Rosa Parks in 1950s Alabama—was first screened on British television. For Kang, the two occurrences reflected \\"how far we've come since the inception of the civil rights movement, while also reminding us how far we have left to go.\\" Kang saw both the Doctor Who episode and the Ryanair incident as evidence that \\"black people are treated as aggressors in scenarios where they are really the victim\\"; in Gayle's example because staff treated her as if she was equally guilty as Mesher in the argument and was asked to move seats. He linked this to the \\"racist stereotype that black people are innately confrontational or aggressive\\", so that when they are faced with racial abuse their angry responses are regarded as \\"evidence that the abuse was provoked\\" in the first place. Writing for The Huffington Post, Nadine White and Lucy Pasha-Robinson noted that for many black British people, the footage about the incident was \\"shocking, but not surprising.\\" White and Pasha-Robinson noted that many of the black Britons they talked to could relate experiences of \\"everyday racism\\" that they had encountered in their lives, such as being referred to as \\"golliwogs\\" or \\"niggers\\" by strangers or neighbours, being followed by store security when entering shops, and encountering racial abuse on social media. In an op-ed for The Guardian, Hugh Muir cautioned that Mesher \\"may not be able to take responsibility for his actions. If he is, he is damned by them, by the knowledge that his show of inhumanity was seen by millions, by the terrible certainty that his dark side is forever transparent.\\" He praised Lawrence for filming the incident and thus ensuring that it \\"became a cause celebre\\" but criticised other passengers on the plane who \\"sat by – keener to get home perhaps than to stand up for an elderly woman being racially abused\\". Ultimately, he described the incident as being \\"like the Rosa Parks story enacted in reverse\\". Police investigation On 23 October, Essex Police revealed that they had ascertained the identity of the man and had passed his details on to the Spanish authorities. West Midlands Police co-operated with their Essex counterpart and spoke to Mesher at his home. Also on 23 October, the Daily Mail publicly revealed Mesher's identity, which before then had not been known to the public. Reporters from the Daily Mail tried to talk to him; he responded by locking himself in his flat and telling them: \\"Go away, there's nothing to say\\". Reporters assembled outside the housing block in which Mesher lived. A spokesperson for Optivo, the company which manages the block, stated that \\"we do not condone abusive behaviour in any form. As this matter is now being handled by the police we are unable to make any further comment at this stage.\\" Barcelona's city council stated that it would treat the incident as a potential hate crime, with its deputy mayor Jaume Asens stating that they had passed the information to the public prosecutor to determine if criminal charges could be brought. On Twitter, he tweeted that \\"Barcelona is a welcoming and anti-racist city. All support to the victim.\\" The Mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, called the footage \\"unbearable\\" and said that Barcelona \\"wouldn't take this lying down\\". She praised the man responsible for filming the incident, stating that by doing so he had \\"brought to public attention an event that can't go unpunished\\". A spokesperson for Spain's Civil Guard stated that the issue was a matter for the British police because the plane had been bound for the UK. Spain's Aviation Safety and Security Agency stated: \\"We think what happened, and the racist comments made, were terrible... But our responsibility is aircraft safety and we're looking into whether or not this comes under our responsibility.\\" Responses from the Gayles and Mesher On 22 October, Gayle and her daughter were interviewed by ITV News. Commenting on the incident, Gayle related that she was \\"shocked, nobody ever said those words to me [before]... I travel a lot, I go to Canada... and no-one has ever said those words to me\\". She explained that the abuse made her \\"feel very low. He paid a fare to go on holiday, I've paid mine so why does he abuse me for that due to the colour of my skin?\\" She added the view that if Mesher \\"gets away\\" with the incident, then he would \\"do it to somebody else\\". Gayle stated that she had not been contacted by Ryanair since the incident and would not use the company again. Her daughter told ITV News that Ryanair's response had been poor; \\"on the plane it was unprofessional, and after it was unprofessional... It's all wrong, I just believe they need more training\\". She also expressed the view that aboard the plane, \\"nothing was done and I know if that was a black person racially abusing an elderly woman the police would have been called. When I saw the video I felt [Ryanair staff behaved as if] he was the victim - that's the way RyanAir was treating it.\\" On 25 October, Carol Gayle told journalists from The Huffington Post that \\"Both mum and I are emotionally and mentally drained... Mum hasn't been able to eat much since this all happened and she had something today. She's keen to raise awareness about what happened to her, so it doesn't happen to anyone else\\". She added that \\"I hope that some justice will be done because people can't go around racially abusing people – no way\\", and thanked \\"everyone who has supported us, shared articles about it and got behind the cause. I didn’t expect the scale of this, at all. It’s worldwide! The love and support is so nice.\\" On 26 October, Mesher appeared on the ITV Breakfast television show Good Morning Britain, where he stated that he \\"absolutely\\" regretted his behaviour in the incident. He added: \\"I probably lost my temper a bit and ordered her to get up. I'm not a racist person by any means and it's just a fit of temper at the time, I think. I apologise for all the distress you've had there and since.\\" Gayle refused to accept his apology. She stated that \\"You must forget and forgive but it's going to take a long time for me to get over what he has done to me\\". Gayle's daughter rejected Mesher's protestation that he was not racist, stating that \\"if he wasn't racist\\" then he would not have used the words he used during the incident. Mesher's views on this point were also critiqued by Stephen Bush in the New Statesman. Bush felt that Mesher's claim to not being a racist was \\"a perfect illustration of the widespread delusion that being racist is a moral condition, only practiced by the immoral, rather than a specific pattern of behaviour.\\" He noted that Mesher's statement that Gayle was a \\"black bastard\\" and his claim that she was speaking in a \\"foreign language\\" when she spoke English with her Jamaican accent were \\"palpably\\" racist but that he, like many British people, continued to believe that only totally immoral people could be \\"racist\\". He added that Mesher's public comments were a \\"non-apology\\", for Mesher had only apologised for the \\"distress\\" Gayle experienced and not for his original comments. Also on 26 October, the Gayles stated that Ryanair's staff had not apologised to them and that the company's claims that it had done so were \\"lies\\". In response, Ryanair publicly stated that \\"Our customer care team contacted the Gayle family on Sunday.\\" The company added: \\"We again extend our very sincere apologies to this passenger for the regrettable, and unacceptable remarks that were made to her by an adjacent passenger, and we believe that by reporting this matter immediately to the Essex Police and by apologising in writing to this customer early on Sunday morning, Ryanair treated it with the urgency and seriousness it warranted.\\" It stipulated that the staff aboard the flight had been aware of the argument when it happened but only learned that Mesher had used racist language when they were shown footage of the incident once landed at London Stansted. It noted that at the time of the incident, \\"the cabin crew believed they were dealing with an argument between two passengers\\" and thus \\"followed company procedure, to defuse the argument,\\" through separating \\"the passengers by offering to move one to alternative seating\\".

Examples of her work are held in the collections of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm and the Design Museum in Helsinki. Her work has also been exhibited at the Rome Quadriennale, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, and the Triennale Design Museum in Milan. Her most celebrated design was the Karelia chair, first produced by Zanotta in 1966. Life and career She was born Liisi Marjatta Meronen on her parents' farm in Kirvu on the Karelian Isthmus. The Meronen family was forced to evacuate when the Russians invaded and seized the territory at the outbreak of World War II. With their farm razed to the ground and unable to return to Karelia, the family built a new life in Virenoja, a village near Orimattila. She enrolled in the Helsinki School of Arts and Design on the milinary and clothing course, but unbeknownst to her father, also took courses at the Academy of Fine Arts which occupied the same building. She married Hans Beckmann in 1946. Their early married life was spent between Helsinki, Vironja, and Lübeck in her husband's native Germany. The marriage was not a success and the couple soon began living apart. However, they did not divorce until 1957, and she retained his surname throughout her life. Beckmann moved to Milan in 1957 where she worked in the development studio of La Rinascente. She went on to design objects and furniture for several Italian firms, including the furniture company Zanotta, the glass company Vetreria Vistosi, the ceramics company Gabbianelli, and the metalware company Valenti. In 1966 she designed her most famous piece, the Karelia easy chair for Zanotta. Constructed in undulating forms of expanded polyurethane foam with a glossy vinyl cover, it became one of Zanotta's cult classics. It was reissued by the company in 2007 and exhibited at Milan's Triennale Design Museum in 2016. In the late 1960s Beckmann settled in Cassano d'Adda in the outskirts of Milan. She gradually withdrew from designing in the mid-1970s and devoted herself to painting and sculpture. During this period she had a solo exhibition at the Galleria di Naviglio in Milan and exhibited her sculptures Liszt and Marconi at the Rome Quadriennale. Another sculpture from this period, Homo Erectus, is held in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm. Beckmann spent the last years of her life in Finland and died in Orimattila at the age of 79. A retrospective exhibition of her work was held at the Palazzo Berva in Cassano d'Adda in 2015.

They were designed by the New South Wales Government Railways and built from 1892 to 1922 by day labour. They are also known as Wentworth Park Viaduct, Jubilee Park Viaduct and Glebe Viaducts. The viaducts were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Established to initially carry the Metropolitan Goods Line, the viaducts were converted for use by the Inner West Light Rail (Dulwich Hill Line) in 1996, at the time of their electrification.  History  By 1900 the Sydney metropolitan railway network was fast reaching congestion through the combined, and conflicting, demands of the suburban and country passenger services and the movements of freight trains. Segregated running periods and special timetables were only short-term solutions and did not address the differing traffic requirements. The decision was made to build a separate rail system for freight trains so they could move independently of the passenger services but could link into the four main lines (north, west, south and Illawarra) at specific locations. Also, a large marshalling yard would be built in the middle of the goods line network (at Enfield) to centralise the interchange of freight traffic. The completion of the goods line was directly associated with the Sydney Harbour Trust's completion of the Pyrmont (Jones Bay) wharves, which were considered the most up-to-date and advanced in the port, with rail lines running along each of the wharves. The goods line provided a continuous loop connection through Central Station Yard, Darling Harbour Goods Yard and the Pyrmont wharves, with connections to Rozelle Yard, White Bay and Glebe Island. In this period, Sydney Harbour was the main port for NSW and the goods line provided a direct connection between rural Australia, growing wheat and wool and mining coal, and the ships carrying the goods to export markets. Imported goods arriving on the docks were back-loaded onto the empty trains for distribution around the state. Work began around 1910 with the goods line from Rozelle to the northern end of Darling Harbour completed and opened for traffic on 23 January 1922. The construction of brick arch underbridges occurred in two periods: 1892 for the duplication of the line from Granville to Picton, then from 1914 to 1922 mostly for main line duplications. The former had bricks supplied from private brickworks whereas the latter's supply came from the State Brickworks at Homebush. The construction of the Jubilee Park and Wentworth Park viaducts was the first large-scale project to use bricks from the State Brickworks. Approximately three million four hundred thousand bricks were used for these viaducts. The viaducts were built using timber piles driven into the ground below them, to shore up the structures, as both Parks had been themselves created on land resumed from swamps and sandflats. In 1996 the Metropolitan Goods Line was converted for use by the metro light rail system, which included the installation of new stations and infrastructure such as overhead catenary systems to carry the required electric wiring. Nearly all the underbridges - a mix of brick arches, steel girders and steel trusses - on the former Metropolitan Goods Line are still in use.  Description  The viaduct over Johnstons Creek, looking upriver, pictured in 2009. Jubilee Park viaduct Jubilee Park viaduct is a 28-span brick arch viaduct built on a curve extending from the east of Jubilee Park at Victoria Road to The Crescent, Annandale. The viaduct contains more than two million bricks from the former State Brickworks at Homebush Bay. The bricks are laid in English bond pattern with soldier courses defining the archways. The arches are evenly spaced, being 28 x clear spans. The viaduct stretches approximately , making it the largest brick viaduct in the NSW rail system. Wentworth Park viaduct The Wentworth Park viaduct consists of a long, curved brick arch viaduct of 11 x clear spans and 10 x clear spans. The viaduct is estimated to contain 1.4 million bricks and stretches approximately across the park, making it the second longest brick viaduct in the NSW system after the Jubilee Park viaduct which is part of the same line.  Condition  As at 15 May 2009, the viaducts are in good condition. The viaducts retain most original fabric and structure, except for some closed-in arches.  Modifications and dates  *1996: Both bridges modified to carry metro light rail network, including addition of overhead electric wires and catenary poles to support them. *N.d: Some of the Jubilee Park arches closed in as rentable space.  Heritage listing  As at 15 April 2013, the Glebe Viaducts across Jubilee Park and Wentworth Park have state significance as excellent examples of large scale brick arch bridge construction. The 28-span Jubilee Park Viaduct is significant as the longest section of brick arch viaduct on the NSW system. Along with the 21-span Wentworth Park Viaduct, the pair of elegant curved structures are integral parts of the parklands in which they stand and remain as important landmarks along the Glebe foreshore. The structures are both major engineering works and are historically significant as important elements in the development of the Darling Harbour Goods Line in the early 20th century, and as one of the first major infrastructure projects to use bricks from the State Brickworks at Homebush, with more than 3 million bricks used in their construction. Glebe and Wentworth Park railway, Viaducts was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Glebe Viaducts are of state historical significance as integral components of the separate railway network (1910–22) constructed to allow freight trains to traverse the metropolitan area independent of the passenger train network which was one of the most significant and effective railway projects in New South Wales during the twentieth century. The Glebe Viaducts across both Jubilee and Wentworth Park was one of the first projects to use bricks from the State Brickworks at Homebush on a large scale, using more than three million bricks for their construction. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Glebe Viaducts (Jubilee Park/Wentworth Park) is an imposing curved structure across parklands whereby its brickwork complements the natural environment. The two sections of the viaduct are major landmark features in the urban landscape and one of the most recognisable industrial features in inner-city Sydney. The viaduct has technical significance due to its scale and construction methods, including the use of timber pilings to add a support structure in regards to the reclaimed land that it was built across. The 28-span Jubilee Park Viaduct is of technical significance as the longest section of brick arch viaduct on the NSW system and the largest viaduct structure to survive. Along with the 21-span Wentworth Park Viaduct, the pair form two significant major engineering works and are excellent examples of brick arch construction. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place and can provide a connection to the local community's history. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Glebe Viaducts (Jubilee Park/Wentworth Park) are rare as the two viaducts form the longest pair of brick arch viaducts in the NSW rail system. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Glebe Viaducts (Jubilee Park/Wentworth Park) are an excellent representative of brick arch construction and compares to the brick arch viaduct on the Lavender Bay railway line.

The problem originated from a conjecture of Gross and Prasad for special orthogonal groups but was later generalized to include all four classical groups. In the cases considered, it is known that the multiplicity of the restrictions is at most one and the conjecture describes when the multiplicity is precisely one. Motivation A motivating example is the following classical branching problem in the theory of compact Lie groups. Let \\\\pi be an irreducible finite dimensional representation of the compact unitary group U(n), and consider its restriction to the naturally embedded subgroup U(n-1). It is known that this restriction is multiplicity- free, but one may ask precisely which irreducible representations of U(n-1) occur in the restriction. By the Cartan–Weyl theory of highest weights, there is a classification of the irreducible representations of U(n) via their highest weights which are in natural bijection with sequences of integers \\\\underline{a} = (a_1 \\\\leq a_2 \\\\leq \\\\cdots \\\\leq a_n). Now suppose that \\\\pi has highest weight \\\\underline{a}. Then an irreducible representation \\\\tau of U(n-1) with highest weight \\\\underline{b} occurs in the restriction of \\\\pi to U(n-1) (viewed as a subgroup of U(n)) if and only if \\\\underline{a} and \\\\underline{b} are interlacing, i.e. a_1 \\\\leq b_1 \\\\leq a_2 \\\\leq b_2 \\\\leq \\\\cdots \\\\leq b_{n-1} \\\\leq a_n. The Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture then considers the analogous restriction problem for other classical groups. Statement The conjecture has slightly different forms for the different classical groups. The formulation for general unitary groups is as follows. Setup Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field k not of characteristic 2 equipped with a non-degenerate sesquilinear form that is \\\\varepsilon-symmetric (i.e. \\\\varepsilon = 1 if the form is symmetric and \\\\varepsilon = -1 if the form is skew-symmetric. Let W be a non-degenerate subspace of V such that V = W \\\\oplus W^\\\\perp of dimension (\\\\varepsilon + 1)/2. Then let G = G(V) \\\\times G(W), where G(V) is the unitary group preserving the form on V, and let H = \\\\Delta G(W) be the diagonal subgroup of G(W). Let \\\\pi = \\\\pi_1 \\\\boxtimes \\\\pi_2 be an irreducible smooth representation of G and let u be either the trivial representation (the \\"Bessel case\\") or the Weil representation (the \\"Fourier–Jacobi case\\"). Let \\\\varphi = \\\\varphi_1 \\\\times \\\\varphi_2 be a generic L-parameter for G = G(V) \\\\times G(W), and let \\\\Pi_\\\\varphi be the associated Vogan L-packet. Local Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture If \\\\varphi is a local L-parameter for G, then :\\\\sum_{\\\\text{relevant } \\\\pi \\\\in \\\\Pi_\\\\varphi} \\\\dim \\\\operatorname{Hom}_H (\\\\pi \\\\otimes \\\\overline{ u}, \\\\mathbb{C}) = 1. Letting \\\\eta_{\\\\mathrm{GP}} be the \\"distinguished character\\" defined in terms of the Langlands–Deligne local constant, then furthermore :\\\\operatorname{Hom}_H (\\\\pi(\\\\varphi, \\\\eta) \\\\otimes \\\\overline{ u}, \\\\mathbb{C}) eq 0 \\\\text{ if and only if } \\\\eta = \\\\eta_{\\\\mathrm{GP}}. Global Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture For a quadratic field extension E/F, let L_E(s, \\\\pi_1 \\\\times \\\\pi_2) := L_E(s, \\\\pi_1 \\\\boxtimes \\\\pi_2, \\\\mathrm{std}_n \\\\boxtimes \\\\mathrm{std}_{n-1}) where L_E is the global L-function obtained as the product of local L-factors given by the local Langlands conjectures. The conjecture states that the following are equivalent: # The period interval P_H is nonzero when restricted to \\\\pi. # For all places v, the local Hom space \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{H(F_v)}(\\\\pi_v, u_v) eq 0 and L_E(1/2, \\\\pi_1 \\\\times \\\\pi_2) eq 0. Current status Local Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture In a series of four papers between 2010 and 2012, Jean-Loup Waldspurger proved the local Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture for tempered representations of special orthogonal groups over p-adic fields. In 2012, Colette Moeglin and Waldspurger then proved the local Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture for generic non-tempered representations of special orthogonal groups over p-adic fields. In his 2013 thesis, Raphaël Beuzart-Plessis proved the local Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture for the tempered representations of unitary groups in the p-adic Hermitian case under the same hypotheses needed to establish the local Langlands conjecture. Hongyu He proved the Gan-Gross- Prasad conjectures for discrete series representations of the real unitary group U(p,q). Global Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture In a series of papers between 2004 and 2009, David Ginzburg, Dihua Jiang, and Stephen Rallis showed the (1) implies (2) direction of the global Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture for all quasisplit classical groups. In the Bessel case of the global Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture for unitary groups, Wei Zhang used the theory of the relative trace formula by Hervé Jacquet and the work on the fundamental lemma by Zhiwei Yun to prove that the conjecture is true subject to certain local conditions in 2014. In the Fourier–Jacobi case of the global Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture for unitary groups, Yifeng Liu and Hang Xue showed that the conjecture holds in the skew-Hermitian case, subject to certain local conditions. In the Bessel case of the global Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture for special orthogonal groups and unitary groups, Dihua Jiang and Lei Zhang used the theory of twisted automorphic descents to prove that (1) implies (2) in its full generality, i.e. for any irreducible cuspidal automorphic representation with a generic global Arthur parameter, and that (2) implies (1) subject to a certain global assumption.

The locality is within the municipal limits of Aranjuez and is in the Community of Madrid. It has a population of 14, but in its heyday in the 1920s there were more inhabitants and the community was provided with a school and a chapel. Railway heritage The most significant building is the railway station, designed by Narciso Claveria in Neo-Mudéjar style. Replacing a more modest facility, it was erected in the 1920s by the railway company \\"Ferrocarriles de Madrid a Zaragoza y Alicante\\" (often known by its initials MZA). The station has become redundant since the opening of the Madrid–Toledo high-speed rail line in 2005. The old line between Aranjuez and Toledo has closed and there is less traffic passing through Algodor. Between 1932 and 2000 an Italian hydraulic system, developed by Bianchi and Servettaz, was used to control points switching and signalling. Part of this system is now on display at the Railway Museum, Madrid, in a replica signal box.

By 2020, this initiative has expanded into 50 countries, serving over 1.5 million people worldwide. The purpose of Cycling Without Age is: \\"to realise the dream of creating a world in which the easy access to active citizenship creates happiness among our elderly citizens and gives them an opportunity to remain an active part of the local community.\\" Under the motto \\"The right to wind in your hair\\", Cycling Without Age offers recreational mobility to seniors, in the form of volunteer-piloted trishaw rides. This type of common activity promotes communication between the senior passengers and their riders (called pilots), thus facilitating the goal of the initiative: \\"we build bridges between generations, we reinforce trust, respect and the social glue in our society\\". Cycling Without Age has chapters throughout the world. Each chapter is typically at the service of a specific nursing home. The trishaw rides are offered by local volunteer pilots. These rides enable seniors with limited mobility to explore their neighbourhood and the surrounding nature. History The history of Cycling Without Age began in Copenhagen in 2012 when the 47-year-old social entrepreneur Ole Kassow cycled to work every day. On his way he noticed an elderly gentleman sitting in front of a senior citizens' home. This encounter stuck in his memory. Later, when looking at historical pictures of his hometown, he wondered whether this gentleman used to enjoy cycling in his younger years as much as Ole himself did nowadays. After thinking about it for a while, an idea formed in his mind: Ole rented a trishaw, rode it to the senior citizens' home and offered a ride. An elderly lady and her caregiver were his passengers on the first trishaw trip. The route took them to sites the elderly lady knew from years gone by. She told him stories from that time and was very happy to see these places again. The trip was a great success and soon other residents of the home wanted a ride with the trishaw. With the support of the residence's management, a spontaneous idea became a regular leisure time facility. When Ole Kassow wrote to the city council of Copenhagen and asked for the financing of the trishaw for the senior citizens' home, he surprisingly found support there too: five trishaws were ordered in one fell swoop. With a parade of the new trishaws in April 2013, the initiative was presented to the public - two television stations and various newspapers reported. Ole Kassow's idea gave rise to the initiative ' which spread quickly in Denmark and soon afterwards in many countries around the world. As of March 2020, there are 2200 regional chapters with over 3000 trishaws in more than 50 countries in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia (including New Zealand). Often a Cycling Without Age chapter is formed in a neighbourhood area. That group then organizes a trishaw and makes it available for excursions to surrounding senior citizens' facilities and other social institutions. Volunteers are instructed in the handling of the trishaw and make themselves available as pilots in their free time. Other Cycling Without Age chapters are associated with a specific social institution and serve only that facility. Impact A 2018 study at the in Barcelona, Spain, reported that all 14 participants felt that the relationship with the volunteer pilot was very positive. The majority \\"loved the trips, felt more motivated and would recommend CWA. The main reasons they liked CWA\\" was \\"going out for a ride and get distracted.\\" In 2019, a study by the German (Institute for Education, Upbringing and Guidance) found that the trips offered by Cycling Without Age generally have a positive effect on older people. The passengers benefit from the many new social contacts and perceive the outings as an enrichment for their everyday life. With the extended range of motion, they can experience the great outdoors again and visit places they have fond memories of. In particular, however, the passengers enjoy the conversations with the trishaw pilot and other people they meet. Due to the special design of the trishaws used by Cycling Without Age (passengers in front, rider in the back), communication is possible at any time without any problems: 'The social isolation, which is a major hurdle in everyday life for many seniors, is inevitably reduced or even dissolved by Cycling Without Age — from which not only the seniors, but also the pilots themselves benefit enormously. The positive experiences with the pilots are also very far- reaching. They lose fear of contact with the older generation and learn to interact with them in a casual and relaxed manner. The drivers can combine sporting activity with social commitment and also have important interpersonal experiences.' A 2019 impact study from Singapore found that nursing home residents experienced an increase in self-reported mood and outlook on life of 80% after 5 rides. Among young volunteers the report found a 36% increase in comfort level communicating and interacting with seniors. A 2020 study in Scotland also looked at the effects of the Cycling Without Age initiative on the mood and well-being of residents in senior citizens' facilities: \\"Analyses revealed significant improvements in mood and wellbeing at follow-up on ride days versus no ride days.\\" Reports in the media confirm the positive impacts of trishaw outings with seniors and their drivers: \\"It creates extraordinary experiences for them. They come out of that building and they get that wind in their hair and they are smiling from ear to ear.\\" \\"Many of the passengers talk about the joy of having the wind in their hair again. Some passengers have told me after a ride 'I am so happy' which makes me tear up!\\" Principles All trips with the senior citizens are always free. This is based on the five guiding principles of Cycling Without Age: * Generosity — donate time and kindness * Slowness — take time to sense the environment, be present in the moment and to meet and talk * Storytelling — listen and share the stories we hear from older adults before they are forgotten * Relationships — build trust, happiness and quality of life by creating relationships between generations, passengers and pilots, caregivers and family members * Without Age — let people age in a positive context aware of opportunities that lie ahead The trips with senior citizens' facilities are carried out by volunteers in their free time. The communication between the passengers and their pilots is very important, so a special type of trishaws is used where the passengers sit in front and can clearly hear what the pilot says, and where the pilots can easily understand their passengers' stories. This facilitates the development of relationship between passengers and pilots. By riding slowly and leisurely, they together experience and enjoy the landscape and cityscape along the chosen route intensively. Cycling Without Age thus supports the following Sustainable Development Goals, set in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly: * 3.4 — Promote mental health and well-being * 10.2 — Empower and promote the social inclusion of all irrespective of age * 11.2 — Provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all * 11.6 — Increase the number of cities and human settlement adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion Organization The umbrella organization of Cycling Without Age is a non- political, not-for-profit association with its place of business in Copenhagen, Denmark. It coordinates all world-wide activities, provides a Brand Book and a visual identity package, hosts web and IT infrastructure, consults with trishaw manufacturers, supports research and development, offers presentations and workshops, and publishes documentation about the initiative. Some countries — especially those with many local chapters — have formed a national umbrella organization. These umbrella organizations provide regional support to new and existing chapters by counseling, organizing events, providing country-specific social media channels and access to a research and knowledge bank, as well as training to staff, pilots and instructors. Sometimes, long excursions are organized by the regional organizations, for example, in 2014 from Odense (Denmark) to Hamburg (Germany), in 2015 from Rønde (Denmark) to Arendal (Norway), in 2019 along the Rhine river from the Lake Constance to Bonn (Germany). Local chapters may be organized at a specific senior citizens' facility, as community initiative, or by a local parish. Captains at each site are experienced pilots: they are responsible for the trishaw, organize the trips, recruit and train new pilots. There are different ways how chapters are organized, how they arrange the communication between pilots and their passengers, and how they finance the trishaw and its maintenance. Local chapters may have regular meetings, provide first-aid classes, and engage in public relations events.
