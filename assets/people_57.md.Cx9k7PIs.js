It was released in China by Beijing Enlight Pictures on August 19, 2016, in 2D and 3D. It is the sequel to the 2014 animated film Dragon Nest: Warriors' Dawn based on the video game Dragon Nest. Plot It is the wedding day of the Elf Queen Mayre, and Princess Liya (Ashley Boettcher) is excited to invite Little Fish (Ryan Potter). The queen allows Liya's request, though Liya's brother, the elf king to-be, disapproves. Meanwhile, at the site of an ancient battleground where the spirits of the many slain elves lurk, Meyla, a dark elf, tries to control the power of the Dark Stone of Death. Meyla, who is the sister of Queen Mayre, resurrects the spirits of the battlefield as her soldiers and gatecrashes the wedding ceremony. There, a quick fight takes place between the elves and Meyla, but the elves are unable to defeat her. Meyla attacks Mayre and asks for the Green Gem of Life. The queen was supposed to wear it on her wedding day, but Mayre foresaw the danger and gave it to Liya to hide and protect it. As Meyla fights with the queen for the gem, Little Fish fires an arrow with the bow gifted to him by Princess Liya. The arrow injures Meyla's hand. The angered Meyla corrupts the arrow with the magic of the Dark Gem and shoots back towards Little Fish, wounding him. As the magic of the Dark Gem enters his body, it begins corrupting Little Fish. Meyla is unable to find the Green Gem so she kidnaps Queen Mayre and demands it and a valuable elvish map as ransom in exchange for Queen Mayre. Little Fish and his friends assist Princess Liya and the elves in rescuing the queen and defeating the evil Meyla.

It was published in August 2010 by Basic Books of New York, and later that month by Tranquebar Press of Chennai.; The book examines the role in the famine, and subsequent partition of India in 1947, played by the policies and racial worldview of Winston Churchill, British prime minister from 1940‚Äì1945, during World War II. Mukerjee writes that the famine killed 1.5 million people according to the official estimate and three million according to most others. The book explores how, apart from the United Kingdom itself, British India became \\"the largest contributor to the empire's war‚Äîproviding goods and services worth more than ¬£2 billion.‚Äù Synopsis Mukerjee documents how colonial policies and negligence created conditions of acute famine and want in Bengal. Churchill's political and racial worldview meant that the British government would, per Lord Wavell, feed only those Indians who were ‚Äúactually fighting or making munitions or working some particular railways‚Äù. Besides Churchill, the book brings out another historical character close to Churchill who had a significant influence on him, Frederick Alexander Lindemann, Lord Cherwell. Known as \\"the Prof\\", Cherwell was an Anglo-German scientist with \\"Malthusian ideas\\" and a racist worldview of superiority over Indians, whom he would characterise as \\"helots‚Äù. India produced 600,000 miles of cotton fabric for British interests during the war, Mukerjee writes. Because of the shortfall and inflation this caused within India, the poorest were reduced to covering themselves with scraps or going naked. Women would have to stay indoors all day waiting for others to return with the single piece of cloth the family possessed. In 1942, as a result of the Japanese conquest of Burma that began that year, the British government introduced a \\"denial policy\\" in Bengal, a scorched earth policy designed to deny Japan access to food and transport should it invade Bengal. Mukerjee attributes the \\"scorched earth\\" approach to Churchill, who reportedly urged it on 14 November 1941. The \\"rice denial\\" policy saw soldiers confiscate and destroy rice deemed surplus; according to one journalist, thousands of tons of rice were thrown into the water in east Bengal. The \\"boat denial\\" policy saw 46,000 boats able to carry more than ten passengers confiscated; bicycles, carts and elephants were also taken. One British civil servant said the policy \\"completely broke the economy of the fishing class\\" in Bengal. Yet Churchill wrote after the war (a remark with which Mukerjee opens her prologue): \\"No great portion of the world population was so effectively protected from the horrors and perils of the World War as were the peoples of Hindustan [India]. They were carried through the struggle on the shoulders of our small island.\\"; While Bengal starved, food rationing in Britain was unpopular: \\"In the end,\\" Mukerjee writes, \\"it was not so much racism as the imbalance of power inherent in the social Darwinian pyramid that explains why famine could be tolerated in India while bread rationing was regarded as an intolerable deprivation in wartime Britain. Cherwell, for instance, did not think much of the British working class either, but he was deeply engaged in feeding it and placating it. Economist Amartya Sen observes that famine has never occurred in a functioning democracy‚Äîa form of government that inverts the traditional power structure by making rulers accountable to those whom they rule.\\" The book showcases another crucial point, namely that Hitler modelled his German empire on the British empire. He admired the English and wished \\"to emulate, not supplant, the British Empire: the German empire would comprise the Slavic countries to the east. As he saw it, the United Kingdom would retain its colonies but assume the role of Germany‚Äôs junior partner in world domination\\", and that Churchill's own beliefs on Britons being \\"a stronger race, a higher-grade race compared to the people Britain conquered, were not very different\\", according to Mukerjee. Reception In Economic and Political Weekly, anthropologist Felix Padel wrote that the book \\"makes clear the real economy of the Raj: not just blocking Indian manufacturing in cloth, etc, reducing India to mainly supplying raw cotton for British manufacturers, but also a grain drain in which Indian agricultural exports had become vital for Britain's economy.\\" The historian Chandak Sengoopta wrote in The Independent that Mukerjee had researched the famine with \\"forensic rigour\\": \\"Her calmly phrased but searing account of imperial brutality will shame admirers of the Greatest Briton and horrify just about everybody else.\\" Reviewing the book in The Sunday Times, Max Hastings wrote: \\"To put the matter brutally, millions of Indians were allowed to starve so that available shipping‚Äîincluding vessels normally based in India‚Äîcould be used to further British purposes elsewhere. When Churchill's nation was engaged in a desperate struggle, perhaps this reflected strategic logic. But it made nonsense of his post-war claims about upholding the interests of the Indian people, and indeed of the whole paternalistic ethic by which the empire sought to justify itself.\\" Hastings disagrees with Mukerjee on two points: he doubts that, as she wrote, the British were responsible for the 1945 plane crash that killed Subhas Chandra Bose, the Indian nationalist leader, and he argues that Churchill cannot be blamed for the 1947 partition of India. But he concludes that \\"the broad thrust of Mukerjee's book is as sound as it is shocking\\". In his book Hungry Bengal: War, Famine, Riots and the End of Empire (2015), the historian Janam Mukherjee argued that Churchill's Secret War belongs to the \\"nationalist mode of Indian historiography\\", but that it \\"nevertheless provides moving insight into the colossal indifference, and at times sheer spite, that characterized London's attitude toward starving Bengal\\". Shashi Tharoor's review in Time concluded: \\"Churchill said that history would judge him kindly because he intended to write it himself. The self-serving but elegant volumes he authored on the war led the Nobel Committee, unable in all conscience to bestow him an award for peace, to give him, astonishingly, the Nobel Prize for Literature‚Äîan unwitting tribute to the fictional qualities inherent in Churchill's self-justifying embellishments. Mukerjee's book depicts a truth more awful than any fiction.\\" Publication details  Further reading   Notes References External links *Churchill's Secret War at Penguin India 2010 non-fiction books Basic Books books Books about British India Books about imperialism British Empire in World War II History books about famine History of Bengal Winston Churchill ","title":"Churchill's Secret War"},{"id":"51366875","text":"The Native American Women's Health Education Resource Center (NAWHERC) is a non-profit organization that provides health resources to Native American women and also advocates for women's health, reproductive choices, economic issues and land and water rights. NAWHERC is first organization dedicated to women's health to open up on an Indian Reservation in the United States. Its agenda is \\"consistently broad\\" because NAWHERC does not separate women's issues from community issues. The organization was founded by Native Americans who lived on the Yankton Sioux reservation. Charon Asetoyer is the executive director and one of the original founders of NAWHERC. The organization is located in Lake Andes. NAWHERC has been a Ms. Foundation for Women grantee. NAWHERC also collaborates with the Indigenous Women's Network, and is part of the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective.  History  Charon Asetoyer and her husband, Clarence Rockboy set up the Native American Community Board (NACB) in 1985 on the Yankton Sioux reservation. Others involved with the initial founding were Everdale Jackie Rouse and Lorenzo Dion. The NACB was first located in the basement of Asetoyer's house. Asetoyer attended a conference in Washington, D.C. sponsored by the National Women's Health Network where Luz Alvarez urged her to seek donations to help create a larger center. In 1988 NACB created NAWHERC. A building was purchased on the reservation to house the center. The center for NAWHERC opened in February 1988. The NACB acts as the governing board of NAWHERC. The NAWHERC first tackled the issue of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) because of the high rate of FAS in the community. In 1990, NAWHERC organized \\"Empowerment Through Dialogue,\\" a gathering of 30 Native women representing 10 Nations in Pierre. From the three day gathering, an \\"Agenda for Native Women's Reproductive Rights\\" was created. This part of NAWHERC became known as the Reproductive Rights Coalition and by 1994 included 150 women from 26 different tribes. In 1991, NAWHERC opened a women's domestic violence shelter. The \\"Agenda for Native Women's Reproductive Rights\\", which includes calls for culturally and age-appropriate sex education, affordable health care, reproductive rights and other issues for Native women, is still used in discussions today.  Activities  NAWHERC runs a domestic violence shelter and has programs for AIDS prevention. They also provide programs about domestic violence, Dakota language and culture, and health and environmental awareness. NAWHERC also runs a hotline. NAWHERC collects information about Native women's health, often using a traditional Native American approach, the roundtable process. The roundtable becomes a safe-space where women are able to discuss issues they face. NAWHERC \\"has been prolific in producing research\\". NAWHERC has been active in reporting abuses in reproductive care and medication in the Native American community. In 2015, they reported that Indian Health Services (IHS) were not providing the emergency contraceptive, Plan B One-Step, which is non- compliant with the FDA guidelines of 2013. A year later, NAWHERC continued to advocate for to access Plan B One-Step at IHS facilities. Finally in 2015, the IHS created an updated policy for providing emergency contraceptive which the ACLU called a \\"long overdue and important step toward ensuring that Native American women have equal access to emergency contraceptive care.\\" NAWHERC advocates for Native women's rights across the country, however, its main focus is on the health of Native women living in the Aberdeen area which includes women living in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska.  Publications  The group published the Indigenous Women's Health Book, Within the Sacred Circle: Reproductive Rights, Environmental Health, Traditional Herbs and Remedies in 2004. Windspeaker called the book \\"well-organized and comprehensive\\", with issues about women's health written by Native women and including chapters about women who are two-spirited. In 2016, they released a guide called What To Do When You're Raped, a guide for Native girls which is free and provides advice and access to resources. The title of the book was specifically chosen by Asetoyer to read as \\"When You're Raped,\\" rather than \\"If You're Raped\\" because of the epidemic of sexual assaults on reservations today. Other educational materials, such as pamphlets, created by NAWHERC have relevant, up-to-date information and practical advice for women's health.

The tor is on private land and since 2003 access by the public has been banned, causing protests and mass trespassing by hikers and climbers. The tor The tor lies between Tavistock and Princetown on Dartmoor. There is a car park to the south of the B3357 road midway between Two Bridges and Tavistock. The tor is away. The tor rises from the moor. The peak is above sea level. It is a granite mass that appears to be made from rocks piled up on each other. The tor is the highest free-standing rock on Dartmoor. From some angles it is said to resemble the Sphinx. Others say it is a vixen and yet others say it looks like an old man with a cap on his head and his back to his wife. 27 rock climbing routes have been identified, but climbing, like walking, is banned. Legend of Vixana There is a legend that a witch named Vixana once lived in a cave at the foot of the tor that she had made the earth gnomes build for her. She was tall, bent and ugly. She delighted in calling up a mist to surround any traveller who passed the bog at the foot of the tor, so they would lose their way and be sucked down to their death. She met her fate when she tried to lure a handsome young man of the moor to his fate, but he had the power to see through the mist and to make himself invisible. He escaped and pushed the witch to her death on the rocks below the tor. Another version has the witch drowning in the bog into which she had lured so many people. Access controversy The land containing the tor has been owned privately since around 1970. A new owner bought of land around the tor in 2003, and at once closed all access to the landmark. She explained that her insurance company had told her she could be liable if walkers or climbers injured themselves on the tor. The Ramblers Association and British Mountaineering Council launched a campaign to publicise the issue, including a \\"mass trespass\\" of 20 people on 1 January 2004. A court found in June 2004 that the owner had made changes to unimproved grassland without obtaining permission, and fined the owner. A public inquiry found in January 2005 that the land was in fact farmland, and the court ruling was overturned in May 2005. Other groups became involved and arranged further protests. Devon County Council claimed that paths leading to the tor were in free public use from 1956 to 1976, and on that basis were public rights of way and should be reopened. However, in September 2011, a planning inspector ruled that there was insufficient evidence of use over an unbroken twenty-year period.

The film is loosely based on Marina and Sergey Dyachenko's 1996 fantasy novel The Ritual. The action takes place in a fictional fantasy world, which is a stylistic fusion of Ancient Russia with Scandinavian, Celtic and Eastern traditions. The plot is about Princess Miroslava being kidnapped by a dragon and carried away into his castle on a remote island. Mira is forced to leave everything behind, including her relatives. Now she is held captive by a mysterious young man named Arman, and an Aye-aye, but she does not know who he is and what is he doing on the island. He's a Dragon was released in Russia by Bazelevs Film Company on December 3, 2015 in RealD 3D. It was the highest- grossing Russian film at the international box office in 2016.  Plot  In the Kievan Rus' of European epics, the young Princess Miroslava (Maria Poezzhaeva), called Mira, is betrothed to Igor. Her father and sister Yaroslava think sh is immature because she still likes fairy tales and playing with toys. According to an ancient custom, Mira is placed on a boat deck in her wedding finery to be sent across the water to her future husband, Igor. As Igor pulls her boat toward him, his people sing an ancient wedding song. In the middle of the wedding, a dragon captures Mira. She is held prisoner in a cave where Mira meets a strange young man who cannot remember his name. Mira believes he is another prisoner and calls him Arman (Matvey Lykov). Soon, she discovers that Arman is the dragon who abducted her. He lives in human form, holding back the inner beast, but sometimes turns into a dragon against his will. As a dragon, Arman is unable to control himself. Arman shows Mira the island and a place for her to create a home. He tells her that male dragons had long lived on the island. As a dragon boy he had been allowed to choose whether to stay human or become a dragon. He chose to remain human until a dragon slayer killed his father. In his grief and rage, he became a dragon, gaining the knowledge of all dragons who had come before him. Realizing that dragons were truly monsters, Arman isolated himself on the island to prevent himself from killing humans. Sensing the uncontrollable transition to dragon form, he would go into the cave where the dragon could not escape and remain there until reverting to human form. He abducted Mira because of a ritual song sung at her wedding by villagers believing dragons to be extinct. The song caught Arman off guard and he did not have time to hide in the cave before responding to the song's summons. Arman wants to live as a man and crush his inner dragon because he is afraid of harming Mira. Mira talks with Arman and teaches him to live as a human. As they get to know one another, Arman and Mira fall in love although Mira is still afraid of the dragon. The island is bewitched so that only those who are loved by someone on the island can find the way to it. Because Mira's feelings toward Igor change as she falls in love with Arman, Igor searches futilely in a fog. Mira's fear of the dragon causes her to secretly prepare a boat in order to escape. Learning of her preparations, Arman despairs of ever being able to control the dragon and reveals to Mira what happened to the other dragon brides. Dragons brought the sacrificed girls to the island and burned them to death. From the ashes of each girl a new dragon boy was born. Arman orders Mira to leave so that she will avoid this fate. Without Mira, Arman does not know how to continue living. Mira returns home. While preparing again for her wedding with Igor, Mira realizes that she loves Arman and cannot live without him. While on the boat, Mira sings the ritual song to call the dragon. Arman hears the song as he is ending his life and changes into the dragon. He recaptures Mira and brings her to the island, intending to burn her. Mira does not show fear to the dragon and confesses her love for him. This allows Arman to finally control himself as a dragon. Years later, Mira and Arman are living together on the island with their daughter. Mira flies on her dragon-husband, who is no longer dangerous to her, and they live happily ever after. Cast Production =Development= He's a Dragon was the feature film directorial debut of Indar Dzhendubaev. To the post of director he was invited by Timur Bekmambetov, who acted as the main producer of the film. Filming took place in the Black Sea. According to the creators of the film, they have preserved much of the literary original, but at the same time brought new elements to the story. The film, 85% of which consisted of computer graphics, was drawn with the help of Russian computers. The posters for the film were created at a 16-hour photo shoot by the photographer Uldus Bakhtiozina. During shooting, only film cameras were used, and the resulting pictures were not subjected to any additional processing, which is an absolute rarity for posters of modern films. =Filming= Principal photography took place at the beginning that August 2014 in Bulgaria is the main scenes were shot on the Black Sea coast and in the picturesque Prohodna cave. Then the crew will go to the Black Sea coast, in the town of Sinemorets. The Bulgarian stage of filming will end on September 26, 2014, in December 2014 the remaining scenes will be shot in Moscow, Russia. In the Moscow Pavilions, the initial scenes were completed: the abduction of the main character, flying a dragon, scenes in his den and the finale. =Music= Also, a well-known Russian folk-rock band Melnitsa (ru) was invited to work on the soundtrack for the film, which recorded the song \\"Rite\\" (the name itself, like the text, is a direct reference to the literary source - the novel \\"The Ritual\\"), but for some for this reason, the producers did not include the song in the film (at least for the voice acting of the credits). = Post-production = The film‚Äôs special effects were worked by professionals from the CGF (ru) computer graphics studio, directed by Aleksandr Gorokhov, who had previously been involved in the production of such films. Release On November 24, 2015 in Moscow hosted the magnificent premiere on the stage of the Moscow cinema \\"October\\". The film was released in the Russian Federation by Bazelevs Film Company on December 3, 2015 and the world premiere of December 4, 2015. The film was released in the United States by 4Digital Media on 6 June 2017. =Marketing= The first trailer was released in the United States in April 2017. Reception =Box office= The film flopped at the Russian box office, collecting only $1.7 million (114 million rubles), and in view of rentals in other CIS countries ‚Äì $1.8 million, which is significantly less than the film's budget of $18 million. It, however, had great success at the Chinese box office, grossing , making it the most successful film in China in the history of Russian cinema. It was the overall highest-grossing Russian film at the international box office in 2016. =Critical response= The film was met with mixed reviews. Such publications as Film.ru, The Hollywood Reporter, Izvestia and Afisha, responded positively to the film. Boris Ivanov, film critic of Film.ru, stated: \\"From whatever angle you look at it, the Hollywood movie \\"Twilight\\" seems like an amateur performance in comparison to \\"I am Dragon\\". Even the computer effects in the Russian production are more convincing. From the point of view of the genre, this is an almost impeccable \\"feminine\\" romantic fantasy.\\" Dmitry Ostashevsky, Russian film critic of The Hollywood Reporter, stated: \\"The computer animation and 3D graphics are so good that you begin to regret that such a cool dragon (that is, by the way, recognised as the most technologically complex virtual character in the whole history of Russian cinema) was chosen for the genre of melodrama and not blockbuster.\\" Others, in particular Mir Fantastiki, Weburg, and Kino-Teatr, rated it as average. \\"Rossiyskaya Gazeta\\" defeated the film, calling it \\"unimaginably boring\\", and the script \\"delusional\\".

(2012)We Are The Economy! (2012)https://www.tagblatt.ch/wirtschaft/was-unternehmen-unterschaetzen- ld.761384 and Rise of the Digital Tribal Society (2016).Rise of the Digital Tribal Society (2016) In his 2012 book, he describes an economic philosophy of ‚ÄòEconomy 3.0‚Äô‚ÄòEconomy 3.0‚Äô as a principle of need satisfaction and a new way of working together that reflects this fundamental change. Economy 3.0 is an economy that is decentrally controlled by people. Put simply, Economy 1.0 can be described as agriculture. The Economy 2.0 is the industrial society and Economy 3.0 is the service society. Each economy level includes shares of the others. The significant difference is this: Economy 2.0 was about eliminating scarcity. In Economics 3.0, the goal is to deal with the abundance. Fiechter has the vision of a future global economic and social order, defined by a transparent digital barter society, based on reciprocity, equality, and cooperation instead of competition. Based on the ‚ÄòEconomy 3.0‚Äô theory Fiechter invented a management-, strategy- and controlling-methodology for human- centered corporate management. Furthermore, Fiechter is the founder of the ISG Institute in St. Gallen and General Director of M&H; Equity AG, an private equity investment company that operates internationally and with a unique methodology that can identify risks and potentials in companies based on the soft factors. For the Carlo Foundation, by the Liechtenstein government, he developed a rating approach for the sustainable rating and valuation of financial products. On behalf of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce, he developed the hidden champion 3.0 award, which rates export-oriented companies according to the rating criteria of the economy 3.0.https://www.wko.at/service/aussenwirtschaft/fresh-view-2015-special- edition-austrias-hidden-champions.pdf Fiechter has been involved with his project Peerworld of the Clinton Global Initiative since 2016. Early life Fiechter was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina on April 30, 1972. He is the son of Beat Fiechter, Ursula Fiechter. He has a sister Natalia born 1976. In the early eighties, Fiechter and his family fled Argentina because of the threat by the Argentinian putschists. The family returned to Switzerland. Integrating into Swiss schooling and culture was difficult for Fiechter, and he began to distrust authorities categorically. Fiechter's negative experiences with institutionalized education influenced his interest in Adaptive Learning, as stated in his book; We Are The Economy! (2012). In it, Fiechter advocates individualized lifelong learning that ‚Äúdevelops constructive critical thinking and individual development.‚Äù Fiechter is opposed to factory-like, mass training without regard for the individual. He states that in order to adapt to the changing digitalization of the world, education will have to shift away from standardization and towards fostering individual creativity and innovation. Career Fiechter's beliefs are strongly influenced by constructionist philosophies, particularly Heinz von Foerster's work on self- organizing systems. Fiechter's core interests lie in the relationships and social exchanges that take place while the needs of the stakeholders within the system are being satisfied. In 2008 Fiechter founded the ISG Institute in St. Gallen, a Swiss-based think-tank known for developing methodology and tools (based on empirical research) that enable companies to measure and report on ‚Äúsoft factors‚Äù and individual preferences such as values, ideals, psychological motivations and attitudes of customers, employees, management and other stakeholders.http://www.isg-institut.ch/wordpress/wp- content/uploads/VSMS-FiechterOglesby.pdf The methodologies see companies as complex social organizations; and thus integrate intangible nonfinancial assets with traditional financial assets in valuation analysis. Companies can therefore measure and report (in real time) how soft factors impact financial performance. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) http://www.wissen.org/wp- content/uploads/2018/05/immaterielle_werte_hz-20070502.pdf and Ernst & Young (EY), have adopted Fiechter's tools as part of their client solutions. The ‚ÄòHidden Champion 3.0 Award‚Äô of the Austrian Ministry of Commerce is based on this methodology (see Hidden Champions). In 2009, the Swiss economist and winner of the Swiss Innovation Prize (1983) Prof. Dr. Cuno P√ºmpin partnered with the ISG Institute. The collaboration proved that management makes more sound and objective decisions when implementing ISG-methodology (including qualitative and quantitative facts). Fiechter's belief in the ‚ÄúStakeholder Value Management‚Äù approach (versus the ‚ÄúFinancial Value Management‚Äù) is the basis for his Economy 3.0 philosophy. In the Economy 3.0 the purpose of a company or organization is to produce value for every stakeholder involved‚Äîcustomers, employees, shareholders, suppliers, local communities, even the society at large. In contrast, the ‚ÄúShareholder Value Movement‚Äù focuses solely on maximizing profits and maximizing the value of a company for certain stakeholders. In Fiechter's opinion, the Shareholder Value movement contributed substantially to the 2008 world financial crisis. He believes that the shareholder value movement has reached its limits and that advancing communication technologies, digitalization and the emergence of peer-to-peer networks can shift the balance of power towards individuals. He foresees a new economic order wherein networks of clients and stakeholders collaborate and co-create for the betterment of society. Economy 1.0 and 2.0 Economy 3.0 is a new economic system that is described in the book ‚ÄòWe are the Economy!‚Äô by Oliver Fiechter. In cooperation with tech entrepreneurs, politicians and artists, Oliver Fiechter had developed 33 theses which later constituted the basis of that book. In order to understand Economy 3.0, one needs to understand the economic systems that preceded it, as well as the key differences between Economies 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. Economy 1.0 is the first economic system that is based on money. It marks the beginning of large scale industry and its goal is dealing with the fundamental problem of physical scarcity. Basic needs like food, water and clothing have to be satisfied. The demand is significantly higher than the supply, so the size of the market is determined by the supply side, which mainly consists of small businesses that focus on satisfying local needs. The driving force of Economy 1.0 is development and the system is controlled by the state. Economy 2.0 is not just about survival anymore; its participants are longing for material wealth. An increase in efficiency leads to more supply, which brings supply and demand into alignment and therefore increases the power of the consumer. The average size of enterprises increases ‚Äì which is one of the reasons for increased efficiency ‚Äì and enterprise management is concentrated in the hands of a few. Furthermore, the realization of the ego becomes the driving force of the system; the individual wants to be unique. Since the needs of the customers are more or less equal, whether or not a need can be satisfied depends on the financial possibilities of the individual. In this economy, success is assessed through profit, respectively the lack thereof. Economy 3.0 ‚ÄúThe imperative of Economy 3.0 is called intellectualization, this means that a community is to empower its members to reflexive thinking and acting.‚Äù In Economy 3.0, the third sector ‚Äì the service sector ‚Äì dominates. There is an abundance of physical and material goods, which is why the exchange of intangibles in order to increase intangible prosperity becomes the primary focus of the system. The demand for efficiency and size is replaced by a demand for creativity and empathy. Intangible needs are highly individual and cannot be satisfied through mass production. In order to fulfill a customer need, an enterprise needs to know what exactly the need is and how it can be fulfilled. The gap between producer and consumer shrinks; the consumer turns into a co-producer. New forms of relationships between organizations and stakeholders are required, the interaction becomes more important than the transaction. Digitalization leads to a new kind of knowledge society because the internet makes it possible for everyone to contribute and access knowledge. ‚ÄúThe basis of the new creation of the economy is through dematerialization.‚Äù Dematerialization changes the needs as well as the means to satisfy the needs. The physical world is losing importance, whereas the non-physical world is becoming more and more relevant; the material world is turning into an intangible world. Corporate management in Economy 3.0 works according to the principles of self-organization. The metaphor of the swarm can be used to explain these principles. ‚ÄúSwarms function without central control, solely by the cooperation of individual agents that interact loyally with each other and are equal to each other.‚Äù A swarm forms, whenever a group of people pursues the same task. Successful swarms require a commitment to self-organization, indirect cooperation, access to a wide variety of knowledge and it has to be able to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Since there is no one giving instructions, tools like knowledge competitions ‚Äì where different approaches are compared and assessed ‚Äì need to be used to increase the quality of decisions. When enterprises function according to the swarm principle, this leads to a decentralization of management, which leads to a new, more equal distribution of power. As beneficial as the swarm principle may seem, there is one thing that needs to be taken into consideration: the so-called knowledge paradox. More available knowledge leads to better processes due to better information. However, having knowledge that no one else has means having power, which incentivizes individuals to keep knowledge to themselves. The knowledge paradox arises due to lack of knowledge about the behavior of others. Communicative integration and information transparency can help to avoid it. The characteristics of Economy 3.0 are transparency, digitality and reciprocity. Like any new system, it has new rules and creates new winners and losers. Five new rules that can be derived are that one needs to self-reflect and network. Additionally, one needs to be transparent, offer dematerialized value and take part in the new, decentralized control possibilities. The winners of Economy 3.0 can be separated into two categories: the digital and the creative. Who the digital are is quite self- explanatory; due to digitalization, the distances between two countries is virtually nonexistent. The world is designated as flat and individuals are separated into different segments on the internet according to their identity. The digital are the ones who are able to cope with this and use it to their advantage. The creative are able to interpret and reinterpret knowledge, products, processes and systems. They think critically and question existing conditions and premises. Closely related to the creative are people with high human capital. Their main task is storing and managing knowledge. They understand, collect and document existing knowledge. People with high human capital have received a high formal education and collaborating with them is desirable for others. The losers of Economy 3.0 are difficult to determine. Whether the winners of Economy 2.0 constitute the losers of 3.0 depends on their focus and whether or not they accept the change. The most apparent thing the winners of Economy 2.0 are going to want to focus on is trying to hold on to the old system. ‚ÄúThe winners of Economy 2.0 will use their weapons so that the old power relations remain alive. This is achieved by the old system remaining alive, the old conventions being declared as irreversible and the previous central control mechanisms being maintained.‚Äù However, if they master the rules of Economy 3.0 or if they are able to manipulate their weapons so that the rules of Economy 2.0 still lead to success, they may become winners of Economy 3.0. Education of Economy 2.0 works according to the key principle of its economy: efficiency. It can be compared to a trivial process; input is offered and a clear output is expected; the individuality of the learners is ignored. Future educational systems should be systems that accompany people over their entire lives and embrace the individuality of those learning. They should allow creativity and unpredictability; strengths should be discovered and promoted. ‚ÄúAs a result of modified education, people become less able to be influenced, less able to be manipulated, less able to be controlled from the outside.‚Äù Measuring systems of today, most importantly GDP, measure success according to the principles and goals of Economy 2.0. In new economic systems, we need new indicators to evaluate the prosperity and well-being of states. Instead of only measuring quantitative indicators like financial profit, emotional indicators like the happiness and the health of a society should be integrated into our calculations of success. Instead of calling it Economy 4.0,http://isig.science/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/isig- oekonomie40_2019-10-14.pdf ‚ÄòWe are the Economy!‚Äô refers to the economy following Economy 3.0 as Synchronomy. Synchronomy is a neologism made up of synchronization and economy. This new system overcomes the logic of scarcity; it is replaced by the logic of abundance. The tangible needs are already satisfied; the system is entirely devoted to the intangible. Enterprises only exist as synchronization platforms where people who produce certain benefits and people who want to receive those benefits meet and form ‚Äòcommunities‚Äô. A community dissolves, once the particular need is satisfied. In Synchronomy, the features of the markets that are characteristic in Economy 3.0 ‚Äì virtuality, transparency and reciprocity ‚Äì gain importance. Dematerialization continues, the principle of exchange and ‚Äòinteraction instead of transaction‚Äô are in the foreground. Hierarchies are replaced by networks. There is a complete decentralization of the structure, development and management of enterprises; they are fully in the hands of the stakeholders. Instead of having executives, communities rely on direct communication and swarm intelligence. The central task of the dematerialized enterprises in Synchronomy is to act as knowledge centers that store, develop and redistribute knowledge. Physical work loses relevance because it can be delegated to robots and avatars. In the decentralized system of Synchronomy, every person has equal value. This means, that every single one of us is responsible for the well-being of the economy and the welfare of society. ‚ÄúSynchronomy is only possible if people have a high level of education and recognize their social, political and economic responsibility.‚Äù Individuals need to be willing to reflect on personal and social goals as well as on their identities. There are three hurdles in the way of realizing the ideas of Synchronomy. The first one is the educational system. It should promote the individuality as well as the self-reflection of those learning and accompany people over their entire lives. The second hurdle is the mistaken belief that the mass is always right. Structures that make the implementation of self- defeating ideas harder need to be created. The third hurdle is overcoming the monetary system. Synchronomy is a modern exchange economy; it should return to a system of reciprocal exchange. Measuring systems of today, most importantly GDP, measure success according to the principles and goals of Economy 2.0. In new economic systems, we need new indicators to evaluate the prosperity and well-being of states. Instead of only measuring quantitative indicators like financial profit, emotional indicators like the happiness and the health of a society should be integrated into our calculations of success. 33 Thesis Based on the Economy 3.0, Fiechter developed 33 theses for the digital age. These theses are addressed to creative sense workers who want to live consciously and environmentally friendly: 1\\\\. Economy‚Äôs objective is the satisfaction of our needs. 2\\\\. We all are at the heart of economy. A large part of our everyday lives is about economic actions, be it as consumer, as employee of a company, as shareholder at the stock exchange or as part of the community that defines the political parameters of the economy. 3\\\\. In order to get the economic system up and running, it needs us as we perform the central functions of the economic system together on a daily basis. 4\\\\. Bit by bit, the winners and losers of our economic system become apparent. 5\\\\. The capitalistic system is in a big crisis, having not yet found the road towards renewal. 6\\\\. Due to its maximization approach, the guild of economists bears the responsibility that economy has dehumanized and disconnected from our needs. 7\\\\. Nowadays, economic theory does not correspond with our perceived reality at all. 8\\\\. Current riots around the globe are one result thereof. 9\\\\. We are all asked to change economy. 10\\\\. It is up to us to improve economy and there by improve the living conditions of millions of people. 11. Economy has not dropped from the sky. It is no natural phenomenon against which we as humans are powerless. 12\\\\. We believe that it is our collective emotions that form the economic system. 13\\\\. The creative control over the development of economic theories shall no longer rest with the competence of academies, chairs and elites. 14\\\\. We are the power. We must only think from a common point of view as a WE and no longer rely on the leaders of this world. 15\\\\. The leaders need us more than we need them. 16\\\\. The new Economy 3.0 establishes a new system of thought and values, which allows us greater freedom but, on the other hand, more social responsibility. 17\\\\. Pure transaction oriented mass consumption will decrease. We will buy more products that precisely correspond to our identity. 18\\\\. The internet is developing new rules and thereby creates new winners and new losers. 19\\\\. We respect the following four rules: I. reflect yourself II.network yourself III. share your knowledge IV. participate at decentralized control options. 20\\\\. The network helps us to better reflect about us and our needs by means of a dialog with others. 21. The network helps to bring our needs in line with the companies‚Äô value propositions. 22\\\\. Social networks like Facebook,Twitter, YouTubeand othersincrease the ability to influence, to actively participate and join in the discussion again. We have regained the autonomy over economic processes that have previously been controlled by the companies. 23\\\\. The internetfully involves us and makes us participants. 24\\\\. We do not want any ready-made matters any more. 25\\\\. We do not need anybody who explains the world to us; we rather want to play an active role in the development of our consumer products. 26\\\\. We ask to be involved and to co-design something actively instead of consuming passively. 27\\\\. Social networks are about to break up the structures of our capitalistic system step by step. 28\\\\. CEOs and managers underestimate the political power of social affairs of in the internet. 29\\\\. New types of consumption will be created that put emphasis on the use and functions of a product and less emphasis on its material possession. 30\\\\. Once use has become more important than possession, money will lose its impact and as a consequence, social power structures will change fundamentally. 31\\\\. We are living in a kind of twilight zone in which the battle for the future is raging. We are witnessing the struggle between the forces of centralization and decentralization. 32\\\\. Large companies and established organizations have a hard time finding the right approach to get us involved. 33\\\\. There is no question whether the revolution is about to begin or not; the question is how we are going to face it: anarchy or structured change. Bibliography * ‚ÄúWe are the Economy!

Telemundo's financial turnaround is mainly due to the decision to produce its own novelas, realities and series in the U.S., a factor credited to Santana's influence.Por John Consoli: Latin Influence: Meet the executives and icons shaping the massive, and growing, Hispanic media market AdWeek 28 de Junio de 2011  Tepuy International  Santana began his career in the legal department of French telecommunications company Sofretu. In 1987, he co- founded the production and distribution company Tepuy International to sell formats, cartoons, series and telenovelas and other Spanish-language content in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America. Tepuy International began making and distributing documentaries and animated shows, but soon branched into telenovelas. The company found a niche between larger distributors like Televisa and TV Globo to bring Hispanic shows, mostly telenovelas, to the European market. An early success was Santana's obtaining the distribution rights in 1993 to several popular Colombian telenovelas from RTI Colombia, Coestrellas, Jes, Caracol and selling them in Europe, Asia, Africa and other parts of South America. In 1994, Tepuy with office's in Caracas, Madrid and Roma moved its headquarters to South Florida, eventually settling in Miami, a main hub of Hispanic television in the United States. Tepuy entered the market at the beginning of the boom in telenovelas and influenced the increasing sophistication of the genre produced by smaller independents by internationalizing the casts and accents and increasing production quality. In its first decade, Tepuy became a mainstay of the telenovela industry, successfully selling the traditionally Latin American product worldwide. The company also successfully pitched remakes of telenovelas, such as Mirada de Mujer, a 1997 Mexican remake of a 1990 Venezuelan storyline. As head of Tepuy, Santana was active in the hands-on creation and selection of many successful television projects with companies such as Telemundo-NBC, RTI, Disney, Sony, Caracol TV, Argos, Endemol, Gestmusic, Imagina, Televen, and Televisi√≥n Nacional de Chile, among others. He created and executed numerous co- production agreements with some of the most prestigious companies in the global television market, setting new industry standards. Tepuy's successful collaboration with RTI Colombia led to the company becoming Telemundo's internacional distribution partner. In 2005, Santana was approached by Telemundo president Don Browne to head program development at Telemundo Studios in Miami.Anna Marie de la Fuente \\"Telemundo takes on RTI unit, distrib\\" Variety NOVEMBER 28, 2006 In 2006, Telemundo acquired Tepuy and brought the entire company in-house in January 2007 as Telemundo Internacional, with Santana as President. \\"Entrevista ‚Äì Marcos Santana, Presidente y CEO de Tepuy International\\" Cine Y Tele May 15, 2003 Daniel Shoer-Roth \\"Novel Approach\\" The Miami Herald - December 16, 2003\\"Telemundo acquires Tepuy International & 100% of Telemundo-RTI Productions.\\" HispanicAd.com October 28, 2006 \\"Telemundo Reorganizes Studio Operations\\" HispanicAd.com.

The moors are asserted to be of national importance by Natural England for the extent, quality and diversity of upland types including heaths, fens, wet grassland, flushes, mires and blanket bogs, together creating an extensive mosaic habitat supporting an exceptional community of amphibians. The moors are important, too, for their relict juniper woodland and scrub. Designated in 2010, Bewick and Beanley Moors incorporates within its boundaries two now denotified SSSIs, Hannah's Hill, Harehope (first notified in 1968) and Quarryhouse Moor Ponds (first notified in 1986). Location and natural features Bewick and Beanley Moors, as defined for the purposes of the SSSI, are three distinct and non-contiguous moorland areas in north Northumberland, located to the north and north-west of Alnwick, and to the south-east of Wooler, extending to about north to south, and up to east to west. The moors are to the west of the A1, east of the A697 and south of the B6348 roads. The southernmost section, south-east of Beanley, south of Eglingham and the B6346 road, and north of Bolton and Titlington, is an irregularly shaped area of moorland, some north to south, and east to west. It is composed of, from the west, Titlington Pike, a round hill rising from circa to above sea level; Titlington and Beanley Plantations and Beanley Moss, wetlands falling gently to the east from about to ; Beanley Moor, making up the majority of the area, wetlands falling very slowly from to before descending to about at Kimmer and Huntersheugh Crags, a semicircle escarpment of steeply descending land with rock outcrops; and Kimmer Lough, a ovaloid kettle hole - a deep pond formed in the void remaining after a submerged glacial calf block melted - at circa above sea level. Kimmer Crags, at the centre of the area, is north-east of Alnwick and south of Eglingham. The middle and largest section, north of Eglingham and south-east of Chillingham and Hepburn, extends to some north to south, and east to west, and is composed in the south of Bewick Moor, in the north west, Hepburn Moor and in the north east, Quarryhouse Moor, which rise from about in the south-east at Harehope in a series of escarpments to a wetland plateau area starting at about with Cateran Hill, a local peak, at the centre. At the far north west, the site includes Ross Castle, a hill just east of Chillingham Castle. Cateran Hill - notable locally for the Cateran Hole - is about north of Eglingham. The northernmost section, situated on the east-falling slopes of moors from east of Chillingham and south of the B6348 road, is again irregularly shaped, extending some north to south, and east to west. It is composed of parts of Chatton Moor in the north, Sandyford Moor in the centre and to the south-east, Rossbrough Moor and Wandylaw Bog; the site incorporates part of Wandylaw Wind Farm, and the Chatton transmitting station. The moors rise very slowly from about and at the eastern boundary, to a number of local maxima ranging from to . Vegetation Bewick and Beanley Moors sit on fell sandstone of the Border Group, falling from in the west to in the east, and are a nationally important example of a mosaic of habitats supporting a wide range of vegetation types associated with the transition from lowand to upland moors. The SSSI citation for the moors defines the principal vegetation and describes a number of specific landforms and transitional areas occurring throughout the site which give rise to specific local flora communities. The dominant flora of the site is characterised as a wet heath composed of heather (Calluna vulgaris), purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea), cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), deergrass (Trichophorum cespitosum), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and tormentil (Potentilla erecta), and occasional bog-moss (Sphagnum capillifolium). A repeated feature of the moors, notably found in the central parts of Bewick Moor and at Beanley Moss, are bogs formed in the depressions and basins abounding throughout the site, and on flat land found on higher ground above valleys. The bogs - waterlogged peat accumulations - fall in type between basin mires and blanket bogs, and are an important factor in the significance of the site on their own account, as they transition to other landforms, and because they are the easternmost examples in Britain of such habitats. Bog sites on the moors give rise to heather, cross-leaved heath, common and hare‚Äôs-tail cotton-grasses (Eriophorum angustifolium and E. vaginatum) amongst a variety of bog-mosses including (Sphagnum papillosum), (S. capillifolium) and (S. magellanicum). Less common are crowberry (Empetrum nigrum ssp. nigrum), cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccos), bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum) and round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia). Transitional bogs sites of the sort found on the moors, within heathland, are uncommon and give rise to noteworthy flora. At a bog site west of Cateran Hill there is a transition into a fen supporting bottle-sedge (Carex rostrata), marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris), and the bog-moss (Sphagnum fallax). A Quarryhouse Moor example shows a transition from bog to an area of purple moor-grass, bottle sedge, star and carnation sedges (Carex echinata andC. panicea), bog-moss (Sphagnum palustre), and related species. Watercourses across the site support soft or sharp-flowered rush (Juncus effusus and J. acutiflorus), haircap moss (Polytrichum commune), and occasional associated flora such as star-sedge, marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle vulgaris) and bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata). Rich wetlands occur especially at the east of the moors and have species mixes arising in part out of the effects of a limestone understratum dominated by purple moor-grass with, in less-grazed areas, bog-myrtle (Myrica gale), and in more-grazed areas, cross-leaved heath and tormentil, with sweet vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus), compact rush (Juncus conglomeratus), sneezewort (Achillea ptramica), marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre) and wild angelica (Angelica sylvestris), and limestone indicators including carnation, glaucous and flea sedges (Carex panicea, C. flacca and C. pulicaris), fen bedstraw (Galium uliginosum), tufted vetch (Vicia cracca) and moss (Hylocomium splendens). The site has local wetland areas strongly influenced by limestone characterised by marsh valerian (Valeriana dioica), butterwort (Pinguicula vulgaris), lesser club-moss (Selaginella selaginoides), grass-of-Parnassus (Parnassia palustris), dioecious sedge (Carex dioica), few- flowered spike-rush (Eleocharis quinqueflora) and black bog-rush (Schoenus nigricans). Dry limestone flora are for the most part not found on the moors, with the exception of areas of mat-grass (Nardus stricta). Rocky outcrops on the site, when accompanied by free draining soil, provide habitat for heather, bilberry and bell-heather (Erica cinerea), with local dry-heath cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) and petty-whin (Genista anglica). Lesser twayblade (Listera cordata) is found in association with old collapsing heather bushes. Conifer plantations aside, the moors have little woodland cover; what exists is found on the boundaries and following the paths of streams at lower elevations. Spwecies include alder (Alnus glutinosa), hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), brown birch (Betula pubescens), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and occasional ash (Fraxinus excelsior), and ground-cover of yellow pimpernel (Lysimachia nemorum), wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella) and smooth-stalked sedge (Carex laevigata). As with the bogs, so the woodland also provide transition locations, such as from wet birch-wood to purple moor-grass or to bogs of lesser pond-sedge (Carex acutiformis). Other wood species found include scrubs of eared sallow (Salix aurita), acid oakwood (Quercus petraea), and, notably one of the largest stands of juniper (Juniperus communis ssp. communis) in the county at Hannah's Wood, west of Eglingham. Kimmer Lough, the largest of the many waterbodies across the moors, supports yellow water-lily (Nuphar lutea) and reed (Phragmites communis), surrounded by a willow woodland with bog- myrtle. Quarryhouse Moor Ponds, to the north-east of the middle section of the site, is notable as habitat for amphibians including great crested, palmate and smooth newts (Triturus cristatus, T. helveticus and T. vulgaris), the common frog (Rana temporaria) and the common toad (Bufo bufo). Additional notable features of the site are the presence of the large heath butterfly (Coenonympha tullia), the upland bird population, and stands of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) with chickweed wintergreen (Trientalis europaea). ;Condition Bewick and Beanley Moors SSSI is divided into 25 units for monitoring purposes. Inspecations in 2009 and 2014 find the condition of the majority of units to be 'unfavourable-recovering', with over-grazing and unfavourable heather-burning regimes being the main causal issues.

opponent of America's military involvement in Viet Nam and was the founding co-chairman and national coordinator of The National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam. He is the first cousin, once removed, of Trump advisor Jason Greenblatt and Canadian religious leader and Holocaust educator Eli Rubenstein Early life Greenblatt was born in Debrecen, Hungary and was a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps in Germany and Austria until his release with the end of the war. He moved to the United States with his parents Julius and Pessie in 1949. Education He studied at Yeshiva Chaim Berlin, then attended Brooklyn College, then Yale, where he received his Phd in Mathematics in 1963, at the age of 25, under American mathematician William Schumacher Massey (a remarkable feat for a child Holocaust survivor who immigrated to the U.S after the war at 11 years of age, considering the average Phd is achieved at 33 years of age.) Activism Greenblatt became an assistant professor of Mathematics at Cornell University where he met Bruce Dancis, the first student to tear up his draft card and send it back to the draft board. In 1966, Greenblatt became very involved in the anti war movement and organized a series of teach-ins in order to \\"educate Americans about the tragic errors of our Vietnam policies.\\" He was also vice president of their sponsoring organization, the Inter-University Committee for Debate on Foreign Policy A large part of his focus was encouraging all white college students to drop-out of school so as not to be a part of draft deferments which discriminate against African Americans who are too poor to get a higher education. He left his post at the university to devote himself full-time to the cause. He said \\"I am a former professor of mathematics, that was before I became a drop-out.\\" He instructed white students saying, \\"Take a few courses, but not enough to qualify as a full-time student and be deferred. You have better things to do.\\" In June 1966, Greenblatt was ordered to jail for his activities but was released soon after. He was one of the chief organizers of the Spring Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam, scheduled for both New York City and San Francisco on April 15, 1967. Organizers had expected only 150,000 but estimates showed between 300,000 and 400,000 attended. On October 21, Greenblatt was an organizer of a march on The Pentagon. It was purposely arranged for a weekend because \\"We checked that out and found that 25,000 people work in the Pentagon during the week. But most of these are secretarial and clerical personnel. The 7,000 who work on week-ends are the people we want to reach. They are the decision-making military men, and for them, war-making is a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week occupation.\\" In 1968, Greenblatt and another academic went to Hanoi with another academic and author Susan Sontag. She wrote a journal of the trip for Esquire Magazine. House of Un-American Activities Committee In 1969 Greenblatt was subpoenaed by The House Un- American Activities Committee who seized a large quantity of documents and forced him to testify. Charges were eventually dropped \\"but not before HUAC's autumnal carnival\\" in the words of the Village Voice. Greenblatt‚Äôs cross examination was led by Richard Howard Ichord Jr. last chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Greenblatt was defended by prominent civil rights lawyer Sanford M. Katz. Greenblatt was quite combative with the committee, arguing that their actions were reminiscent of the fascist tendencies he had escaped from in Nazi occupied Europe. \\"I will tell you when I came to this country. After spending several years in ghettos, in repressive institutions in Hungary and Germany‚Ä¶..I spent several years in ghettos in Hungary. I spent years in concentration camps in Germany under the most blatant kind of Fascist rule ‚Äî which again, and at that time, was justified, in the name of protecting the security of the countries then involved. It was at that time justified as a way of separating out the people that were endangering the security of that country, and I may remind the Chair that ultimately the people who were so described were exterminated.‚Äù \\"I came to the United States when I had had enough of that kind of fascism and thought I could meet with a different kind of condition in this country‚Ä¶The country is the country of Hungary, at a time when fascism was rising in Hungary and at a time when this kind of intimidation was at approximately the same stage as it seems to be in the events surrounding these hearings..\\" ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶there are many millions of people in this country who are opposed to this Government policy, that this country not be labeled in the eyes of all the world as simply a repetition of other countries, the names of which, when I mentioned them the other day, for some reason the chairman became very concerned about, that there is not hopefully a repetition of Germany of the 1940s and not simply a repetition of Hungary in the l930‚Äôs and 1940s‚Äôs, which is still possible in this country, and with the people in this country who will fight this kind of genocidal war in Vietnam \\". He also expressed concern for his own physical safety and that of fellow activists, including Abbie Hoffman, who was arrested entering the House of Representatives after being subpoenaed, even refusing to testify until he could be assured of Hoffman's well being. Mr. Greenblatt: ‚ÄúMr. Chairman‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I want to make it absolutely clear that I came to Washington, I came to these committee hearings, despite reservations and the very strong feeling that I have about them, as I indicated earlier, with the full intention of testifying and responding to any questions that may be put to me about my own actions, about my own activities, although I do feel and feel very strongly that I am not legally, morally, and constitutionally under an obligation to do so for reasons that have been cited by counsel and that I have tried to cite myself. I am still willing, perfectly willing, to go forward with this attempt to testify, although I will not be willing to testify about actions and activities of other people. I will be willing to testify about my own actions and my own activities because I am proud of them. However, as I tried to indicate earlier, I am very concerned about the general atmosphere in which these hearings are being conducted, both inside and outside this hearing room. I am very concerned about the kind of actions that the committee and law enforcement officers, or people who should be enforcing the law, have taken against myself, attorneys, other witnesses, colleagues of mine that have appeared or tried to appear before this committee‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. And I must say at this time, specifically, that the greatest outrage was reached in the last few days when, in fact, one of my colleagues, one of my brothers, was physically assaulted outside this committee. Until I know the whereabouts and the well-being (Cut off by Chairman‚Ä¶) It is difficult for me to answer the question when one of these seven people who have been subpoenaed to this hearing was arrested for trying to walk into the hearing room and trying to walk into the building in which this hearing room is located. I find it very difficult, indeed, to be responsive under those kinds of circumstances of intimidation and of use of force. Mr. Ichord. And you are going to refuse to answer on those grounds? Mr. Greenblatt. I am unwilling to testify until I know that these kinds of tactics will no longer be employed, until I have some kind of assurance as to the well-being of Mr. Hoffman. Later life In later life, Robert became the president of the Brooklyn chapter of Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life. One of his children, Brooklyn artist Jeremiah Grunblatt, died in a car crash on his honeymoon in October 2015, three days after his wedding. Quotes ‚ÄúWe are surrounded by the explosions of discontent and fear, resulting from long-term exploitation and neglect. The myths of the past, used to camouflage oppressive racial and class structures, are disintegrating faster than new ones can be erected in their place. Political nostrums, social science jargon and rehashed ideological rhetoric about equality and opportunity continue to be hawked on the television street corner of America, but they seem only vaguely related to the events around us. Unreal leaders in electronic boxes appear before us as little gray mannequins, speaking into the wind words that they have not written to people they cannot see about problems they do not know.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe myths changed and grew ever more grandiose with each new need for rationalization. The frontier spirit and self-reliance, manifest destiny, laissez faire, free enterprise and the great melting pot: these are the tombstones of a people enslaved, another exterminated and the waves of immigrants neglected, exploited and digested. But some of the victims refuse to die. And as they begin to stir, shaking the foundations of a society built upon their premature graves, we find the cracks and fissures everywhere, breaking through the plaster of egalitarian myths, exposing the truly stabilizing factors: the interdependence of parasitic relationships, the vested interests of the middle class and the coercive power of the state controlled by a corporate ruling elite. Societies and men have ever been mesmerized by such exploitive myths, not only because of their charismatic force but because of the primacy of man‚Äôs social character. ‚Äú ‚ÄúBut the myths of the melting pot, America‚Äôs plastic substitute for the rich experience of peoplehood, have been destroyed beyond salvage by the recent movement of Black and Third World people, to whom this cooptative and castrating elixir was never made available, for they were not merely outcasts, but to be regarded as a different species. Those non-white peoples, whom history exempted from this trap by never making it available, are now being cajoled and coerced into it through the co-optative mechanisms of such programs as Black capitalism and repressive culture nationalism. And, as in every previous case, the efficacy of this approach rests on successful recruitment of ethnic collaborators willing to help transform the peculiar cultural and normative energies of the group into enslaving and alienating functions. Indeed, the share of relative affluence and apparent autonomy permitted to any group in America tends to be in direct proportion to the extent to which it has succeeded in internalizing these repressive functions. The pitifully small minority who escaped, largely by their own efforts, and adopted inter-ethnic and international perspectives, are hounded as anarchists or foreign agents by the state and as traitors by the various ethnic mafiosi.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe injunction from Ethics of the Fathers to ‚Äúmake a fence around the Torah‚Äù and to guard and preserve ethical and social precepts has been bartered away in substance in our opportunistic desire to ‚Äúbecome like the other nations of the world.‚Äù We have traded it for the maxim of Robert Frost‚Äôs thoughtless and superstitious farmer: Good fences make good neighbors. We erect and maintain institutions which separate us from our neighbors and destroy the values the fences are supposed to preserve.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe tradition of Abraham at Sodom and Gomorrah established the obligation to struggle on behalf of all people, even if it means challenging the highest authority. Jonah was reprimanded and punished for refusing to preach to Nineveh, not Jerusalem.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe demands placed on us are as ancient as our history: Na‚Äôaseh V‚Äô nishmah. A statement not of blind faith but of uncompromising dedication and idealism: we will do what is right and take whatever the consequences. We must take full part in the coming and necessary American revolution as followers and leaders, as communities and individuals. We must do this on the side of the oppressed because it is right and it, too, is our heritage. We must reorient our relation to the past, cease using it as justification of the inequities of the present and the method for predetermining and freezing the future. Rather, the past must provide roots for the present and strength to change the future.‚Äù ‚ÄúI am a Jew, an American, a Revolutionary. I am all three at once because each flows out of and merges into one life history. I continue to be each one by choice and self-definition, as well as external, but in no case universal judgment. Establishment of my claim to each of these honorifics was accompanied by hardship and fulfillment, in the ghettos and camps of Europe, as an immigrant in America and in the streets and jails and under the nightsticks of this ‚Äúgolden land.‚Äù I seek neither dialogue nor accommodation with the soured and hate-filled scraps of humanity who deny my claim to be a Jew, an American, a Revolutionary unless I denounce all but one. But to those sisters and brothers who honestly question the compatibility of these categories, I declare my belief that the synthesis is a necessary pre- condition and must therefore be a part of our revolutionary vision.‚Äù References People from Debrecen American people of Hungarian-Jewish descent Cornell University faculty Brooklyn College alumni 1938 births 2009 deaths ","title":"Robert Greenblatt (anti war activist)"},{"id":"51367293","text":"Praneel Naidu (born 29 January 1995) is a Fijian footballer who plays for the Labasa football team.

It originally premiered on June 22, 2013 on Destination America. The series follows the Appalachian Investigators of Mysterious Sightings (A.I.M.S.) team, a band of six native West Virginian hunters and trappers, as they research and track unidentified creatures in the Appalachian Mountains. There is also a side-series titled Mountain Monsters: Uncaged that features extra facts and never-before-seen footage from different episodes of the series. The series aired for five seasons on Destination America, from 2013 to 2017. On July 15, 2019, after an 18-month hiatus, it was announced that the series was renewed for a sixth season and would be moving to Travel Channel. The new season premiered on August 21, 2019. Premise The A.I.M.S. team is a self-styled, fictional cryptozoology research team founded by West Virginians John \\"Trapper\\" Tice, Jeff Headlee, and Willy McQuillian. Their goal is to prove the existence of mysterious creatures such as Bigfoot, Werewolf, Hellhound, Lizard Man, and Mothman. The episodes normally begin with Trapper, Jeff, Huckleberry, and Buck discussing the specific creature they are hunting on the way to the location where the creature was spotted. They then meet with eyewitnesses who have encountered the creature, giving the team an idea of where to conduct an initial night investigation to find evidence of the creature being in the area. After concluding their initial night hunt, Willy and Wild Bill begin work on a trap to contain the creature while the rest of the team searches for more evidence, meeting with additional eyewitnesses who normally possess photographic, video, or audio evidence of the creature. After testing the completed trap the team begins the final night hunt. The creatures are, supposedly, occasionally caught on camera, such as the Cave Creature. They are also shown as a digital rendering that appears before and after commercial breaks. The team attempts to capture these creatures (with Hogzilla and three Devil Dogs being their most recent trapped creatures). In some instances, the team places trail cameras and/or infrared camcorders near the trap to capture photographic evidence of the creature in question. They have caught fleeting, blurry images of what they claim to be the Grassman, Shadow Creature, Cherokee Death Cat, and the Black Wolf on camera, to name but a few. More recently a recurring rogue team has spied on and sabotaged the A.I.M.S. team and their investigations. But the Rogue Team will not have much involvement in the show's 6th season, which will focus more on the team hunting monsters like in the earlier seasons.  A.I.M.S team members  * John \\"Trapper\\" Tice, Team Leader (May 24, 1947 - December 16, 2019) * Jacob \\"Buck\\" Lowe, Expert caller (formerly \\"Rookie\\") * Joseph \\"Huckleberry\\" Lott, Security * Jeff Headlee, Researcher * Willy McQuillian, Trap builder * William \\"Wild Bill\\" Neff, Expert tracker  Production  Prior to the season six premier, John \\"Trapper\\" Tice announced that he would have limited involvement due to a myriad of serious health issues. He made a minor appearance in the first episode of the season where he was visited by Huckleberry and Buck to whom he expressed the severity of his situation. He made one more brief appearance in the season's eighth episode. Tice died on December 16, 2019.

This led to \\"Trapper\\" John Tice directly responding and referring to Moneymaker's show as \\"Losing Bigfoot\\".?lang=en The online feud has continued with Finding Bigfoot castmember Cliff Barackman chiming in that the show is \\"fiction\\" and the official Finding Bigfoot Twitter account calling Mountain Monsters a \\"fake-hoax\\" show in regards to the series' April 2017 return. On May 30, 2017, the official A.I.M.S. Brasil Twitter account responded by saying that Finding Bigfoot \\"do not find anything\\". Many of the show's viewers are unsure if the show actually is real or scripted, which has caused several arguments among the Mountain Monsters community.

Background  We can think of a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) as a function that transforms a series of bits known as the state into a new state and a random number. That is, given a PRNG function and an initial state \\\\mathrm{state}_0, we can repeatedly use the PRNG to generate a sequence of states and random numbers. \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathrm{PRNG}(\\\\mathrm{state}_0) &= \\\\mathrm{state}_1,\\\\ \\\\mathrm{num}_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{PRNG}(\\\\mathrm{state}_1) &= \\\\mathrm{state}_2,\\\\ \\\\mathrm{num}_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{PRNG}(\\\\mathrm{state}_2) &= \\\\mathrm{state}_3,\\\\ \\\\mathrm{num}_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{PRNG}(\\\\mathrm{state}_3) &= \\\\ldots \\\\end{align} In some PRNGs, such as the Mersenne Twister, the state is large, more than 2048 bytes. In other PRNGs, such as xorshift, \\\\mathrm{state}_i and \\\\mathrm{num}_i are one and the same (and so the state is small, just 4, 8, or 16 bytes, depending on the size of the numbers being generated). But in both cases, and indeed in most traditional PRNGs, the state evolves unpredictably, so if you want to calculate a particular \\\\mathrm{state}_i given an initial state \\\\mathrm{state}_0, you have to calculate \\\\mathrm{state}_1, \\\\mathrm{state}_2, and so on, running the PRNG i times. Such algorithms are inherently sequential and not amenable to running on parallel machines like multi-core CPUs and GPUs. In contrast, a counter- based random number generator (CBRNG) is a PRNG where the state \\"evolves\\" in a particularly simple manner: \\\\mathrm{state}_i = i. This way you can generate each number independently, without knowing the result of the previous call to the PRNG. This property make it easy to run a CBRNG on a multiple CPU threads or a GPU. For example, to generate n random numbers on a GPU, you might spawn n threads and have the ith thread calculate \\\\mathrm{PRNG}(i).  Implementations   CBRNGs based on block ciphers  Some CBRNGs are based on reduced-strength versions of block ciphers. Below we explain how this works. When using a cryptograhpic block cipher in counter mode, you generate a series of blocks of random bits. The ith block is calculated by encrypting the number i using the encryption key k: \\\\mathrm{Block}_i = E(i, k). This is similar to a CBRNG, where you calculate the ith random number as \\\\mathrm{PRNG}(i). Indeed, any block cipher can be used as a CBRNG; simply let \\\\mathrm{PRNG}(i) = E(i, \\\\mathrm{seed})! This yields a strong, cryptographically-secure source of randomness. But cryptographically-secure pseudorandom number generators tend to be slow compared to insecure PRNGs, and in practice many uses of random numbers don't require this degree of security. In 2011, Salmon et al. at D. E. Shaw Research introduced two CBRNGs based on reduced-strength versions of block ciphers. * Threefry uses a reduced-strength version of the Threefish block cipher. (Juvenile fish are known as \\"fry\\".) * ARS uses a reduced-strength version of the AES block cipher. (\\"ARS\\" is a pun on \\"AES\\"; \\"AES\\" stands for \\"advanced encryption standard\\", and \\"ARS\\" stands for \\"advanced randomization system\\".) ARS is used in recent versions of Intel's Math Kernel Library and gets good performance by using instructions from the AES-NI instruction set, which specifically accelerate AES encryption. Code implementing Threefry, ARS, and Philox (see below) is available from the authors.  CBRNGs based on multiplication  In addition to Threefry and ARS, Salmon et al. described a third counter-based PRNG, Philox. It's based on wide multiplies, e.g. multiplying two 32-bit numbers and producing a 64-bit number, or multiplying two 64-bit numbers and producing a 128-bit number. As of 2020, Philox is popular on CPUs and GPUs. On GPUs, nVidia's cuRAND library and TensorFlow provide implementations of Philox. On CPUs, Intel's MKL provides an implementation. In 2020, Bernard Widynski published the Squares CBRNG.Squares RNG website Squares is based on John von Neumann‚Äôs middle-square method, applying several rounds to a counter to produce a random output. The Squares PRNG is notable for being extremely simple, just 7 lines of C code.

Griffith Dodson, Virginia General Assembly 1939‚Äì1961 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1961), pp. 552-53 He ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Virginia in 1945. Early life and education Landreth liked to claim he was born in a log cabin on March 27, 1885 in a community then known as Dipsey in Carroll County, Virginia. His father, Rev. James Jonathan Landreth (1861‚Äì1926; minister at the local Disciples of Christ Church that Landreth would attend the rest of his life) and his wife, the former Missouri Clementine Phillippi (1864‚Äì1939), also had six daughters. S. Floyd Landreth graduated from the local Woodlawn High School and then attended Washington and Lee University further up the Shenandoah Valley in Lexington, Virginia. He graduated in 1910 and began practicing law in his native Carroll County. He married Lola Lintecum and they had one daughter, Kathryn Franke, who also bore a son before her father's death. Politics and career Landreth practiced law at the Carroll County Courthouse in Hillsville, as well as in adjoining counties. In 1912, while still a young deputy clerk, he witnessed a courtroom shootout between convicted defendant Floyd Allen and his family and law enforcement, which wounded Landreth's boss but killed the judge, prosecutor, sheriff, jury foreman, and later a witness, as well as wounded seven spectators. Landreth participated as special prosecutor in the trials of two of the shooters, which were moved to Wytheville because of inflamed feelings in Carroll County. Landreth also farmed and was president of the First National Bank of Galax for four decades. He served on the local Chamber of Commerce, as well as the Retail Merchants Association. He was active in his church (on a national level) as well as with the Masons, Rotary Club, Moose, Boy Scouts and various bar associations. He was also a trustee of Lynchburg College. He unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Virginia in 1945, receiving only about half the number of votes of Byrd Organization Democrat William M. Tuck. Still, garnering 30% of the vote, was far more than previous Republican candidates, and unlike previous Republican candidates, Landreth actually campaigned across Virginia.Frank B. Atkinson, The Dynamic Dominion, p. 22 A decade later, Tuck would become a crucial figure in the Massive Resistance movement to the United States Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education. Landreth was chairman of the state Republican party in 1952, and greeted President Dwight Eisenhower during his campaign stops in southern Virginia. During the Massive Resistance controversy, Landreth had been one of the token Republicans on both the Gray Commission and later the Perrow Commission, which were both designed to address (or avoid compliance with) Brown. Virginians' upset over Governor Thomas B. Stanley's closing of public schools, as well as census changes and changes in federal law (especially the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which the Democratic Byrd Organization vehemently opposed) eventually led to the revitalization of the state Republican party and return of two-party democracy to the state with the election of Linwood Holton as Governor before Landreth's death. Death and memorials Landreth died at a nursing home in Galax on October 2, 1977, survived by his wife, daughter, four sisters, a grandson and great grandchildren.

She was the queen's confidante in her love affair with Johann Friedrich Struensee but was fired in 1771 because of rivalry between her and the queen about Struensee.Fjelstrup, AugustDamerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909 After the fall of Struensee, von Eyben gave testimony that seriously damaged the cause of the queen during the divorce.Fjelstrup, August, Skilsmisseprocessen imellem kong Christian den Syvende og dronning Karoline Matilde, 1908 Life Elisabet von Eyben was born to the German nobles Christian August von Eyben and Sofie Marie von Hassbergen. She was raised at the Protestant convent of St. John in Slesvig from the age of one. In 1760, she was given a position at the Royal Danish court. =Courtier of Caroline Matilda= In 1766, she was appointed one of the ladies-in-waiting of the new queen upon the recommendation of Louise von Plessen. She was given the position of Kammerfr√∏ken (senior maid of honour), which was the second highest rank among the ladies-in-waiting of the queen: after the senior lady in waiting Louise von Plessen in rank, and before the group of hofffroken (maid of honour). von Eyben was reportedly an influential confidante of the queen. The letter writer Luise Gramm accused her of being a bad influence upon the queen: it was she who convinced her to ride astride in male attire and dance and flirt alongside Anna Sofie B√ºlow, Christine Sophie von G√§hler and Johanne Marie Malleville. She had an affair with the courtier count Christian Frederik Moltke, the spouse of Ida Hedevig Moltke, who in turn had an affair with the Spanish envoy Sebastian de Llano y la Quadra. During the absence of the king in 1768‚Äì69, there were rumors about the queen and a certain La Tour, a handsome actor and singer from the court theater Hofteatret, which employed a French language theater troupe in 1767-1773. La Tour was the lover of Elisabet von Eyben, but he was noted to receive gifts from \\"a higher hand\\" and it was said that his visits to von Eyben's chamber was in fact visits to the queen. This alleged affair is not considered to have been true, but La Tour was exiled after the return of the king, perhaps because the rumor was damaging enough in itself. In the summer of 1770, the king and queen made a tour through the Duchies of Schlesvig-Holstein toward the German border, accompanied by Struensee. During the trip, the queen and Struensee was observed to behave in a suspect manner toward each other, and rumors started spreading that they were lovers. Elisabet von Eyben was sent back to the capital during the trip, which attracted attention. She was fired by the queen the following year, and settled in Germany, where she lived on her pension as a retired courtier. =Testimony= During the process against the queen and Struensee in 1772, Elisabet von Eyben was called to give testimony. She gave her testimony in writing from her absence in L√ºbeck, and it was damaging to the queen's cause. Elisabet von Eyben was accused to have convinced the queen to accept treatment by Struensee when he was recommended to her by the king. The queen's lawyer Uldall claimed that von Eyben had an affair with Struensee at the time and that she had encouraged the queen to commit adultery with him, and assisted them in their love affair. Her dismissal was reportedly because of the queen's jealousy toward her because of Struensee. Elisabet von Eyben herself claimed that the king had himself taken the doctor to the queen. She stated that she had witnessed how the queen left a masked ball in January 1770 and made a long visit alone in the room of Struensee. Not long after, the queen had confided in her: Caroline Matilda had told her, that her chamber maids had informed her that there were rumors of her affair with the doctor, that the queen dowagers were aware of it, and that she should ask Bernstorff to exile Struensee. When Caroline Matilda told Struensee, he advised her to confess to the maids and then bribe them, but she refused, and instead choose Elisabet von Eyben to be her confidante in the affair.

The episode was written by Robbie Thompson and directed by Stefan Pleszczynski. It was first broadcast on March 23, 2016, on The CW. Plot A woman, Naoki Himura, is scraping old wallpaper in her new house when she hears a scream and runs up to her daughter's bedroom. The girl, Kat, tells her mother that there is something bad in the house, and complains about how cold her room is. After the mother leaves to get her a glass of water, the lights in Kat's room go out and her door slams shut. Kat hides under her bed, watching the shadow of someone walking in front of her door. The door is suddenly opened, followed by a pale hand snatching Kat away. After getting no information on Castiel or Amara, Sam and Dean decide to take up the case of a little girl who went into coma and the only sign of any trauma is a handprint on her ankle. On reaching Grand Rapids, Michigan, Sam and Dean realize that Rufus Turner and Bobby Singer worked the same case a couple of years ago and consult Bobby's journal but it doesn't contain any information about what they were hunting. In the past, Rufus and Bobby argue over the case. Bobby believes it's a simple ghost case while Rufus now thinks it's a baku. They bet a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue Label Whisky on it, then head off to dig up some bones. On two separate nights, two pairs of hunters are digging up the same graves. Sam and Dean open the first casket and find that the bones have already been burned. They dig up the second grave and find that the bones have been burned as well. They come to the conclusion that they're not hunting a ghost after all. After the mother is also attacked and goes into a coma, the brothers, after consulting the lore find that they are dealing with a soul eater. Bobby and Rufus figure it out too. While Bobby and Rufus can't find a way to kill the creature, Bobby had previously worked a case in Tennessee where he fought what he now realizes is a soul eater and he was able to trap it. In the present, the Winchesters realize that Naoki broke Bobby and Rufus' sigil while redecorating and accidentally released the soul eater. In the Men of Letters archives, Sam finds a second sigil that can kill the soul eater, but one of them must enter the soul eater's nest to paint the sigil there at the same time it is painted in the house. In the past, Bobby and Rufus begin painting the sigil, only for Bobby to come under attack and get dragged to the nest where he has visions of the Winchesters dead and meets the young boy taken by the soul eater at the beginning of his case. He is soon possessed by the soul eater and used to attack Rufus. Rufus manages to subdue the possessed Bobby and finish the sigil, trapping the soul eater and sealing its nest. In the present, as Sam works on his own sigil, Dean purposefully goads the soul eater into dragging him into its nest where he meets Kat. Dean completes his sigil, but is possessed by the soul eater to attack Sam. The soul eater shows knowledge of the Darkness and warns Sam that Dean is driven to go to the Darkness. Sam subdues the possessed Dean and completes his sigil, killing the soul eater. Inside of the nest, the souls of all of its victims are released to their final rest or their bodies if they are still alive. Watching the souls disappear, Dean and Bobby briefly encounter each other before being returned to their own bodies in their respective time periods. In the past, Bobby puts up wallpaper to cover the trap sigil while Rufus check on the family to discover that they are now okay. Bobby is left worried by the implications of his encounter with Dean and how everything seems to have ended too neatly. In his car, Bobby finds a bottle of Johnny Walker Blue from Rufus (later discovered by Sam and Jody Mills in season 7's Time after Time) and begins to write about the case in his journal before being interrupted by a call from Dean. At Dean's request, Bobby heads off to check on a lead on Lilith. In the present, the Winchesters find that Naoki and Kat are awake as well while Dean speculates on whether or not he actually saw Bobby in the nest, a place that exists outside of time and space, making it theoretically possible. Departing, Sam and Dean decide to revisit Bobby's old soul eater case in Tennessee and finish it for him by killing the soul eater that he had trapped there.

One where he was allowed to stay dead and not come back in a cheap way to saddle up next to Sam and Dean.

It states that it sends \\"mercenaries of hope,\\" volunteer undercover operatives who have developed good relationships with local authorities and who pose as clients at brothels to learn about people being held against their will and then plan raids with the local police to arrest sex workers. The Exodus Road sometimes invites television crews and supporters watch and film its raids of brothels. Headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, The Exodus Road supports active operatives in India and southeast Asia, primarily in Thailand, and in the United States. As of April 01, 2019, The Exodus Road claims to have directly supported 1,139 rescues, made 544 arrests. However, the organization has refused requests from journalists to substantiate these claims. The Exodus Road's website states that it is not a faith-based organization, however many of its leadership team are motivated by the Christian faith and many of their current after care partners are faith-based.  Beginnings  In 2010, Matt and Laura Parker moved with their family to Thailand to direct a children's home, and in the process Matt began networking with the counter-trafficking NGOs in the area. After building a relationship with the police, he personally offered to start the process of collecting information for the local police to act on and assemble raids. After working two years doing investigative work and developing relationships with local governments and NGOs, The Exodus Road was founded in January 2012.  Criticism  The Exodus Road has been criticized as a religious organization that uses trafficking as a pretext to intervene against sex workers and remove their sources of income. The Exodus Road states it is not a religious organization but its cofounders and leaders acknowledge that religion is very important to them. The Exodus Road has also been criticized for using military jargon, such as describing volunteers as \\"covert operatives\\" to carry out an alleged humanitarian mission. One journalist referred to The Exodus Road and similar groups as, \\"white burly dudes, often ex-police or FBI...who get to live out some fantasy of breaking into some exotic locale and stealing away underage brown women for their own purposes,\\"  Fund Raising  A primary way that The Exodus Road fund raises is through the search and rescue team program. Donors are invited to contributed to one or more \\"teams\\" to fund operations in specific areas. However, the Exodus Road website acknowledges that it retains the full control of donated funds including the right to allocate them in any way it chooses. The volunteers, referred to as \\"covert operatives\\", specifically investigate sex work establishments and work with local police and are organized into four groups, by the regions they work in.

She was the daughter of Baron Verner Rosenkrantz and Else Margrete Sehested and married the courtier and nobleman Kristian Karl Gabel in 1762. She was known for her beauty and admired for her great intelligence and intellectual ability. The contemporary memoir writer count Rantzau-Ascheberg described her as a woman whose education and great scholarly knowledge could be compared to that of most men. She was given the Ordre de l'Union Parfaite in 1764. It was noted that Christian VII of Denmark found her attractive and attempted to seduce her. In 1767, the circle around Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain, wished to make her the official mistress of the monarch in order to divert him from politics and take over the de facto power over the government themselves.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. The plan failed because Gabel did not wish to become the king's mistress, as she found him repulsive and was in love with Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel. The same year, St√∏vlet-Cathrine became the king's official mistress, but was exiled the following year. According to contemporary reports, Johann Friedrich Struensee attempted to make her the official royal mistress of the king in 1769, claiming that it would benefit the mentally ill king's health to have an intelligent woman as a lover, and the nation, as it would make the king more easy to control. Reportedly, it was also Struensee's plan to become the lover of Gabel and through her control the king politically. Gabel made an attempt to be more encouraging to the king's attraction for her than she had been before, but after observing that the king's health and behavior did not improve and would likely not improve if she became his lover, she refused to go through with it. During her brief relation with the king, she reportedly tried to influence him to get rid of his favorite Conrad Holck, whom she despised. She died in childbirth after having given birth to a dead daughter in mid-August 1769.

Life She was the daughter of Schack von Buchwald til Johannisdorff and Eleonora Elisabet von Plessen. She married courtier Count Ulrik Adolf Holstein in 1763. In 1765 her spouse was appointed ambassador to Berlin, however during a court ball she convinced the king to appoint another to the post because she did not wish to leave Denmark. Influencing government policy in this manner was regarded as a scandal. As a result the king appointed her spouse to a post in the Danish countryside, which reportedly they both found a less than pleasing place to reside. She was a cousin of Ida Hedevig Moltke, and her relative Charlotte Elisabeth Henriette Holstein served as the chief lady-in-waiting to queen Caroline Matilda. Upon the recommendation of the queen's friend Christine Sophie von G√§hler, her spouse was given a political post by the queen's lover Johann Friedrich Struensee in 1770, which made it possible for the pair to return to court, and Amalie Sofie Holstein became a leading member of court life. Together with the baroness Anna Sofie B√ºlow and countess Christine Sophie von G√§hler, she became known as one of the Three Graces of the Danish royal court.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. Amalie Sofie Holstein was described by contemporaries as friendly, with a good disposition and humor to her personality, beautiful though somewhat plump in her appearance, and as sympathetic and kind to those who knew her personally. She had a relationship with Enevold Brandt, who used his position with the king to pay off her gambling debts, and who left the position as the king's caretaker to √âlie Salomon Fran√ßois Reverdil for her.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. Struensee disliked her because she allegedly made Brandt defiant toward him, and as her spouse proved himself not useful as a politician, the Holstein couple was allowed to stay at court only because of Brandt.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. On the night of the fall of Struensee in January 1772, Brandt danced with Holstein at the masquerade ball, and when he escorted her from the ball, he told her that he was sure that their roles could not continue much longer.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. After the coup, her spouse was forced to resume his old post in the countryside, effectively banishing them from court once again. She gave birth to her only child in 1775 and became a widow in 1789.

Background Kerr McDonnell was born at Glenarm in County Antrimhttp://www.lijssenthoek.be/en/address/2901/-the-hon-sir-schomberg-kerr- macdonnell.html the youngest son of ten children to Mark McDonnell, 5th Earl of Antrim (1814‚Äì1869), by his wife Jane Emma Hannah Macan (ca. 1825‚Äì1892). His paternal grandfather Lord Mark Kerr (1776‚Äì1840) was a descendant of the Marquess of Lothian, whose wife Charlotte McDonnell (1779‚Äì1835) was the Countess of Antrim in her own right, hence the change of surname for their descendants. He was educated at Eton College and at University College, Oxford. Whilst at Oxford he became a Freemason in the Apollo University Lodge, a Masonic lodge for students and former students of the university. Political career In 1888 Kerr McDonnell was appointed Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, and served as such while he was in office until 1892, and again from 1895 to 1902 (with a short interval while he fought in South Africa in 1900). He also served as private secretary to Lord Salisbury while he was Leader of the Opposition from 1892 to 1895. In failing health, Lord Salisbury resigned as Prime Minister in July 1902, and Kerr McDonnell received a non-political appointment, as Secretary to the Office of Works, a position he held until 1912. It was the duty of this department to look after the royal palaces, and the position brought him into close contact with the royal family. Kerr McDonnell was a captain in the London Volunteer Regiment. Taking leave from his work for the Prime Minister, he took an active commission with the newly raised City of London Imperial Volunteers in late 1899. This corps was raised and equipped by the City of London for service during the Second Boer War, left for South Africa in January 1900, and returned in October the same year. Honours Kerr McDonnell was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1892, for his service to the outgoing Prime Minister. He was promoted to a Knight Commander (KCB) of the Order in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and received the knighthood in a private audience with King Edward VII on 2 August, during the King's convalescence on board HMY Victoria and Albert. He was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 1901, and promoted to Knight Grand Cross (GCVO) in the order in the 1911 Coronation Honours list. Ha was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA).

Rescued fish would either be redeposited in the river or transported inland to stock streams and lakes by the State Fish and Game Warden (after 1931 the Iowa Fish and Game Commission, and after 1935 the State Conservation Commission). This building was constructed by the Iowa State Fish and Game Warden in 1915 as a headquarters for fish rescue, and as a fish hatchery. The facility was along the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad tracks, and it and other railroads in the state would transport fish for the state for a nominal fee in specially designed cars for stocking purposes. In the 1930s the Lansing facility became the headquarters for fish management in eastern Iowa. Rescue efforts were discontinued in the 1940s, but the facility remained a hatchery into the late 1970s. Luther College leased the building in 1981 for an onsite laboratory. Beginning in 1984 the Lansing chapter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars began leasing the building.

That province was controlled by Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr on behalf of his Mecca- based brother, Abd Allah, a rival caliph to Abd al-Malik.

Brackett was born in Vassalboro, Maine to Reuben and Elizabeth (Starkey) Brackett, and moved with his parents in the spring of 1837 to Cincinnati, where he started work as a sculptor. In 1839 he showed a pair of portrait busts at the Cincinnati Academy of Fine Arts, and subsequently moved to New York City. In 1841, after roughly two years in New York, he moved to Boston with an introduction from his friend William Cullen Bryant, where from 1843 he lived in Winchester, Massachusetts (at that time Woburn), from the early 1850s onward in the octagonal Edward A. Brackett House. In October 1859, after the raid on Harper's Ferry, Brackett traveled to the jail there, where he made sketches and measurements of John Brown's head, which he subsequently cast as a bust. After serving one year in the Civil War, he turned to horticulture and the scientific breeding of fish. In 1869 he was appointed to a state commission supervising inland fisheries, and became its head in 1873. From 1894 until his death he served as head of the Massachusetts Fish and Game Commission.

It has a single rampart, outer ditch and counterscarp bank on all but the western side, where it is protected by the steep bank of the ravine. The bank would have been high, with a ditch that has a revetment of stones below its counterscarp. The sides of the ridge are steep to the north and precipitous to the south and west. The approach from the east is flat. A scarp on the north survives, above a stony bank. There is a strong double rampart on the eastern side, and traces of another, but this was largely destroyed when ornamental gardens were built. There may have been an entrance in the northwest, but in this area a farm track has partly destroyed the outer bank. The gazetteer lists the fort as covering .

Tedbury, Wadbury and Newbury guarded the Avon and Frome rivers, and defended the roads and approaches to the mining district of the Mendip Hills with its capital at Camalodunum long before the Roman Era. The present Wadbury House was built within the old fortification. There is a bank running in a north- south direction through the middle of the fort, and a low bank to the northwest of the house, both of which are modern. Today Wadbury camp is a scheduled monument.

She was the first woman to be appointed to the chartered position Public Information Director for the City of New Orleanshttp://nutrias.org/facts/women.htm by the late Mayor Ernest Nathan Morial.

They lived in the Touro Boulignyhttp://www.nola.gov/neighborhood-engagement/neighborhood- organizations/touro-bouligny-neighborhood-association/ neighborhood. Ms. Brylski attended Gregory Junior High and graduated from John F. Kennedy High of New Orleans. Both public schools were destroyed in the 2005 levee failurehttp://levees.org/mission-and-goals-of-levees-org/ following Hurricane Katrina. She received her Bachelors in Journalism and Political Science from Loyola Universityhttp://www.loyno.edu/ of the South in 1980 and a Masters in Political Science from the University of New Orleanshttp://www.uno.edu/ in 1983.  Early career  Ms. Brylski's love of journalism was first encouraged by her high school journalism teacher Lee Maloney and stoked by Tom Bell, Chair, Loyola University's Journalism Department. She landed her first reporting job for the Vieux Carre Courier, edited by William F. Rushton and published by Philip Carter, when she was 17 years old. A feature story she wrote on the plight of Louisiana Native Americans in Dulac, Louisiana to receive federal recognition won top honors with the Society of Professional Journalists. Then-Consumer Advocate Ralph Nader was intrigued by the story and offered her a job in Washington D.C. with Public Citizen's Congress Watch, an investigative newsletter. She returned to Louisiana in 1980 to work on a project with Nader exposing the-late U.S. Senator Russell Long's ties to the oil and gas industry, and his influence in increasing prices at the pump. It was during this project, she was introduced to newly elected Mayor Ernest N. Morial and accepted a job to be his personal writer. This job led to her becoming Morial's Public Information Director and chief speechwriter. She worked for Morial until his death in 1989. Ms. Brylski helped Mayor Dutch Morial and his Administration establish Blacks in City Government, the city's first and an award-winning comprehensive and enforceable Minority Business Enterprise Program, and the city's first Hunger and Homeless policy, which was later adopted as a model by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, among other accomplishments.

Baquet  The Brylski Company  The Brylski Company helps clients develop strategic marketing campaigns designed to increase public education about a specific service or issue, and/or obtain a certain outcome in public policy. The company's focus is to achieve objectives that have a public purpose. Services include strategic planning, a full range of public relations activities, issues development and movement, grassroots ally development, and earned/free media placement. The Brylski Company also helps candidates get elected, and once elected, develop effective public outreach programs to achieve definitive policy goals and objectives. The Brylski Company has worked with presidential, congressional, gubernatorial, statewide and local campaigns scheduled in Louisiana. The Brylski Company is a 100 percent woman-owned firm, a state contractor, a certified City of New Orleans SLDBE, and has the distinction of running more women for elective office than any other company in Louisiana.  Key Contributions  = Education Reform = In 1992, the Brylski Company worked closely with the New Orleans Metropolitan Area Committee and its then- Director Leslie Gerwin to draft a school reform initiative based on school decentralization. The theory was that empowered school principals would have better control of their school's performance. The plan however was never fully embraced. Then Assessor Ken Carter recruited the Brylski Company to help organize a school board reform effort called Excellence in Education. The effort was successful in electing a reform-majority to the Orleans Parish School Board, but its goals to implement comprehensive changes in school management, were largely abandoned when school board members met up against traditional obstructionists, such as school unions. By 1996, one of the leading reformers, Leslie Jacobs, resigned from the Board to accept a position advising then Louisiana Governor Murphy J. Foster Jr.. Between 1996 and 2005, Ms. Jacobs would spearhead a number of policy initiatives, including developing the State and District School Accountability Plan, which empowered local parents to act when school districts were academically failing and yet unresponsive to reforms. The Brylski Company is proud to have helped Ms. Jacobs draft some of these reform documents, such as the initial plan, and work with some of its clients, especially then-Senator Paulette Irons and then-Representative Karen Carter, to pass key legislative reforms that designed Louisiana's school reform movement. Since 2005, the Brylski Company has championed the growth of the charter school movement in Orleans Parish and the State of Louisiana by serving as public relations counsel to the Eastbank Collaborative of Charter Schools, the Greater New Orleans Collaborative of Charter Schools, and the Louisiana Association of Public Charter Schools, as well as helping to establish the first completely virtual charter public school in Louisiana, Louisiana Connections Academy. = Public Service = In 1989, the Brylski Company served as chief strategist to a small group of women advocates dedicated to fighting for women's rights in Louisiana and gaining a gubernatorial veto for the most regressive anti-abortion legislation proposed by a state legislature in the nation. To everyone's surprise, they won. As a result, the Brylski Company helped the Louisiana Legislative Women's Caucus pursue more progressive legislation in areas impacting women and families. As women representation in the Legislature increased by Year 2000, the Caucus under its President Representative Diane Winston conducted the first statewide series of women's needs assessments and conferences in the hopes of establishing a comprehensive business development strategy. The surprising outcome was an overwhelming cry by women for more accessible healthcare services for their families instead of a business development model. A 42-point legislative package was developed and passed by 2002. The Governor's Office of Women's Services was established in this time period, as well as a Children's Cabinet under the Lieutenant Governor's Office (now a permanent part of the Louisiana Governor's Office). The Brylski Company also established a network around the state for healthcare providers and women's organizations to address healthcare issues, the top concern being accessible and affordable healthcare. This network, the Women's Health Access Network, the Louisiana Women's Network and the Louisiana Women's Lobby Network, was instrumental in promoting support for the Louisiana Children's Health Insurance Program (LACHIP), the Louisiana Senior Health Insurance Information Program (SHIIP) and eventually the creation of the Louisiana Senior Rx and Aging and Disability Resource Center programs. Concurrent with these efforts, the Brylski Company promoted the extension of affordable, independent housing for seniors and families in Louisiana through a variety of funding and education programs under the Louisiana Housing Finance Agency. The Brylski Company's networks were critical in helping Louisiana become one of the top three enrollees of seniors in the Medicare Part D program, as well as creating the Elderly Protective Services Program, the Louisiana Ombudsman Program, and LouisianaAnswers.com, through the Governor's Office of Elderly Affairs. Following the 2005 Hurricanes and subsequent levee failures in Louisiana, these networks maintained independently by Brylski Company email-list-serves would be critical to reestablishing communications among healthcare and service providers in Louisiana. = Women‚Äôs Rights = Out of its efforts to promote women's access to all healthcare options in the late 1980s and 1990s, including contraceptive equity, a statewide campaign called Women Elect 2000 was initiated by the Brylski Company with the Louisiana Women's Network and Louisiana women activists like Danae Columbus, Kim Gandy, Madalyn Schenk, Leslie Gerwin and Julie Schwam Harris to encourage women to qualify in every state legislative race. Elected female legislators increased from five to 10 by 1990; by 2000, the State of Louisiana reached the national average of 23 percent of its legislature being female.

Biography  Gaston Ickowicz immigrated to Israel from Argentina in 1980 at the age of 6. He studied photography at Naggar School of Photography, Media, New Music, Visual Communication and Phototherapy in Musrara, Jerusalem from 1997 till 2000. Ickowicz received MFA in art and photography from Bezalel School of Arts and Design in 2008. Ickowicz works are in permanent collections of Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Haifa Museum of Art, Museum on the Seam in Jerusalem, Ashdod Art Museum and private collections.  Work  Ickowicz mainly works in video and photography and centers on the interaction between people and landscape in a socio-political context. His work entertains a dialogue with the Israeli sphere and touches some of the conflicts it contains. The difference between \\"landscape\\" and \\"place\\" is one of Ickowics's main subjects. His work examines the relations between these two concepts, as well as their potential to change following their definition as such and the perspective from which they are viewed. He is interested in how the photographic act can transform a landscape, which may only be examined as a static image, into a place with a dynamic quality, an act that enables him to study various components of the landscapes identity. Ickowicz captures sights and traces that remain in the aftermath of various events; a spent bonfire, a scorched field burnt in the course of a military bombing, an avalanche in the desert, rocks used to create a roadblock, or the ruins of an ancient settlement. This strategy documents the traces of different processes and events that took place in the past, and is directed at exploring definitions of memory, history, and culture as they are revealed through the signs captured by the camera. The journeys in which these images are taken are also related to a more general existential state, which involves a search for roots and for a sense of belonging. In this context, the concept of time is expanded: inevitably, the present, or \\"here-and-now\\" captured in these works, is viewed in relation to a chronological axis that constantly echoes the past.

His policies during his tenure as governor of Iraq in 738‚Äì744 deepened the Qays‚ÄìYaman rivalry and were one of the main factors in the outbreak of the civil war of the Third Fitna, during which he was executed. Biography A member of the Thaqif tribe, he was related to the powerful governor of Iraq, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi, who was a first cousin of his father. In 725‚Äì738 he served as governor of the Yemen, where he suppressed a Kharijite rebellion, killing its leader, Abbad al-Ru'yani. According to one tradition, he was responsible for the death of the traditionist Wahb ibn Munabbih during his tenure there. His brother Qasim also served as governor of the Yemen in the 740s. In 738, Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724‚Äì743) appointed Yusuf to the governorship of Iraq, replacing the longtime governor, Khalid al-Qasri. The reasons behind this move are obscure; Khalid certainly was taken by surprise by the arrival of his replacement, and Yusuf immediately imprisoned Khalid and his sons, and tortured his predecessor to extract his wealth, a practice common during hand-overs of governorships at the time. Khalid was released after 18 months, but when Caliph Hisham died in 743 and was replaced by al-Walid II (r. 743‚Äì744), the latter sold Khalid back to Yusuf for 50 million dirhams. Yusuf again tortured him until Khalid died in late 743. Yusuf was also responsible for confronting and suppressing the rebellion of the Alid Zayd ibn Ali in 740 at Kufa. Not coincidentally, Yusuf's residence during this tenure was al-Hira rather than Kufa, which was until then the usual residence of the governor. Himself a \\"fanatical Qaysi\\", Yusuf was largely responsible for the exacerbation of the Qays‚ÄìYaman rivalry and, according to Khalid Yahya Blankinship, \\"nearly completed the total breakdown in the ability of the two groups to live in peace in the same state\\". His appointment marked the shift from a Yamani prevalence under Khalid al-Qasri to a Qays/Mudar dominance, as Yusuf dismissed Khalid's appointees, whom he often mistreated and tortured, and appointed men of Qaysi background in their stead. Yamani hostility deepened further with the handover, murder and death of Khalid al-Qasri, whom the Yamanis had by now come to regard as their champion. The Yamani opposition, in which Khalid's sons played a prominent role, coalesced around Yazid III, a son of al-Walid I (r. 705‚Äì715). In April 744, Yazid and his supporters entered Damascus and overthrew al-Walid II, who was soon killed near Palmyra. Yazid III sent the Kalbi Mansur ibn Jumhur to replace Yusuf in Iraq. Yusuf fled to the Balqa, but was soon captured and imprisoned in Damascus along with al-Walid II's sons. As the civil war widened and the pro-Qays Marwan II advanced on the city, Yusuf and al-Walid's sons were killed (late 744 or early 745) by Khalid al-Qasri's son Yazid, on the orders of Sulayman ibn Hisham.

A church at \\"Ardsalach\\" is listed in the ecclesiastical taxation (1302‚Äì06) of Pope Nicholas IV.

The arch leading into the chancel is of particular interest: Carved stones on each side of the arch show three dogs attacking an otter or fox, and another carving of three men, possibly depicting the Arrest of Jesus. There is a single lancet window and an ambry (recess for storing sacred vessels and vestments) at ground level on the north wall and a surviving lancet and piscina at the east end of the south wall.

Named after Cameron, the series was launched with much publicity in September 2006, when the party was keen to rebrand itself as a modern entity by embracing new technology, and appealing to a younger generation of voters adept at using online media. History David Cameron was elected to lead the Conservative Party in December 2005 on a platform of making the party appeal to a wider electorate, and to those who had not previously voted for them. His director of strategy, Steve Hilton realised the potential of using websites such as the recently launched video- sharing website YouTube to by-pass traditional media, such as television broadcasters, and attract new voters. Political parties in the UK, including the Conservatives, had established websites before the 1997 general election, but had not embraced the technology as a campaigning tool. Consequently, after 2005, the party hired Rishi Saha, a former nightclub manager, to bolster its online presence, and WebCameron was established as part of its digital strategy. The WebCameron videos were made available on the website www.webcameron.org.uk, as well as via YouTube. There was also an online discussion forum facility. At the time of WebCameron's launch, the Conservatives described the series as providing \\"behind-the-scenes access\\" to Cameron, while Sam Roake, who helped to run the site, said the videos \\"very much [represent] the values of David Cameron's Conservative party, of openness and community\\". The first video uploaded to the WebCameron site, on 30 September 2006, showed Cameron washing up in his kitchen while his family ate breakfast, and featured him setting out his party's aims: \\"I want to tell you what the Conservative party is doing, what we're up to, give you behind-the- scenes access so you can actually see what policies we're developing, the things that we are doing, and have that direct link ... watch out BBC, ITV, Channel 4, we're the new competition. We're a bit shaky and wobbly, but this is one of the ways we want to communicate with people properly about what the Conservative party stands for.\\" Subsequent videos featured Cameron in different settings, while offering his thoughts on a variety of topics, and generally appeared at the rate of one or two a week. Among videos recorded for the series was footage of Cameron celebrating Diwali at Neasden's Swaminarayan Temple, a discussion of British achievements at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and Cameron offering his thoughts on how to clean up British politics. In a video posted in January 2007, Cameron called for the legalisation of medical marijuana. In May 2007, after he was the guest of a Muslim family living in Birmingham's Balsall Heath district, Cameron posted highlights of the visit to WebCameron. The video showed him living and working with the family, and discussing topical issues with the local community. Shortly after that, Cameron spent two days as a teaching assistant at a comprehensive school in Humberside, footage of which was also uploaded to the site. Also in 2007, Cameron used the website to challenge Gordon Brown to a live televised political debate as he prepared to succeed Tony Blair as Prime Minister, arguing the format had proved useful for discussing \\"serious policy issues\\" during the 2005 Conservative leadership election. Cameron's wife, Samantha made her WebCameron debut in April 2010, ahead of that year's general election. The WebCameron YouTube channel was renamed Sam WebCameron for the duration of the weeks preceding the election, and was part of the Conservatives' campaign to attract young female voters. In 2007, the Conservatives apologised after a forum discussing the \\"sexiest female MP\\" attracted some negative media attention, and the thread was removed. In Cameron‚Äôs Conservatives and the Internet: Change, Culture and Cyber Toryism, Anthony Ridge-Newman reports that daily visitor traffic for WebCameron stood at 150,000 in the initial phase of the project, before falling to 5,000‚Äì6,000 during its latter years. By 2010, the WebCameron series had been moved from the webcameron.org.uk site to the main Conservative Party website. A Good Web Guide review described the series as \\"[offering] little more than another platform for the broadcast of policy, rather than a two-way dialogue between the elected and the electors\\". After the Conservatives formed a government following the 2010 general election and Cameron became Prime Minister, 10 Downing Street announced that he would continue to record the WebCameron videos. In November 2010, Nicky Woodhouse, who was in charge of running the WebCameron site, was appointed as the government's official film-maker, but stepped down from the role after two weeks when the appointment was perceived negatively by the media and public. The WebCameron series attracted some renewed media interest when it was deleted from YouTube in November 2013, particularly as it coincided with the removal of a decade of Cameron's speeches from the Conservative Party's website. However, the material remains available through the UK Web Archive. Legacy In 2007, Labour launched Labourvision, a series of videos inspired by the WebCameron model. The videos had their own YouTube channel, and featured prominent Labour figures discussing policy issues. In 2008, Labour leader and Prime Minister Gordon Brown launched Ask the PM, a YouTube channel on which he would answer questions put to him by subscribers. Brown's public image had been an issue with voters during his time as Prime Minister, and Ask the PM was an attempt to revitalise his image. Conservative MP Douglas Carswell launched clactontv.com, a website following a similar video-sharing format in November 2006. WebCameron was also the subject of satire, with some sending up Cameron's attempt to connect with a younger generation. One notable example of this occurred in October 2006, when MP Si√¥n Simon recorded a video titled \\"DaveCam\\" in which he mocked Cameron's presenting style while wearing a baseball cap, inviting viewers to sleep with his wife and take his children. The Financial Times reported that the video resulted in an increase in traffic to the WebCameron site. Simon deleted the clip following criticism about its content from Conservative and Labour MPs. Another spoof of the videos was made by supporters of the UK Independence Party who established a website with a similar address to the WebCameron URL, and redirected visitors to a spoof Armando Iannucci video set to David Bowie's song, \\"Changes\\" and that had appeared on his television show Time Trumpet.

It was designed by William Pagan and built in 1905 by day labour. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Scaffolding during construction, 1905 The Mungar-Monto railway line was built only as far as Degilbo before the financial depression of the early 1890s halted the rail construction program. Construction resumed in 1905 under the Railway Department's day labour program. William Pagan was Chief Engineer at the time. Construction began on the Degilbo to Wetheron extension in February 1905. William Pagan inspected the extent of the construction and preparatory work on the Deep Creek bridge in March 1905. The bridge was completed and the line opened by 21 December 1905. Pagan described the bridge in his annual report for that year as \\"a concrete bridge of somewhat novel design\\". The bridge represented a substantial development in concrete arch bridge design. It followed the spans used in Swansons Rail Bridge on the Main Line near Toowoomba and the span at Petrie Terrace road overbridge. It was followed by two substantial concrete arch bridges on the Main Line near Lockyer.

She is often referred to as Henry‚Äôs third mistress. Richard was brought up and educated by Robert Bloet, the Bishop of Lincoln. Bloet had also educated Richard‚Äôs half-brother Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester. Richard is sometimes confused with Richard de Lincoln, an Anglo- Norman prelate who died in 1203. Richard supported his father in his war with Louis VI of France, although it is unclear at what point he joined the fight with the English forces. According to Orderic Vitalis, he avoided capture by French forces at Les Andelys in 1119 through the help of Ralph the Red of Pont-Echanfray. Richard continued to fight at his father‚Äôs side during the siege of the castle of √âvreux being held by Henry‚Äôs most detested enemy, Amaury III de Montfort. His last known military adventure was at the Battle of Br√©mule on 20 August 1119, for which the decisive win by the English led to Louis‚Äô accepting Richard‚Äôs half-brother William Adelin as Duke of Normandy. In 1120, Richard became betrothed to Amice, the daughter of the defender of Br√©mule, Raoul II de Gael, seigneur of Gael and Montfort, son of Ralph de Gael, Earl of East Anglia. The marriage never took place as Richard died in the wreck of the White Ship on 25 November 1120. Amice did not accompany him and lived until 1168, marrying the king's ward Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester, and one of many descendants included Ida de Tosny, a mistress of Henry II Curtmantle, King of England.

Krausch (1868‚Äì1929), was an American architect, engineer, and inventor who worked for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q;) from the late 1880s to the 1920s.  Life  Krausch was born at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania June 11, 1868, the son of Theodore and Emma (Heide) Krausch. He was educated at Evanston High School, at a technical school at Buffalo, New York, and by private tutoring. Although associated with the firm of Theodore Krausch & Company, architects and engineers, at Buffalo, New York from 1888 to 1891, Krausch began work for the CB&Q; in 1888. The 1892 Directory of La Grange, Illinois, lists his profession as draugthtsman. The CB&Q; appointed him to the position of architect by 1901. Krausch was appointed engineer of buildings by the CB&Q; in April, 1912. His responsibilities, including designing buildings and supervising construction, were wide-ranging, but probably typical of such a position. Examples include awarding a contract for construction of a large coaling plant at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, to the Roberts & Schaefer Company in 1913; in March 1922 directing preparation of a report on the effects of a fire in the CB&Q; office building in Chicago and lessons to be learned; supervising preparation in March 1922 of plans for the station and power house in Aurora, Illinois; in April 1922 receiving bids for construction of a freight house in Chicago; directing the CB&Q;'s Building Department in work related to the railroad's grade separation project in Aurora, Illinois, in 1922; in August 1922 receiving bids to construct a bridge over the Platte River near Oreapolis, Nebraska. Krausch was active in professional organizations: he presented the report of the Standing Committee entitled \\"Modern Locomotive Coaling Station. Design, Construction, Operation and Maintenance\\" to the sixth annual convention of the International Railway Fuel Association at Chicago in May, 1914; presented a paper on coaling plants and fuel economy to a meeting of the Western Railway Club in Chicago November 19, 1917; was a member of Committee XXIII Shops and Locomotive Terminals of the American Railway Engineering Association in 1921 and 1922; at the annual meeting of the Railway Fire Protection Association at Washington in October 18, 1922, spoke briefly of the recent burning of the CB&Q; general office building in Chicago; was a member of the Western Society of Engineers and presented a paper to the Society on \\"Design of Railway Locomotive Terminals\\" on March 23, 1923. As an inventor Krausch developed and patented a number of railroad-related mechanical devices, both alone and with E.F. Weber, assistant engineer, and with Robert Elder. His personal and social life was centered around La Grange, Illinois. Krausch married Clara Ann Shordiche of La Grange on January 5, 1891.\\"Iowa Marriages, 1809‚Äì1992,\\" database, FamilySearch(https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XJG8-N3Z : 3 December 2014), Theodore Krausch in entry for Walter Theodore Krausch and Clara Ann Shordicke, 05 Jan 1891; citing Marshalltown, Marshall Co., Iowa, reference 2:3FDTGFR; FHL microfilm 983,770.

Medical career  In 1864 he served in the Union Army in the US Civil War as a military nurse at Camp Barker which became a model for Freedmen's hospital, and he graduated from Western Reserve in March, 1865. Two months after graduation he took the position of acting assistant surgeon with a rank of first lieutenant and was assigned to duty in Washington, DC.

That year he was elected secretary to the Medical Faculty. Morris was very successful at Howard, and was credited with keeping the medical department running during the financial panic of 1873. He attended President Garfield after he was shot by an assassin on July 2, 1881. This made him the first black physician to attend to a sitting president. Later in 1881 he was appointed by President Chester Arthur to Surgeon-in-Charge at the Freedmen's hospital. Purvis was surgeon-in-charge at the Freedmen's Hospital from October 1, 1881, to 1894,Logan, 1969, p 122 and in that role was the first black person to head a hospital under civilian authority. In a letter from 1908, Purvis stated he believed he was removed by the Secretary of the Interior Hoke Smith in favor of a Democrat.

This site has two unusual species, the nationally rare grass- poly, which is only found in south Cambridgeshire on the British mainland, and the nationally uncommon fairy shrimp Chirocephalus diaphanus. They are found in shallow hollows in arable fields, which are the result of ice lenses melting at the end of the last ice age. There are also uncommon liverworts. The site This site consists of two fields, one at Whittlesford and one at Thriplow with a total area of . This region was affected by the most recent ice age, and it left behind depressions which resulted from the melting of ice lenses, where the freezing of water-saturated soil causes deformation and the upward thrust of the ground surface. These depressions provide suitable habitat for grass-poly (Lythrum hyssopifolia), a very rare plant in Great Britain. Other plants growing in this specialised habitat include toad rush (Juncus bufonius), greater plantain (Plantago major), knotgrass (Polygonum aviculare), redshank (Persicaria maculosa) and the very local tasteless water- pepper (Persicaria mitis). There are also some uncommon liverworts at the site; Riccia cavernosa, Riccia warnstorfii and Riccia subbifurca. There is a requirement for both flooding and ploughing of the site to maintain this specialised community and provide suitable conditions for it to continue. Another rarity found at this site is the fairy shrimp (Chirocephalus diaphanus), here at the most northerly end of its range, a crustacean, protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

A sequel, Pitstop II, was released in 1984. Gameplay Pitstop is played from a semi- first-person perspective, placing the player in a bird's eye perspective slightly behind a race car. The game features three difficulty modes and three gameplay modes: Single, Mini-Circuit, and Grand Circuit. In Single, the player can choose from one of six tracks and learn how to play the game. In the game's Circuit modes, the player races against other drivers and earns a certain number of points and money depending on the place finished in each race. The Mini-Circuit features only three tracks, while the Grand Circuit features all six. Pitstop implements pit stops, a concept not featured in many other contemporary racing video games. Color-based damage is shown on the player's car whenever it hits another vehicle or a wall on the track, both of which wear out the tires. The player also has a fuel meter that gradually depletes during each race. If the player's vehicle displays a red color from taking too much damage, or if it is running low on fuel, it must make a pit stop. Unlike other racing video games, the pit crew is fully controlled by the player, who must refuel the vehicle and replace its worn-out tires. Up to four players can play by taking alternating turns. ColecoVision version uses the ColecoVision's Expansion Module #2 steering wheel/pedal peripheral. Reception The Commodore 64 Home Companion noted that the game's pit stop feature \\"slows the action down, but it adds an element of strategy (Can I make it around again without blowing out that right-front tire?) to what would otherwise be just another eye-hand coordination game.\\" Roy Wagner of Computer Gaming World felt that Pole Position was a superior racing game, and wrote that Pitstop \\"is the pits because that is where the race is won or lost.\\" Computer Fun gave the game 2.5 out of 4 and wrote that \\"fantasy is a fragile thing and the reality of Pitstop is something less than harrowing, as the driver finds when he braces himself for an outrageous switchback only to find it as tame as a suburban boulevard. Disappointingly, the six 'unforgiving' tracks merely blend into a pureed sameness. Graphically, the cars are done in fine style but the trackside scenery consists of green flatlands and an occasional bush or sign. [‚Ä¶] As for gameplay, Pitstop is at its best in the more difficult settings where things are a little more hectic and the side-to- side motion of the cars add challenge.\\" Ted Salamone of Electronic Games reviewed the Commodore 64 version and wrote, \\"The engine rev sounds are realistic, the pit screen unforgettable, and the action absolutely hair- raising.\\" Stephen Reed of Hi-Res wrote that Pitstop \\"does not have the extended playability or good graphics\\" of Pole Position. Reed called the game's pit stop concept a \\"unique feature\\", but wrote, \\"While this is an interesting aspect to the program, its attractiveness is short lived because the pits soon become an obstacle to racing.\\" Shay Addams of Compute! praised the game's \\"exciting competition and action\\" and its pit stop feature, writing that the game \\"requires strategy and split-second decision-making that are missing in other racing games.\\" Addams wrote that Pitstop was more enjoyable when playing with others, and noted that the game's graphics were not as detailed as Pole Position, but concluded, \\"Since veteran race car drivers agree that many professional races are won in the pits, not on the track, Pitstop has to be one of the most realistic and playable racing simulations available.\\" References External links Pitstop at Atari Mania 1983 video games Atari 8-bit family games ColecoVision games Commodore 64 games Epyx games Racing video games Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Pitstop (video game)"},{"id":"51369066","title":"1978 Wisconsin gubernatorial election"},{"id":"51369070","text":"Grevillea phanerophlebia, commonly known as the prominent vein grevillea and the vein leaf grevillea, is a shrub of the genus Grevillea native to a small area on the west coast in the Mid West region of Western Australia. Description The erect and straggly evergreen shrub typically grows to a height of and has terete non-glaucous branchlets. It has simple spiny dissected tripartite shallowly divided mid green leaves with a blade that is long. It blooms in August or September and produces an axillary raceme regular inflorescence with white or cream flowers with white or cream styles. Later it forms rugose oblong or ellipsoidal and glabrous fruit that is long. Seeds produced are smooth approximately and with an obovoid to ellipsoidal shape with a waxy to membraneous margin. The plant is able to regenerate from seed only. Habitat The shrub is found in open forest areas of tall to low trees or on heathland, close to Mingenew, Mullewa and Eradu on the Geraldton sandplains and hills area. It is able to grow in gravelly, sandy or loamy soils. It is only known from one population of two plants that are probably juveniles, and another population that contained no live plants. Plant species associated with G. phanerophlebia include Waitzia nitida, Acacia saligna, Acacia acuminata, Allocasuarina campestris, Hakea erinacea, Mesomelaena sp., Austrostipa elegantissima, Aristida holathera, Bonamia rosea, Grevillea amplexans and Grevillea biternata. The Botanic Garden and Parks Authority in Perth, Western Australia currently have 36 plants of Grevillea phanerophlebia in cultivation, and seeds taken from one population are in storage. History The first collection of the plant was made in 1901 by the German botanist Ludwig Diels from near Mingenew. The Western Australian Herbarium first collection made from the species was made in 1931 from near Mullewa. Grevillea phanerophlebia was declared as Rare Flora in March 1999 and ranked 1999 as Critically Endangered (CR). It currently meets World Conservation Union (IUCN 2000) Red List Category ‚ÄòCR‚Äô under several criteria. Despite being rare in the wild, it has been in cultivation since the 1980s in New South Wales and Victoria. G. phanerophlebia is commercially available and sold as a waterwise informal hedge, barrier or border plant that can be grown in areas with hot overhead sun suitable in dry soils and able to tolerate light frost.

The Name Tunganistan was coined by the Austrian Mongolia expert Walther Heissig. The territory included the oases of the southern Tarim Basin, the centre of the region was Khotan. Tunganistan was surrounded on three sides by troops loyal to Xinjiang governor Sheng Shicai and to the South by the Tibetan Plateau.Lars-Erik Nyman: Great Britain and Chinese, Russian and Japanese interests in Sinkiang, 1918‚Äì1934, Stockholm 1977, p. 122.  History  In 1934, the First East Turkestan Republic ended. Afterwards the Muslim Tungan warlord Ma Zhongying vanished into Soviet territory. His successor was Ma Hushan, who fled from Kashgar to Khotan.Andrew D. W.

Ma Hushan regularly received telegrams, ostensibly from his brother-in-law in the USSR, promising the leader of Tunganistan that Ma Zhongying would soon return.Mark Dickens: The Soviets in Xinjiang 1911‚Äì1949, academia.edu 1990. Ma Hushan governed the region from 1934 until 1937, he was called \\"King\\" by his subjects. During his rule the Hui Muslims of Inner China governed the territory like a colony with Turkic Muslim subjects.Andrew D. W. Forbes: Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: A Political History of Republican Sinkiang 1911‚Äì1949, Cambridge (England) 1986, p. 128. In Tunganistan, taxation was heavy in order to support the needs of the 36th Division of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army. Farmers and merchants were exploited for the benefit of the military garrisons. Forced conscription was common.Joanne Smith: Four Generations of Uyghurs: The Shift towards Ethno-political Ideologies among Xinjiang's Youth, Inner Asia, Vol. 2 (2000), No. 2, pp. 195‚Äì224 (here: p. 204). In 1935, the troops of Tunganistan crushed the Charkhlik Revolt in the region of present-day Ruoqiang County. Additionally by 1935, inflation was out of control, homesick Tungan troops were deserting, and Uyghurs frequently fought with Tungan soldiers in the streets of Khotan.Joanne Smith: Four Generations of Uyghurs: The Shift towards Ethno-political Ideologies among Xinjiang's Youth, Inner Asia, Vol. 2 (2000), No. 2, pp. 195‚Äì224 (here: pp. 204/205).

In 1937, Soviet troops attacked Tunganistan and incorporated it into the realm of Sheng Shicai's regime.

Wube Illustrated by Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville Wube Haile Maryam, also called Wube Haile Mariam or Dejazmach Wube, (1799‚Äì1867)Richard Pankhurst, The Ethiopians: A History (Oxford: Blackwell, 2001), p. 136 was a regional ruler and dejazmach in Tigray, Simien, and other coastal territories, in an area that is now part of northern Ethiopia and central Eritrea. Wube is remembered in Eritrea for barbarous military raids. He was defeated and imprisoned in 1855 by Kassa Hailu. Some sources date Wube's defeat as the end of Ethiopia's Zemene Mesafint era.  Dejazmach  Wube was born in 1800. He is variably reported as having become the regional chief of Simien upon the death of his father Dejazmach Haile Maryam in 1826, or as having ruled from 1831. He was a persistent warlord, who leveraged his governorship of the district of Wogera into a wider rule of Simien and Tigray. Considered one of the more powerful of numerous concurrently feuding regional warlords, Wube is recognized as having had ambitions on becoming emperor himself, and he arranged for completion of the ongoing building of Dirasge Mariam Church for his coronation. His status is underpinned by his being exempted from the usual requirement of vassals to attend the court of Ras Ali II, regent to the Emperor of Ethiopia. In 1841, at Wube's request, the See of Alexandria sent Abuna Salama III to become the new patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. That same year, Wube defeated Ras Ali II in battle, taking Gondar, the then capital of Ethiopia. Nonetheless, Ras Ali II escaped. In February 1842, their armies clashed again in the Battle of Debre Tabor, where Wube's initial tactical superiority from imported firearms almost carried the day, until a detachment under Dejazmach Birru Aligaz, Ras Ali's uncle, went to pay homage with his forces to Wube's encampment but found him very intoxicated, also without guards and took him prisoner, thus enabling Ali to retain his title.Abir, The Era of the Princes: the Challenge of Islam and the Re- unification of the Christian empire, 1769-1855. London. Longmans, 1968 Although Ras Ali II and Wube continued to have some tension, they avoided any serious clash as there was constant threat from Egyptian rulers from the north. Subsequently, Wube was unsuccessful in his efforts to take Massawa and in 1844 withdrew inland, finally leaving Tigray in 1846. Kassa Hailu later definitively defeated Ali II in the Battle of Ayshal, 29 June 1853, whereupon Ali disappeared from history. Ras Wube (mounted) on a painting from c. 1880  Defeat and death Some sources date the ending of Zemene Mesafint era, during which Ethiopia lacked effective central authority from approximately 1769 to approximately 1855, to Ras Ali II's defeat at the Battle of Ayshal in 1853, after which Kassa became the de facto ruler of Ethiopia. However, other sources denote the ending of the Zemene Mesafint as Wube's defeat in 1855, as the last remaining autonomous regional ruler. On 9 February 1855, Wube's army was defeated by Kassa Hailu and Wube was captured and imprisoned. Within a few days, Kassa, who had previously been titled as a Negus, was finally crowned Emperor Tewodros II, ironically by Abuna Salama III in the Dirasge Mariam Church. Although some sources suggest that Wube may have died in 1855, it is more commonly accepted that he spent the later part of his years in prison and died in 1867.

He is portrayed by actor Johnny Depp. He serves as the films' male protagonist. Audience reception of the character was positive.  Appearances  = Alice in Wonderland (2010) = In the film, Tarrant takes Alice Kingsleigh toward the White Queen's castle and relates the terror of the Red Queen's reign while commenting that Alice is not the same as she once was. Tarrant subsequently helps Alice avoid capture by the Red Queen's guards by allowing himself to be seized instead. He is later saved from execution by the Cheshire Cat and calls for rebellion against the Red Queen. Near the end of the film, the Hatter unsuccessfully suggests to Alice that she could stay in Wonderland and consummate his feelings for her. = Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016) = In the beginning of the film, Tarrant is in poor health because his family is missing following the Attack of the Jabberwocky. The attack occurred shortly after his father, Zanik, a hat retailer, seemed to reject Tarrant's gift of a hat creation. For the majority of the film, Alice Kingsleigh travels through time (with an object called the \\"Chronosphere\\") attempting to rescue the Hatter's family from death, as he appears to be dying. At the end of the film, the Hightopp family turns out to be alive, and he is reunited with them. The Hatter's backstory is also explored in the film. Rhys Ifans plays Zanik, the Hatter's father, while Simone Kirby plays Tyva, the Hatter's mother with Joe Hurst, Siobhan Redmond, Oliver Hawkes, Frederick Warder, Eve Hedderwick Turner, and Tom Godwin playing members of his extended family.  Reception  The character has been highly well received by audiences. Many critics have praised Depp's performance. Mia Wasikowska, who plays Alice in the film, said that the Hatter and Alice \\"both feel like outsiders and feel alone in their separate worlds, and have a special bond and friendship.\\" Burton explained that Depp \\"tried to find a grounding to the character ... as opposed to just being mad. In a lot of versions it's a very one-note kind of character and you know [Depp's] goal was to try and bring out a human side to the strangeness of the character.\\" The Hatter's orange hair is an allusion to the mercury poisoning suffered by milliners who used mercury to cure felt; Depp believes that the character \\"was poisoned ... and it was coming out through his hair, through his fingernails and eyes\\". Depp and Burton decided that the Hatter's clothes, skin, hair, personality and accent would change throughout the film to reflect his emotions. In an interview with Depp, the character was paralleled to \\"a mood ring, [as] his emotions are very close to the surface\\". The Hatter is \\"made up of different people and their extreme sides\\", with a gentle voice much like the character's creator Lewis Carroll reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish Glaswegian accent (which Depp modeled after Gregor Fisher's Rab C. Nesbitt character) reflecting a darker, more dangerous personality. Illusionary dancer David \\"Elsewhere\\" Bernal doubled for Depp during the \\"Futterwacken\\" sequence near the end of the film. David Edelstein of New York Magazine remarked that while the elements of the character suggested by Depp don't entirely come together, \\"Depp brings an infectious summer-stock zest to everything he does: I picture him digging through trunks of old costumes and trying on this torn vest and that dusty cravat and sitting in front of his dressing-room mirror playing with makeup and bulging his eyes and sticking out his tongue.\\" J. Hoberman of The Village Voice simply referred to Depp's Hatter as \\"amusing\\". Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic said that \\"Depp is exactly what you'd expect, which is a good thing. Gap-toothed and leering, at times he looks like Madonna after sticking a fork in a toaster. How he finds his characters is anybody's guess, a sort of thrift-store warehouse of eccentricities, it seems like. But it works.\\" Chris Vognar of The Dallas Morning News stated that Depp's \\"wide eyes and high whimsy feel a bit derivative of his Willy Wonka (another collaboration with Burton), but he invests so much of his ample energy and instinct in these roles that it's hard to complain.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly had a more mixed opinion and commented that Depp as the Hatter is \\"a fantastic image, but once Depp opens his mouth, what comes out is a noisome Scottish brogue that makes everything he says sound more or less the same. The character offers no captivatingly skewed bat-house psychology. There isn't much to him, really‚Äîhe's just a smiling Johnny one-note with a secret hip-hop dance move‚Äîand so we start to react to him the way that Alice does to everything else: by wondering when he's going to stop making nonsense.\\" Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times stated that \\"there's no denying Depp's gifts and abilities, but this performance feels both indulgent and something we've all seen before.\\" Christopher Rosen of The New York Observer observed that acting-wise, \\"Mr. Depp is tasked with the heavy lifting, but, festooned in an orange fright wig and some very uncomfortable-looking contact lenses, he can't even be bothered to keep his accent straight (it vacillates between an effete lisp and an angry Scottish brogue) ... he acts like even being on set was a chore. It wouldn't have been a surprise to see him break the fourth wall, take the blue pill and return home to Paris. Frankly, with how much the film drags, you'll probably wish he had.\\"  References   External links  * Film characters introduced in 2010 Tim Burton characters Alice in Wonderland (franchise) ","title":"Tarrant Hightopp"},{"id":"51369145","text":"The Nova Phor is an Austrian two-place paraglider that was designed by Hannes Papesch and produced by Nova Performance Paragliders of Innsbruck.

Democrat Nelson Dewey won the election with 52% of the vote, winning his second term as Governor of Wisconsin. Dewey defeated Whig Party candidate Alexander L. Collins and Free Soil Party candidate Warren Chase. This was the second Wisconsin gubernatorial election, and the first election for a full two-year gubernatorial term. Democratic Party Nelson Dewey was the incumbent governor, having been elected in the 1848 election. He was a prominent lawyer and real-estate investor in Grant County, Wisconsin. He did extensive business with the lead-mining industry, which was a major component of the economy of the Wisconsin Territory. He had been a member of nearly every session of the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature, first as a member of the Territorial Assembly, from 1838 to 1842, then as a member of the Territorial Council from 1842 to 1846. He served as Speaker of the Territorial Assembly in 1840, and President of the Territorial Council in 1846. =Other candidates= Although Dewey was renominated on the first ballot, two other names were placed in candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination at the 1849 State Democratic Convention, held in Madison: * Harrison Carroll Hobart, of Sheboygan, was a state senator and prominent lawyer. He had also served in the Wisconsin Territorial House of Representatives. * William Rudolph Smith, of Mineral Point, had been a colonel in the War of 1812 and served in the Pennsylvania General Assembly before moving to the Wisconsin Territory. In Wisconsin, he negotiated an important treaty with the Chippewa, obtaining a portion of their land, and had been a delegate to Wisconsin's first constitutional convention. =Nomination= colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"text- align:center;background-color: #e9e9e9;\\"Vote of the Wisconsin Democratic Convention, September 6, 1849 Free Soil Party Warren Chase was, at the time of the 1849 election, a member of the Wisconsin State Senate, having been elected on the Democratic Party ticket in 1848. He represented Fond du Lac and Winnebago counties. Chase was an abolitionist and temperance advocate, and was one of only three delegates to attend both the first and second Wisconsin constitutional conventions. Chase was also notable for his fourierist beliefs, having participated in the founding of the Wisconsin phalanx (commune) at Ceresco, Wisconsin. Whig Party Alexander L. Collins was a prominent lawyer in Madison. At the time of the 1849 election, he was a member of the first Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin. He had been the Whig Party candidate for United States Congress in the 2nd congressional district in 1848. He also served in the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature from 1846 until the territorial government was replaced by the state government in 1848.

El Elegante (Spanish for elegant one) is a maar (a type of volcanic crater) located in the Gran Desierto de Altar in the Sonoran Desert, Mexico. At deep and across, the crater is the largest in the volcanic complex of Pinacate Peaks.  Formation  The crater was formed about 32,000 years ago when groundwater seeping down into the earth came into contact with magma rising from beneath the crust. The hot magma instantly turned the water to steam, and the sudden high pressure triggered a phreato-magmatic explosion, blowing a huge hole in the ground, and blasting out rocks, magmatic material and ash, forming the crater. Ejecta was spread out to a distance of about from the crater over what is now the desert floor. The crater rim is higher than the surrounding desert and shows layers of rock built up from the ejecta. El Elegante contained a lake during the pluvial period preceding the last altithermal period.  Biosphere Reserve  The crater is located in an important area and nature reserve called El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve, which was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2012.

The Texas Bullion Depository is a bullion depository based in Texas in the United States. It was the first state- administered depository to be established in the United States; previous depositories were either at federal level or private companies. Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar announced it was open for business on June 6, 2018. In 2017, the Comptroller‚Äôs office partnered with Lone Star Tangible Assets (LSTA) as the vendor to build and operate the depository. LSTA, a Texas-based company that also owns precious metals dealers U.S. Gold Bureau and WholesaleCoinsDirect.com, operates a highest-rated, Class 3 vault that serves as the depository‚Äôs initial location. Planning for a permanent home for the Texas Bullion Depository began in 2018, at a site in Leander, Texas that should be completed in 2019. Tom Smelker, director of Comptroller Treasury Operations, was named administrator of the depository in 2017. The depository eliminates the need for out-of-state storage and gives Texas the opportunity to become a ‚Äúcommodities hub for the continent,‚Äù according to Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake. Free from the jurisdiction of governmental or quasi- governmental authority beyond the state of Texas, the depository offers a safe storage facility for the bullion of both institutions and individuals and creates a more stable Texas economy. The depository accepts deposits of gold, silver, platinum, palladium and rhodium. History Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the Texas Bullion Depository Bill, HB 483, on June 19, 2015. Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, originally filed the bill on December 10, 2014. The bill was co-authored by 31 other colleagues and sponsored by Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham. In 2013 Capriglione announced his interest in creating the depository and was subsequently contacted by people around the world interested in storing their gold in a Texas depository. Capriglione was able to draw support for the depository by requiring that it be run by the private sector with no costs to taxpayers. The bullion depository will hold precious metals deposits owned by multiple entities: individuals, businesses, financial institutions and even foreign countries. Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar issued a request for information, RFI 212P, regarding the location of the depository. Many companies replied, including Texas Precious Metals, Brink's and Anthem Vault. All three companies envision different solutions for the storage of the precious metals. Tarek Saab, chief operating officer of Texas Precious Metals, proposed building a $20 million depository on 40-acres in Shiner, Texas, without the cost of taxpayer dollars. Brink's is in favor of relocating the state's‚Äô precious metals to one of their branch locations instead of constructing a physical building. Anthem Vault addressed the issue of location by offering the implementation of multiple locations for the depository, including retail storefronts and coin shops across the state. Hegar worked through business models with his task force to ensure Texas has a safe and secure depository. The June 2017 announcement of Lone Star Tangible Assets as the partnering vendor concluded a lengthy evaluation period and followed the announcement that Tom Smelker, the director of Treasury Operations at the Comptroller's office, was named the depository administrator. Legislation Texas HB 483 authorizes the establishment and administration of a state bullion depository to serve as the custodian, guardian and administrator of bullion that may be transferred to or otherwise acquired by this state or an agency, political subdivision, or another instrumentality of the state. The bill grants the Comptroller authority to interpret and implement the Act and allows the Texas Bullion Depository to \\"purchase\\" and \\"sell\\" precious metals in the \\"course of ordinary business\\" (Sec. 151.003). The bill states that the Texas Bullion Depository should be a monument to the state of Texas, a recruitment attraction for business, and an asset for domestic and international relations. Challenges and reactions Although there has been both public and private support behind the bill ‚Äì‚Äì which passed nearly unanimously with only one \\"nay\\" vote ‚Äì‚Äì some disagree that the bill should have been passed, claiming that any depository concept doesn't make financial sense for taxpayers, and that gold is not a practical investment for the state. The University of Texas Investment Management Company (UTIMCO) has gold bullion stored in New York, worth $647 million. According to Lois Kolkhorst, HSBC Bank in New York City charges Texas a fee to store each individual bar of gold. HB 483 does not require UTIMCO to move the $647 million in precious metals back to Texas. New York City is within the COMEX trading market. Currently, all COMEX rated facilities are located within 150 miles of New York City and earning a COMEX membership out of this region may be difficult.

While eating breakfast with her boyfriend and a family friend in the Rollerville Cafe in Flumeville, California, she headed for the restroom. She was following her friend, but the friend soon found that Kreimer had disappeared. Kreimer likely never entered the bathroom. At the time of her disappearance she was dressed in street clothes, but she was barefoot. She had no money, credit cards, or identification documents with her. Her jacket was later found discarded along the road. Background Twenty-six-year-old Asha Kreimer, who held dual US-Australian citizenship, had been living with her boyfriend in Albion, California, for three years when she suffered a mental health crisis. She had never previously had mental health issues. However, after being awake for four nights and shouting incoherently, she was taken to Mendocino Coast District Hospital in Fort Bragg, California, on September 20, 2015. The contractor who had taken over when Mendocino County privatized mental health services was supposed to evaluate her under California Code 5150 to determine whether she was a risk to herself or others. However, Kreimer was so resistant to having her vital signs taken prior to a mental health evaluation that the Fort Bragg Police Department was called. In the end, Kreimer was released without evaluation or treatment to her boyfriend and a visiting Australian childhood friend. Disappearance After Kreimer's release, the trio then drove south toward Point Arena, stopping at the Rollerville Cafe in Flumeville. At 9:30 a.m., while they were in the cafe, Kreimer's friend got up to go to the restroom. A few seconds later, Kreimer decided that she would also go to the restroom, and followed her friend, although the friend was unaware that Kreimer was behind her. When the friend returned to the table, Kreimer's boyfriend told her that Kreimer had followed her to the bathroom, but the friend said she never saw Kreimer in the bathroom. Investigators believe that Kreimer never entered the bathroom and wandered off instead. At the time she disappeared, Kreimer was barefoot and dressed in black skinny jeans and a gray hoodie. She left without money, credit cards, or identification. She also may have left her cell phone behind, though that is debated. Her jacket was subsequently found along the road to the Point Arena Light. Continued search There have been subsequent vague reports of Kreimer. According to a spokesman for the Mendocino County Sheriff's Office, she supposedly returned north to her Albion home and retrieved her German shepherd. A surfer at Gualala, south of the cafe, also purportedly saw her at about 3 p.m. on the day she disappeared. , the search for Kreimer continued, as her friends at her ancestral home in Alice Springs, Australia raised funds to continue looking. As of April 24, 2018, Kreimer's mother reportedly still travels back to California from Australia every few months to look for her daughter. It has been reported to Mendocino County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) by Kreimer's family that it is possible that Kreimer has taken an assumed name, related to a reported mental health incident in the days before her disappearance. Media In 2017, Kreimer's mother, Jeannie, was approached by Netflix to produce a story on her daughter. Episode 18 of the Thin Air Podcast covers Kreimer's disappearance.

The liberal-dominated Congress called upon the election which was held in all five member states; Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. The two main parties were the Liberals and the Conservatives. After the election conservative candidate Jos√© Cecilio del Valle obtained 41 electoral votes and his main rival, liberal Manuel Jos√© Arce, gained 34 of a total of 79 electoral votes cast. The total of electoral votes were supposed to be 82, so the liberal-lead Congress declared the election void arguing that no candidate obtained a majority and appointed Arce as president, much to the outrage of Valle and his supporters. Arce tried to appease Valle by offering him the Vice-Presidency, but Valle declined. He did retired from Congress without calling for an uprising. Nevertheless, civil war would happen anyway as Arce‚Äôs centralism and authoritarian government would cause the uprising of the Liberals in El Salvador and Honduras that sprang after Arce dissolved the Parliament in Guatemala in 1826. Arce would eventually resign as president and the war would only end when rebel leader Francisco Moraz√°n took over Guatemala in 1829, calling for new elections soon afterwards.

A BWB holster offers deeper concealment when compared to the traditional IWB (Inside WaistBand) holster, which results in more noticeable comfort. Because a BWB Holster is worn inside the pants and below the belt it is often the most concealed type of holster available that works with most clothing options. Advantages and Disadvantages The primary benefit of a BWB holster is deep concealment ensuring the firearm is securely and discreetly concealed at all times. Many types of IWB, OWB (Outside WaistBand) and SOB (Small Of Back) holsters can expose the firearm when the shirt becomes lodged between or if the wearers top is too short or snug; with a BWB this is not an issue because the firearm is completely concealed within the pants, shorts, slacks or skirt. Another benefit of the BWB holster it that it is designed to flow naturally with the body creating flexibility at the pivot points resulting in easy wearability and all day comfort. Holsters that are worn at the waistband and belt, or sometimes even around the shoulders, can often restrict movement causing pinching or rubbing of the skin and general discomfort. When carrying a firearm retention ability is always a consideration and the BWB holster excels in this area as well. Due to its deep concealment the BWB holster is less likely to be accessed by another person. The caveat to this is that the BWB holsters higher level of retention and deep concealment can cause the firearm to be more difficult to retrieve, especially while seated, putting it at a slight disadvantage. Most often choosing the correct size BWB holster for the firearm can often help overcome this issue and commonly leaning back with a BWB holster gains better access to the firearm from a seated position. Materials Options for a BWB holster materials vary with leather and denim being the two most common found. Leather and denim are both breathable and attractive in appearance. While denim is often less expensive, leather is more durable and can be dyed in many colors; leather will also take the form of the firearm and a quality leather is thick enough to provide protection from perspiration and other elements. Common Types and Styles Holster designs for firearms cover a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and materials. Holsters are generally designed to offer protection to the firearm, secure retention, and provide access to it. The most popular options of BWB holsters resemble fanny packs or a pouch type of concealment for the firearm. As an added safety feature a few of the BWB holsters ensure the trigger is inaccessible in the holster until the firearm is drawn. Concealment holsters are designed to easily conceal sub-compact and compact firearms while a few even offer options for full-sized firearms. Because BWB Holsters are designed to be worn below the waistband, under clothing and held close to the body, comfort is important.

It is used by high-volume purchasers to inform suppliers. RP requires consumers to have access to price and quality information, which is not general practice in many industries. Further, it does not help consumers with urgent needs, cognitive and/or other impairments. Reference pricing requires sufficient competition. Otherwise, consumers have no choice about providers, who in turn face less pricing pressure. Reference pricing could encourage lower quality. \\"Reference price\\" in this context is distinct from its use in behavioral pricing scholarship.Kalyanaram, Gurumurthy, and Russell S. Winer(1995).

The insurer announces prices that it is willing to pay for specific surgical procedures, pharmaceuticals and other services. If the provider charges a higher price, the patient is responsible for the balance. One study estimated that about 40 percent of health care spending is for services for which patients could shop. Appropriate services include hip and knee replacement, colonoscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine, computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head or brain, nuclear stress test of the heart, and echocardiogram because they have relatively uniform protocols and are less likely to experience variation in quality. In health care, a more common alternative is to limit patients to a specific network of providers who have accepted the pricing and other terms specified by the insurer. RP provides consumers a broader choice of providers. Further, some large employers contract with regional \\"centers of excellence,\\" such as Cleveland Clinic. Several countries are using RP, such as external reference pricing, to compare the national drug prices against other countries' or other formulations of a similar therapeutic class. On May 2, 2014, the Obama administration published its approval for large/self-insured firms to use RP for health care services and to use the price of generic drugs as the RP for other drugs, which would encourage patients to favor generics over non-generics. Costs that exceed the RP are not counted for ACA's out-of- pocket limits.  CalPERS  In 2011 California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) adopted reference pricing for 450,000 members. The approach was used for knee and hip replacement surgery, arthroscopy, colonoscopies, cataract removal surgery and other elective procedures. For example, the RP for a knee or hip replacement surgery was $30,000. As before, the patient was responsible for 20 percent of the first $15,000, paying a maximum of $3,000. The insurer covered the next $15,000. However, if the procedure cost $40,000, the patient was responsible for the final $10,000. Initially 41 of the hundreds of hospitals provided knee and hip replacement procedures at or below the RP with acceptable quality. Some hospitals charged more than $100,000. Multiple studies found that patients sought out the lower cost facilities. Prices for knee and hip replacements and cataract surgery fell by an average 20%. Other procedures fell by similar percentages. Many higher price facilities lowered their prices. Quality was apparently unaffected. By contrast, prices paid by employer-sponsored plans rose by about 5.5 percent. CalPERS reduced cost-sharing for patients who chose a (lower cost) outpatient surgical center, instead of a (higher cost) hospital. = Energy = The Canadian province of Alberta operates an RP scheme for natural gas. It is a monthly, weighted average of the consumer price in Alberta and a price at the Alberta border, with transporting and marketing adjustments. The system became effective in 1994.

The company specializes in the design and manufacture of paragliders in the form of ready-to-fly aircraft.Bertrand, Noel; Rene Coulon; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2003‚Äì04, page 23. Pagefast Ltd, Lancaster UK, 2003. The company was founded in 1989 and originally located in Innsbruck. In 2010 the company relocated its headquarters to Terfens. By 2016 the company had 110 employees, including 95 in the Mecsek Ballon KFT Hungarian production plant in P√©cs and 15 in Terfens. The company's first designer was Hannes Papesh. Other founders were Hermann Habe and competitive paraglider pilot Toni Bender. History big ears. The company's first design, the Nova CXC was sewn by Papesh on his mother's home sewing machine. The company initially operated from Wolfgang Lechner's apartment. In 1990 the company established a manufacturing relationship with Mecsek Ballon KFT in the Hungarian town of P√©cs to take on production. In the communist era Mecsek Ballon had been a balloon and mountaineer clothing manufacturer. Glider development was not without problems. In 1992 the Nova Phantom developed technical problems that could not be easily resolved and was replaced in the line by the Nova Ph√∂nix. Paraglider pilot Christian Heinrich won the 1999 World Paragliding Championships, held in Bramberg am Wildkogel, Austria, flying a Nova Krypton, although the contest was not validated, due to poor weather. The Nova Argon introduced in 2000 was DHV certified with unsheathed Kevlar lines, which greatly reduced drag in flight. The introduction of the Nova Carbon in 2001 resulted in delays filling customer orders as demand exceeded the ability of the fabric manufacturer to provide the cloth for construction. In 2002 The Carbon wing developed porosity in the field after delivery to customers, resulting in parachute-like descents. The fault lay with a batch of fabric which the fabric manufacturer had sub-contracted to a new factory and which had produced a sub-standard product. Nova replaced 65 Carbon wings of the 1440 sold that had developed issues. By the mid-2000s the company had a full line of gliders, including the beginner Phorus, intermediate Pheron and Artax, performance Aeron and Radon, plus the two-place flight training Phor. In 2003 Hungarian paraglider pilot Szilard Forgo flew a new world record to a declared goal of flying a Nova Aeron in Brazil. The 2008 contest season XContest resulted in the Nova Mentor being flown by the first-, third-, fourth-, seventh- and eighth-place finishers. In 2011 the Nova Mentor 2 dominated the standard class in the DHV league, with Mentor 2 pilots taking seven of the top ten places. In the XContest nine of the top ten gliders flown were Mentor 2s, including the top three.

He is an avid horse breeder, and in 2016 was reported to be one of Africa's richest people, worth $400 million. Joining forces with Christo Wiese in 2014, they embarked on an aggressive international expansion programme. Jooste's sudden resignation from Steinhoff on 5 December 2017 was followed by an involved and protracted controversy concerning Steinhoff's accounting practices in its Central European business dating back to 2016, or even 2014. The resulting uncertainty saw some ‚Ç¨10 billion (R160 billion) of Steinhoff's value wiped off the markets in a matter of days, with further losses as the situation unfolded. Aided by the Panama Papers, some journalists contend that insider trading occurred since Steinhoff's listing in 1998, and that the company's top brass acted on both sides of several deals. Leveraged Steinhoff shares served as currency to remunerate third parties, while shareholder value was diluted to acquisitions in which Jooste and a circle of associates had allegedly acquired prior stakes. The ensuing 3,000 page PwC investigation directly links Jooste and his CFO La Grange to the widespread fictitious transactions and accounting irregularities resulting in the Stellenbosch-headquartered company claiming R870 million from Jooste and R272 million from la Grange in a summons lodged at the high court in Cape Town. This would include both salaries and bonuses. Jooste was represented by lawyer Callie Albertyn of DKVG and advocates Jeremy Muller and Matthew Blumberg at his first court trial. A criminal prosecution is not expected soon, as the Hawks investigative unit admitted to making no progress at all, while the NPA lacks the in-house skills to address crimes of this nature. The ruinous impact on pension funds caused some South African lawmakers to express dismay at the lack of prosecution, and some demanded arrests of the culpable parties without delay. Early life Jooste's father was a postal worker and an avid horse race punter, instilling also in his son an interest in the races. Jooste matriculated from Afrikaanse Ho√´r Seunskool in 1978. Before the 2017 fallout in his business empire, he donated R10 million to the school's old-boys trust in his personal capacity. The donation has since been ring-fenced pending possible claims. He obtained a BAcc degree from Stellenbosch University in 1982, and subsequently obtained an honours degree at the University of Cape Town while completing his CA(SA) articles at a company then owned by Christo Wiese. Career After training as a chartered accountant in his 20s, he was appointed financial director of a publicly listed company. At age 27 he became the financial director of GommaGomma, where he met German entrepreneur Claas Daun, who coached him in business. On his part, Jooste convinced Daun in 1998 to merge his business with that of Bruno Steinhoff in Europe, and to list Steinhoff International on the JSE. Jooste and Daun acted as non-executive directors of Steinhoff International from 1988, and Jooste became its CEO in 2000. In his role as CEO, he built the company through numerous acquisitions from a small furniture manufacturer to a large corporation in the furniture industry. Piet Ferreira, a former investment banker who joined Steinhoff in 2002, was instrumental in structuring its public offerings and complex acquisitions during his 15-year tenure. Notably, they acquired Conforama in 2011 for ‚Ç¨1,207-million, a deal that boosted revenues and growth. 2014 through 2017 saw acquisitions in South Africa, the United Kingdom and United States, which included Mattress Firm for $2.4bn, and Poundland for ¬£597m in depressed retail conditions. Despite being partially funded with Steinhoff shares, the very large premium paid for Mattress Firm prompted scrutiny by independent analysts. The financial press initially ascribed the growth in Jooste's empire to either good luck or fortuitous timing, but the dissenting voices grew silent as Steinhoff raked in 36% growth in its 2014/2015 reporting year. In March 2015 Steinhoff bought Pepkor from Wiese and his Brait holding company at R63 billion (then ‚Ç¨4.8 billion), implying a very high p-e ratio of 37. After a failed merger with Shoprite in December 2016, Jooste and Wiese raised new capital in 2017 to split off Pepkor's South African division, a move received with some skepticism, as it was seen as a way to pay off Steinhoff's South African debt. The Pepkor acquisition also occurred without a cautionary announcement, raising suspicions at the FSB about possible insider trading leading up to the deal. The split implied a 71% holding in new entity, Star, which managed more than 5,000 South African stores, more than any other retailer. In October 2015 Jooste treated some Stellenbosch colleagues, friends and associates to a lavish excursion to the semi-final of the Rugby World Cup at Twickenham Stadium, which is estimated to have cost Steinhoff shareholders some R84 million. On 4 December 2015 Steinhoff announced that Oldenburg authorities had carried out a 26 November raid on its European headquarters in Westerstede, Germany, in order to review its balance sheet treatment of transfers to subsidiaries or third parties. Three days later, on 7 December, Steinhoff International Holdings transferred its primary listing from Johannesburg to Frankfurt, as, in Jooste's words, the majority of the firm's stores, customers and revenues were in Europe. Though describing it as \\"an important day in the history of Steinhoff\\", Jooste chose not to leave Cape Town to attend the event, citing \\"neck pain\\" which precluded travelling. Steinhoff's share price peaked at R90 a share in 2016, making it the 15th largest company listed on the Johannesburg exchange. The conglomerate employed over 130,000 people on five continents, and had become the second-largest home goods retailer in Europe after Ikea. In 2017, while its stock was held by some 340 investment funds in South Africa, in part due to its low volatility, its financial position began to worsen as its operating profit margin fell and net debt increased. Its March 2017 accounts showed ‚Ç¨3.1 billion in cash reserves, and ‚Ç¨18 billion ($21 billion) of exposure to creditors. Steinhoff limited its effective tax rate to between 8% and 12% for years, notwithstanding the company tax rate of 28% in South Africa, a fact pointed out as a red flag in the wake of the Steinhoff fallout. Manager Magazin revealed in August 2017 that Jooste was one of the managers being investigated in Germany. Prosecutors suspected that inflated revenues in the hundred million Euro range may have been reported on the balance sheets of subsidiaries. Handelsblatt reported in November 2017 that investors had become decidedly wary of the nestled and intransparent company structure that Jooste had created. Financial Mail journalists, aided by the Panama Papers, allege that Jooste had secret stakes in these daughter companies before they formally entered the Steinhoff fold, and that they were acquired at premiums to their value. They propose that this network of front-running companies would have been set up and operated by George Alan Evans and Malcolm King. On 4 December 2017 Steinhoff Holdings disclosed that it would release unaudited annual statements, and the next day Jooste resigned his position as CEO amid allegations of fraud and corruption. Soon after he also resigned from Phumelela Gaming & Leisure, Kenilworth Racing, and Mayfair Speculators. Jooste also submitted his resignation as chartered accountant, but SAICA rejected it, preferring instead to suspend him pending the outcome of disciplinary proceedings. According to Jooste, who was drawing a salary of R2,5 million ($190,000) a month at the time, the Steinhoff board had disagreed with his plan to find new auditors to sign off on the financials. = Steinhoff scandal = Manager Magazin reported in August 2017 that Jooste was being investigated by German authorities. In response Steinhoff's price slumped by 16% on the JSE, but recovered after the company denied the allegations. This was followed by allegations of accounting impropriety made by Steinhoff's former POCO subsidiary. Steve Booysen also alerted the board to possible accounting irregularities after engagements with Deloitte. Jooste's December 2017 resignation as CEO of Steinhoff came as the company admitted to \\"accounting irregularities\\" within the group, and announced that it had approached PwC to conduct an investigation into these. Chairwoman Heather Sonn revealed later that Steinhoff‚Äôs proprietary electronic records had been destroyed, complicating their investigation. In a letter to staff on his resignation, Jooste apologized for \\"big mistakes\\" and that he had caused bad publicity for the company. In an SMS sent on 6 December to former Steinhoff director Jo Grove, Jooste supposedly admitted that he had tried to cover up the impact of losses incurred by Steinhoff's American assets. Viceroy Research immediately tweeted a link to its 37-page report which detailed how Steinhoff had allegedly used off-balance-sheet entities to obfuscate losses and inflate earnings. Between 5 and 7 December Steinhoff's share price plunged from R46.25 to R10, and its bonds fell in line as Moody's downgraded Steinhoff bonds from investment grade (Baa3) to junk (B1). Christo Wiese's Upington Investment Holdings held over 30% of Steinhoff's stock and was the biggest loser in the collapse. South Africa's PIC (holding 7%), Coronation and BlackRock all made multi-billion rand losses. The European Central Bank sold its Steinhoff bonds after these had depreciated by 50%, while JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs all reported substantial loan losses. Lenders were owed over ‚Ç¨9 billion ($10.6 billion), but in June 2018 the majority were persuaded to a debt standstill and insolvency was avoided. It was soon labeled as the biggest corporate scandal in South African history and the biggest corporate crash in the country's history. As a result of Jooste's resignation, $11.4 billion was wiped off the value of the global furniture and clothing retailer. This in turn had a ripple effect on several other companies, including its subsidiary Steinhoff Africa Retail (Star), which may have guaranteed some of Steinhoff's debt. In seven days of trading, the Johannesburg exchange was hit by losses totaling about R295 billion ($24 billion), equivalent to 8% of South Africa's GDP. Steinhoff's share price dipped to R4.50 (down from R51.40 on 1 December) when the company's accumulated debt of R161 billion ($12.8 billion) was revealed. By late December, Steinhoff shares were on the brink of collapse, as management could not ascertain the magnitude of accounting irregularities, or provide assurances concerning individual companies' cash flows. Steinhoff however won approval to roll over ‚Ç¨690m of its financing, and its US subsidiary Mattress Firm secured a loan of $225m from Barclays. Steinhoff also sold PSG shares worth R4.7 billion to increase liquidity. In the wake of the scandal media articles identified Jooste's supposed mistress who occupied a luxury apartment in Bantry Bay, owned by Malcolm King. Reports also revealed that his hard- nosed executive style earned him a nickname, \\"the seagull\\", as he would \\"fly in and shit all over his subordinates before flying out.\\" =Investigations and litigation= PwC was tasked with an investigation into possible accounting irregularities or non-compliance with laws and regulations, and resumption of audited statements were subject to its outcome. German prosecutors confirmed in December 2017 that they were still investigating four current and former managers of a group (identified in the German press as Steinhoff), for accounting fraud. Steinhoff announced in February 2018 that they had submitted a report on Jooste to the Hawks on suspicion of fraud, for investigation and potential prosecution. Christo Wiese's Titan Group instituted a claim of R59 billion ($4.8 billion) against the Steinhoff conglomerate to recover cash investments made in 2015 and 2016. The prospects of this claim are however complicated by the fact that Wiese had been Steinhoff director since 2013. Wiese had a 22% shareholding in Steinhoff, the European component of which appears to have been subject to margin loans with different banks. In December 2017 Absa Bank and Investec Plc applied for the liquidation of Mayfair Speculators, when Mayfair's Steinhoff shares failed to provide sufficient collateral for its overdraft facilities. Absa, who was owed R350 million, expressed suspicion about R1.5 billion of assets that were transferred as a dividend in specie to Mayfair's holding company in August 2017. According to court documents, Mayfair owed Sanlam capital markets, Investec Plc and Absa more than R1.2 billion ($94 million) in total. Mayfair disclosed liabilities of R1 billion and assets worth R350 million. The Western Cape High Court postponed the banks' application, and the lenders subsequently agreed to grant Mayfair extension until the end of 2018 to facilitate a favourable disposal of its real estate and racehorses. Lenders held Mayfair accountable for R2.08 billion in total. In June 2018, a Dutch shareholders association, VEB, filed for damages against Deloitte in Rotterdam, for their failure in vetting the accounts of retailer Steinhoff Int. NV. The association planned to hold the directors, company, accountants, and potentially the banks that promoted Steinhoff's listing, jointly responsible. The German raid of 2015 recovered documents supposedly signed by Andreas Seifert, co-managing director of furniture chain XXXLutz. Seifert denied ever having seen or signed the papers, and filed criminal charges for document forgery. After filing additional lawsuits against Steinhoff in three countries, Seifert managed in April 2018 formalize his controlling stake in POCO, which Steinhoff disputed. In August 2018 a claim of R740 million was instituted against Jooste and his former colleague Ben la Grange by Jaap du Toit and the trustees of Le Toit Trust. The claim relates to PSG shares which Du Toit swapped for Steinhoff shares in 2015. When Jooste appeared before South African members of parliament in September 2018, he denied knowledge of any accounting irregularities on Steinhoff's part. He stated that Deloitte's independence became compromised in Steinhoff's dealings with Andreas Seifert, causing him (Jooste) to recommend appointment of new auditors, and the delay of the release date of audited results to the end of January 2018. In Jooste's view this would have warded off financial disaster in the group. Jooste stated that from 2015 onwards, Andreas Seifert managed to convince German authorities to conduct various tax investigations into Steinhoff, besides attempting to manipulate public prosecutors, capital market regulators and the press to gain information on Steinhoff, whereby the outcome of ongoing civil litigations between Seifert and Steinhoff in three countries could be affected. Horse trainer and breeder Jooste's racing silks Jooste entered the horse racing industry in the 1990s with 250 horses, and became the second biggest horse- racing investor in Africa, or perhaps the world. Jooste and his son in law, Stefan Potgieter, manage their horse racing interests through Mayfair Speculators, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mayfair Holdings that was founded in 1987. In 2004 Jooste became a partner in Klawervlei Stud, together with Johan du Plessis, Danie van der Merwe and John Koster, and they chose the four-leaf clover as their emblem. In the next decade other prominent investors joined the enterprise. Jooste's first horse, the stallion National Emblem, was bought for R100,000 in 1993 and became a champion. Mayfair Speculators owned South Africa's best racehorse, Legal Eagle, a six-time Grade 1 winner, and Edict Of Nantes, a dual Grade 1 winner. They were sold in December 2017 for R3.2 million and R9.9 million respectively. In 2016, The Conglomerate won the Durban July as an outsider. Jooste, in various partnerships, was a regular buyer at racing sales. In 2014 he impressed with his buying power at Arqana's premium sale in Deauville. In 2015 he added 12 yearlings to his stables at Tattersalls Book One, for a total of ¬£4.3 million.

Production The Woes of Roller Skaters was apparently inspired by a 1905 or 1906 film by Path√© Fr√®res, featuring a character very similar to the exaggeratedly obese man in this film. M√©li√®s appears in the film as the passerby attacked by \\"Apaches\\" at the end. The actor Bruneval plays the commissioner of police, with M√©li√®s's set painter Claudel as one of the police officers. Fernande Albany plays one of the ladies. Themes The film is one of several M√©li√®s works in which spectators watching movement begin unintentionally to imitate it: in this case, a cancan and then a roller skating act. Like M√©li√®s's 1905 comedy The Scheming Gambler's Paradise, the film parodies the police by showing them making their own comical use of confiscated objects. Release The film was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company, and is numbered 1227‚Äì1232 in its American catalogues. (There was no known French release of the film.)

They held of fuel, which allowed them to be moved by a single person. The flimsy was well known for leaking; when used in the North African Campaign, some flimsies leaked 20%, and in some cases over 50% of the fuel they carried over a journey. One quartermaster reported that his of fuel had been reduced to just 30,000 over the journey - and was informed that even this was a \\"good effort\\". The problem with the containers was the crimped or soldered seams, which easily split during transportation, especially over the rocky desert terrain in North Africa. Containers were stacked on top of each other during shipping, and the upper layers crushed those below, resulting in fuel flowing freely in the bilges, with the resulting poisoning and fire risks. The favoured use by soldiers for the flimsy was as a small stove which could be used to heat meals and tea for the crews. A soldier would cut the flimsy in half, fill the bottom half with petrol-soaked sand and balance the other half on top, filled with water. This was known as a Benghazi Boiler or Benghazi Burner, after the embattled town of Benghazi. Both 4 gallon flimsies and the original 2 gallon cans were replaced by the jerrycan, copied from the much better German design of fuel container.

They are also found in increasing numbers off the Islands of the Tristan Da Cunha archipelago in the South Atlantic. They are frequently caught on the 3 northern Islands of Tristan Da Cunha, Nightingale and Inaccessible and were recently reported by Factory Manager Erik Mac Kenzie at Gough Island at 40 deg South which is 200 miles south of the other Islands. Fish in the size range 25 to 40 kg are not uncommon and are caught both from boats and the shore. Conservation status This fish is listed as \\"least concern\\" by the IUCN, on the basis that \\"significant global population declines have not been reported and are not suspected.

His areas of study include identity, sexuality, privilege, and marginalization.  Career and personal life  Assigned female at birth, Costello first attempted a gender transition in 1991, while working as an attorney in Washington, D.C. Due to the discrimination he experienced, he postponed his transition, and left the legal profession to pursue a degree and career in sociology. He transitioned to male after securing tenure as an associate professor of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, where he leads the LGBT Studies program. Costello has advocated for transgender and intersex people on issues including intersex surgery, eugenics, bathroom bills, TSA airline passenger screening, and the sometimes fraught relationships between intersex and transgender communities. He has analyzed the controversy over the gender testing of South African athlete Caster Semenya from an intersex perspective. Costello has suggested using the term ipso gender instead of cisgender for intersex people who agree with their medically assigned sex. Costello is the gestational father of a daughter, and is married to an intersex trans woman. In February 2017, Costello and his wife lost access to transition-related healthcare when the state of Wisconsin reinstated an exclusion on these services. Additionally, his employer required that he obtain and submit new proof of his gender identity, despite the fact that he had transitioned over a decade earlier.

Name The ethnonym kombumerri has been related to a Yugambeh word, g≈´mbo, which refers to a type of shellfish called a mudflat or cobra with -merri meaning \\"man\\" and thus means \\"cobra people\\". Such cobra were a delicacy in the aboriginal diet. The autonym of the people of the Nerang area is not known. Kombumerri was first registered in 1914, when, assisted by a local schoolteacher, John Lane, Bullum (John Allen), composed a grammar and word list of the Yugambeh dialect. In this work, Allen, who belonged to the Wangerriburra tribe, mentioned that it was the name for the Nerang River people. Whether this is a Wangerriburra exonym or not is not known. In 1923 Archibald Meston stated that the Nerang tribe was called the \\"Talgiburri\\", and Germaine Greer cites the authority of Margaret Sharpe for the view that the root of Talgiburri, namely talgi- represents dalgay (dry). She thus takes Dalgaybara to mean people of the dry sclerophyll forest, rather than salt-water people. The same root underlies the clan name Tulgigin, which is taken to mean \\"dry forest people\\", said to dwell south of the northern rim of the caldera. Meston also mentioned another Nerang tribe as distinct from the Talgiburri, namely the Chabbooburri, and, writing in 1923, considered both \\"extinct\\". John Gladstone Steele states that the Nerang river tribe was known as the Ngarangbal-speaking Nerang-ballun, and adds that the toponym nerang has several etymologies: ngarang has been taken to mean \\"little stream\\"; as a language name it might suggest that the Ngaranbal were a people who used the word ngaraa for the idea of \\"what\\"; alternatively it may be related to neerang/neerung, with the sense of shovel- nosed shark. Language The Kombumerri people spoke a dialect, of which some 500 words have been preserved, of the Yugambeh-Bundjalung languages. Knowledge of the grammar is otherwise sketchy. John Allen appears to have considered this coastal language as a dialect of Bandjalang, yet not mutually intelligible with Yugumbir. Modern linguists such as Terry Crowley have argued that the languages of this area consisted of two dialects, Ngarangwal between the Coomera and Logan rivers and a dialect employed between the Nerang and the Tweed, the latter with a 75% overlap with Nganduwal. Country Partial Yugambeh clan map Their tribal boundaries are said by Ysola Best to have extended north to the Coomera River, south to Tallebudgera Creek and west to the Gold Coast hinterland. According to John Allen's map, the Kombumerri were located south of the Bullongin clan on the Coomera River, and north-east of the Tweed clan (whose traditional name was not noted by Allen) within the Tweed Caldera, with the Wangerriburra in the hinterland to their west. Dreaming A story was recorded by Jack Gresty, a National Park Ranger who worked in the Numinbah Valley area. Gresty picked it up from the Duncan brothers. It concerns the Nerang culture hero Gowonda, a white-haired hunter and expert in training dingoes to hunt, particularly associated with Southport. He eventually died and his people grieved over their loss. Then: > One day some children were playing on the sandy beach between the Nerang > River and the ocean at a place we know as Main Beach when one cried out > 'look, there is Gowanda in the waves'. The other children looked and were > quite sure it was him. They ran to the camp to tell the others they had seen > Gowanda in the waves. Men, women and children came running out to the beach > and there was Gowanda swimming close to the shore. They could see him > clearly and could recognise him by his white fin, although in the dreamtime > he had been changed into a Dolphin. They could see him teaching the other > Dolphins to drive fish onto the beach so that his people could net them. > Among every shoal of Dolphins you will see the leader with a white fin, > which the Aborigines believed to be a descendant of Gowanda or another > hunter returned from the dreamtime. Dolphins were greatly appreciated for > their services and were not hunted in this area. In 1984, H. J. Hall asserted that the collaboration of aborigines and dolphins in fishing was restricted to an area further north, specifically to the Nunukul area of Amity Point on North Stradbroke Island. Sceptics make much of a remark by an early observer of the practice at Amity Point, Fairholme, writing in 1856, that \\"Porpoises abound in the Bay, but in no other part do the natives fish with their assistance.\\" His restrictive view was challenged by David Neil in 2002, who noted that the historic evidence, such as that of Curtis, James Backhouse and others, documented that this custom was attested as much more widespread along the Queensland coast down into colonial times. History of contact The Nerang area was first penetrated by whites searching for stands of cedar in 1842 when two boys, Edmund Harper and William Duncan (14) penetrated the Numinbah Valley as far as Cave Creek's outlet on the Nerang. One local history recounts that: > Two young men who had been companions for some time and were on friendly > terms with the natives were among the newcomers. They were Edmund Harper and > William Duncan. A rafting ground was first established at the mouth of > Little Tallebudgera Creek. Later Edmund Harper made his home there to which > he brought his mother. Harper and Duncan remained together in the district, > and associating with the natives, could speak the dialects of the Tweed and > Nerang tribes so well that the blacks could not tell from their speech that > they were not of the tribes. They were too young to work the massive red cedars there, but returned after some decades, Duncan establishing himself in the distinct in 1848 at Boobigan. Regarding Duncan's movements in the Nerang district, Gresty states: > William Duncan did pit sawing and squaring in and about Nerang, and with > other timber-getters, Jim Beattie, Fred Fowler. and John Johnston, they made > their first camp in the Numinbah Valley at Jigibill (the site later on of > Yaun's sawmill, which was destroyed by fire some years ago). Duncan's surviving sons (John, Robert, and Hugh) later served as the main informants on Aboriginal history for J.A Gresty's work in the Numinbah Valley. Fred Fowler also learnt language from the Nerang people, and provided a wordlist to Edward Curr of Nerang Creek words. Harper also married an Aboriginal woman from the Nerang area and had a son, Billy, and had occasion to challenge Archibald Meston's assertions regarding Nerang aboriginal names. Archibald Meston stated that the Aboriginal population on the Nerang river around 1870 was about 200.  Important landmarks  There are significant sites all over the Gold Coast, particularly at Burleigh Heads, Queensland. This mountain is a \\"sacred women's area\\" for the Kombumerri people and their ancestors today. There is a men's area not far from sacred mountain at the Jebribillum Bora Park on the Gold Coast Highway. Archaeologist Laila Haglund excavated the Broadbeach burial site, which was unknown to local Aboriginal people, and of which no record existed, that came to light in June 1963, about inland from Mermaid Beach and not far from the mouth of the Nerang River. Soil contractors had removed earth for reuse as garden fertiliser in the Gold Coast area without asking permission from the landowner, Alfred Grant of the Mermaid Keys Development Pty. Ltd. It became the first systematic archaeological excavation of an Aboriginal burial ground, undertaken with urgency also because the larvae of Christmas beetles were infesting the exposed bones. She and her amateur group managed to retrieve the remains of roughly 150 persons. Through the agency and the Kombumerri Aboriginal Corporation the bones were laid to rest in a nearby park at Broadbeach in 1988 with a plaque dedicated to their memory. Notable people Mary Graham, a philosopher of mixed Wakawaka and Kombumerri descent, has written on the philosophical background of Aboriginal world views.

Henry Machyn described the inauguration: \\"The 28 day of October (1556) the new mayor took his oath, and so went by water to Westminster with trumpets and the waites royal, and a gallant pinnace decked with streamers and guns and drums; the new mayor Master Offley, merchant taylor, and merchant of the Staple of Calais, and the two henchmen in crimson velvet imbrodered with gold an ell broad; and 40 poor bachelors, and they did give 40 blue gowns, cap, doublet and hose to the 40 poor men; and there was a godly pageant; and the trumpets had scarlet caps, and the waites.\\"Diary of Henry Machyn, pp. 117‚Äì18. On 7 February following the river journey was made again to Westminster, where both Offley and William Chester were knighted on the same occasion.Diary of Henry Machyn, p. 125. Among the notable events of his mayoralty was the arrival and visit of King Philip in March 1557, with a royal procession through the city from Tower Wharf, which Offley escorted. He led the civic welcome to the first ambassador of Tsar Ivan IV, Osip Gabrilowitsch Nepeya, who, having survived the last ill-fated voyage of Richard Chancellor, was in London throughout March and April.O. Dmitrieva and N. Abramova (eds), Britannia and Muscovy: English Silver at the Court of the Tsars (Yale University Press, 2006), pp. 18‚Äì19.

Among the many ceremonies and honours accorded to Nepeya he was banqueted at the Mayor's House, and Offley no doubt took an important role in his conducted inspections of the great places of the City.'A Discourse of the Honourable Receiving into England of the First Ambassador of the Emperor of Russia...

In a raging fever which afflicted London a number of aldermen died, making way for new elections, and several heretics were burned at the stake during the summer months. In August Offley represented the city as chief mourner at the memorial ceremony in London for King John III of Portugal.Wriothesley's Chronicle, II, p. 139. Machyn represents the same ceremony as being for the King of Denmark (who died in 1559). News was brought of the military victory against the French at St Quentin.Diary of Henry Machyn, pp. 118‚Äì155. Offley, himself a merchant of Calais, was able to complete his mayoral term before the loss of Calais in January of the following year, by which he personally suffered considerable losses of goods and lands, and England the loss of her last continental territory.Consult: E.E. Rich, The Ordinance Book of the Merchants of the Staple, Cambridge Studies in Economic History (Macmillan, New York 1937), p. 12. At that time his half-brother Richard Offley, Merchant Taylor, was his very efficient factor in Calais.The Offley Manuscript, pp. 4, 85‚Äì86.  Offley the Elizabethan  Offley's son Henry, who had been brought up with a command of French and Latin, acted as his factor in Bruges, selling wools, keeping accounts and receiving money for exchange into sterling.The Offley Manuscript, p. 4. He married Mary, a daughter of John White the Grocer and alderman, who (having been Sheriff in Offley's mayoralty) served as Lord Mayor in 1563‚Äì64. Offley became godfather to Mary's half-brother Thomas White at his baptism in February 1560/61.The Diary of Henry Machyn, p. 248.

Thereby the familial alliances of the Marian period (themselves expressive of more ancient kinships) were continued and carried down into the 17th century. At three important civic funerals of the 1560s Offley was among the leading mourners, for Sir Rowland Hill in November 1561,The Diary of Henry Machyn, pp. 271‚Äì72. for alderman David Woodroffe in March 1563 and again for Ranulph Cholmley (Recorder of London since 1553) in April 1563.The Diary of Henry Machyn, pp. 302‚Äì03, 307.

From 1559 Offley (by now a very wealthy man, but given to much charity and simple in his private tastes) served as president of Christ's Hospital,W. Trollope, A History of the Royal Foundation of Christ's Hospital (William Pickering, London 1834), pp. 309‚Äì10, and see p.132; Beavan, Aldermen of the City of London, II, p. 33. the house established in the former Grey Friars at Newgate for the reception and education of poor men's children. In 1565 he was among the substantial donors to Thomas Gresham's fund for the building of the Burse at the Cornhill.J.W. Burgon, The Life and Times of Sir Thomas Gresham, 2 Vols. (Robert Jennings, London 1839), II, pp. 500‚Äì03, at p. 502. In 1568‚Äì69 he joined with Sir Thomas Rowe (Mayor), Sir Thomas White, Sir Roger Martyn, Lionel Duckett and others in formulating a policy of retaliation against Spanish traders following the Duke of Alva's provocation.Burgon, Life and Times of Sir Thomas Gresham, II, pp. 277 ff., at pp. 290‚Äì91. Offley was Mayor of the Staple both of England and of Westminster at various times during the 1560s, and helped to draw up new ordinances for the Staplers.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. The Offley Manuscript states that he was repeatedly chosen as a man most worthy of that trust and dignity, because, in the absence of the Lord Chief Justice, the recognizances of the Staple were acknowledged before the Mayor of the Staple and the Recorder of London. He served into the 25th year of Elizabeth as alderman, becoming chief alderman and Father of the City of London (from 1571A.P.

He was Surveyor-General for Hospitals from 1567 to 1572, and Comptroller- General for Hospitals from 1572 until his death.Beavan, The Aldermen of the City of London, II, p. 33. His sister Margaret Kirton died in 1573: her will refers to her brothers and sisters, and to her Cradock cousins in Stafford.Will of Margaret Kirton, Widow of London (P.C.C. 1573). See Grazebrook, Heraldic Visitations of Staffordshire, notes pp. 224‚Äì25. In his late years Offley played a role in a dispute over lands in the Lime Street ward between St Augustine Papey and Bishopsgate. Some dwellings there having been improved by the removal of certain unruly inhabitants, the residents of Aldgate ward encouraged Sir Thomas to claim them for Aldgate. The contrary case, on behalf of Lime Street, was brought by Sir Rowland Hayward, and the matter was resolved at the wardmote (in Lime Street's favour) by the intervention of John Stow, who produced an ancient ledger formerly belonging to the dissolved Priory of Holy Trinity in Aldgate. In 1579 Richard Pype successfully claimed them for Bishopsgate ward.H. Thomas, The Ancient Remains, Antiquities and Recent Improvements of the City of London (Sears, London 1830), Vol. 2, p.355-56.  Death and exequies  Monument to Sir Thomas and Dame Joan Offley in the church of St Andrew Undershaft, 1582. Dame Joan Offley died late in 1578, and Sir Thomas Offley made his will in August 1580. He desired to be buried in Madeley church, or (if dying in London) in the middle aisle of the choir of St Andrew Undershaft, near to the graves of his wife and of David Woodroffe. He left about half of his wealth in charitable bequests, and made his son Henry his heir. A bequest was made to the daughter of John Dorrington, Haberdasher, late of London, presumably a member of his mother's family. He also acknowledged his brother JohnThe career and descendants of brother John Offley are told in The Offley Manuscript, pp. 149‚Äì153. and his half-brothers Robert, Thomas, Richard, Hugh and William Offley and their wives, and his brothers-in-law then living, Gyles Jacob and Robert Bowyer.Will of Sir Thomas Offley, Alderman of St Andrew Undershaft, City of London (P.C.C. 1582).Jacob and Bowyer were the husbands of Offley's half-sisters, see The Offley manuscript, p. 149.

The wall- mounted monument at his tomb, by Cornelius Cure, which survives in St Andrew Undershaft,Photograph of the Offley monument, by Stiffleaf, at ipernity. shows fully sculpted figures of Thomas and Joan kneeling at prayer in arched recesses either side of a central altar, in front of which are shown their three sons, two of whom (as the inscription records), 'it pleased god above by death to call for'. The scene is enclosed by free-standing pillars at either side, over a balustrade. Sculpted cherubs recline upon skulls above the cornice, and in addition to Offley and Nechylls heraldry there are shields for the Merchant Taylors, The Muscovy Company, and the Merchants of the Staple.

History Vintage photo of the Jennow House The property was part of a large lot at present-day No. 8‚Äì14, which had still not been developed in 1635. It is believed that brewer Jacob Byssing constructed a building at the site prior to his acquisition of the entire corner lot at No. 12‚Äì14 between 1689 and 1692. No. 12 was sold off in 1702. The current building was constructed in 1792 for brewer Mathias Rohde, who owned the site from 1785 until 1801, and it was then owned by his widow Christence Cathrine until 1804. Lieutenant Colonel F. A. Schleppegrell (1792‚Äì1850) lived in the building from 1844 to 47. Minister of Internal Affairs Peter Georg Bang (1797‚Äì1861) lived in the building in 1849. The grocer Andreas Jennow purchased the property in 1949. In 1916, he had co- founded the trading company Jennow, Maage & Co., part of Russisk Handelskompagni which traded on Russia.

In 2014, he ran, unsuccessfully, for the United States House of Representatives as a Republican. He placed eighth in the open primary, obtaining approximately two percent of the votes cast. In 2015, he was arrested for interfering with a court, assault on a police officer, disorderly conduct, and contempt of court. On December 8, 2017, he failed to appear in Grant County District Court on charges of obstruction of a law enforcement officer and harassment in connection with an August 2017 arrest in Ephrata, Washington. Seim claimed illegal conduct from the court and prosecutor, including a motion which would force him to unlock his phone and said that he refused to comply. A warrant with a $5,000 bond was issued for his arrest. According to press reports, Seim has fled to Mexico. On February 13, 2020, Gavin Seim claimed that the Mexican government gave him and his family protected person status and permanent residency. Political views =Government and Politics= Seim denies being an anarchist, instead calling himself an \\"abolitionist and liberty activist\\". Seim commonly uses the term \\"Resist Blue ISIS\\", referring to police. Although he does not endorse violence against the government he does endorse civil disobedience in a non-violent way, often stating that the police work for the people and that the people are the ones in charge, not the police. =Second Amendment= He stated during a 2014 radio interview, \\"The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution . . . means the government has no authority whatsoever to restrict our guns in any fashion whatsoever. Any gun law, except our Constitution's, is void, it's lawless.... If you want to have a bazooka as my neighbor, I don't care.... The people are to be armed‚Äîthe militia is the people‚Äîthey are to be armed in order to, if need be, defend themselves against the government.\\" During a protest in Spokane, Washington, in 2014, Seim stated, \\"The people should be armed equal to the police. If they can have an MRAP [mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle], we can have a tank.\\" =Civilian militias= In 2016, Seim supported those arrested for the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, referring to the militia members and other armed protesters there as \\"patriots\\". He called on their supporters to learn the names of the judges, prosecutors, and marshals, whom he claimed were persecuting those arrested. \\"On the surface level, these are secret courts,\\" Seim said. \\"We [sic] got to do something about this.\\" =Sovereign citizen movement= Although some of the limited-federal-government militia members whom Seim supports advocate so- called \\"Sovereign Citizen\\" theories, Seim denounced the sovereign citizen movement in August 2016, however he does sympathize with their beliefs and has taken an \\"anti-police\\", \\"anti-government\\", view. . =Abortion= Seim is against abortion and believes that life begins at conception; he also believes that the right to life lies at the very core of both liberty and the Constitution.http://callmegav.com/issues/ =Foreign policy= Seim supports bringing home both troops and resources, and ending interfering in the affairs of foreign countries. He is also against getting into entangling alliances and is opposed to trade deals like TPP and TPN.http://callmegav.com/issues/ 2014 election In 2014, Seim ran for the U.S. House of Representatives, to represent Washington state's 4th Congressional District. He ran as a Republican, using the slogan, \\"No More Politicians\\". Seim lost in the primary, receiving 2.56% of the vote, which was 1,462 of the 73,264 votes counted. $7,676.00 was donated to his campaign in total. \\"I Will NOT Comply\\" rally Seim organized an \\"I Will NOT Comply\\" rally which took place in December 2014 in Olympia. The rally was in protest of Washington State Initiative 594, which had recently passed by a 19-point margin and expanded gun sale background checks to private sales and exchanges. Seim refused to obtain a permit for the rally, but notified the government of his intent to hold the rally. In response, the government informed him that another pro-gun group was planning a rally for the same day in the same location. Seim responded that he was only informing them of his plans, not asking for authorization. He intended for the rally to be a civil disobedience event. However, a spokesman for the Washington State Patrol stated that openly exchanging guns as the rally intended would not be illegal, since handing a gun to another person would not be considered a \\"transfer\\" within the meaning of i594. Seim spoke at the event, arguing that mass shooting events were caused by gun regulation. While on stage, Seim burned his state concealed weapons permit and said that those who want tanks and bazookas should purchase them. Ammon Bundy, who had participated in the Bundy standoff (which arose from a dispute between Bundy's father and the United States Bureau of Land Management), was scheduled to speak at the event, but did not show up. 2015 arrest In 2015, Seim attended the hearing of 19-year-old Tavis Shasteen, who was cited for refusing to provide a driver's license to a police officer when stopped for speeding. Seim insisted on representing Shasteen, but the court would not allow it, since Seim was not an attorney. The court also would not allow him to live- stream the hearing. Seim was subsequently arrested. Seim was booked into jail for interfering with a court, disorderly conduct, and contempt of court. He was sentenced to 14 days house arrest and 12 months probation. 2016 Libertarian Party of Wisconsin convention Seim spoke at the 2016 Libertarian Party of Wisconsin Convention, which was held April 16, 2016. Ties to the Bundy standoff and the occupation of MNWR Ammon Bundy participated in the Bundy standoff in 2014 and led armed militants in the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016. Bundy was scheduled to speak at the \\"I Will NOT Comply\\" event that Seim organized in 2014, but Bundy did not show up. At the end of the MNWR occupation in early 2016, Seim hosted live streams of the remaining four occupiers. David Fry, the last remaining occupier, called Seim, who streamed the audio over the internet. Seim urged Fry to peacefully leave the refuge. Seim posted links on his website to numerous fundraiser pages for those arrested for participating in the 2014 Bundy standoff and/or the 2016 MNWR Occupation. He also made various videos supporting those arrested. Additionally, he became an editor of the official Bundy Ranch Facebook page.  2017 arrests  On August 17, 2017, Seim was arrested following an altercation with a police officer at the Ephrata Walmart. Seim was charged with harassing and obstructing a police officer. Shortly after being arrested Seim posted a Facebook Live video in which he claimed that the police officer was \\"harassing some woman in her pickup truck\\" and \\"trying to be cool\\", so he started to record the stop. While being arrested, a police officer seized Seim's phone. Seim was released from Grant County Jail after posting a $2,000 bond. In October 2017, Seim appeared at Grant County District Court regarding the case. He notified the court of his intent to represent himself in all future court proceedings. During the hearing Seim contended that the phone seized during his arrest was taken without a warrant. Seim argued that he was legally allowed to film the police officer as he was on a traffic stop. Deputy Prosecutor Marc Fedorak explained that a warrant had been obtained to conduct a search of the phone, but efforts to search the phone had been unsuccessful because the device was password- protected. Judge Mark A. Chmelewski denied Seim's motion to have his phone returned, after finding that \\"the phone was properly seized\\", but ordered the state to return the phone to Seim within 21 days. In November 2017, Seim posted a video to his YouTube page explaining that he had chosen not to appear in court because he feared that doing so risked his family's lives. Several days later, Seim posted another video from Mexico. This showed his family leaving Ephrata and crossing the border into Mexico. Seim defended his decision to travel to Mexico, arguing that \\"I didn't run from law or justice. Prosecutor Marc [Fedorak] has nothing to do with either one and neither does the judge and neither does Grant County, neither does my sheriff. I'm not hiding. I'm changing the narrative.\\" In December 2017, at the request of Deputy Prosecutor Marc Fedorak, Judge Chmelewski issued a $5,000 bench warrant for Seim's arrest after he failed to appear at a court hearing held on December 8, 2017. Fedorak told the court that the State intended to dismiss the harassment charge previously brought against Seim, but would file at least one bail jumping charge against Seim. Fedorak said Seim appeared to be living in an \\"alternate universe\\" and called Seim's actions \\"silly\\" and \\"very unfortunate.\\" References 1985 births Living people 21st-century Christians Activists from Washington (state) American Christians American filmmakers American gun rights activists American libertarians American political activists Armed standoffs in the United States Bundy standoff Christian libertarians Non- interventionism People from Ephrata, Washington Sovereign citizen movement Washington (state) Libertarians Washington (state) Republicans ","title":"Gavin Seim"},{"id":"51369926","text":"Newton is an unincorporated community in Grays Harbor County, in the U.S. state of Washington.

Then in Hamburg (Germany) completed a specialty at the Institute for Maritime and Tropical Diseases in Hamburg, later traveling in 1935 to the United States as a fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation to obtain a doctorate from Johns Hopkins University in hygiene sciences with speciality in protozoology. Back in Venezuela he was appointed to head the newly created Special Directorate of Malariology within the Ministry of Health and Welfare, a position he held until 1950. Under the direction of Gabald√≥n, Venezuela became the first state which organized a nationwide campaign against malaria by using DDT, which led to be the first to achieve eradication of the disease in a large area extension of the tropical zone.COLMENARES ARREAZA, Guillermo. Arnoldo Gabald√≥n (1909‚Äì1990). Gac M√©d Caracas, mar. 2006, vol.114, no.1, p.69-69. ISSN 0367-4762. Gabald√≥n had acquired such fame in his country in 1951 was one of the candidates to replace the recently assassinated President of the Republic, Carlos Delgado Chalbaud. He continued to advise the General Directorate of Malariology until his retirement in 1973.  Health and welfare  In 1936 the Minister of Health and Welfare, Santos Dominici appointed Gabald√≥n director of Malariology and Alberto J. Fernandez, deputy director of the School of Malariology Experts malariologists. Once the headquarters of the National Division of Malaria in Maracay was established, Gabald√≥n carefully selected collaborators and as a team faced the serious problem of malaria in the country, by adopting a strategy that broke with the traditional schemes of the time, and it is still in full force, diligently preparing the staff and with defined methodologies according to the needs, accompanying the process of epidemiological research and disease control with antibacterial and antiparasitic measures. His strategy for antimalarial effort, was based on practical experiences of sanitation and supply of antimalarial drugs, with deep knowledge of national geopolitics and contact with people, becoming a national project, which immediately started to give positive results, so that high rates of morbidity and mortality malaria that decimated the country in the era of the 1930s, by 1944 had decreased significantly and its control was seen as possible.Gabald√≥n, A. Malaria Aviaria en un Pa√≠s de la Regi√≥n Neotropical, Fondo Editorial Interfundaciones, 1998, Caracas, Venezuela.http://www.iaesp.edu.ve/index.php/iae This initial program in 1945 was followed by a phase of malaria eradication, through a national campaign by application of the synthetic insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane better known as (DDT). The controversial use of DDT in Venezuela was carried out in a controlled manner through the work of the Italian-Venezuelan chemical Ettore Mazzarri, founder of the Chemical Laboratory of Malaria in 1948. The results were immediate: by 1950 the death rate from malaria in the country had been reduced to 9 per 100,000 inhabitants (from a Latin American country high of 164 per 100,000) and was eradicated in an area of 132 000 km2. In 1955, 10 years after the program started the rate was lowered to 1 per 100 000 population and the eradicated area had increased to 305,414 km2. Moron, an area that had the highest rates of mortality from malaria, had spent three years with no deaths by malaria. Thereafter the great population explosion in Venezuela occurred with evident achievements and successes which were recognized nationally and internationally.http://vitae.ucv.ve/?module=articulo&rv;=54&n;=1924&m;=2&e;=1927 Dr. Arnoldo Gabald√≥n, El DDT y su √©xito en Venezuela. He also discovered new species of malarial parasites and devoted himself to studying the mosquito Anopheles nuneztovari, action that catalyzed the recognition of educational needs and preparing managerial staff of the Ministry of Health, through the creation of the school that bears his name in Maracay, a deep and additional contribution. Between 1959 and 1964 President R√≥mulo Betancourt appointed him Minister of Health and Welfare and Gabald√≥n developed a management program influenced by his professional background grounded in medical and environmental sanitation activities throughout the country. At the Ministry, Dr. Arnoldo Gabald√≥n applied the same management principles that he had used for successful management in the Division of Malaria: the accuracy of objectives was one of his cardinal rules such as the one made when taking his new position: \\"Our objective in the field public health is to get a six-month increase in life expectancy at birth for each year of work \\"(Guerrero and Borges, 1998, 85). Other significant elements of its successful management included; the selection of competent personnel and professionalization of the same both domestically and abroad, modernization of the management of different departments. His vision on the need for training or preparation for an efficient work in the field of malariology is expressed in his book \\"A Health Policy\\" and the \\"Letters of the Minister\\" which allowed him to disclose monthly to all staff and the country their views; He gave priority to preventive medicine for which he created the Environmental sanitation sub- department in 1960. He amended the health budget by investing more resources in environmental sanitation. He encouraged decentralization by signing agreements with regional governments to \\"cooperative services\\". It strengthened its longstanding goal of rural housing, in order to offer a decent habitat for the Venezuelan peasant. Gabald√≥n authored more than 200 papers published in national and international medical journals written in Spanish, English, French and German. For example, he conducted studies on malaria in birds, work that earned him be incorporated as member of the Academy of Physical, Mathematical and Natural which in his honor institutionalized Arnoldo Gabald√≥n Prize for scientists under 40 years in the areas Biology, Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. It was also a tenured of the National Academy of Medicine, where he held the chair X joining in 1972. He was the first professor of the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Professor of Latin-American Studies at the University of Cambridge, England (1968‚Äì69) and directed post- doctoral studies at the Central University of Venezuela. Gabald√≥n was active as an expert of the World Health Organization in work for malaria control in countries from 5 continents. On February 15, 1989, it was decided by Venezuelan executive decree, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, to compile his written work, to issue a postage stamp with his effigy and to give his name to the complex of buildings that would form the Directorate of Malaria and Environmental Sanitation in Maracay, today known as the Institute of Higher Studies of Malariology Arnoldo Arnoldo Gabald√≥n. Gabald√≥n Parish in the Candelaria municipality of his native state, was named in his honor.  Personal life  On April 22, 1937, in Bocon√≥ Trujillo state, he married Mar√≠a Teresa Berti, sister of one of his great friends and exemplary fighter against malaria in Venezuela Arturo Luis Berti. His son Arnoldo Jos√© Gabald√≥n Berti (Caracas, 1938) was the first Minister of Environment of Latin America (1976‚Äì79) and chairman of the board of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) at its nineteenth period session, Nairobi, Kenya, 1997‚Äì99, member of the Academy of Physical, Mathematical and Natural Sciences (2007), rector of the Presidential Commission for State Reform, head of the Venezuelan delegation to the Environmental Summit in Rio 1992 and general manager of the environmental consulting firm Ecology & Environment of Venezuela. His nephew engineer Adalberto Gabald√≥n was environment minister in the transitional government of President Ram√≥n J. Vel√°squez (1993‚Äì94).

He is an American motorcycle jumping world record holder and stunt performer and Stage 4 cancer survivor who lives in Daytona, Florida. Danger has set many records, including the Longest Motorcycle Jump, which was 251 feet over 42 cars. With that jump, he entered the Guinness Book of World Records in 1991. Danger also broke Evel Knievel's jump record over cars at The Legendary Buffalo Chip, Sturgis 75th Motorcycle Rally, Sturgis, South Dakota in 2015. On his motorcycle, Danger has jumped a jumbo jet from wingtip to wingtip, over school buses, tractor-trailers, cars, as well as through fire. He's also crashed, accumulating a total of 50 broken bones, a fractured skull, burns, and once suffered amnesia that lasted a year. Danger is sponsored by Vanson Leathers, Bell Helmets, and Mustang Seats. Although Danger still jumps, he is now a motivational speaker at elementary schools, high schools, community-service organizations and corporations. Early life and history Growing up in Palmer, Massachusetts, Danger's mother rode a motorcycle, but discouraged him from doing the same. However, as a young man, Danger saw Evel Knievel jump over 13 Mack trucks on ABC's Wide World of Sports in 1974. Danger aimed to follow in Knievel's footsteps by jumping his bicycle over his neighborhood friends when he was 11, and shortly after received his first motorcycle from his stepfather. As a sophomore at Palmer High School, Danger drove his motorcycle through the school hallways on a dare. Palmer High asked him not to come back for his junior year, so he transferred and finished at Pathfinder in 1980. When Danger was five and living with his parents in Las Vegas, Danger first saw Knievel jump live over the fountains at Caesar's Palace. Twelve years later, Danger made his first public motorcycle jump, over 10 cars, in Palmer. When his career took off, he and Knievel became friends. Career =1979‚Äì90= Danger began his motorcycle stunt career in 1979 when he jumped 10 cars in Palmer. At age 22, in 1984, he jumped over a three-story restaurant into Forest Lake in Massachusetts going 85 feet high and a distance of 145 feet. A year later, he made a 125cc motorcycle leap over 14 school buses in Thompson, Connecticut, earning him his first World Record. That same year, his motorcycle exploded during a fire stunt in North Carolina which threw him 150 feet down the track, legs in flames. In 1990, Danger earned another American record, this one for 250cc bikes, by jumping 25 cars at a total of 181 feet at New Hampshire International Speedway. =1991‚Äì2000= In 1991, Danger set a World Record for a 251-foot motorcycle jump over 42 cars in Loudon, New Hampshire. That jump earned him a place in the Guinness Book of World records, and it stood for nine years as the Longest Motorcycle Jump. A year later, in a competition against Australian National Champion Jumper, Dar Davies, he won the International Motorcycle Jumping Competition at New Hampshire International Speedway. That same year, Danger signed a contract for a Daredevil Showdown with Robbie Knievel for a Pay-Per-View but the event never happened because in July 1992, a practice jump went awry and Danger crashed into a three-foot retaining wall at Hudson Speedway in New Hampshire breaking 17 bones and remaining in a coma for over a month. When he recovered, his memory was gone. After recovering, Danger created the Doug Danger Motorcycle Stunt Spectacular, Legends Stunt Show, a thrill show that included various motorcycle jumps, firewall crashs, wheelie show, and automobile stunts. He partnered in the venture which ran from 1997 through 2003, with legendary stuntman Tim Chitwood. One of the first jumps Danger made after his accident was on October 10, 1999: he jumped over 18 tractor-trailers at Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada, setting another World Record and breaking the one previously held by Robbie Knievel of 17 semi-trucks. On March 18, 2000, Danger jumped an L-1011 Jumbo Jet wing tip-to-wing tip, a stunt that was filmed for the \\"I Dare You\\" television show. For this, he rose 30 feet and traveled 160 feet across the airplane. =2001‚Äì10= Danger did a couple of stunts in May 2001 at Thompson Speedway, Connecticut, one involving a Honda CR500 motorcycle jumping 120 feet across three school buses lined up ended to end, and the other using a 1987 Harley Davidson 883 Sportster weighing over 500 pounds to jump over 10 cars. Louis \\"Rocket\\" Re and Danger performed a double jump‚Äîtwo riders one behind the other in the air at the same time‚Äîcovering over 100 feet on July 15, 2006, in New Castle, Pennsylvania. The duo met again later in July at Brockton Fair Grounds in Massachusetts for a head-on criss-cross jump where they passed each other at 70 mph with four feet of clearance that was filmed for a Country Music Television pilot called \\"Hell Drivers\\". =2011-present= For two months, beginning May 2011, Danger made an Australian tour in Hell Raiser's of Insanity Extreme Stunt Show. Among the jumps were two that he made with a broken leg, obtained after a moving truck stunt. During the hospital examination in Australia, doctors discovered a lump near his tonsils, and after its removal was told it was benign cancer. Six months later, a cancerous growth surfaced, and he had another operation in the United States. The prognoses was not good. During his treatments, Danger injured himself again doing a jump in May 2012 to benefit The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at Lulu Shriner's Arena in Plymouth, Pennsylvania. He separated his shoulder and broke his knuckle. After 35 radiation treatments, and three rounds of an experimental chemotherapy, each lasting five days, Danger received news that he was cancer free. In 2012, Risky Rick Cruz, of the Ricksonian Daredevil Museum presented Danger with the honorary Triple Crown, awarded for the stunt performer's holding the 125cc, 250cc and 500cc motorcycle records at the same time. Danger began a motivational speaking career in 2012 that continues. Entitled \\"Live Life Full Throttle,\\" the message he brings to various elementary and high schools, community service organizations like the Boys and Girls Clubs, Chambers of Commerce, Rotary Clubs, Lions Clubs, and Motorcycle Shows is to follow your dreams, go for your goals, and maintain a drug-free life. On June 14, 2014, Danger once again attached to the Evel Knievel legacy, by using Knievel's XR-750 Harley-Davidson to leap over 15 cars, 110 feet in across at the Republic of Texas Rally in Austin, Texas Danger was able to break Knievel's record the following year using Knievel's own XR-750 Harley-Davidson‚Äîloaned to Danger by its owner Lathan McKay‚Äîto jump 22 cars at the Buffalo Chip Campground during the 75th Sturgis motorcycle rally on August 6. The jump was 151 feet long, and was a success, outpacing the Knievel attempt, which only cleared 21 cars. Next April 7, 2016, Danger was recognized by Massachusetts State Senator Anne M. Gobi (D-Spencer), during a formal Senate Session. Danger participates in the KSR Motorsports Monster Truck and Thrill Show, performing 25‚Äì30 shows a year, jumping, doing wheelies, and fire wall crashes.

She captured several small privateers while on the West Indies and Halifax stations before the Royal Navy sold her in 1817. Her main claim to fame, however, is that she was the first command of future Rear-Admiral Charles Austen, who was also the brother of the famed novelist Jane Austen. After the Navy sold her she became a whaler for Samuel Enderby & Sons. She apparently sailed for them until the mid-1830s; she then sailed for other owners until mid-1847, for a total of nine whaling voyages since leaving naval service. Design and construction Indian was one of six Bermuda-class sloops built in Bermuda, of Bermudan cedar. The class was a modified Dasher-class. Naval career Lieutenant Charles John Austen received an appointment to Indian on 10 April 1804. She was then building in Bermuda. He did not receive his promotion to Commander until 10 September,Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, pp.74-5. and commissioned her on 10 October for the West Indies and Halifax stations. To raise a crew he put a front-page advertisement in The Bermuda Gazette on 13 April 1805, extolling her virtues. On one of her first cruises, Indian encountered four French frigates that surrounded her. A providential sudden calm enabled her to use her sweeps to push between them and get far enough away to escape when the breeze returned. Lloyd's List reported in September 1806 that Indian had captured Nuestra Senora del Carmen and had sent her into Halifax. She had been sailing from Porto Cavalto (Puerto Cabello) to Cadiz.Lloyd's List 9 September 1806, n¬∞4080. Baltic arrived at Bermuda on 7 February 1807. She had been sailing from Isle de France (Mauritius), when Indian captured her.Lloyd's List 24 March 1807, n¬∞4137. In May or June Indian detained Eliza, an American vessel sailing from Cuba to Charleston, and sent her into Bermuda.Lloyd's List 14 July 1807, n¬∞4169. Indian arrived at Bermuda on 10 October from Newfoundland. At the end of September a violent gale had dismasted her dispersed the small convoy for the West Indies that she had been escorting. After the gale had passed she saw a schooner floating upside down; Indian believed the schooner to have been of the vessels of the convoy.Lloyd's List 1 December 1807, n¬∞4208. At daylight on 19 June 1808 Indian encountered two schooners at . The schooners immediately tried to escape by taking different directions. Austen chased after the larger and sent his boats after the other. Austen quickly captured Jeune Estelle, of four guns and 25 men, which struck after fire from Indians chase guns killed one man and wounded another. She had been sailing from River St. Mary's to St. Domingo with a cargo of flour and provisions. Livelys boats were half-a-gun-shot away from the second schooner when a breeze sprang up, enabling the schooner to escape. Austen's prisoners informed him that the second schooner was the 6-gun Exchange, with a crew of 95 men, which too was bringing provisions to St. Domingo. Austen then decided to take Jeune Estelle into Bermuda. They arrived at Bermuda on 27 June.Lloyd's List 9 August 1808, n¬∞4276. Austen received promotion to post captain in on 10 May 1810. Lieutenant William Bowen Mends then became acting commander, a role that he held until September. Commander Henry Jane had been appointed to Indian on 10 May to replace Austen.Marshall (1831, Supplement 3, Part 1, p.223. However, he only Mends in September, with Mends returning to Swiftsure, from whence he had come. On 8 July, Indian captured the American brig Mary and Elizabeth. Mary Elizabeth, of 167 tons (bm), was sailing from St Ubes, Portugal, in ballast but carrying specie.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 29, p.312. Mary Elizabeth, C. Crandal, master had also been carrying $2313. Earlier, an American privateer had captured William, of Bristol, J. Hare, master, off Cape Sable. Indian recaptured William on 8 July and took her into Halifax.Lloyd's List 21 August 1812, ‚Ññ4695. William had been carrying dry goods worth ¬£1400. 'Indian and , Lieutenant James Bray, captured the privateer schooner Fair Trader on 16 July 1812 in the Bay of Fundy. Fair Trader was armed with one gun and had a 20-man crew. A report in Lloyd's List stated that Indian had captured Fair Trader, Argus, and a third American privateer.Lloyd's List 18 September 1812, n¬∞4703. Argus, which Indian and Plumper captured on 17 July, was a 21-ton privateer schooner out of Boston and under the command of W. Heath. She too went into New Brunswick. The third privateer may have been Friendship, of 22 tons (bm), out of Boston, and under the command of A. Richards. Indian captured her on 19 July and took her into New Brunswick. On 9 August Indian sailed from St. John's, New Brunswick, with a convoy of 50 sail for England. Indian shared with , , and in the proceeds for the capture four days later of the American vessel John. Two days later, on 15 August, Indian and number of the vessels parted company in a fog off the Newfoundland Banks. On 5 July 1813 Jane transferred to . Three days later Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren appointed Lieutenant Thomas Sykes to command of Indian at Quebec.O'Byrne (1849) He assumed command of her on 11 July. Sykes received promotion to the rank of commander on 9 November 1813. He transferred to on 23 February 1814. On 9 March 1814 Commander Nicholas James Cuthbert Dunn replaced Sykes.Marshall (1833), Vol. 4, Part. 1, p.152. Dunn brought her home and paid her off later in the year.O'Byrne (1849) Disposal: Indian was paid off in October 1814. She then went into ordinary. The Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy offered the \\"Indian sloop, of 394 tons\\", lying at Deptford for sale on 15 December 1814. She finally sold on 24 April 1817 for ¬£1,300 to Messrs. Enderby. Whaler Messrs. Enderby were a whaling company and Indian made five voyages for them. Her first voyage lasted from 11 August 1817 to 9 July 1819. She had two masters, Sullivan, and then William Swain, and she brought home 800 casks of whale oil.British Southern Whale Fishery Database ‚Äì voyages: Indian. One of the crew was Samuel Swain, William's cousin, who would become her master for her fourth and fifth whaling voyages.British Southern Whale Fishery database: Masters. Indian, Bermuda- built and of 399 tons (bm), appeared in Lloyd's Register for 1818 under their ownership with S. Swain as master, and trade as London-South Seas.Lloyd's Register 1818.. Swain was her master again in the 1819 Lloyd's Register. However, she left on her second voyage on 18 September 1819 under Captain Silas West. The 1820 Lloyd's Register gives the master's name as C. West. Between 16 March and 21 April 1821 Indian was at Sydney refitting. On 29 May Indian, West, master, sailed for the fishery. On 22 July 1822 she left Bay of Islands with 1200 barrels of whale oil. By that time West had died and her masters became Meyrick or Starbuck. She arrived in Britain on 27 August 1822 with 400 casks of whale oil, plus whale jawbones and teeth. Indian left on her third voyage on 20 January 1823 under the command of Gibson, master. In June‚ÄîJuly 1824 she was off the coast of Japan, reportedly with 450 barrels. In September she was at Timor with 600 barrels. She returned to Britain on 9 November 1825 with 500 casks of whale oil and one cask of ambergris. Lloyd's Register for 1825, gave her master's name as J. Gibson, and her burthen was given as 385 tons (bm).Lloyd's Register 1825.. This figure of 385 tons is the one that the database of whaling voyages uses. For Indians fourth voyage, Samuel Swain became her master. He sailed her to the Southern Fisheries on 4 February 1826. She traveled via Indonesian waters and arrived in Sydney in July. The Australian in its \\"Ship News\\" column for 26 July reported that she was carrying 16 tons of sperm oil, but had had to put into port because her crew was mutinous. Indian left on 28 August and spent some eight months whaling. She returned to England by 3 March 1828 with 700 casks of whale oil gather in Indonesian and New Zealand waters. Indian left Britain on 23 May 1828 on her fifth voyage (and last for Enderby), bound for Timor and under Swain's command. She was at Timor in January 1829 with 100 barrels, and at the Bay of Islands on 5 September with 220 tuns of sperm oil. By November 1829 she was at Tongatapu with 1800 barrels. Indian returned to England on 3 January 1831 with 800 casks. In 1830 Lloyd's Register gave her master as Swain, and her trade as Falmouth-South Seas.Lloyd's Register 1830 However, Swain left Indian after his return to England and then commanded Vigilant for Enderbys. Indian, W. Grant, master, left Britain on 16 October 1831 on her sixth voyage. Grant may have been her owner as there is no information on any other owner. She was at Madeira on 8 November, at the Bay of Islands with 2000 barrels on 3 February 1833, and to have there with 2200 barrels in April 1834 for London. She arrived there on 27 June. Lloyd's Register had Indian with Grant, master, and trade London-South Seas.Lloyd's Register 1833 Lloyd's Register for 1834 listed Indian, 385 tons (bm), W. Grant, master. However, the entry had no mention of ownership and simply gave her location as London.Lloyd's Register 1835 The entry continued unchanged until Indian was no longer listed in Lloyd's Register after 1838. However, Indian continued to make voyages under new owners. For her seventh voyage, she left Britain on 4 September 1835 bound for Timor, with J. Freeman, master, and T. Ward, owner. She was reported to have been at St Helena on 16 February 1839, having left Timor on 27 December 1838. She arrived in Britain on 3 March 1839 with 200 casks. For Indians eighth voyage, master and owner were Maugham. She left on 26 June 1839. From the Marquesas Islands she arrived in 20 days at Honolulu, where she stayed from 3 to 7 May 1840. She had 500 barrels 10 months after having left London. She was again at Honolulu between 17 October and 15 November. She now had 850 (or 880) barrels after having been out 16 months. She arrived back in Britain on 16 May 1843 with 370 casks. Indians ninth voyage, her last recorded voyage, began on 2 September 1843 with J. Maugham, master, and T. Ward, owner. She was bound for New Zealand and was reported at the Bay of Islands on 9 January 1846 with 75 tons oil, having been out 31 months. She arrived back in Britain on 14 June 1847. She brought back 12 tanks blubber, 130 casks of sperm oil, and 54 [seal] skins.

The designation is an abbreviation of Pinyin: H for Haijun (Êµ∑ÂÜõ, meaning naval in Chinese), Z for Zhihui (ÊåáÊå•, meaning command in Chinese), and K for Kongzhi (ÊéßÂà∂, meaning control in Chinese), J for Jian (Ëà∞, meaning ship in Chinese) and T for Ting (Ëâá, meaning boat in Chinese). Type 673-I Poseidon-1 The predecessor of all Chinese CDS/CMS is the first CDS in China designated as Type 670-1, which was developed by the 706th Institute under the request of 701st and 713th Institutes, when the latter two were assigned to develop Type 051 destroyer in 1966. Mr. Qin Xue-Chang (Áß¶Â≠¶Êòå, born in 1940 in Chongming County) as the general designer, with the CDS designated as Type 670-I shipborne combat information center, and given the name Poseidon-1 (Hai-shen Yi-Hao, Êµ∑Á•û1Âè∑), with development begun in 1966 and concluded seven years later. Type 670-I CDS is a centralized system based on specially developed 22-bit, 8K-RAM, MLB minicomputers, which is built on DTL small-scale integrated circuits (IC). The minicomputer is capable of performing two hundred thousand operations per second (ops/sec). The thirty- one centimeter display is fully transistorized and adopts a mixture of analog and digital circuitry. If accepted into service, the system would be designated as ZKJ, short for Zi-dong Kong-zhi Ji-qi (Ëá™Âä®ÊéßÂà∂Êú∫Âô®), meaning automatic control machine, because system was intended to automate shipborne weaponry control that was performed manually. However, the political turmoil in China at the time, namely, the Cultural Revolution, had serious hampered the development of the first Chinese CDS. The only prototype built was plagued with reliability problem, and instead of the originally name planned, the system was frequently and candidly referred by the nickname given by the sailors as seasick machine (Yun-chuan-ji, ÊôïËàπÊú∫) due to its frequent breakdowns, especially in severe sea states. As a result, Type 670-I Poseidon-1 did not enter service after seven years of development. Although Type 670-1 failed to enter production and service, it is nonetheless an important milestone in the development of CDS in China in that it has provided the foundation of CDS framework for similar systems developed later in China. Type 673-II Poseidon-2/ZKJ-I In 1970, orders were given to develop a successor of earlier Type 673-I CDS named Poseidon-2, with the same general designer reassigned to the 724th Institute. Type 673-II follows the same design of its predecessor but with a new computer developed by the 709th Institute. The 32K-RAM, 32-bit new computer is designated as Type 911, and based on small- scale TTL IC, it is capable of performing half a million ops/sec. Type 671-II can automatically provide fire solution channels for Type 342 and Type 343 radars in real time. The one meter by one meter display of Type 670-II CDS is much larger than that of its predecessor. The political turmoil once again severely hampered the development of Type 673-II CDS, it was not until in November 1979, three years after the end of the Cultural Revolution, when the system first begun its trials on land, utilizing Type 381 passive phased array radar. In April 1980, the system was installed onboard Type 051 destroyer No. 105 in Dalian for sea trials, which were conducted in July and August the same year, utilizing Type 354 surface search radar. In October 1983, the system was removed from Destroyer No. 105 and installed onboard another Type 051 destroyer, No. 132 in Shanghai for further sea trials in Zhoushan, which was completed in twenty days in December 1983, utilizing Type 354 and Type 342 fire control radar. Type 673-II CDS is capable of handling a total of seventeen batches of targets. When Type 673-II was accepted into service after thirteen years of development, it received PLAN designation H/ZKJ-I, and the original name of automatic control machine given in the Cultural Revolution was changed to a much more accurate description of Naval / Command, Control, Shipborne (H/ZKJ: Haijun / Zhihui-Kongzhi-Jianzai, Êµ∑ÂÜõ/ÊåáÊå•-ÊéßÂà∂-Ëà∞ËΩΩ), though the Pinyin abbreviation remains the same. Type 673-II/ZKJ-I was used on early models of Type 051 destroyer No. 132. ZKJ-1 subsequently was upgraded to ZKJ-1A standard, and the major improvement is the replacement of Type 911 computer with more advanced computer by 724th Institute. Poseidon-3/ZKJ-II ZKJ-II is frequently but erroneously referred by many as ZKJ-3, but in reality, ZKJ-II is the actual CDS based on Racal Marine Radar CTC-1629 (CTC: Command Tactical Console) combat direction system, which can simultaneously track 20 targets. The general designer of ZKJ-II is Mr. Yan Jun-Xing (‰∏•‰øäÊòü), and the CDS is named as Poseidon-3. Developed by the 724th Research Institute, ZKJ-II is installed on Type 053K Jiangdong class frigates. Based on the British CTC-1629, one of the characteristics of ZKJ-II is that it is linked to domestic Chinese fire control system (FCS), and one of the most important of these is SIASWFCS, which is the abbreviation of Shipborne Integrated Anti- Submarine Warfare Fire Control System (Chinese: Ëà∞ËΩΩÁªºÂêàÂèçÊΩúÁÅ´ÊéßÁ≥ªÁªü Jian-zai Zong-he Fan-qian Huo-kong Xi-tong), the first kind in Chinese service. SIASWFCS links up onboard sensors and ASW weaponry, and once top priority targets are identified, SIASWFCS would be able to simultaneously engage two targets by automatically providing fire solutions for Type 65 ASW mortars, ASW rocket/missile launchers and ASW torpedo tubes. SIASWFCS can provide fire solutions to two different targets with up to two different types of ASW weaponry simultaneously and it (and later models) has been standard equipment onboard Chinese warships since. Poseidon-4/ZKJ-3 Originally designated as ZKJ-III and named as Poseidon-4, but later re-designated as ZKJ-3, ZKJ-3 is designed to replace minicomputers in earlier designs with microcomputers with multilayered architecture, using Intel 8086 microprocessors. ZKJ-3 CDS has multiple input/output interfaces, and the software can be expanded when needed thanks to its modular design. In comparison to earlier Type 673-II/ZKJ-I CDS, the capability of ZKJ-3 has been expanded. Some of the additional capability includes compatibility with Type 352 targeting radar for anti-ship missiles and Type 681A IFF, and providing info from SJD-5 sonar to antisubmarine depth charge launchers. ZKJ-3 CDS also incorporates tactical software developed by Dalian Naval Academy, which includes two portions, one for threat analysis, and the other for ship maneuvering to assist naval commanders to make tactical decisions. ZKJ-III was first installed on Type 053H2 Jianghu-III class frigate No. 535 in December 1986, and the 2nd set was subsequently installed on the 2nd ship of the same class No. 536. The 3rd ship of the class No. 527 received an upgraded version ZKJ-IIIA. A further upgraded version designated as ZKJ- IIIB is reported to equip Type 053H1G Jianghu-V class frigates, while ZKJ-IIIC is installed on Type 053H2G Jiangwei-I class frigates and Type 053H3 Jiangwei- II class frigates. Starting with this model, all ZKJ series are renamed following the convention used on the export model for Thailand, with Roman numerals replaced by Arabic numbers. =CCS-3= An export version ZKJ-III designated as CCS-1 (reported to be the abbreviation of Command and Control System 3, from ZKJ-III it was developed from) was installed onboard two Type 53T and two Type 053HT frigates built for Royal Thai Navy. CCS-3 differs from ZKJ-3 mainly in data links: Thai ships were equipped with a data link back to shore headquarters, and after delivery, a US inter-ship data link is also incorporated. The general designer of CCS-3 is Mr. Chen Yongqing (ÈôàÊ∞∏Ê∏Ö). The CIC associated with ZKJ-3 was ECIC-1, rumored to be electrical combat information center. The significance of CCS-3 is that it naming practice was adopted by Chinese for later models in the future CDS, with Arabic numbers replaced the Roman numerals. ZKJ-4 Originally designated as ZKJ-IV and later re-designated as ZKJ-4, it was a subsystem of Type 051G destroyer in Type 051 destroyer upgrade program. Development of ZKJ-4A begun in January 1984 by the 709th Institute using eleven Intel 80/30 microcomputers, and the CDS is built to RS-232 and RS-422 specs/standards. ZJK-4A is capable of tracking and processing sixty batches of targets in fully automatic mode, and tracking eighty batches of targets in manual mode. Land trials begun in November 1986 in Lianyungang, and sea trials were conducted in May 1987, and the system was delivered and installed on Type 051G destroyer No. 165 in 1988. An improved version designated as ZKJ-4AG was installed on the 2nd unit of Type 051G destroyer No. 166. Contrary to many frequent but erroneous claims, ZKJ-4/4A/4AG is not a Chinese copy of French TAVITAC (Traitement Automatique et VIsualisation TACtique) because the French CDS were not delivered to China after ZKJ-4/4A/4AG series were already completed: on November 23, 1984, China decided to import naval SAM, ASW helicopter and torpedo. From July 10 thru September 26, 1985, a Chinese delegation from Poly Technologies headed by Rear Admiral Zheng Ming (ÈÉëÊòé), the head of PLAN Equipment Department evaluated French naval systems developed by Thomson-CSF, including TAVITAC, Crotale SAM, and associated Castor fire control radar. On December 22, 1986, French systems were selected by China and contract was signed in the following month in January 1987 for two sets, which were subsequently delivered in the following year. On August 24, 1988, installation of the first set onboard Type 051 destroyer No. 109 begun, and the 2nd set was also installed on another ship of Type 051 destroyer (rumored to be No. 110). Due to the urgent need, both set of French systems were installed on ships and nothing was left for research and reverse engineering like other foreign systems China imported. Therefore, ZKJ-4/4A/4AG is not a Chinese copy of French TAVITAC. =ZKJ-4B= ZKJ-4B series CDS with modular design is the first Chinese CDS utilizes ruggedized computers, and it is the Chinese equivalent of Italian Alenia IPN-10 combat data system, and borrowed heavily from SADOC 2 (systema dirizione della operazioni di combattimento) CDS, the export version of IPN-10 delivered to China in 1985. The Italian design features such as three-man level display and MIL-STD-1553B spec/standard are adopted for later models. ZKJ-4B incorporates 052 Integrated Command Decision-making System (052ÁªºÂêàÊåáÊå•ÂÜ≥Á≠ñÁ≥ªÁªü), a software named after Type 052 destroyer it was planned to equip, and it is decision making software developed by Dalian Naval Academy. After land trials in 1990 in Lianyungang, ZKJ-4B was shipped to Shanghai and installed onboard Type 052 destroyer No. 112. Only a single set of ZKJ-4B was completed, and it was followed by ZKJ-4BII, which is installed on board the 2nd Type 052 destroyer No. 113. In addition, ZKJ-4BII CDS is also installed onboard Type 051B destroyer No. 167. During the upgrades of these ships in the early and mid-2010s, ZKJ-4B/4BII series has been replaced by more advanced ZKJ-5 CDS. ZKJ-5 ZKJ-5 is a CDS developed by the 709th Institute to replace all previous CDS on major surface combatants of PLAN. The general designer of ZKJ-5 was Zhang Zihe (Âº†Â≠êÈπ§), head of the 709th Research Institute of the 7th Academy of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation. Other important figures in ZKJ-5 program included program engineers Li Shuyun (ÊùéÊ∑ë‰∫ë) and Hu Bin (ËÉ°ÂΩ¨). Zhang Zihe pioneered the design of incorporating microcomputer/PC to the system, which was almost rejected when first proposed because it was the first attempt in China, but eventually the idea was accepted and proved successful. PCs/microcomputers incorporated in ZKJ-5 combat data system are the intelligence workstations to replace the dumb terminals used on previous systems. ZKJ-5 is a distributed system with duplex fiber optic Ethernet and video feed, incorporating dozens of software packages and data banks. ZKJ-5 is installed onboard Type 052 destroyers and Type 054A frigates, and as older ships of PLAN receive their upgrade, earlier CDS such as ZKJ-4 series have been replaced by ZKJ-5 CDS. ZKJ-5 CDS is able to receive orders from higher level on the chain of command, and coordinate the battle plan as whole, as well as providing the battle plan of the ship to the high level in the chain of command, which is essential in network centric warfare. ZKT-1 In addition to ZKJ series CDS, China has also developed ZKT series CDS, which is intended for fast attack crafts such as missile boats, and other lightly armed surface combatants such as patrol ships, light frigates, and amphibious warfare ships. The current series is ZKT-1, which is developed by the 716th Institute. Instead of the three tiered command system of ZKJ series, ZKT series adopts two-tiered command system. ZKT series does share the same characteristics of centralized command and integrated control of ZKJ series. ZKT-1 is the first model of the ZKT series CDS, with development completed in 1992. ZKT-1 CDS is very flexible thanks to its modular design, and depending on the onboard weaponry, the operator consoles can be adjusted accordingly. ZKT-1 was first used on Type 037II Houjian-class missile boat of PLAN, and it was built to the MIL-STD-1553B standard. ZKT-1A and ZKT-1B CDS are subsequent succeeding models developed from ZKT-1, and in comparison to ZKT-1, the latest models in the series have been upgraded significantly by incorporating tactical software, databanks, and amphibious warfare software and command system, and helicopter control system. Other features includes duplex fiber optic Ethernet and video feed, like that adopted by ZKJ series CDS. ZKT-1B is installed onboard Type 071 amphibious transport dock of PLAN. ZBJ-1 H/ZBJ is the fleet command system developed by China for its PLAN. The designation is an abbreviation of Pinyin: H for Haijun (Êµ∑ÂÜõ, meaning naval in Chinese), Z for Zhihui (ÊåáÊå•, meaning command in Chinese), and B for Biandui (ÁºñÈòü, meaning fleet formation in Chinese), J for Jian (Ëà∞, meaning ship in Chinese). The official H/ZBJ designation is generally abbreviated as ZBJ. Instead of building specialized command ship, PLAN takes a different approach by installing fleet command systems on large principal surface combatants to act as command ship. The first PLAN naval ship with a modern fleet command system installed is its Type 051B destroyer No. 167. In addition to command surface fleet, the ship is also capable of command amphibious warfare. However, the 1990s technology utilized was not satisfactory, because the resulting system was too bulky and too heavy. As a result, subsequent ships of PLAN were not equipped with this first generation Chinese naval fleet command system, and it was not until Type 052C destroyer when PLAN ships begun to be equipped with fleet command systems. The knowledge and experience gained in the development of first generation fleet command system helped China to develop more capable models later. The first widely used shipborne fleet command system onboard Chinese naval ships is H/ZBJ-1, usually abbreviated as ZBJ-1, which is first installed onboard Type 052C destroyer and subsequent Type 052D destroyer. Based on the original ZBJ-1, a series of fleet command systems were developed, including ZBJ-1A and ZBJ-2. ZBJ-1A is a fleet command system designed to command and control operations of an amphibious fleet/task force, and is reported installed on Type 071 amphibious transport dock. ZBJ-2 is another development of ZBJ-1, which is designed to command and control operations of an aircraft carrier fleet/task force, which is reported installed onboard Type 001 Liaoning class aircraft carrier.

They may also be called split-top, top-sliced, frankfurter rolls, or frankfurt rolls.  History  This style of roll or bun was developed in the 1940s by Howard Johnson's, who approached the Maine bakery J. J. Nissen in search of a bun for its fried clam strip sandwich. According to The Boston Globe, the \\"restaurant chain wanted top sliced rolls that would stand upright and be easier to prepare, serve, and eat.\\" Outside of New England, they are associated with clam rolls and lobster rolls, dishes iconic to New England cuisine. The New England-style bun predates the hot dog bun found almost everywhere else in the United States by at least several years. Before the invention of the New England bun, commercial bakers would slice rolls all the way through. Today, this style of bun is prevalent in New England, with small and large grocery stores stocking at least several competing brands, and the hot dog bun typical of the rest of the United States (also called a \\"side-loading\\" bun) offered right alongside.  Overview  In New England, hot dogs, clam rolls, lobster rolls, and the buns that accompany them are often associated with the summer months and coastal villages, where clam shacks and lobstering are common. Some recipes for these dishes explicitly require the use of a New England-style bun. The rolls are baked very close together, keeping the sides soft, much like sliced bread.

After a restoration project in 2005‚Äì06, the Temple now attracts thousands of visitors. It has had several names over the centuries, including the \\"Kasyapa Buddha Temple\\" (), the \\"Bojue Temple\\" (), the \\"Hongren Temple\\" (), and the \\"Reclining Buddha Temple\\" (). The present name of \\"Dafo\\" means \\"Great Buddha\\". History External view of the temple The temple was built around the beginning of the 12th century, during the Western Xia (1038-1227) period. In 1028, the Tibeto-Burman speaking Tangut people took over Zhangye (then known as Ganzhou) from the Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom. A few years later they founded the Western Xia and controlled the entirety of the Hexi Corridor. To strengthen their hold over the area, the Xia built temples and ordered the translation of the Buddhist scriptures. They were especially strong during the reign of Emperor Li Qiangshun (1086-1139), and the Dafo Temple dates from this time. The history of the temple relates that in 1098, a monk called Sineng Weimie had seen numinous lights and heard heavenly sounds coming from a nearby hill at the foot of a mountain. Investigating the area, Sineng unearthed a hoard which included a reclining Buddha statue and set out to build a great temple in honour of the image, which he believed had been revealed by divine favour.Sonya S. Lee, Surviving Nirvana: Death of the Buddha in Chinese Visual Culture (Hong Kong University Press, 2010), p. 265 The nirvana image in the temple has a long history of patrons and visitors and has been protected for centuries by its Buddhist monks, but it has also suffered from decay and restoration. Protecting it was most difficult during the Cultural Revolution. There is a story that Kublai Khan (1215-1294) was born in the temple, while his mother was living there, and another that Bing, the last Song dynasty (960-1279) emperor, was exiled to Zhangye and became a monk in the temple. However, Ruth W. Dunnell has reported that she has been unable to find evidence to support either of these claims. She notes that they \\"illustrate the accretion of legend around this particular Buddhist site\\".Dunnell (1996), p. 82 The Hall of Scriptures has a double wall behind it and is forty metres long, twenty metres high. In 1996 the temple was added to the list of major national historical and cultural sites and the Beijing Review reported that 6,000 volumes of ancient Buddhist scriptures survived in the temple.Beijing Review, Volume 39 (1996), p. 29 In 2005, the temple was reinstated as a place of worship, and the next year it was re-opened after a major restoration which aimed to promote it as a tourist attraction. On 1 July 2006, dozens of Buddhist masters blessed a large crowd which attended, in the largest gathering seen at the temple for more than a hundred years. The statue and its hall The hall with reclining Buddha The temple's huge statue is made of clay on a wooden frame and depicts the Gautama Buddha's attainment of nirvana, with his ten disciples standing behind him. It is largely unaltered since the time of the Western Xia (1038-1227). With a length of some , Ruth W. Dunnell has described it as \\"the largest reclining clay Buddha statue in China\\".Ruth W.

The game was published by Digital Tribe and released on Steam for Microsoft Windows and Linux on April 4, 2016. It was nominated for 9 AGS Awards and won 3, including that of Best Gameplay. Since its release, it has been met with mostly positive reviews. Reviewers praised the story, gameplay and voice-acting, while noting the steep difficulty level an apparent problem.  Gameplay  Until I Have You is a 2D side-scrolling action platform video game which has 12 chapters with 4 stages and a unique boss each, taking place within a different setting. The goal for each stage is to get to the end of the stage as fast as possible without falling, getting killed or depleting your sanity gauge. Central to Until I Have You is the exoskeleton suit. The suit gives the player special abilities at the cost of the player's sanity. The exoskeleton comes with the abilities to slow down time, ala Max Payne and to rewind time. However, overuse of these abilities will cause the sanity bar to deplete making your character lose touch with reality. When the sanity bar depletes your character starts to hallucinate, altering gameplay mechanics and level design. In each stage, the player navigates his way from left to right through platforming sections, death traps, and enemies. The goal is to do this as fast as possible with the fewest deaths. The fast pace of the game can make it difficult to plan a perfect approach. To make up for this, the game allows the player to restart each stage the moment they die, allowing them to quickly fine-tune their approach over several attempts. At the end of each chapter the player must also defeat a unique boss. Along the way the player acquires a number of weapons and upgrades that you can cycle through, all of which have a specific use. The game grades the player's performance at the end of each stage based on a number of factors and given a percentage rating out of 100. Things you get judged on include method of death, whether you kill any of the enemies and what you killed them with.  Plot   Development  = Voice cast = The main protagonist The Artist is voiced by Kieran Flitton and the primary antagonist, Keiroth is voiced by actor Vincent van Ommen. Another character includes the Newscaster, voiced by Marissa Lenti (One Piece, Attack on Titan), a broadcaster who provides information about story and insights into the world.  Soundtrack  The Until I Have You - Official Soundtrack is an atmospheric synthesizer driven soundtrack created by James Spanos. It is freely available on Valve's digital distribution platform, Steam, as downloadable content for the main game. The soundtrack contains 34 tracks, available in both MP3 and FLAC format. James Spanos mentioned that Lazerhawk, Hans Zimmer's Interstellar, Miami Nights, Garth Knight, and Tangerine Dream have been the main influences for the soundtrack.  Reception  Until I Have You received mostly positive reviews from critics, with praise given to its cyberpunk-style depiction of the game, its solid voice-acting and nuanced story. The game's synth-driven soundtrack was lauded for accentuating the already bleak and retro atmosphere. In 2017, Until I Have You was nominated in for 9 AGS Awards, including Best Game Created with AGS, Best Gameplay, Best Music and Best Voice Acting. UniversalGamingReviews scored the game 9/10, reviewer Shaun Meyers wrote \\"\\"Until I Have you is a pretty solid hardcore platformer backed up by an excellent art style, great (and atmospheric) soundtrack and very well done voice acting\\".https://www.universalgamingreviews.com/until-i-have-you-overview-and- review/ Rock, Paper, Shotgun's reviewer wrote \\"The parallax scrolling, great art and the 2D effects, the moving platforms, bosses and a particularly enjoyable selection of enemies should at the very least inspire you to give Until I Have You a try.\\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/until-i-have-you/ Hardcore Gamer gave the Until I Have You a 3/5, commenting that the graphics and music perfectly captured the classic cyberpunk feel, and praising how the games manages to keep each new level feeling different. The website's review also gave very high marks to the story and gameplay. OperationRainFall awarded it 3.5 out of 5, specifically praising the voice-acting, saying \\"The voice- overs for the characters are also well done to the point where I consider them better than most dubs in localized Japanese titles and it is also clear that there was effort put into them to match the atmosphere of the game.\\" Hookedgamers praised about Until I Have You's story, design and voice-acting, and particularly noted the style: \\"There is a consistent bleak retro cyberpunk feel throughout the game, but it never becomes boring\\". The reviewer also noted the, at times, high difficulty level of game. Saying it can be frustrating for the players, ultimately giving it a 6/10. Awards In 2016 the game received nine AGS Awards nominations. And won three AGS Awards in the categories Best Gameplay, Best Programming and Best Non Adventure Game Created with AGS.

The king of Ba ordered Ba Manzi to lead troops to reinforce the capital. Ba Manzi's army was not strong enough to fight both the rebellion and Shu kingdom at the same time, so Ba Manzi asked the Chu state for help. He made a promise to the king of Chu that he would cede three towns to Chu if Chu could help Ba put down the rebellion. The king of Chu sent out his troops and helped Ba Manzi defeat the rebels and Shu army. After that, the king of Chu sent out an envoy to Ba to take over three towns. Ba Manzi told the Chu envoy that, as a general, he could not cede those three towns to another kingdom, but he was willing to compensate for his promises with his life. He then committed suicide by slitting his throat.Êôã¬∑Â∏∏Áí©„ÄäÂçéÈò≥ÂõΩÂøó„ÄãÔºöÂë®‰πãÂ≠£‰∏ñÔºåÂ∑¥ÂõΩÊúâ‰π±„ÄÇÂ∞ÜÂÜõËîìÂ≠êËØ∑Â∏à‰∫éÊ•öÔºåËÆ∏‰ª•‰∏âÂüé„ÄÇÊ•öÁéãÊïëÂ∑¥ÔºåÂ∑¥ÂõΩÊó¢ÂÆÅÔºåÊ•ö‰ΩøËØ∑Âüé„ÄÇËîìÂ≠êÊõ∞Ôºö‚ÄúÁ±çÊ•ö‰πãÁÅµÔºåÂÖãÂº≠Á•∏ÈöæÔºåËØöËÆ∏Ê•öÁéãÂüéÔºåÂ∞ÜÂêæÂ§¥ÂæÄË∞¢‰πãÔºåÂüé‰∏çÂèØÂæó‰πüÔºÅ‚Äù‰πÉËá™ÂàéÔºå‰ª•Â§¥ÊéàÊ•ö‰Ωø„ÄÇÊ•öÁéãÂèπÊõ∞Ôºö‚Äú‰ΩøÂêæÂæóËá£Ëã•ËîìÂ≠êÔºåÁî®Âüé‰Ωï‰∏∫ÔºÅ‚Äù‰πÉ‰ª•‰∏äÂçø‰πãÁ§ºËë¨ÂÖ∂Â§¥„ÄÇÂ∑¥ÂõΩËë¨ÂÖ∂Ë∫´‰∫¶‰ª•‰∏äÂçøÁ§º„ÄÇ The Chu envoy took Ba Manzi's head back to his king.

The painting is currently housed in le Mus√©e des Augustins, in Toulouse, France. Description Against the backdrop of a desert landscape, a naked man appears to advance towards a floating female figure clothed in a virginal white dress that emanates in the right portion of the painting. The man in the painting is followed by a group of women clothed in transparent flowery attire. The group seems to dance and sing in order to attract his attention. In the center of the group is a woman in black dress with peacock feathers and butterfly wings, which symbolize vice in its many forms. The work is signed \\"Henri Martin 92\\" in the lower right corner. History Martin adopted a divisionist (pointillist) technique upon returning to Paris from Italy in the 1880s His style was slowly transitioning from realism. This work in particular is unusual because of the realist portrayal of the man's body.

Described in media as ‚Äòhotly anticipated‚Äô, the book provoked some speculation regarding the inspiration behind protagonist Robert Wardner, a troubled rock star who was speculated to have been inspired by several real- life musicians. Background The novel was written as part of a PhD in Creative Writing at Northumbria University. Undertaking research for it the author ‚Äòlanded meetings with bands and artists including Savages and Gazelle Twin'. Mankowski ‚Äòsent a tweet to Jehnny Beth from Savages and was immediately invited to meet up with her‚Äô, which ‚Äòopened up doors to meet with other artists too'. Their conversation was later published by Jehnny Beth, on her blog. According to Mankowski, 'The novel was hard to write, and went through two publishers and three agents before finding a home.' He added, 'these negotiations led to me write about thirty drafts of the novel and to often despair over whether the novel was worth anyone's time.' After publication it was noted that there were ‚Äòechoes of Richey Edwards and Ian Curtis of Joy Division, in the books main character‚Äô. Richey Edwards was co-lyricist of the Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. Edwards suffered from depression, alcoholism, anorexia and self-harm and he disappeared on 1 February 1995. In a review of the book The Huffington Post recalled Edwards‚Äô disappearance, adding ‚Äòperhaps this is the figure that Guy Mankowski had in mind when he began to pen his latest novel‚Äô. In an interview between Mankowski and Kingsley Chapman, former singer of The Chapman Family, Chapman added to speculation by commenting: ‚ÄòWhen I read your book and I visualise the band, at least two of them look like members of the Manics.‚Äô Mankowski replied; ‚ÄòI‚Äôve been asked before if my main character is based on one of their members and I always duck the question. Richey Edwards was such a brilliant artist, so I‚Äôm adverse to the idea of portraying him [directly] in a novel. The danger is I‚Äôll reduce someone complex who wasn‚Äôt simply a member of a band I loved, but who had a whole other life that I don‚Äôt have a right to trespass into.‚Äô In an interview with 3:AM Magazine in 2016 Mankowski confirmed 'Robert Wardner was a mix of influences ‚Äì you rightly identify Richey Edwards and Ian Curtis, but I didn't want to fictionalize these people in a ‚Äústraight‚Äù way as I didn't get to know them and felt it would be disrespectful, not to mention impossible, to portray such people. Mark E. Smith was also in the mix.' Pages of the notebooks Mankowski used to research the novel were published in the 2015 academic textbook Creative Writing: A NAWE Handbook For Teachers. Plot The book is ‚Äòwritten from the alternating perspective of Robert Wardner, a recovering post-punk rockstar recalling the peak of his manic fame in the grimy early 80s, and an investigative journalist named Sam, tracked down by a publisher to capitalise upon the rock star‚Äôs rumoured re-emergence by writing a book telling the story of his disappearance in-between‚Äô. Damon Fairclough, for Louder Than War, commented that ‚Äòthe plot throws Forbes into a mission to track down one of the most enigmatic frontmen of the eighties‚Ä¶who apparently led his group from Top of the Pops to global success before vanishing from the face of the earth.‚Äô Themes For the Glasgow Review of Books, Laura Waddell commented that ‚ÄòMankowski‚Äôs novel is about the pitfalls of externally defined identity; the inability to find meaning and purpose on an individual or societal level results in an attachment to mere symbols of existence. One ill- fitting mode of living is replaced by another, successfully portrayed as shallow and unsatisfying, just tipping over the edge of not quite right or real enough,‚Äô adding that ‚ÄòWardner‚Äôs organic choice to check out from these options altogether ‚Äì how he left the national grid ‚Äì is the closest he comes to contentment and self knowledge.‚Äô But Louder Than War argued that ‚Äòthis intriguing novel is more about the pop fan‚Äôs urge to remember, to hold on to the magic of lost soundtracks and the moments to which they‚Äôre attached.‚Äô The Huffington Post also focused upon the books nostalgic element, writing ‚ÄòMankowski transports us back to a world of smouldering band managers, corpulent record executives and, of course, the ‚Äògirl next door‚Äô who writes a journal, reads Satre and listens to The Cure. It is a world Mankowski clearly relishes - a bygone era in the 70's, 80's and 90's when people ran fanclubs, wrote fanzines and edited fan-forums to honour their stars and forge friendships‚Äô. Northern Soul also focused upon the significance of the era portrayed in the book as ‚Äòa time, a sound, and a culture which never really seems to have left many of us, and it speaks directly to, and for, subsequent generations in yet another time of Conservative rule, high unemployment and increasing alienation from a digital world.

It shows a group of riders on the Scheveningen beach, painted in an impressionistic style. The work is now in the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. History Mauve was a member of the Hague School, which was known for its portrayal of the harsh existence of fishermen in Scheveningen. Here, however, Mauve chose a different subject in depicting a bourgeois group riding along the beach. The painting shows a group of riders descending to the beach, with bathing cabins ready for swimmers. The riding horses are unusual for a Mauve piece, as he was known for painting animals in their natural environment and was particularly famous for his landscapes with sheep. Mauve chose a particular color scheme of blue and yellow, which is effective in depicting the seaside atmosphere. The movement of light in the painting suggests a high amount of dynamism and motion. The ingenious use of light in the painting was proven to be more skillful than previously thought after a restoration of the painting was completed in 1991. The restoration removed the yellowish tinge that had permeated the work, and revealed another surprising thing. In his commitment to realism, the artist had depicted horse droppings in the scene, which one of the previous owners must have deemed sufficiently indecent to warrant a covering up.

He is the foremost interpreter of music composed by Thomas de Hartmann (1885‚Äì1956) and the spiritualist George Gurdjieff (1866 or 1867‚Äì1949). As a teen, Sicroff trained as a classical pianist at the Juilliard Preparatory School under Jeaneane Dowis, specializing in Bart√≥k. \\"When I first found Bart√≥k‚Äôs music, I was 14,\\" he recalled in a 2010 interview. \\"My teacher gave me the Three Rondos on Folk Tunes, from Hungary. I was at the Juilliard Preparatory School, and I needed something modern for the final exam of my first year there. I played it through once and I didn‚Äôt understand it. The second time, I was addicted. For years, I was playing only Bart√≥k.\\"Oksanen, Reijo, Elan Sicroff interview, Gurdjieff Internet Guide, 2010 He later studied at the Oberlin Conservatory. He attended the International Academy for Continuous Education in Sherborne, UK, directed by John G. Bennett, one of the leading exponents of Gurdjieff's teachings. From 1975 to 1979 he trained with Mme. Olga de Hartmann, the composer's widow. About his training with Mme. de Hartmann, Sicroff said, \\"Her greatest interest in the interpretation and performance of her husband‚Äôs music was that feeling should be transmitted through it. She was unimpressed by fingers running up and down the keyboard, and she would sometimes say things that would irritate me. She would say that none of the pianists on the world stage really played with feeling. This was very hard for me to accept, and it took many years for it to really become clear to me, just what she was talking about.\\"Oksanen, ibid. In 1982, Sicroff undertook a concert tour of the US, introducing de Hartmann's neglected works to a wider audience. Sicroff has performed at such prestigious concert venues as London‚Äôs Wigmore Hall, Carnegie Recital Hall in New York,Hughes, Allen, \\"Music: Debuts in Review; Elan Sicroff, Violinist, Performs de Hartmann,\\" The New York Times, June 21, 1981 Bulgaria's National Academy of Music, and Madrid's Muzeum Hudby, as well as with the Santa Fe Symphony.

He lives in the Netherlands.

In 2006, guitarist Robert Fripp (of the band King Crimson), an adherent of the teachings of Gurdjieff and an admirer of de Hartmann's music, proposed that Sicroff take on the task of bringing the Russian composer's music back into concert halls. \\"Fripp said to me, 'If you don‚Äôt get this music known, nobody is going to do it,'\\" said Sicroff. \\"The Gurdjieff music is safe. Many, many people are playing the Gurdjieff now. It‚Äôs the de Hartmann classical music that is still sitting under a rock.\\"Marcello, Joseph, \\"Resurrected music of an Unsung Master\\", The Recorder, March 2, 2016 For this purpose, the Thomas de Hartmann Project was conceived.

Career Born in 1966, Campbell first experienced competitive snooker in the 1986 Scottish Amateur Championship, where Steve Muir beat him 9‚Äì3 in the final. During the 1988‚Äì89 season, he entered three WPBSA main tour qualifying events, reaching the final of Event 2 of the Pro Ticket Series, where Thai prospect James Wattana defeated him 5‚Äì1, and winning his match against Gary Filtness 5‚Äì2 in the Professional Play-offs to secure his place on tour. Campbell's first season as a professional was underwhelming; early exits in the Hong Kong Open to Les Dodd and in the Asian Open to John Rea were followed by second-round losses in the next four ranking events. In the 1990 European Open, he overcame Pat Houlihan and Dave Gilbert to reach the last 64, but was beaten there 5‚Äì4 by John Virgo. At the 1990 Dubai Classic, Campbell produced the best performance of his career, defeating Ken Owers, Craig Edwards and Tony Meo to reach the last 32, where he lost 3‚Äì5 to Jason Whittaker; he repeated this feat in that season's European Open, but again could progress no further, losing 2‚Äì5 to Steve James. Campbell's ranking had improved to 66th for the 1990‚Äì91 season, but the next was poor, heralding only three wins from fourteen matches. Having lost all nine of his matches in 1992‚Äì93, he did not play professionally again; ranked 158th by that season's conclusion, Campbell was relegated from the tour in 1994.

The part of the Swan Princess was performed by his wife, Nadezhda Zabela-Vrubel. History Vrubel drew inspiration for this piece from a Savva Mamontov private opera that premiered on 21 December 1900. Vrubel was the costume designer for the opera, while his wife played the part of the Swan Princess. However, the face of the Swan Princess in the painting does not resemble that of his spouse, as evidenced by a photo taken at the time the opera was shown. The art critic Nikolai Prakhov opined that the painting drew upon the likeness of his sister, Elena Prakhov. It is possible that Vrubel combined the likeness of Elena and his wife, or an unknown lover. The artist painted this piece at the farm of his parents in Chernihiv oblast, in present-day Ukraine, in the summer of 1900.

Its primary business is frozen baked desserts, which it prepares both for private label customers, and for marketing under its own Chudleigh's brand. Chudleigh's also operates Chudleigh's Farm, an entertainment farm in Milton, Ontario, located on the apple farm where the company was founded.  History  Eric and Marion Chudleigh established a commercial apple orchard in Milton, Ontario, Canada, in 1955, and began propagating an experimental compact apple tree that would make harvesting more efficient. Their son, Tom, took over Chudleigh's Farm in 1963 after completing his BSc (Agr) at the Ontario Agricultural College. In 1967, Chudleigh's opened its farm to the public during apple season, allowing visitors to pick their own apples. In 1973, Tom's wife Carol began offering visitors slices of homemade apple pie, and by the 1980s, the farm was selling fresh baked whole pies to both farm visitors and restaurants in nearby Toronto. In 1990, a fire destroyed most of the Chudleigh's Farm facility, leaving only the family home. In the aftermath and rebuilding, the commercial bakery was relocated to a separate facility nearby. Since then, it has remained in dedicated facilities as it has grown, occupying its current 120,000 sq. ft. Milton location in 2007. The Chudleigh's Farm continues to operate as a popular destination for families, as well as an event space between July 1 - October 31 every year. The farm activities include pick-your-own apples, a hay maze, farm animals, various swings, slides and play areas, as well as a retail and restaurant area. Tom and Carol's sons Dean and Scott both joined the business (in 1986 and 1990 respectively), and have led the growth of the commercial bakery. Today, all four Chudleighs, along with other family members, actively manage the bakery and farm operations of Chudleigh's Limited.

Their name is an acronym for \\"Uptown Niggas Living Violent\\". Music career The original members of the group were Lil Ya (Yaphet Jones), Tec-9 (Jermaine Stines), and Yella Boy (Albert Thomas). Their debut album, 6th and Baronne, was released in 1993 on Cash Money. The album was not released outside of the local region, but it was successful there and established Cash Money as a prominent label in the city. Today it is often considered a classic of New Orleans rap. Their next two albums, Straight Out Tha Gutta in 1994 and Mac Melph Calio in 1995, were similar to their debut. The raps were mostly about guns, violence, and sex overlaying New Orleans bounce beats provided by Mannie Fresh. The group released one more album on Cash Money in 1996, titled Uptown 4 Life. This was the group's first album to have more than a local distribution, and it was their first and only album to chart nationally, peaking at #86 on the Billboard R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album featured the song \\"Drag 'Em in the River\\", which was a diss song directed at fellow New Orleans rapper Mystikal. According to Mannie Fresh in a 2008 interview, the song's beat was the major reason Cash Money was able to sign rapper Juvenile, and in 2001 the same beat was reused for Juvenile's single \\"Set It Off\\". The group's success was tempered, however, by the death of group member Yella Boy, who was murdered in 1997 in New Orleans. Following this album, the group left Cash Money Records. Although the group was no longer on the label, Cash Money began re-releasing the group's albums and giving them national distribution. This would later lead to a lawsuit from the group against the label, claiming they could not re-release their material without their permission when they were not on the label. The suit was settled in July 2007, with the settlement being confidential. After leaving Cash Money, the group went on a hiatus for some time, but in the 2000s they have released three more studio albums, The Return of U.N.L.V.: Trendsetters in 2001, Keep It Gutta in 2003, and \\"The Relaunch\\" on May 20, 2014. Their latest album has a feature from former Cash Money member Turk. Following the settlement of their 2007 lawsuit with Cash Money, U.N.L.V. released \\"U.N.L.V. Greatest Hits Collection.

The film is directed by J. D. Dillard, written by Dillard and Alex Theurer and stars Jacob Latimore, Seychelle Gabriel, Dul√© Hill, Storm Reid, Sasheer Zamata and Michael Villar. The film was released on April 28, 2017, by WWE Studios and Blumhouse Tilt. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $4 million worldwide, against its $250,000 budget. Plot A young street magician named Bo (Jacob Latimore) is left to care for his little sister after their parents' death and turns to illegal activities to keep a roof over their heads. By day Bo performs magic tricks all over Los Angeles, with his specialty as being able to control anything metal, even float it in the air. He does this by building an electromagnet into his arm, with the negative electrode of the battery running to his thumb and the positive electrode running to his fingers. He first developed the electromagnet in high school for a science project, which earned him an engineering scholarship but he had to turn it down in order to take care of his sister after his mom died. By night he sells drugs to pay the bills, seeing it as steady work with his supplier Angelo usually being a nice guy. However, things get ugly when a new kingpin comes in and starts selling drugs for cheaper on their turf. Angelo has Bo find this kingpin, so Bo uses his pickpocketing skills as a magician when he goes to a club, managed by one of Bo's friends, where the new kingpin has his dealers selling. Bo asks one of the dealers for drugs and pickpockets his phone to look up his call history, and finds out that his supplier's name is Maurice. Angelo finds where Maurice lives, invades his house with Bo and forces Bo to chop off his hand. Bo then gets in too deep when he tries to skim $15,000 off the money he makes from drug dealing so he and his sister can leave town. When Angelo finds out, he threatens to kill Bo unless he can come up with $45,000 in one week. Bo finds the money, but has to steal the last $9,000 from his friend the club owner by watching her unlock the safe when she invites him up to the main office; he pickpockets the office keys as they leave. He waits to have one last drink with his friend, feeling guilty for having stolen from her, yet relieved he may make it out of his predicament alive. However, Maurice's gang is at the club at the same time. When they spot him, they knock him out, handcuff him and put him in the trunk of a car. Bo manages to escape by using his electromagnet to lift the latches on the handcuffs and trunk, but Maurice stole all his money. When his sister is kidnapped by Angelo as ransom, he is forced to get back in touch with his old high school science teacher to get more power to his electromagnet. The teacher has an idea to add a feedback oscillator, but warns that it may cause the wires in his arm to overheat. Bo then goes to Angelo's house with the supplemented electromagnet to find out where his sister is, where he rips out one of his ex-co-worker's gold teeth, hits the other with his own aluminum bat and then sends it flying into the wall. When Angelo goes to shoot him, he stops the bullets and causes the lights to flicker. He then drops the bullets to the floor, picks one up and slowly burrows it into Angelo's forehead to force him to divulge Bo's sister's whereabouts. After Angelo tells Bo that his sister is with his aunt, he releases the bullet from Angelo and gives him $15,000 before leaving. Bo goes to pick her up with his arm burnt and they start a new life with Bo's girlfriend Holly in San Diego. As they are getting accustomed to their life, Bo still does street magic as his arm has now healed and Holly walks in on him in the bathroom late at night developing a new trick after waking up to all the lights in the house flickering.

Description The painting depicts a demon sitting atop a mountain. His flexed musculature and wrought hands contrast vividly with his slumped figure and sad facial expression. He appears at once passive, introverted, proud and solitary. His body shows contrasting masculinity and femininity with his long hair and indolent gaze. His face seems desperate for love in his cold surroundings. The painting's background is a mountainous area in a scarlet sunset. The composition emphasizes the constraint of the demon's figure, as if pressed between the upper and lower bars of the frame. The painting is created in Vrubel's unique style with the effect of crystal edges, which makes his paintings look like stained glasses or panels. That effect was achieved with plain strokes made with a painting knife. History In 1889, Vrubel moved to Moscow where he would produce The Demon Seated as his first large canvas. The work was harshly criticized, yet moved him into a higher realm of artistic expression. In this piece, among others, Vrubel explored the theme of a Demon from Mikhail Lermontov's 1839 poem, which tells of a Byronic demon that fell in love with a Georgian princess, who dies as a result of his kiss.Visual Art: Symbolism: Vrubel's The Demon Seated Vrubel portrays the Demon as a romantic spirit, full of hope and searching for harmony and truth. He seems to briefly fulfill his longing, but suddenly has his hopes dashed. The Demon is disillusioned and pines for retribution. In the end, he is crushed and has no place in this world.Russian Art: Mikhail Vrubel (1856-1910) Vrubel described this Demon as ‚Äúa spirit uniting in itself masculine and feminine qualities‚Ä¶a spirit, not so much evil as suffering and sorrowing, but in all that a powerful spirit‚Ä¶a majestic spirit‚Äù. Later, the painter created two more pieces on that theme: The Demon Flying (1899) and The Demon Downcast (1901‚Äî1902).

It was founded in 1990, and in 1994 it served as a foundation for the new American Friends of the Czech Republic (AFoCR). History In 1989, the communist governments of Central and Eastern Europe were in a state of collapse. The Polish Solidarity trade union and popularity of John Paul II helped force an election in Poland that created a new non-communist government. Hungary opened its borders with Austria, and in East Germany the Berlin Wall had fallen. Next month, on November 17, 1989, the Czechoslovak communist government-sanctioned ceremony took place in Prague to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1939 shutdown of Czech universities by the Nazi government, in which 1200 people were arrested, and 9 students murdered. This ceremony devolved into a peaceful anti-government protest in the streets of downtown Prague, and eventually culminated in the Velvet Revolution, which brought (without violence) a transition of power from the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia to a democratic federal republic. As in many other former communist countries, the collapse of the communist regime excited many people of Czech and Slovak background who sought ways to extend support to the new fledgling republics in their transition to a democratic form of governance and in the transition to a free-market economy. In the immediate aftermath of the revolution, there was a void for the presence of such organizations for Czechoslovakia. In Washington, D.C., a political refugee from Czechoslovakia, Robert Miller, along with George Levendis, using an ad in The Washington Post, called for a founding meeting of the American Czechoslovak Society (ACS). The meeting took place in the Georgetown Public Library on February 7, 1990 with Hana Palec, from the Czechoslovak desk at Voice of America reporting. The meeting was attended by 75 people, split between those with and without Czech or Slovak ethnic background. Resolutions on key organizational steps were adopted and, subsequently, the ACS was registered as a Delaware corporation (Company# 2221522), subsequently receiving the IRS Code 501-c-3 non-profit status. After the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia on January 1, 1993, - called in reference to the Velvet Revolution - the \\"Velvet Divorce\\", the ACS changed its name to the American Czech & Slovak Association (ACSA). In February 1993, the ACSA moved from its original offices on 601 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW to the historical Investment Building, closer to the White House, on 1511 K Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20005. In 1994, with more focus given to the advocacy role, the ACSA became the foundation for the newly founded and also Washington, D.C. based non-profit organization, American Friends of the Czech Republic (AFoCR). Description and Statement of Mission The ACSA was a leading national Czech and Slovak focused non-profit organization registered in 1990 in Delaware with a mission to facilitate bilateral U.S. - Czech and Slovak cooperation in various areas of human endeavor and to assist the new democracy and free market reform. It was not primarily a diaspora and ethnic- based organization; rather, it brought together individual Americans and American private and public sector organizations sharing an interest in bilateral cooperation and supporting the post-Velvet Revolution era development in the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. =Statement of Mission= A nonprofit, nonpolitical, nongovernmental membership organization to: 1\\\\.

Organizational Structure =Officers= Robert Miller, President and Founder Oliver Gunovsky, Vice President Robert Doubek, Vice President, and Treasurer Cari Votava, Secretary =Academic Affairs Committee= Chaired by Michael Harthill, the committee provided links, contacts, and information to education-related organizations in both the United States and Czechoslovakia as well as to great numbers of volunteers willing to help with reform of educational system or teach English in schools in the Czech and Slovak Republics. The Committee also organized the collection and shipment of English language textbooks, books, video cassettes and CDs with language and educational context. Annually, on average, ACS/ACSA sent to the Czech or Slovak Republics about 50 volunteer teachers of English. =Business and Trade Committee= Chaired by Ann Elizabeth Robinson, PhD, committee members facilitated development of databases of companies in both countries seeking cooperation and trade opportunities, investment, joint-ventures and transfer of know-how. The committee served as a contact point for visiting officials from Ministry of Industry and Trade, trade associations, and legislators. =Health and Environmental Committee= Chaired by Charles P. Warr, the committee taped extensive network of contact and sources of information in the area of public health and environmental protection, in particular, to assist people and governmental institutions in Czech and Slovak Republics to start effectively addressing very serious problems in environmental degradation, starting with significant air pollution caused by the heavily industrialized economy and decades of significant neglect in remedial measures. On the healthcare side, besides assisting in scientific exchanges in health care and research, the committee, in cooperation with the Polish American Congress and the Olga Havel Foundation, delivered to the Czech and Slovak republic in total 50 kidney dialysis machines. =Organizational Development and Fundraising= Chaired by the ACS Vice-President, Robert W.

Under its Editor-in-Chief, Cari Votava and then Julie Mazur, the monthly newsletter became a valuable source of information on bilateral U.S-Czechoslovak agenda to those in the private or public sector, individuals and institutions interested in the development and expansion of cooperation. The ACS News Editor-in-Chief and her team interviewed key players in the bilateral agenda, including national leaders and officials. =National Advisory Board= Hon.

Julian Niemczyk, former U.S. Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, provided important support to Czechoslovak dissidents and Charter 77 members during his mission in Prague before 1989, and provided significant assistance to the newly formed government after the Velvet Revolution. Hon. Charles A. Vanik, Member of U.S. Congress (D-OH), representing the Cleveland district, as an accomplished U.S. legislator, being the co-author with U.S. Senator, Henry M. Jackson (D-WA), of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment which played a significant role in relations with the Soviet Union. The Amendment for decades denied the Soviet Union and its satellites status as favorable trade nations in bilateral trade unless they adhered to certain guidelines set out on human rights. After the Velvet Revolution, Vanik led numerous initiatives in gathering support in the U.S. to support the new Czechoslovak government, helping secure re-admission of the republic to the International Money Fund and the World Bank. In October, 1995, in recognition of Mr. Vanik's life-long achievements in assistance to democracy, and upon nomination by the ACSA President, Robert Miller, the president of the Czech Republic, V√°clav Havel, awarded Charles Vanik with one of the highest Czech honors, the Order of Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk, 1st Class. The act took place at the Vladislav Hall at the Prague Castle, at a traditional gala-ceremony celebrating Czechoslovak Independence Day. Hon. Paul Simon, U.S. Senator (D-IL), represented Illinois - a state with large Central and Eastern European communities. He was substantially involved in the post-Cold War Congressional legislative activities which were important in helping to fill the power vacuum caused by the dissolution of the Soviet Union. =Honorary Patrons= Poster for panel discussion on \\"Czechoslovakia - 1992\\" with H.E.

Canetoli escaped the massacre of his parents and brothers who were killed in Bologna during a political feud and embraced the religious life not long after where he became noted to the point he turned down repeated offers to serve as the Archbishop of Bologna and the Archbishop of Florence. His beatification received full approval on 2 October 1748 after Pope Benedict XIV approved the late priest's local 'cultus' - or popular devotion. Life Arcangelo Canetoli was born in Bologna in 1460 to nobles. His relations were all massacred during his childhood during a political feud with the Bentivoglio house. The Canetoli house had been accused of the death of Annibale Bentivoglio in an apparent move that ignited the longstanding feud between the two houses. He soon after entered the canons regular of Santa Maria di Reno (an order that originated from Venice) on 29 September 1484 and was later ordained to the priesthood in 1498. Canetoli lived at the Sant'Ambrogio convent in Gubbio from 1498 after being made a priest and would remain there for the rest of his life; he requested this transfer himself. He repeated his refusals to be appointed as the Archbishop of Bologna. He became the vicar of the San Daniele in Monte convent in Padua in 1505 and held the position until 1509. Canetoli predicted that Giovanni de' Medici would be elected as pope sometime soon and when de' Medici became Pope Leo X in 1513 the pope's brother Giuliano de' Medici summoned him to Florence in an attempt to persuade him to become the new Archbishop of Florence. Canetoli refused and returned to his convent. Canetoli died on 16 April 1513 from an intense period of fever. His remains were interred in the convent that he resided in on 3 December 1513 and are incorrupt. Beatification His beatification received formal ratification on 2 October 1748 from Pope Benedict XIV after the latter confirmed that there existed a local 'cultus' - otherwise known as popular veneration - that endured since the late priest's death.

Combining styles from groups of the first wave of punk with newer indie rock influences, the band was a major part of the vanguard which represented the D.C. music scene's new direction in the aftermath of the Revolution Summer movement. In addition to their music, the Most Secret Method developed a signature visual art style on their concert posters and 1998 album, Get Lovely, thanks to drums player Ryan Nelson. History Founded in 1995, the Most Secret Method featured the trio of Johanna Claasen (bass guitar, vocals), and brothers Marc Nelson (lead guitar, vocals) and Ryan Nelson (drums). The band made its debut at the high-profile independent music nightclub the Black Cat alongside fellow D.C. band the Capitol City Dusters. Live performances in the D.C. punk scene's abundance of venues and widely observed all-ages policy helped the group hone their heavily-emphasized rhythm technique, while attracting a sizable following in a brief amount of time. Additionally, the Most Secret Method incorporated stylistic tendencies from like-minded groups of the D.C. punk community such as Juno, the Dismemberment Plan, Smart Went Crazy, and Jawbox. Ryan Nelson thought \\"to a large extent the D.C. musicians of the ‚Äò90s were influenced by the Revolution Summer bands. I certainly was. And by the time we got around to forming our own bands, there was still an active underground community - a network of places to play and kids to stay with around the country\\". In 1997, the Most Secret Method split an EP with the Capitol City Dusters on Superbad Records, a subsidiary of Dischord Records. In addition to the band's musical aesthetic, much was made of Ryan Nelson's visual art designs on the Most Secret Method's concert fliers. Well aware of the designs of artists including Raymond Pettibon (designer of Black Flag album covers and the Sonic Youth's Goo artwork), Love and Rockets creator Jaime Hernandez, and Ghost World writer and artist Daniel Clowes, Nelson's artwork for the band became immediately recognizable and considered among the best the area produced. Combine with the group's split EP, Nelson's artistic style was instrumental in landing their record deal with Slowdime Records in 1998. Jawbox‚Äôs guitarist J. Robbins collaborated with the Most Secret Method to record and mix their debut album, titled Get Lovely, at Arlington‚Äôs Inner Ear Studios. Music historian Brandon Gentrey described the album as a \\"sterling example of Capitol City post- hardcore indie ruckus, buzzing, dynamic, and smart\\", while managing to stand the test of time. Released in September 1998, Get Lovely features cover art and inner sleeve designs by Nelson, who was inspired to create a piece which rivaled the boldness of Big Black's Songs About Fucking. The album had a profound influence on the following generation of punk bands, with groups such as Q and Not U and Black Eyes exhibiting signs of the Most Secret Method's style. Following the distribution of Get Lovely, the group had a down period in which the band members took to other activities. Ryan Nelson played in the bands the Dead Teenagers and Beauty Pill, Marc Nelson devoted time to acting, and Claasen focused on practicing standup bass, before resurfacing in 2002 to release their second album Our Success. In August 2002, the Most Secret Method returned for a series of concerts at the Black Cat before disbanding. Nelson continued his music career, forming the band the Soccer Team, which has released two albums for Dischord Records. Marc Nelson began acting full time under the stage name Marcus Kyd. He went on to found Taffety Punk Theatre Company in Washington, DC, with choreographer Erin F. Mitchell, actors Lise Bruneau and Chris Marino, and manager Amanda MacKaye.

It is part of the municipality of Simpelveld in the province of Limburg, about 20 km east of Maastricht. The village lies on a hill, north of Simpelveld, and south of Ubachsberg. In 2008 the village had a population of 350 on an area of 0.44 km2. On the hillside south of Huls lies Hulsveld, a hamlet sharing the same name with a population of 1630. Since the hamlets share a single built-up area, and are both located on the hill called Huls, the village Huls is sometimes mistaken to include Hulsveld. https://www.plaatsengids.nl/huls Huls], Plaatsengids.nl, viewed on 20 August 2016  Etymology  An archive from 1454 refers to Huls as \\"die Heuls\\". The name is believed to refer to holly plants, hulst in Dutch, that used to grow in the area. Huls (gemeente Simpelveld), Rijckheyt archives for the municipalities Brunssum, Gulpen- Wittem, Heerlen, Nuth, Simpelveld and Voerendaal, viewed on 20 August 2016 Due to the location on a hill the people off Huls are locally referred to as living \\"on Huls\\" instead of living \\"in Huls\\".  History  The remains of three Roman farms were found in the village, including a large villa, which were built between 75-100 CE by retired soldiers and public servants who were granted land in the area. These farms were destroyed around 250 CE by Germanic invaders. Archeological findings show Huls was inhabited during the Merovingian and Carolingian era. In 1840 Huls was made up out of 29 houses and had a population of 135. At this time Huls also included the separate area of Lauvenberg, which is no longer mentioned in atlasses. In 2008 the village had a population of 350 on an area of 0.44 km2, and a population density of 795 per km2.  Geography  The area is made up out of inliers and outliers. The Huls hill lies on the southern edge of the Plateau of Ubachsberg above the Eyserbeek valley in the south. Between 1 and 2 million years ago it was part of the island of Ubachsberg in the Meuse river. Wandeling met gids Jos Littmann, Vrouwengilde Landgraaf, 10 May 2014 With a height of 215 meters above NAP the Huls hill is one of the highest point in the European part of the Netherlands. It was long believed that the plateau of Ubachsberg was in fact the highest point in the Netherlands, because from the top at Vrouwenheide you can see over the top of the Vaalserberg, to see the even higher hills from the German Eifel. Nederland Bergenland, ANWB  Culture  In the centre of the village lies the Joseph the Worker Church, which was built in 1955 on the top of the hill, and is surrounded by an open area. This was originally the location of a small chapel. The non-oriented aisleless church served as an assisting church for the Saint Remigius parish in Simpelveld. In 2012 the church was taken out of service due to a gradual general decline of church attendance in the diocese. North of Huls lies the Keverberg manor. First mentioned in 1380 the manor burned down in the late 19th century and was rebuilt in neogothic style in 1890. The manor retains its original arcaded basements. On the front of the manor is a tower with battlements and a balcony with corbels. Before the municipal reorganisation of 1981 the castle was part of Voerendaal. Keverberg, hoeve (Simpelveld), Rijckheyt archives for the municipalities Brunssum, Gulpen-Wittem, Heerlen, Nuth, Simpelveld and Voerendaal, viewed on 20 August 2016 The Huls is part of the Mergellandroute, a tourist route for cars and bikes through South Limburg, Netherlands, mapped out by the ANWB. Due to the hills, the Huls and surrounding areas are part of the Amstel Gold Race, a road bicycle race.

He took office as a Member of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature in February 2019. He previously held the position from 2014 to 2016. Msimanga was the Executive Mayor of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality from 2016 to 2019 and the DA Provincial Chairperson from 2014 to 2017. He was the Democratic Alliance's Gauteng Premier candidate for the 2019 elections. Early life, education and family Solly Tshepiso Msimanga was born in Atteridgeville, a township west of Pretoria. He attended Isaac Mor√© Primary School, Patogeng Higher Primary and Saulridge High School. He obtained a national diploma in marketing management and a BCompt from the University of Pretoria. Career Msimanga worked with Project Literacy and was enlisted at the Liberian embassy at one stage. Later on, he was employed by the United States embassy. He had been a national director for Legal Education And Development. He also held multiple senior management positions in the private sector. =Entry into politics= Msimanga delivers a speech, while Mmusi Maimane watches in the background Msimanga first joined the DA in 2006. After having attended a DA event, he wrote to the party criticising its campaign approach and was soon offered a staff position by the party's CEO Ryan Coetzee. He eventually began rising through the ranks of the party. In May 2011, he was elected to the Tshwane City Council, and in the same year, he became the leader of the DA's Gauteng North region. In May 2014, Msimanga was elected as a Member of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. He was appointed the party's provincial spokesperson for sports and served on the Education and Economic Development Portfolio Committees in the legislature. =DA leadership elections= In November 2014, he succeeded Michael Moriarty as DA Provincial Chairperson, after Moriarty had stood down. In November 2017, Moriarty succeeded Msimanga as DA Provincial Chairperson at the party's Provincial Congress, after Msimanga took the decision to not run for re-election. In March 2018, Msimanga declared himself a candidate for the position of Federal Chairperson of the Democratic Alliance ahead of the party's Federal Congress. On 8 April 2018, he lost to incumbent Athol Trollip. =Mayoral career= Msimanga met with former U.S. Mayor Anthony A. Williams on 13 February 2019. Msimanga handed Williams a gift to celebrate their meeting which focused on urban renewal In September 2015, Msimanga was announced as the DA's mayoral candidate for the City of Tshwane in the 2016 municipal elections. He defeated Brandon Topham and Bronwyn Engelbrecht for the nomination. The DA emerged as the largest party after the election, but without a majority. By forming a coalition with several smaller parties, and with the support of the Economic Freedom Fighters, Msimanga was elected unopposed as the Executive Mayor of Tshwane. He was the first DA member to hold the post. When he was elected Mayor, he stated his intention to outlaw blue-lights brigades in the City ‚Äî for everyone except the President. ‚ÄúThe only VIPs in the City will be the residents of the City,‚Äù he said. In May 2018, it was revealed that Msimanga's chief of staff Marietha Aucamp had been dishonest about her qualifications. She was placed on special leave on 16 May 2018. She subsequently resigned on 17 May 2018. In June 2018, an inquiry found that she had misrepresented her qualifications. It also found that her appointment was unlawful. In August 2018, both the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and African National Congress (ANC) had tabled motions of no confidence to remove Msimanga as Mayor. The ANC Tshwane Regional Chairperson Kgosi Maepa had said in an interview that his party's caucus would support the EFF's motion, if needed. He also said that the party had lobbied other political parties to support their motion. On 30 August 2018, Tshwane Council Speaker Katlego Mathebe declined to proceed with the EFF's motion of no confidence because it did not comply with the council's rules. The EFF subsequently staged a walkout out of the council chamber. The party's caucus leader said that it would not support the ANC's motion and that it would challenge the Speaker's decision in court. Due to the lack of support, the ANC withdrew its motion. On 27 September 2018, he survived another motion of no confidence tabled by the ANC. The EFF abstained from voting. Ninety-five councillors voted against the motion, while seventy-seven voted for it. Twenty-one councillors abstained. Msimanga's last months as Mayor were overshadowed by the irregular awarding of a multi-billion-rand tender contract to GladAfrica by embattled City Manager Moeketsi Mosola. Msimanga tried to suspend Mosola, and the DA caucus of the Tshwane City Council attempted multiple times to remove Mosola from the position. Mosola announced in July 2019 that he would step down as the City Manager of Tshwane. On 18 January 2019, Msimanga announced that he was stepping down as Mayor of Tshwane to focus on his Gauteng premiership campaign. He also said that his resignation would be finalised in the first two weeks of February. He later announced on 31 January 2019 that he would effectively resign on 11 February 2019. He was succeeded by Stevens Mokgalapa. Msimanga was subsequently sworn in as a Member of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. =Gauteng premiership campaign= On 19 August 2018, Msimanga was announced as the party's Gauteng Premier candidate for the 2019 general elections. He defeated many prominent candidates for the nomination, such as Member of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature Makashule Gana, Member of Parliament Ghaleb Cachalia, and Party Spokesperson Refiloe Nt‚Äôsheke. On 8 May 2019, the African National Congress narrowly retained their majority in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature with a total of 50.19% of the vote. The Democratic Alliance remained the official opposition, but lost three seats, giving them a total of twenty seats in the provincial legislature. Msimanga was elected DA caucus leader on 17 May 2019 and officially assumed the post of Leader of the Opposition on 22 May 2019. =Provincial leadership= Msimanga was selected as the party's acting provincial leader on 2 September 2020, after incumbent John Moodey had resigned from the party. He is currently running for a full term at the party's virtual conference. He faces MP James Lorimer. Personal life He married Monde Msimanga in 2006. They have two children named Amogelong and Aobokwe. Solly and his wife work together on the charity organisation named ‚ÄúMake Somebody‚Äôs Christmas a Merry One‚Äù. The project donates groceries to disadvantaged families. =Sexual harassment allegation= In September 2020, DA MPL Nkele Molapo filed a sexual harassment case against Msimanga. Msimanga denies the allegation and says that he is willing to take a lie detector test to prove his innocence. He has also responded by opening a crimen injuria case against Molapo.

It has its roots in glossolalia ('speaking in tongues'). Speakers consider Medefaidrin to be a 'spirit language'. It was created by two leaders of the church, Michael Ukpong and Akpan Akpan Udofia. They state that the Holy Spirit revealed the words of the language to Ukpong, while Udofia wrote them down. At the time Ibibio was not a written language, and Udofia created a script to write Medefaidrin. After finalizing the language in 1936, members of the church started a school in which children were instructed in Medefaidrin. This was not tolerated by the British colonial government, who closed the school that same year. Nonetheless, the language continued to be used for church activities, including liturgy and hymns, and for letters and written contracts between members. The language faded from use, but in 1986 Udofia began teaching it again in the church's Sunday school in Ididep. Old manuscripts in the script are in poor condition, and in the 21st century there has been some effort to preserve them. In structure, the language is largely a relexification of English, though the semantics are closer to the native language of its users, Ibibio. Medefaidrin is a stress-accented rather than tonal language, though this may be changing under Ibibio influence. There are several consonant clusters that do not exist in English. (Ibibio has no consonant clusters.) The definite article is dei, and several prepositions alliterate or rhyme with their English equivalents: ' \\"to\\", ' \\"from\\", ' \\"by\\", ' \\"in\\". Most words, however, resemble nothing in English or Ibibio, but appear to have been created without a specific underlying system. The morphology is not highly developed, but a few elements have been taken from English, such as the plural in -s (z?). The vigesimal numbering system, however, and the calendar, reflect Ibibio norms. The calendar year contains sixteen four-week months.The week is reported to consist of eight days, but it is not clear if it is 8 by Ibibio or English counting. What is 2 days from now in English is 3 days from now in Ibibio (with today counted as the first day), so starting a new week every 8 days when thinking in Ibibio means every 7 days when thinking in English. The script has upper- and lower-case letters like the English alphabet, but the letters were invented and there is no systematic relationship between glyph and sound. There are a number of arbitrary digraphs, whose pronunciation cannot be determined from their component letters, again as in English. Unicode Medefaidrin script was added to the Unicode Standard in June, 2018 with the release of version 11.0. The Unicode block for Medefaidrin is U+16E40‚ÄìU+16E9F and contains 91 characters: See also *the 20th-century Eskayan language and script of the Philippines *the embryonic 12th-century Lingua Ignota and script of Germany  Bibliography  * Monday B.

He worked in a tree nursery, which was run by his family. Since 1973 he has been swimming and diving in the sea surrounding the Isle of Arran. He has an extensive knowledge on marine environment. While exploring the marine environment close to Isle of Arran, he has taken several photos and created video archives.  Contribution to environment  Firth of Clyde When Howard Wood was diving in Firth of Clyde he realized changes to marine environment, which he associated with recent growth of fishing industry in this region. In 1989 he met his close friend, Don MacNeish, who had just come back from New Zealand. They both were inspired by the means of protecting the marine life that exist in New Zealand. They decided to create a similar protection area in Scotland. Using their personal savings, in 1995, they co- funded Community of Arran Seabed Trust (COAST) consisting a group of local volunteers. Howard Wood initiated grassroots campaign in order to establish Scotland‚Äôs first No Take Zone (NTZ) in Lamlash Bay. Finally, in 2008 an NTZ in Lamlash Bay was created, after 12 month of meeting and consulting on the matter with public officials, local fishermen and scientists, community rallies, and sending petitions to the Scottish parliament. Howard Wood encouraged local divers to introduce the new rules and caring for them to be respected by others. These activities were supposed to fasten the marine environment recovery, mostly seaweed beds, corals and juvenile scallops. In 2012 together with COAST he suggested to designate the South Arran Sea as a Marine Protected Area (MPA).The idea was consulted with local divers and marine experts. Wood's aim was to keep the issue popular among the politicians. Eventually, in July 2014, Scottish Government announced creation of 30 new Marine Protected Areas in Scotland including the South Arran MPA, the first and only community-developed MPA in the country. Howard Wood together with COAST work now on creating similar protected areas in other Scottish areas presenting unique marine environment. They promote sustainable marine management policies and try to preserve fishing communities and their cultures.

Biography  A pupil at the , Pierre-Antoine de La Place was compelled, after college, to get back to the study of French, which he had partly forgotten. His first literary attempts having been barely noticed, he imagined to send the news of his death in Paris where it was inserted in the Feuilles of abbot Desfontaines. If the scheme, once discovered, triggered laugh at the author's expense, the succ√®s de scandale also drew him out of his darkness. The English literature being then fashionable, La Place was quick to exploit the genre from which he drew most of his income. In 1750, he became the first translator of Tom Jones, Henry Fielding's masterpiece, and the works of his sister, Sarah Fielding. Having had the opportunity to do a favor to Madame de Pompadour, he obtained through her, the title of Secretary of the Academy of Arras and the privilege of the Mercure de France in 1760 but subscriptions under his leadership, diminished to the point that he had to withdraw about 1767, maintaining, in consolation, a 5,000-pound pension. But what made him famous was his book, le Th√©√¢tre anglois, of which the first volume was published in Paris in 1745. In the first four volumes of his work, The Place wrote a speech on the English stage (preface), an introduction to the life of Shakespeare, the translation of ten Shakespeare plays (Othello, Hamlet, Macbeth, Cymbeline, Julius Caesar, The Merry Wives of Windsor, Timon of Athens, Antony and Cleopatra, Henry VI, and Richard III), as well as summaries of twenty-six Shakespeare plays. In the following four volumes, The Place translated plays by Ben Jonson, Thomas Otway, Edward Young, John Dryden, William Congreve, Nicholas Rowe, Thomas Southerne, Joseph Addison, Richard Steele and John Hughes. If his translation work was widely appreciated (he also proposed a paraphrase of the first gothic novel by Clara Reeve, (The Champion of virtue), it also attracted him some enmity, especially that of Voltaire, who neither appreciated Shakespeare (as evidenced by his Lettres philosophiques (1734), nor the fact of losing his unique position of Shakespearean expert in France. La Place also translated Oroonoko into French in 1745, but it was more an adaptation than a translation. According to La Harpe, who wrote his biography, he was \\"a great braggart, but compelling, flexible, active, and over all a man of fun and good food.\\" Pierre-Antoine de La Place himself wrote some pieces which, however, had little success. It took nothing less than the formal order of the Duke of Richelieu to force the actors to represent Ad√®le de Ponthieu. He wrote under several pen-names, including \\"Skunk\\" and \\"Skupk\\". He was the great-great-grand-son of Pierre de la Place, philosopher and first president of the Court of Aids of Paris, murdered during the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre.

She was born to nobles and married in 1475 to the nobleman Lodovico Antonio Costa - and had one child - who soon acquired a mistress and chastised her for her generous nature towards the poor and ill. Her husband later repented and died leaving her widowed and she died not long after this. Gambara desired to become a nun but complied with the desire of her parents to embrace marriage and so dedicated herself to serving her husband while at the same time learning to detest his excessive lavishness and the pomp of his noble court. Her friend and confessor was Angelo Carletti whom she and her husband later attributed the latter's cure to. Her beatification received formal confirmation from Pope Gregory XVI on 14 August 1845 after the latter ratified that there existed a spontaneous and enduring local 'cultus' - or longstanding and popular veneration. Life Paola Gambara Costa was born on 3 March 1463 in Brescia as the first of seven children to the nobles Giampaolo Gambara and Taddea Caterina Martinengo. Her following siblings included: * Marietta - later a nun * Ippolita - a mother of fourteen children * Laura - a widow who dedicated herself to the care of the ill * Federico * Lodovico * Maddalena In her childhood she delighted in spiritual reading and reflection on the Gospel and harbored an ardent desire to become a nun later in life. But this dream was cut short when her parents decided to arrange her marriage to Count Lodovico Antonio Costa - the Lord of Benasco - and she saw this as the will of God manifesting itself and so complied with the wishes of her parents. Her confessor prior to her marriage was Father Andrea da Quinzano of the Sant'Apollonio convent in Brescia. The marriage came about after Count Bongiovanni Costa visited her parents and was struck with her virtue and so wanted her as his nephew Lodovico Antonio's wife. Her decision to be a nun concerned the count who sent her to Angelo Carletti - a Franciscan priest - who persuaded her that marriage was a call from God to embrace a different kind of life still in accordance with Christian values. The pair married in autumn 1485 and the pair travelled to the small Benasco province for the ensuring celebrations. She endured her new husband's expensive tastes seeing it as her role to be faithful to him even if she did not live the excessive luxuries. In spring 1486 the couple visited Milan and Alessandria before setting off for Asti. The two also visited Turin where the duke received them. Her confessor around this time was Father Crescenzio Morra from Bene though she later reconnected with Carletti who became her friend and spiritual advisor as well as a confessor. Carletti kept her on the path of virtue and advised her to enroll in the Third Order of Saint Francis while learning to appreciate the poor and to detest the lavishness of the secular world. She joined in 1491 with the permission of her husband. Gambara often deprived herself of food in order to bring it to the sick and on one occasion took off her shoes and gave it to an old woman who walked barefoot over ice and snow on one occasion during winter. Gambara also became the godmother of Yolande in 1487 who was the daughter of Duke Charles I and Bianca di Monferrato. In 1488 she gave birth to her sole child Giovanni Francesco and named him in honor of Francis of Assisi. To mark this occasion she managed to persuade her husband to distribute large amounts of food to the poor of their area. Her actions soon vexed her husband who reproached her for her conduct and ridiculed her in front of their servants and the servants followed their master's example and joined in ridiculing their mistress. Costa soon acquired a mistress - the daughter of the Podest√† of Carr√π - and he allowed her to live in the castle in 1494 even though Gambara resided there. In 1495 her son left for Chieri for his education and Father Carletti died on 11 April 1495. She attended his funeral in Cuneo - he died at the convent of Sant'Antonio - but fell ill there. Following this she suffered strong migraines. In 1500 she reunited with her parents and siblings when she returned to her hometown on a brief visit. In 1504 the mistress fell ill with abdominal pains and it was Gambara who comforted her and forgave her as she died. Also in 1504 her son - now a page - returned to his home and a grand banquet was celebrated for him. Her husband later repented and approved her good works and also consented to her wearing the habit of her order in public. Costa became ill in 1504 and she began to tend to him. The two travelled to Cuneo to ask for the intercession of her former confessor Carletti and when her husband was healed attributed the healing to him - Costa celebrated a banquet in commemoration of this and undertook a pilgrimage to the priest's grave in thanksgiving with his wife at his side. This was short-lived for her husband died not long after in 1504. On 14 January 1515 she was struck with an extreme fever that caused her great pain and she died on 24 January 1515 in the town of Binasco in Milan after having confessed and received the Eucharist for the final time. Beatification Her beatification received formal ratification on 14 August 1845 once Pope Gregory XVI issued a decree that recognized that there existed an enduring and longstanding local 'cultus' - otherwise known as popular veneration and devotion - that endured through the centuries after her death and was a spontaneous devotion rather than something that evolved over time.

The corps attacked with its 93 outdated light tanks (80 T-26 tanks and 13 BT tanks) and the 4th Airborne Corps advanced on foot instead of conducting an air assault due to a lack of transport aircraft. Both units were unable to stop the German advance. On 30 June the Svisloch Railroad Bridge, defended by the 4th Airborne Corps, was captured by the 4th Panzer Division, cutting off most of the 20th Mechanized Corps and a 4th Airborne Corps brigade.

By 25 July, the Soviet troops in Mogilev were running out of ammunition, food and fuel. 61st Rifle Corps commander Fyodor Bakunin made the decision to withdraw against orders and called a meeting with Vedeneyev and three of the division commanders on the breakout plan. The 20th Mechanized Corps would lead the breakout towards the general direction of Roslavl. That night, the corps began the breakout. In the morning, the corps ran into the German 78th Infantry Division at the village of Samulki. Supported by vehicles from an attached reconnaissance battalion, the corps fought on foot and attacked the German positions. The attack was stopped by heavy German machine gun fire.

The film was produced by Gokulam Gopalan and stars Dileep, Siddharth, Murali Gopy, Bobby Simha, and Namitha Pramod. The film marks the Malayalam film debut of Siddharth. Principal photography began on 18 August 2016 in Kochi. The film was released in India on 14 April 2018. The film won the National Film Award for Best Production Design. Plot A group of liquor barons, who are members of the Indian Liberation Party (ILP), want the declining party to win the upcoming Kerala state election to benefit their business interests. To raise the ILP's image, they decide to make a biopic about Kammaran Nambiar, the party patriarch and the last veteran of the Indian independence movement. They ask director Pulikeshi to make a film based on a chapter in the book Unsung Heroes of India by Robert S. Coogan, in which Kammaran is depicted as a forgotten freedom fighter. Pulikeshi meets Kammaran, now an ailing old man living in an old house with his son Bose. Kammaran tells the young man a story: During World War II, Kammaran was a cunning medical practitioner who would do anything for personal gain. To destroy his love rival, Othenan, Kammaran incites violence between the villagers, Othenan, Othenan's cruel landlord father Kelu, and British officers. During the violence, Kammaran kills Kelu and Othenan is arrested. Later, Othenan visits Kammaran in the night, but as Kammaran tells the story he begins coughing and is unable to continue. Pulikeshi makes the film as the ILP instructed, and when Kammaran watches it he realizes the roles have been reversed. In the film, Othenan and his friend Singh are working for the British; they are captured as traitors by Netaji (Subhas Chandra Bose) but they escape and Othenan kills the man who reported their treason. The landlord's wife Maheshwari is then shown inflicting cruelty when Kammaran arrives as the leader of the ILP, preventing the harassment of poor tenants and gaining such mass support that Maheshwari is forced to flee. Kammaran is shown doing many things for the benefit of the villages, such as looting money from the British to distribute amongst the villagers. Kammaran marries Bhanumathi when Othenan returns and plots with Maheshwari and the British against Kammaran. The plot involves using Netaji's death to gain Kammaran's trust, so that they can then blame Kammaran for the planned assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. Kammaran then tells the story of how he met Netaji. During the Battle of Imphal in 1944, Kammaran saved Netaji who was injured from a grenade; Netaji found such confidence in Kammaran that he asked him to form a party for the people. As a strong symbol, Kammaran took the axe, the weapon Maheshwari's men used to murder his father, on which he swore revenge against India's landlord system. Kammaran returns to AmruthaSamudram and forms the ILP. To foil the assassination plot, Kammaran posts his men in three places along Gandhi's procession route to a temple, while he rides on a train with Gandhi. Othenan secretly boards the train and moves against Gandhi, but an informer has warned Kammaran who stops and chases him, fighting, and Othenan is killed after a brutal struggle on top of the train. Kammaran stands to be hanged for killing a British officer. The only person who believes his story is Robert S. Coogan, who convinces Jawaharlal Nehru to free him. The film ends with Kammaran refusing his followers' request to participate in elections, but promising to be back when he is needed. The film becomes a success, and helps the ILP return to power. Elderly Kammaran is made the Chief Minister of Kerala. Pulikesi arrives and asks him what really happened to Othenan. It is then shown that years later Othenan came for Bhanumathi who was then Kammaran's wife, and Kammaran killed him brutally but doesn't reveal this to Pulikeshi. Kammaran tells Pulikeshi that the movie is now the history in everybody's mind, and that the actual events no longer matter.

Career  He was involved in supporting strike by railway workers in Bombay in 1899, and subsequently became involved in the Swadeshi movement in Bengal, in opposition to the 1905 partition of Bengal. Surendranath is also believed to have been involved in the early phase of revolutionary movement for Indian independence, when he served as the treasurer of the Anushilan Samiti established under Pramatha Mitra. Surendranath is credited with establishing a number of Indian-owned banks and insurance companies through which he sought to encourage indigenous industries. Surendranath's work in the initial stages of establishment of Vishwabharati university is considered crucial, and he sat in the university's publishing board. He also served as the editor of The Visva-Bharati Quarterly from the July 1923 up to April 1929. Surendranath was influenced by his uncle Rabindranath from an early age which saw him develop an interest in literature. Surendranath's work include both his own creative work, as well as translations of Rabindranath's work from Bengali to English. Surendranath's own noted literary works included essays on various aspects of Science which were published in the magazines Sadhana and Bharati. He also contributed to Modern review, and Prabasi. Among the noted works in translations is his translations of Rabindranath's works The Home and the World (Ghare baire) in 1919, Glimpses of Bengal Selected from letters (Chinnapatra) in 1921, and Four chapters (Char adhyaye) in 1950 (published after his death). Surendranath Tagore died in 1940.

In ancient times, nearly all Chinese Buddhist temples had a Shanmen, as an important gate of the temple. After successive wars and cultural discontinuity, with only one gate, most of the existing ancient Buddhist temples usually follow the hall style or change the middle gate of the three main gates into a hall called \\"Hall of Shanmen\\". Architectural Style General Heng (ÂìºÂ∞áËªç) inside in the Shanmen Hall of Hongfa Temple, in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. General Heng (ÂìàÂ∞áËªç) inside in the Shanmen Hall of Hongfa Temple, in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. Each niche on both sides of Shanmen Hall enshrines a statue of a heavenly deity with a Vajra in his hand, namely Nio, Buddha's warrior attendant, also known as \\"Yakasha Deity\\" () or \\"Zhijingang\\" (). Vajra originally refers to the short metal weapon of king of all heavenly deities Indra in Indian mythology and symbolizes solidness and sharpness in Buddhism. Nio is a Dharmapala who protects Buddhism with his Vajra in his hand. Originally, there is only one Nio. However, in order to meet Chinese custom of being in pairs, Chinese people cast two Nio to safeguard the mount gate after the introduction of Buddhism from India to China in the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220). The Nio are wearing crowns, ethereal clothes with their upper bodies exposed, with well-developed muscles and short skirts. The Nio have widely open eyes and protruding noses, holding weapons in their hands, and glaring the ground awesomely and angrily. The Nio, the right one, has its mouth open to pronounce the sound \\"a\\", while the other has it closed to utter the sound \\"hong\\". The symbolism is the same already seen. The generic name for statues with an open mouth is General Ha (; Japanese: ), that for those with a closed mouth General Heng (; Japanese: ). \\"A\\" and \\"Hong\\", are the start and end sounds in Sanskrit, symbolizing the basis of sounds and bearing the profound theory of Dharma.

The episode was written by Dan E. Fesman, and was directed by Tawnia McKiernan. The episode aired alongside the previous episode, Cold Blooded. Plot Opening quote: \\"O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree, How steadfast are your branches!\\" During Christmas time, two teenagers named Derrick Bryce (Shane Coffey) and Quinn Baxter (Alex Mentzel) steal presents from a car. Suddenly, a person dressed as Santa calls them \\"naughty\\", revealing itself to be a horned creature and attacks Derrick while taking Quinn. In Austria, Tavitian (Bernhard Forcher) kills Verrat members that seem to follow him. He arrives at a Resistance to meet with Renard (Sasha Roiz), Meisner (Damien Puckler), and Sebastien (Christian Lagadec). However, the members of the Resistance have doubts about Renard for his blood although he manages to convince them by telling them he has a Grimm. Nick (David Giuntoli), Hank (Russell Hornsby) and Wu (Reggie Lee) inspect the body of Derrick but Wu freaks when he finds that he is not dead and the attacker left a piece of coal. Meanwhile, Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) calls Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) to help in redecorating the house, as a surprise for Rosalee (Bree Turner), as they are having their first Christmas together. During a visit to Derrick in the hospital, he gets freaked after he sees a Santa in the hallway. Another teen steals a woman's presents and while checking on them, is attacked and subdued by the same horned Santa. A man watches the event but the creature does not attack him and again leaves a piece of coal. In Vienna, Renard and Meisner sneak in Adalind's hotel room and find her substance in the jar and leave a rose and a note for her, warning her to meet with him in a cafe and to watch out from the cameras. Monroe shows Rosalee the decorations in their house but Rosalee reveals that she does not like Christmas very much after her uncle and aunt died on a car accident on Christmas's Eve, hurting Monroe. The next morning, she wakes up to find that Monroe took away all the decorations. While looking for the Santa responsible, Nick and Hank interrogate a Santa in the mall who turns out to be a Schakal. He panics when he finds that Nick is a Grimm and runs. Nick goes after him and tackles him while people film the event, reaching news reports. Nick and Hank asks Monroe about it and Monroe quickly deduces that the creature is Krampus. Krampus is a creature that takes the \\"naughty\\" people and subdues them to take them to a forest and then hangs them from the tallest tree as punishment for their actions. He also adds that when the Winter Solstice arrives, he will devour those children. To make matters worse, they're exactly on the Winter Solstice. While discussing where is the tree, Bud (Danny Bruno), while denying Krampus' existence, deduces that the tree may be in Council Crest Park. They go to the forest and find the people in the tree but Krampus (Derek Mears) arrives and attacks Nick. Although he is stronger than Nick, Nick manages to knock him out. They debate what to do with him as the police won't have evidence linking him to the kidnappings and he could disappear for another year. To their surprise, they find that Krampus woges into a human form (Darius Pierce). In the precinct, the human Krampus explains that he has his memory erased every Christmas and the day after the Winter Solstice, he wakes up with a Santa suit. To Nick's surprise, the human Krampus does not have knowledge of the Wesen world. Finding no other choice, Nick decides to inform the Wesen Council to handle the situation. Monroe returns to his house to find Rosalee asleep in the couch and finding beer and cigars instead of cookies and milk (this was the tradition her aunt made every Christmas), causing him to smile as he finds that she has finally celebrated Christmas.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade and wrote, \\"The good things to come out of this rather asinine conflict are the scenes between the men and the women. While they certainly don't pass the Bechdel Test, it puts Juliette in the position of helping Rosalee work through her emotions, and gives Monroe a chance to use Nick and Hank as a sounding board. I'm really surprised that Juliette, in the span of only eight episodes, has been largely rehabilitated from the anchor dragging the show down to only the weakest link in an improving cast.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.1 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Thank you, Grimm Season 3 Episode 8, for ruining Christmas for all of us. On the bright side, the legend of Krampus is awesome if you want your kids to behave (no wonder it's real), there are always alligators living in the sewers ready and willing to tear their limbs off to make sure they are fully traumatized.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman from TV.com, wrote, \\"'Twelve Days of Krampus' gave us the sort of excitement and teasing we expect from a long (or in Grimms case, not really all that long) break. it also featured just a pinch of emotional compromise, which seems to be Grimms thing this season.

Ndodomzi Jonathan Ntutu is currently South Africa's fastest ever para-athlete. His 10.80 was posted on April 12th 2018 during the heats of the Commonwealth Games. Competing in the T12 classification, Ntutu has competed at three Summer Paralympic Games, winning bronze in the 2012 Games in London. He is also a multiple World Championships winner, taking five medals over four tournaments. Personal history Ntutu was born in the township of Gugulethu in Cape Town, South Africa in 1986 to Alexander Ntutu and his wife Sylvia. He was born with a congenital complication that left him visually impaired; though he is not blind. He was unable to cope in mainstream education and his parents, who struggled financially, ensured that his needs were catered for by enrolling him in the Athlone School for the Blind. His father died in 1996, when Ntutu was entering his early teen years. He now lives in Bellville, Western Cape. Athletics career Ntutu first showed promise as an athlete whilst at the Athlone school, showing at aptitude for sprinting. He was inspired to compete at the Paralympic Games after a pupil at his school qualified for the South Africa team at the 2000 Games in Sydney. He took onboard a local trainer, David Williams, and began training at the Vygieskraal Stadium in Athlone. His efforts were rewarded, when in 2004, he was selected for the South African team at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens. Initially classified as a T13 category athlete, for competitors with limited vision, he entered two events in Athens; the 100 metres sprint (T13) and the long jump (F13). He finished sixth overall in the long jump and his time of 11.34 in the heats of the 100m saw him finish two hundredths of a second outside the qualification time for the finals. Two years later he won his first major international medal, taking bronze in 100 metre sprint at the 2006 IPC Athletics World Championships in Assen. In 2008 Ntutu competed at his second Paralympics, travelling to China to compete in the Beijing Games. He no longer competed in the long jump, but still entered two events, the 100 metre and 200 metre sprints. In the 100 metres he surpassed his achievement at the 2004 Games by qualifying through to the finals, where he finished fifth with a time of 11.06 seconds. Although finishing in the top three qualifiers in the heats of the 200 metres, he finished a distant eighth in the finals. In the buildup to the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, Ntutu entered his second World Championships, this time held in Christchurch, New Zealand. He entered all three sprint events, winning silver behind Russia's Alexey Labzin in the 100 metres and narrowly missing the podium with fourth place in the 400 metres. His biggest breakthrough of his career came at the London 2012 Paralympics, where he qualified for both the 100 metre and 200 metre sprints, making the finals of both. He finished sixth in the 200 metre race, but in the 100 metres he took the bronze medal, beating Labzin in a photo finish for the third spot. At the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon, Ntutu came away a double medalist, winning a silver in the 100 metres (behind Ireland's Jason Smyth) and a first major medal in the 200 metres, a third placed bronze. Two years later Ntutu sight was deemed to have deteriorated and he was reclassified as a T12 classification athlete. This allowed him to enter his first African Games, as traditionally the T13 sprint was not contested. Held in Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo, Ntutu entered the 2015 African Games competing in the T12 200 metre sprint. He took gold, finishing ahead of countryman and fellow ex-Athlone School pupil Hilton Langenhoven. At the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha Ntutu took silver in the 200 metres but he was disqualified from the 100 metre sprint. The next year he added a second Paralympic medal when he took a silver in the 100 metres at the 2016 Games in Rio. He also competed in the 200 metre race but failed to qualify for the finals.

He became the commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen after the death of Burhan Muzaffar Wani; discontent over Wani's death led to the 2016 Kashmir Unrest. In August 2016, Musa issued his first video in Kashmir. He has been described as \\"part of a new generation of tech-savvy, well-educated militants\\" who became involved in the conflict after the 2010 Kashmir unrest. In 2017, Musa threatened to behead the Hurriyat leaders for calling the Kashmir conflict a political, rather than a religious, objective to establish Islamic rule; he warned them not to become a \\"thorn\\" in the imposition of Shariah in Kashmir. Hizbul Mujahideen immediately disassociated itself from Musa's statement, and Musa, in response, quit the organization. In 2017, he left the group after it refused to back his public statements supporting his argument that the struggle in Kashmir was for Islam, and not for political purposes. Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind In July 2017, the Global Islamic Media Front claimed that Zakir Musa had been named the head of Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, a newly created cell of Al-Qaeda. After the killing of militant commander Abu Dujana and Arif Lelhari, a statement purported to be from Musa was released. The statement claimed that Dujana and Lelhari had joined Al-Qaeda and helped establish it. Officials stated that the voice of the message matched those of the earlier audio clips by Musa, though the state's DGP S.P. Vaid stated there was no way of authenticating the clips even though there were reports that Dujana and Musa were close at the time. Meanwhile, an audio-clip circulated on media that claimed to be the last message from Dujana and Arif during their encounter. Two voices claim allegiance to Al-Qaeda; however, no gunfire is heard and the authenticity of the clip was not proven. It was reported on 12 August 2017 that Musa and his aide evaded an Indian Army and JK Police operation with locals, pelting security forces with stones in Noorpora Village in Tral. In an audio message released on 31 August 2017, Musa attacked Pakistan for \\"betraying Kashmir jihad.\\" He also stated that the objective of Al-Qaeda's Kashmir cell was to clear it from the Pakistan government, army and their sponsored agents. He also threatened to \\"liberate India\\" from the Hindus.

These are mostly procumbent herbs occurring in the Western Mediterranean region and Macaronesia, with some isolated occurrences in North Africa and at the Horn of Africa. They are interesting as crop wild relatives of sugar beet.  Description  Inflorescence of Patellifolia procumbens Fruit of Patellifolia patellaris Patellifolia are annual or perennial herbs, growing erect or often procumbent. The alternate leaves have a petiole, their leaf blade is heart-shaped or hastate. The spike-like inflorescences consist of glomerules of one to three flowers sitting in the axils of leaf-like bracts. The free flowers are hermaphrodite. The perianth consists of five herbaceous, slightly keeled tepal lobes which are connate at base. There are five stamens opposite to the tepals, their filaments are fused at base forming a disc. The ovary is semi-inferior with 2 stigmas. In fruit, the ovary is partly immersed in the enlarged base of the perianth. The tepal lobes are not modified and appressed to the fruit. The solitary fruits are nearly globular capsules, they fall down when ripe and open with a circumscissile lid. The vertical seed contains an annular embryo and copious perisperm (feeding tissue).  Distribution and habitat  Patellifolia is mainly distributed in the Western Mediterranean region (Spain, Morocco), Macaronesia and Cape Verde Islands. There are also some isolated occurrences in North Africa (Hoggar Mountains and Tassili n'Ajjer, Libya), and in the Horn of Africa region (Socotra, Somalia). The plants grow in more or less coastal habitats from sea level up to 200 m, in Macaronesia and the Western Mediterranean region, and also in Socotra. But in the North African mountains they were found at higher altitudes up to 2000 m, and also in Somalia at 1150 m.  Systematics  Patellifolia patellaris Patellifolia procumbens Patellifolia webbiana The genus Patellifolia was published in 1977 by A J Scott, Brian V. Ford-Lloyd and J. Trevor Williams, with the type species Patellifolia webbiana. The same authors had described this taxon already in 1976 as Patellaria J.T. Williams, A.J.Scott & Ford-Lloyd, but that was an illegitimate name, (because the lichen genus Patellaria Hoffmann was published earlier in 1789). These plants were first grouped together in 1927 by Vladimir Andreevich Tranzschel as an informal unranked taxon Patellares in the genus Beta. In 1934, Oskar Eberhard Ulbrich placed them in a new section Beta sect. Procumbentes. Until 2006, Patellifolia was often not accepted as a separate genus. But recent molecular genetic studies by Kadereit et al. (2006) and Romeiras et al. (2016) revealed a deep genetic differentiation between Beta and Patellifolia and confirmed the status as own genus. Patellifolia comprises one to three species: * Patellifolia patellaris (Moq.) A.J. Scott & al. (Syn. Beta patellaris Moq.), in dry coastal sites or on rocks, widely distributed in Macaronesia (Canary Islands, Madeira, Cape Verde) and in the western Mediterranean (Spain, Balearic islands, Sicily, Morocco), North Africa, to the Horn of Africa. * Patellifolia procumbens (Chr. Sm.) A.J. Scott & al. (Syn. Beta procumbens Chr. Sm.), in dry coastal sites in Macaronesia (Canary Islands, Madeira, Cape Verde). * Patellifolia webbiana (Moq.) A.J. Scott & al. (Syn. Beta webbiana Moq.), endemic on Gran Canaria, in ruderal nitrophilous sites, Critically Endangered. It was suggested that Patellifolia procumbens and Patellifolia webbiana might not be different species. The identification of the three species is difficult, and some distinguishing characters were found to be unreliable. Therefore, Thulin et al. (2010) proposed to treat all members of Patellifolia as a single variable species, Patellifoia procumbens. This proposal was followed in the Euro+Med Plant Base. But Patellifolia patellaris could not be hybridised with the other two species, supporting the rank of an own species. The island species evolved recently, and because of their isolation they developed only small genetic differentiation. As a result, they show only weak genetic barriers to hybridization.  Evolution  Patellifolia is a rather old genus; the divergence from its sister genus Beta probably occurred early in the Late Oligocene. Its subtaxa are relatively young, diversifying in the late Pliocene or early Quaternary. The present distribution area suggests that it was previously a widespread taxon, but later the area fragmented and extensive extinctions occurred.  Crop wild relatives  Patellifolia is related to the economically important cultivated beets (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris, with sugar beet, beetroot, chard and fodder beet). Therefore, Patellifolia is of great interest as Crop wild relative and potential gene donor. They seem to be resistant to some of the most serious diseases of sugar beets, to leaf spot disease caused by Cercospora beticola, curly top virus, rhizomania, and powdery mildew (Erysiphe polygoni). All three species proved to be highly resistant to the Beet cyst eelworm (Heterodera schachtii). The three species differ in their resistance level, whereas Patellifolia patellaris is not completely immune, but eelworms never develop to maturity in the other two species.

Science in Motion Mahanoy Area High School did not take advantage of a state program called Science in Motion which brought college professors and sophisticated science equipment to the school to raise science awareness and to provide inquiry-based experiences for the students. The Science in Motion program was funded by a state appropriation and cost the school nothing to participate.The Pennsylvania Basic Education/Higher Education Science and Technology Partnership, Science in Motion annual report, 2012 Susquehanna University provided the enrichment experiences to schools in the region. AP Courses In 2015, Mahanoy Area High School offered 7 Advanced Placement (AP) courses at a higher cost than regular courses. The fee for each AP Exam is $91 (2014). The school normally retains $9 of that fee as a rebate to help with administrative costs. In 2012, the fee was $89 per test per pupil. Students have the option of taking College Board approved courses and then taking the College Board's examination in the Spring. Students, who achieve a 3 or better on the exam, may be awarded college credits at US universities and colleges. Each higher education institution sets its own standards about what level of credits are awarded to a student based on their AP exam score. Most higher education give credits for scores of 4 or 5. Some schools also give credits for scores of 3. High schools give credits towards graduation to students who take the school's AP class. At Mahanoy Area High School, just 6% of the students who took an AP course earned a 3 or better on the exam.PDE, School Performance Profile - Academic Performance Data - Mahanoy Area High School, December 2015 In 2014, 10% of the pupils at Mahanoy Area who took an AP course achieved a 3 or better. In 2016, less than 10 of the pupils at Mahanoy Area who took an AP course achieved a 3 or better. The school offered 8 AP courses. Mahanoy Area Offers; AP Chemistry, AP Biology, AP English, and AP U.S. History. Successful completion of an AP course earns the pupil 1.10 credits. Dual enrollment Mahanoy Area High School offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. Mahanoy Area School District works with Lehigh Carbon Community College to provide the course opportunities. Originally, the state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Dual Enrollment Guidelines, 2010 Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. Under state rules, other students that reside in the district, who attend a private school, a charter school or are homeschooled are eligible to participate in this program.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Dual Enrollment Guidelines, 2010 In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students, from the Commonwealth, in his state budget plan. For the 2009-10 funding year, the Mahanory Area School District received a state grant of $4,139 for the program. Governor Edward G.

Grants =Classrooms for the Future grant= The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. Mahanoy Area School District applied but was denied funding in 2006-07. In 2007-08, Mahaony Area School District applied again receiving $144,611. The District received $45,413 in 2008-09. Among the public school districts in Schuylkill County the highest award was given to North Schuylkill School District which received $245,673. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget. =Project 720= Project 720 was a high school reform program implemented for three years under the Rendell administration. The intent was to increase academic rigor and improve the instruction of teachers in the Commonwealth‚Äôs high schools. Teachers were expected to use data driven instructional practices and to meet the needs of diverse learners. The 720 in the name referred to the number of days a student was in high school in ninth through 12th grades. High schools applied for funding and were required to agree to report to the PDE their plans, their actions and the outcomes. In 2007-08 budget year, the Commonwealth provided $11 million in funding. Mahanoy Area School District was one of 161 PA public school districts to apply, receiving $222,000 funding over three years.Robert Hayes Postupac, PROJECT 720: A CASE STUDY OF HIGH SCHOOL REFORM, University of Pittsburgh, 2011 For 2010-11, Project 720 funding was decreased to $1.7 million by Governor Rendell. The grant program was discontinued effective with the 2011-12 state budget.PA Office of the Budget, 2011-12 Budget General Fund - State Appropriations, June 28, 2011 School safety and bullying Mahanoy Area School District administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the High School in 2015. Additionally, there was one assault on a student and no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in one incident at the school. One student was caught with an illegal substance at the school. Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. Mahanoy Area School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti- bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the District must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. According to the Center for Disease Control‚Äôs biannual national study of high school students in 2009, five percent of Pennsylvania students did not go to school for at least one day because they felt unsafe at school or on their way to or from school. Extracurriculars Mahanoy Area High School offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, costly sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). Mahanoy Area School District is within PIAA District 11. The PIAA mandates that student athletes must be passing at least four full-credit subjects to participate in sports. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. According to PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities in Mahanoy Area School District, must have criminal background checks. Like all school district employees, they must also attend an anti child abuse training once every three years.Eleanor Chute., New Pa. law expands clearance requirements for school volunteers, employees, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 15, 2014Ali Stevens., Child Protective Services Law impacts schools, WKOK.com 1070AM, January 6, 2015 =Sports= Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract.

He previously played eight matches over a four-year tenure with , which included winning a VFL premiership with the club's reserves side in 2019. He debuted for Carlton in Round 8 2020 against North Melbourne. Early life and junior football Moore is the son of New Zealander parents, but spent his teenage years in the Melbourne suburb of Essendon where he played junior football with Aberfeldie in the Essendon District Football League. In addition to football, Moore has an athletic background in basketball and rugby union. Moore soon joined the Calder Cannons TAC Cup development squad but chose to give up the sport and focus on basketball while with that club's under 16's side. That decision would be reversed eventually however, with Moore returning to football with Calder during his final year of high school after trialing with the local Coburg representative basketball side. He played five matches for the Cannons after that mid-season return in 2014, including in the club's grand final loss to Oakleigh. After finishing high school Moore worked with his father's business as a landscaper while playing football with Calder in his final year of eligibility. In early the early part of that 2015 season Moore suffered a broken wrist, limiting his output for much of the year. He played nine matches, kicking 13 goals and averaging 13 disposals, 10.7 hitouts and 3.4 marks per game as a tall utility. That same year Moore represented the Victorian Metro side at the Under 18 National Championships. He played four matches, recording averages of four marks and 2.8 inside-50s. Moore earned an invite to the 2015 AFL Draft Combine and while there recorded top-10 scores in the running vertical jump (86 cm) and 20-metre sprint (2.91 seconds) tests. AFL career =Richmond (2016-2019)= Moore was passed over for selection in the 2015 AFL Draft before being selected three days later in the 2016 rookie draft by with the club's first selection and twelfth selection overall. He began the 2016 season playing for Richmond's reserves side in the VFL. Moore was upgraded from the club's rookie list in August 2016, as a replacement for the injured Jake Batchelor. Moore made his AFL debut in a nine-point loss against in Round 22, 2016 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He kicked his first career goal on debut, along with five disposals and three tackles. He also played in the club's final match that season, against in Round 23. He finished the season with one goal to his name and an average of six disposals per game from his two AFL matches. Moore did not play senior football in 2017, instead continuing his development by switching between forward and back line roles in Richmond's VFL side. He suffered a partial syndesmosis sprain in his left ankle in late May, and missed six weeks of football as a result. In Richmond's VFL finals campaign, Moore proved a key player, kicking four goals in a preliminary final win which saw his team into the grand final. He played in what was ultimately a losing side the following week against Port Melbourne. Moore finished the reserves season having kicked 18 goals in 17 matches. Moore kicks for goal during the pre-match warm-up in round 10, 2018 Moore played his first football of 2018 in a six-club AFLX exhibition tournament alongside many of Richmond's younger players. Following that he was named as an emergency for the club's first official pre-season match before earning selection in the club's second and final match of that tournament two weeks later. Moore played in only the second half of that match against but still managed to score two goals, showing his potential to play as a second tall-forward alongside Jack Riewoldt come the start of the season- proper. He was ultimately unselected for senior football in round 1, but was named as an emergency for that season-opening match against . Moore would continue to wait for an AFL berth through the months of March and April, with reserves coach Craig McRae noting his \\"impressive development\\" and saying he \\"wouldn't be far off an AFL opportunity\\" following a two-goal VFL match in early April. Though it would take a further six weeks, that opportunity came in round 10, when Moore was selected for his first AFL match since round 23, 2016. Moore was given little opportunity to ease into that match however, as a concussion sustained early in the match saw teammate Jack Riewoldt play only the opening five minutes of the match and Moore tasked with considerable responsibility as the team's only remaining tall forward. Moore's performance was strong in Riewoldt's absence, taking six marks, kicking three behinds but failing to score a goal. In the Dreamtime at the 'G match against the following week, he kicked two goals while adding another three behinds, in a performance that AFL Media said outshone the returned Riewoldt. An eight disposal and goalless game in round 12 however, would see Moore's AFL run ended as he was dropped back to VFL level. He was immediately prolific at that level, kicking a bag of five goals during a match against the Northern Blues in late June. That performance and good form over the following two weeks saw Moore earn an AFL recall for a match against in round 16. He kicked two goals in that match before going goalless in rounds 17 and 18 and being subsequently dropped back to VFL level ahead of round 19. For the second time that season he responded to an AFL omission by bagging five goals at VFL level. On that occasion it came along with 19 disposals and 12 marks in what development coach Paul Griffiths called Moore's best game for Richmond at either level in his three years at the club. Despite that performance, Moore would not be recalled to senior football and would instead spend the remainder of the year with the club's reserves side in the VFL. There he played a contributing role in each of the team's two finals matches, including kicking two goals in the knock-out semi-final loss to the reserves. Moore finished the season having played six matches for four goals at AFL level. He also added 26 goals across 14 matches at VFL level that saw him place second at the club behind small forward Tyson Stengle. Moore signed a one-year contract extension ahead of the 2019 season, being upgraded from the club's rookie list to its senior list. He narrowly missed selection in Richmond's AFL pre-season campaign, instead being named an emergency at the level and ultimately playing with the club's reserves side in the VFL. When teammate Jack Riewoldt missed round 3's match against the Giants with injury, AFL Media named Moore a likely replacement, though he would eventually go unselected. Despite what VFL coach Craig McRae labelled a \\"great start to the season\\", Moore would neither be named to play nor as an AFL level emergency through the first four rounds of the season, even in Riewoldt's continued absence from the side. In early May he suffered a severe ankle injury while playing in a VFL match against . Surgery was required to repair extensive ligament, tendon and soft tissue damage from the injury, as well as a small fracture. The club placed an expected eight-to-ten week recovery time frame on the injury. By late June he had resumed some running exercises on a weight-assisted treadmill, but was expected to require another six weeks recovery time. Moore made his return to VFL football in early August, immediately impressing with four goals in a win over the Northern Blues. He remained with the minor premiership winning VFL side into their finals series, kicking one goal in a come-from-behind qualifying final win over the reserves. A fortnight later and despite going into the match suffering the effects of the flu, Moore contributed one goal from a spectacular inside-50 contested mark in a preliminary final as Richmond's reserves won through to the league's grand final. He was goalless in the Richmond VFL side that defeated the following week, as the club won its first reserves grade premiership since 1997. Moore finished 2019 having failed to play a match at AFL level, but winning a VFL premiership after nine matches and 12 goals with the club's reserves side. Moore was delisted by Richmond following the end of the 2019 season, after playing eight AFL matches over four seasons with the club. =Carlton (2020-)= Despite some reported interest from following his delisting by Richmond, Moore could not secure an AFL contract in the final months of 2019 and instead signed with VFL club Coburg for the 2020 season. However, in the early months of 2020, Moore began training with and in the second week of March, was signed to the club's AFL list under the pre-season supplemental selection period rules.

Three Saudi Arabians were arrested for the plot, followed by several Moroccan Islamists, many members of Salafia Jihadia. Plot and arrests The three Saudi nationals arrested were Zuher al-Tbaiti, the suspected ringleader, and Abdullah al-Ghamdi and Hilal al- Assiri. The three eventually confessed to the plot, having escaped Afghanistan in 2001 during the Battle of Tora Bora. The men had reportedly been instructed to the plot by a senior aide to Osama bin Laden based in Pakistan, named \\"Abu Bilal\\", suspected by authorities to be Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri who later reportedly confessed to having been behind the plot. The plot involved using speedboats packed with explosives in suicide bombings against American and British vessels, and possibly suicide bombings in Gibraltar. The Saudis had been able to integrate into Moroccan society by marrying Moroccan women through the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (GICM). The wives of two of the men were arrested, suspected of having been used as money couriers for al- Qaeda and to have been aware of the plots; one of the two women attempted to hide explosives in her apartment when she was arrested by security forces. According to one official, the plot had been planned \\"well before\\" the September 11 attacks. Attacks were reportedly also planned in Morocco, notably in the tourist centre of Marrakesh. The three Saudi Arabians were sentenced to ten years imprisonment in February 2003. The plot was widely compared to the USS Cole bombing of 2000. The bombing of USS Cole, as well as the later bombing of the French-registered oil tanker Limburg in October 2002, have also been linked to al-Nashiri. In 2003, NATO began escorting civilian ships through the Strait of Gibraltar amid fears of terrorist attacks. The Strait was mentioned as a target by Al-Qaeda in 2014, when through its magazine Resurgence it urged its followers of attacks against central transport hubs to destabilise the world economy.

Life Johann Georg Rist was born in Niendorf, at that time a prosperous village on the edge of Altona in Holstein, and today a quarter in Hamburg. His father was the minister- preacher at the Lutheran Ninedorf Market Church, Johann Christoph Friedrich Rist (1735-1807). They were both directly descended from the poet-dramatist Johann von Rist 1607-1667. Rist received his education at home from his father until 1794 when for a year he attended the prestigious Johanneum (school) in Hamburg. In the Easter term of 1795 he moved to the University of Jena where he studied Law and where contemporaries whom he got to know included , Johann Diederich Gries and Johann Friedrich Herbart. He also found time for frequent visits to the theatre in nearby Weimar, where he often encountered Goethe, already a celebrity, who made a great impression on Rist. An entry to the home of Schiller (who by this time was unwell and keeping out of the limelight) was also negotiated through well placed mutual acquaintances. After just a year, in 1796 Rist moved on from Jena to the University of Kiel where he pursued his studies and his networking. Those whose lectures he attended included August Christian Niemann and Dietrich Hermann Hegewisch. Like-minded new friends included Henrik Steffens. In 1797, invited by another of his student friends, he visited Copenhagen where he made the acquaintance of the Danish Finance Minister, Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann. This led to an appointment as von Schimmelmann's private secretary, a post he retained till 1801. (It is not clear that he ever graduated with a university degree.) At this time, to the frustration of more enthusiastic belligerent nations, Denmark and Russia were both navigating a path through the shifting alliances of the Napoleonic Wars based on armed neutrality, as a result of which they were allied with each other. In 1801 Rist joined the Danish diplomatic service as legation secretary to Saint Petersburg. His next posting was to the Madrid embassy where he remained till 1806. In 1804 he was appointed charg√© d'affaires, which in the absence of an ambassador made him Denmark's senior diplomatic representative. In 1806 he was transferred to London, again as the Danish charg√© d'affaires. His time in charge was dominated by a diplomatic breach between Denmark and the newly launched United Kingdom after British naval commanders, fearful that the Danish fleet might fall into French hands, bombarded Copenhagen and seized the Danish fleet. In Denmark Rist was blamed for not having foreseen or averted the development, and by 1808 he had left London. In that year he was sent as commercial attach√© (in some sources identified as General Commissar and General Consul) to Hamburg, a potentially profitable posting, but also a difficult one in the middle of a major war. The complexities of the French occupation enforced his resignation in 1813 which was also the year of his marriage. He relocated briefly to Hadersleben in Schleswig (for many purposes by now part of Denmark). Moving south in 1814, he became a member of the Kiel- based \\"Commission for the re-occupation of the principalities of Schleswig and Holstein\\" (\\"Kommission zur Wiederbesitzergreifung der Herzogt√ºmer Schleswig und Holstein\\"). With the defeat of Napoleon he was then appointed to a Danish government position in Paris. However, the situation in France was far from stable, and in 1815 Rist was back in Hamburg. In 1828 he relocated to Altona in Holstein which, though close in terms of geography, was politically very separate from Hamburg which had recovered and then built on much of its traditional autonomy after 1815. His youngest son died young, but both the elder two attended school in Altona. When a regional government for Schleswig- Holstein was established at Schleswig on 1 October 1834, Rist became First Councillor, a position he would retain till 7 September 1846. However when, in the context of growing ethnically fueled separatism, the king placed Ludvig Nicolaus von Scheele in charge of the government, widespread dissatisfaction ensued, and in 1846 Rist was one of six senior government ministers who fell into disgrace and were dismissed from office. The government structure itself lasted only another five years, after which, in 1852, separate ministries were created for Schleswig and for Holstein. Personal On 13 July 1813 Rist was married to Emilie \\"Emmy\\" Hanbury (1793-1859), a younger daughter of the British consul in Hamburg, William Hanbury (1755-1798). The marriage produced three recorded sons and three recorded daughters. Five of the six grew to adulthood.

From the 15th to 17th centuries it was the seat of the Vass family. The castle stood close to Loch Eye on the boundary of the parishes of Tain and Tarbat, but takes its name from an earlier name of the nearby loch. Architecture The last upstanding part of the castle collapsed on 31 January/1 February 1953. However, old photographs clearly show that it had a high-level corbelled angle turret. It also had cable-moulded decoration comparable to that at Castlecraig. The building was an L-plan castle with the kitchen on the first floor, and seems to have been similar in layout to Castle Leod and other Mackenzie residences. Although according to Geoffrey Stell it is very doubtful that the castle was actually built by the Mackenzies who did not come into possession of it until 1624. The castle consisted of two nearly square keeps with staircases in the corners. According to the Old Statistical Account of Scotland which was written in the late 18th-century, the smaller keep looking west was about 20' square, the other about 38' square. The castle was 60' high, and was fortified with three large turrets, two on the larger square and one on the smaller. History The castle stood about half a mile east of Loch Eye. According to the New Statistical Account of Scotland the castle was 14th-century. The Vass family had been in possession of the castle from the 15th-century to the early 17th- century when in 1603 they were declared rebels. Their successors in the castle were the Munros of Meikle Tarrel. The castle later passed from the Munros to the Mackenzies.

The years 2008-2009, on the occasion of the 1750th anniversary of his death, a Jubilee has been declared for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tarragona by the Pope Pope Benedict XVI.1750 a√±os de m√°rtires. Context The text documents the following details. St. Agurius, along with bishop Fructuosus and deacon Eulogiuss, were just going to bed when they were arrested. They were examined, at which point they affirmed their belief in the Christian God. They were then sentenced to be burnt. Officers were posted to prevent any sort of disturbance breaking out. They were not completely successful, though, and near the gate of the amphitheatre some of the Christians were able to get close to Fructuosus, and one of them asked him for his prayers. St. Fructuosus replied, in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear, \\"I am bound to bear in mind the whole universal Church from east to west.\\" He then added some words of consolation and encouragement to the assembled. As the flames rose and enveloped the martyrs, they stretched out their arms, praying to their God until they died. St Augurius feast day is January 21.

Very little of the area is developed with most of the land covered by bush and grazing land. Reedy Creek, a tributary of Stuart River downstream of Gordonbrook Dam, is another major waterway in the locality.  History  Gordon Brook Provisional School opened in 1924. On 11 September 1928 Gordon Brook South Provisional School opened and both schools operated \\"half time\\" (the full-time teacher being split between them). In 1929, Gordon Brook Provisional School closed and Gordon Brook South Provisional School continued on a full time basis. On 1 October 1938 it became Gordon Brook South State School and then closed in 1945. In 1941 Gordonbrook Dam was constructed to provide the town of Kingaroy and its former WWII airforce base, R.A.A.F Kingaroy with a reliable water supply. In 1986, the dam was extensively upgraded, including the raising of the dam wall and spillway by two metres. Formerly in the Shire of Kingaroy, Gordonbrook was included in the newly formed South Burnett Region following the local government amalgamations in March 2008. In the 2011 census, Gordonbrook had a population of 322 people.  References   Further reading  * Hession, Kathleen, Arthur, Jeannette.

His research focuses on development of computational methods in epidemiology for applications to public health also known as computational epidemiology or e-epidemiology He is also the founder of several global public health surveillance systems including HealthMap. He is most known for his work on global tracking of disease outbreaks. Early life and education Brownstein is the son of Veronica (Coleman) and Stephen Brownstein, and his sister is Jessica Mulroney. He is a descendant of the founders of Browns Shoes. He grew up in Montreal and obtained his bachelor's degree in biology from the McGill University in 1999. He received a Ph.D. in epidemiology in 2004 from Yale University for work on the emergence of Lyme disease and West Nile virus in the United States. Career Brownstein joined the faculty at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital in 2005, where he focused on the intersection of epidemiology and computer science. He directs the Computational Epidemiology Group at Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital and the Innovation and Digital Health Accelerator also at Boston Children. He was appointed as full Professor of Pediatrics and Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School in 2015; tenured at age 36, he was one of the youngest professors to receive tenure in the modern history of Harvard Medical School. He received the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2010 and the Lagrange Prize in 2016. He was honored with the 40 under 40 award by Boston Business Journal in 2015 and by Medtech Boston in 2016. Research Brownstein‚Äôs pioneered the creation of Computational Epidemiology and E-epidemiology- utilizing diverse digital data sources to understand populations. He has published 200 peer-reviewed papers, all focused on new methods and applications in public health surveillance. Overall, his research agenda aims to facilitate the control and prevention of disease through better epidemiologic understanding of factors influencing disease risk, improved practice of public health and engaging the public around critical health issues. As part of this work, he has built and maintains several patient facing public health systems, including HealthMap, an internet-based global infectious disease intelligence system. During the H1N1 pandemic, his research made important contributions to our understanding of the emergence of the virus in Mexico and its subsequent global spread. His work is credited with supporting early detection and surveillance of Cholera in 2010, Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2015. His work has led to the application of crowdsourcing in health; a field termed \\"participatory epidemiology\\". . His work has been funded from diverse array of sources including The U.S. Department of Defense, Google.org and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Along with Sachin H. Jain he coined the term \\"Digital Phenotype\\" in a seminal paper in Nature Biotechnology. On December 30, 2019, the HealthMap system led by Brownstein was the first electronic disease surveillance program to issue an alert for an unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Following identification of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 disease, Brownstein coauthored numerous papers on nopharmaceutical interventions, socioeconomic disparities, and participatory surveillance related to the global pandemic. Brownstein also coauthored a controversial paper that analyzed satellite image data and search engine traffic data and speculated that COVID-19 may have started as early as Fall 2019 in Wuhan. This claim received widespread media coverage including reports and an academic commentary that questioned the academic rigour of the study. Commercial efforts Brownstein is co-founder of Epidemico a commercial spinoff of Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital that was acquired by Booz Allen Hamilton in 2014.

They had originally planned to prospect for gold at Arltunga but eventually found supplying the miners with meat to be more profitable. They built the first homestead on the station in 1910. Ben Webb's three sons, Bennett, Qinton and Kil, better known as the Webb brothers, took over the station. Kil was responsible for improving the water infrastructure on the station and Bennett for the mustering, branding and droving. Joseph Louis Schaber's son Roy also managed the station. The Webbs started the annual Harts Range Races in 1946, now held each Picnic Day long weekend. The Webb brothers raced stockman Jack Schaber and the regional policeman Senior Constable Bob Darken over a distance of about a mile to the Ulgarna Yards to determine who had the fastest horse. It inspired an annual race meet. The Webb brothers purchased Golden Star, a four-year-old chestnut Arab stallion in 1949 for breeding on the station. Recent history Dick and Ann Cadzow purchased the lease on Mount Riddock in 1986. They had previously owned Phillip Creek station near Tennant Creek. When they took over the station it had significant populations of rabbits and horses. Dick Cadzow was the winner of the 2004 Rural Press Landcare Primary Producer Award at the NT Landcare Awards. While they continue to live on the station, it is now managed their son Steve and his wife Rebecca. They have three children. Well-known Central Australia botanist Peter Latz was a ringer on Mount Riddock Station in the 1960s. The Cadzows were among the first to adopt rotational grazing in the arid zone, working closely with researchers to monitor this management strategy. It won them an NT Landcare Award for Innovation in Sustainable Farm Practices in 2015. Cattle from Mount Riddock regularly attract the top price at the annual Alice Springs Show Sale. The Cadzows introduced the first privately owned Remote Livestock Management System in Australia on the property in 2015, allowing them to remotely weigh and draft their cattle. An unsuccessful application was lodged to heritage list the historic homestead on Mount Riddock Station in 1994. The homestead was built between 1928 and 1930. It was dismantled in 2012 and then relocated to Gemtree Caravan Park, 140 km from Alice Springs, in 2014. A second bid to have the homestead in its new location added to the Northern Territory Heritage Register was made in 2015 with the site being gazetted on 8 April 2016.

She showed little promise as a two-year-old and was well beaten in maiden races at Leopardstown and Newmarket. As a three-year-old she showed improved form as she was moved up in distance, winning a maiden at Dundalk and the Lingfield Oaks Trial at Lingfield. She ran poorly in The Oaks but then emerged as a top- class performer with wins over strong fields in the Irish Oaks and the Yorkshire Oaks. Background Seventh Heaven is a bay filly with no white markings bred in Ireland by La Traviata Syndicate, a breeding organisation associated with the Coolmore Stud. The filly was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the official details of her ownership have changed from race to race: she has sometimes been listed as being the property of Derrick Smith, whilst on other occasions she has been described as being owned by a partnership of Smith, Michael Tabor and Susan Magnier. She was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo is now one of the world's leading stallions and has been champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland five times. His other progeny include Cape Blanco, Frankel, Golden Lilac, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Ruler of the World and Minding. Seventh Heaven's dam La Traviata was bought as a two-year-old at the Fasig-Tipton Calder sale in February 2006 for $1.1 million by the bloodstock agent Dermot \\"Demi\\" O'Byrne on behalf of Coolmore. She showed good form in a brief racing career, winning three of her races in the United States in 2007 including the Grade III Victory Ride Stakes. She was descended from the American broodmare Miel, making her a distant relative of Rodrigo de Triano and Shaadi. As a broodmare La Traviata has also produced the Middle Park Stakes winner Crusade. Racing career =2015: two-year-old season= Seventh Heaven began her racing career in a seven furlong maiden race at Leopardstown Racecourse on 12 September in which she finished seventh of the thirteen runners behind Anamba. Two weeks later she was sent to England for a similar event at Newmarket Racecourse and started the 5/2 second favourite. She never looked likely to win but stayed on in the closing stages to finish fourth behind First Victory. =2016: three-year-old season= Spring On her three-year-old debut Seventh Heaven contested a one-mile maiden on the Polytrack surface at Dundalk Racecourse on 18 April in which she was ridden by Seamie Heffernan. Starting the odds-on favourite in an eleven-runner field she took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by three and a quarter lengths from the Dermot Weld-trained Heartful. The filly was then moved up in class and distance for the Listed Oaks Trial Stakes over eleven and a half furlongs at Lingfield Park 7 May. Ridden by Ryan Moore she started 15/8 favourite in a five runners field which included the highly regarded British- trained fillies Mountain Bell (a ten length winner of a maiden at Windsor) and Architecture. Seventh Heaven tracked the leader Mountain Bell before taking the lead in the last quarter mile and getting the better of what was described by the Racing Post as a \\"sustained duel\\" with Architecture to win by a neck. After the race Moore said \\"She didn't like the ground or the track and she's still won. She's a good filly and she'll have learned plenty\\". Summer The Epsom Oaks on 5 June saw Seventh Heaven start a 20/1 outsider in a field headed by her stablemate Minding. After tracking the leaders she dropped from contention in the straight and finished sixth of the eight finishers, thirty- three lengths behind Minding, who won from Architecture and Harlequeen. On 16 July, Seventh Heaven (ridden by Heffernan) faced Architecture and Harlequeen again in the Irish Oaks at the Curragh and started a 14/1 outsider. The O'Brien stable fielded three other runners: the Ribblesdale Stakes winner Even Song, ridden by Moore, who started odds-on favourite, the Munster Oaks winner Pretty Perfect and the Cheshire Oaks winner Somehow. The best of the other five runners appeared to be Turret Rocks (May Hill Stakes) and Ajman Princess (runner-up in the Ribblesdale). Seventh Heaven raced at the rear of the field as Pretty Perfect made the running but began to make progress as the runners approached the final turn. She was switched to the left to make her challenge in the straight, recovered from a minor bump, and moved up to take the lead just inside the final furlong. She drew away in the final strides and won by two and three quarter lengths from Architecture, with Harlequeen a length and a quarter back in third. Aidan O'Brien, who was winning the race for the fifth time, nominated the Yorkshire Oaks as the filly's most likely next objective saying \\"She‚Äôll love the flat track. She's a lovely, big, flowing Galileo filly\\". Seventh Heaven was matched against older fillies and mares for the first time when she contested the Yorkshire Oaks at York Racecourse on 18 August. Ridden by Colm O'Donoghue she started the 100/30 second favourite behind her four-year-old stablemate Found who was returning from a two-month absence. Even Song, Harlequeen, Turret Rocks and Pretty Perfect were again in opposition, whilst the other runners included Queen's Trust (runner-up to Minding in the Nassau Stakes), Endless Time (Lancashire Oaks) and the multiple South American Grade I winner Furia Cruzada. As in her run at the Curragh, Seventh Heaven was held up at the rear of the field before making a forward move entering the straight. Pretty Perfect who had led for most of the way, was overtaken by Queen's Trust two furlongs out but Seventh Heaven gained the advantage a furlong out. Seventh Heaven stayed on strongly in the closing stages and won by two and three quarter lengths from Found, with Queen's Trust in third place. After the race O'Donoghue said \\"She's tough and genuine and has a great temperament and a beautiful action\\" whilst O'Brien commented \\"She's a beautiful traveler and is a massive, rangy filly that handles fast ground very well. I'd say she's going to make a real 4-year-old, because she's big and rangy.\\" Autumn On 15 October Seventh Heaven, ridden by Moore, started 5/4 favourite for the British Champions Fillies & Mares Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot Racecourse. Drawn on the far outside of the thirteen-runner field she tracked across to the rail soon after the start to race along the inside. After repeatedly struggling to obtain a clear run, she was switched to the outside in the straight but never looked likely to win and finished fifth behind Journey. In November she was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf over ten furlongs at Santa Anita Park. She started the 7/2 second favourite and stayed on in the straight to finish fourth behind Queen's Trust, Lady Eli and Avenge. =2017: four-year-old season= For her four-year-old debut Seventh Heaven was sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Sheema Classic at Meydan Racecourse on 25 March. Ridden by Heffernan, she started lowly but stayed on strongly in the closing stages to finish second to Jack Hobbs with Postponed in third and Highland Reel last of the seven runners. On her return to Europe she was dropped from Group 1 class for the first time in a year and started odds-on favourite for the Group 2 Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in which she was ridden by Moore. She took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew right away from her rivals to win by five lengths from the French horse One Foot in Heaven (winner of the Prix du Conseil de Paris).

The lake is east of the village of Sutton-under- Whitestonecliffe in North Yorkshire, England. Gormire has no inflow or major outflow of water. It is thought to be fed by an underground spring and drained by a limestone channel so the water finds a way out through the base of the cliff face to the east of the lake. The lake is also known as the White Mere, Lake Gormire, or more simply, Gormire. The name Gormire translates as filthy swamp. The lake was formed over 20,000 years ago by glacial erosion. When an ice sheet pushed its way between the Pennines and the North York Moors, it bulldozed the soft earth away and carved the cliffs at Whitestone and in turn the mud left over stopped the water's egress and formed the glacial lake. Gormire Lake was a result of this process and is fourth largest of the natural lakes in Yorkshire (the other three being Hornsea Mere, Malham Tarn and Semerwater). The lake was first designated as an Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1954; however, in 1985 the area surrounding the lake was incorporated into the SSSI status with the new area being . The new designation incorporates the broadleaf woodlands of Garbutt Wood which encroach right up to the water's edge. The lake is the setting of several myths; one being of a knight known as Sir Harry Scriven who conned the Abbot of Rievaulx Abbey into letting him ride his horse (a white mare, the so called derivation of White Mare Cliff (another name for Whitestonecliff)). The knight and the abbot rode on from an inn and as they did so, it turned into a race. The abbot then changed into the devil, which caused such panic in the knight that he couldn't stop the horse and himself plunging into Gormire Lake from the clifftop. The 'devil' was then seen to jump into the lake after them and the boiling effect of the devil in the water is what is said to have caused the darkness of the lake to this day. Other myths are that the lake is bottomless, that the bottom of the lake is the entrance to hell, there is submerged village underneath the water and that a goose once disappeared in the lake to emerge in a well at Kirkbymoorside stripped of all its feathers. Gormire Lake is popular with wild swimmers as it has no streams feeding it so there is very little current and the waters are described as being 'warm'. Swimmers have reported that it is seething with leeches. The Times named the lake as one of the 20 best lakes and rivers in Britain for wild swimming.

Coach bodies were built on chassis from Daimler and Maudslay, and 29- and 33-seat buses were built on the Leyland Comet chassis. The company built double-decker buses for the Bristol Omnibus Company on the Leyland Titan PD1 chassis. Longwell Green sold many bus bodies on chassis with underfloor engines to South Wales operators in the 1950s. For example, in 1957 Longwell Green supplied four single-deck motorbuses with Leyland Tiger Cub chassis to Cardiff Corporation. Between 1952 and 1957 Longwell Green was among the companies that built bodies for high-capacity Bedford pumping vehicles known as \\"Green Goddesses\\" for use by the Auxiliary Fire Service. In 1960 the New Scientist reported that Longwell Green Coachworks had moulded a crane machinery house from Beetle polyester resin, the first time a complete crane machinery house had been made with structural plastics. The result was an elegant crane with reduced cost of construction. In May 1965 the plastics operation became L.G. Plastics. Longwell Green Sports F.C., a football club, was formed in 1966 by workers from Longwell Green Coachworks during a period of great enthusiasm for football after England had beaten West Germany in the World Cup at Wembley. At the time Longwell Green Coachworks was the main employer in the area. The first pitch was laid out on what was then open farmland, and this is still the site of the team's home pitch. Longwell Green Coachworks built both buses and lorries until 1966. Customers for the buses included the Cardiff, Newport, Aberdare, Gelligaer and Merthyr Tydfil corporations, and the larger Rhondda Transport Company and South Wales Transport. The lorries, vans and crew buses were bought by British Road Services, British Rail and the General Post Office. The last two buses were made in 1966, but the company went on building vans and lorries. In the 1980s the company made custom-built Range Rovers for use in the Middle East. Longwell Green Coachworks ceased operation in 1983.

When Emmanuel Haller was appointed in the Girardot bank in 1777, Louis became a silent partner. At some time (1777?) he became a friend of Benjamin Franklin. Jacques Necker was dismissed on 19 May 1781 as controller of the royal treasury.

The disgrace of his younger brother Jacques, who resigned in 1790, contributed to his decision. The Neckers were far from welcome in Geneva. Many of the French √©migr√©s considered them Jacobins, and many of the Swiss Jacobins thought them conservative.The Encyclopedists as individuals: a biographical dictionary of the authors of the Encyclop√©die His son Jacques (1757-1825), who had joined the French army, married Albertine Necker de Saussure in 1785.

The characters, portrayed respectively by Russell Harvard and Adam Goldberg, were often highlighted as one of the stand-outs of season one by critics. The characters later briefly re-appear as two unnamed children in the season two finale \\"Palindrome\\", set many years before the first season, with Wrench appearing again as a recurring character in season three, set four years after season one. Relationship and character overviews =1979‚Äì2006= As shown in the season 2 finale, Numbers and Wrench were friends from childhood, growing up somewhere in the American midwest. Although Numbers did not have a hearing impairment, he learned sign language so as to communicate with his friend. One day, when the two were playing baseball, they were attacked by two older boys, but the fight was interrupted by Hanzee Dent. The two are committed hitmen, who will perform what is asked of them no matter the circumstances. Mr. Numbers is killed by Lorne Malvo after a long pursuit, which involved killing an innocent man who looked similar to Malvo, in the sixth episode of season one, \\"Buridan's Ass\\". Later, Wrench is seen cuffed to his hospital bed, Malvo, rewarding him for coming the closest to killing him that anyone ever did, gives him the key to his restraints and says, \\"if you still feel raw about things when you heal up, come see me.\\" =2010‚Äì2016= Wrench reappears in the season 3 episode \\"The Law of Inevitability\\", sitting next to Nikki Swango on a prison bus. Manacled together, they escape from the back of the bus, pursued by Yuri Gurka, who later runs off after his ear is lost to an axe, thrown by Wrench; Nikki and Wrench kill the other assassin pursuing them. The two later venture to points unknown in a car provided by Paul Marrane, whom they meet at a bowling alley. They go on to attempt to blackmail V. M. Varga by breaking into his semi- tractor trailer and stealing sensitive information. Nikki and Wrench ambush Varga and his crew when they come to pay ransom, though Varga escapes. The two part ways, and Nikki gives Wrench the briefcase full of money. She is later killed while trying to kill Emmit Stussy, the brother of her deceased lover Ray Stussy, whom she blamed for his death. Five years later, Wrench tracks down Emmit and kills him. Production Writer-creator Noah Hawley, a part- time Austin resident who lives near Texas School for the Deaf, cited his own neighborhood encounters with sign language as the inspiration for the ‚ÄúMr. Wrench‚Äù character: a deaf assassin who uses his command of American Sign Language as a means of menace toward his targets and of private communication with his partner Mr. Numbers. Hawley has described Harvard as ‚Äúmagnetic and charismatic‚Äù in the role of Mr. Wrench, and ended up extending the character‚Äôs appearance in the series. Hawley deliberately modeled the pair's appearance after Ratso Rizzo and Joe Buck from the film Midnight Cowboy. Goldberg was cast after previously working on Hawley's TV series The Unusuals, Goldberg said; \\"That was just a straight up offer. Every once in a while there‚Äôs a guy like Noah [Hawley] who sees something in me that maybe even I don‚Äôt necessarily see.\\" During the five-month shoot in Calgary, Alberta, Harvard and the show‚Äôs ASL manager, Catherine MacKinnon, worked closely with Goldberg on translating the pair‚Äôs dialogue into the most effective ASL exchanges for their scenes. Reception The characters and the performances of Goldberg and Harvard were well received by critics, with Alan Sepinwall of HitFix, \\"the relationship between Goldberg and Harvard feels unlike any criminal twosome of its type I've seen before, even in the midst of a show that is otherwise cleverly rearranging familiar pieces of the movie and other crime stories.\\" Tim Goodman, TV critic for The Hollywood Reporter, wrote, \\"Encapsulating everything that is joyously weird about Fargo, the killers are the dangerous ‚Äî and deaf ‚Äî Mr. Wrench (Russell Harvard) and his partner and translator, Mr. Numbers (Adam Goldberg)...
