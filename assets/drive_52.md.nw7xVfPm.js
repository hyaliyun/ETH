Kedatuan (ancient spelling: Kadatuan; Javanese romanization: Kedaton) were historical semi- independent city-states or principalities throughout ancient Maritime Southeast Asia in present-day Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. In a modern Malay and Indonesian sense, they could be described as kingdoms or polities.Definition of 'Kedatuan' The earliest written record mentioning the term kadatuan was the 7th-century Srivijayan Telaga Batu and Kota Kapur inscription. Etymology The term Kadatuan in Old Malay means \\"the realm of Datu\\" or \\"the residence of Datu\\". Constructed from old Malay stem word Datu with circumfix ke- -an to denote place. It derived from Datu or Datuk, an ancient Austronesian title and position for regional leader or elder that is used throughout Maritime Southeast Asia. It was mentioned in several inscriptions such as 7th century Srivijayan Old Malay Telaga Batu inscription, and 14th century Sundanese Astana Gede inscription. In wider sense it could refer to the whole principality, on smaller sense however, it could refer to palace where Datu resides. The Kota Kapur inscription mentioned \\"manraksa yan kadatuan √ßrivijaya\\" (to protect the Kadatuan of Srivijaya), thus Srivijaya is described as a kadatuan. In Srivijayan perspective, the realm of the Kadatuan Srivijaya was described consists of several wanua (settlements) each led by a datu (datuk), which means community leader or elder. All of this realm are under control of central kadatuan which also led by a datu. The highest datu in Srivijaya was Dapunta Hyang. Kedatuan is known and widely spread in the Malay-speaking region, including the east coast of Sumatra, the Minangkabau lands, the Malay peninsula, the Borneo coast and the Filipino archipelago.The ancient Kadatuan or Tumao.(Philippine History Files) In Javanese, the term Ratu is used instead of Datu, thus in Java Karaton, Keraton or Kraton is used instead of Kedaton to describe the residence of regional leader. The term is also known in Java as Kedaton, the meaning however, has shifted to architectural term to refer to the inner compound of the living quarter inside keraton (palace) complex. For example, there is the Kedaton complex within the central part of Keraton Surakarta palace in Central Java. Political relations Smaller Kedatuan were often become subordinate to more powerful neighboring Kedatuan, which in turn were subordinate to the central king (Maharaja). The more powerful Kedatuan, sometimes grew to become powerful kingdoms, and occasionally tried to liberate themselves from their suzerain and sometimes enjoyed times of independence, and in turn might subjugate neighboring Kedatuan. Kedatuan, large and small often shifted allegiance, or paid tribute to more than one powerful neighbor. Some Kedatuan, such as Srivijaya, rose to become empires. It is suggested that during its early formation, Srivijaya was a collection or some kind of federation consisting of several kadatuans (local principalities), all swearing allegiance to the central ruling Kadatuan ruled by Srivijayan Maharaja.

The headquarters of the church is in Seoul, South Korea.  History  In 1959 at the 44th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Korea the denomination divided for the third time (1951, 1953, and 1959) into two equal parts due to the church's view of the issue of ecumenism and the World Council of Churches. The church was divided for and against Park Hyun-nyon, president of the Presbyterian Seminary Society of the General Assembly. The anti-Park party is called 'Tonghap' (the united body) and the pro-Park party is called 'Hapdong' (the union body). The divisions from all three splits during the 50s still exist. The divisions from the third split between Tonghap and Hapdong respectively are still the largest Presbyterian dominations in South Korea. The HapDong section represented more theologically conservative wing than the TongHap. The Tonghap group maintained its affiliation to the World Council of Churches and the National Council of Churches and allowed relatively wide range of theological positions. The Presbyterian Church in Korea (HapDong) was the more conservative group in the schism. Its conservative doctrinal basis made it possible to unite later with the Presbyterian Church in Korea (Koshin) in 1960. But this union did not last and a group of Koshin churches separated a few years later, although about 150 Koshin congregations stayed with HapDong. In 1961, another group separated to form the Bible Presbyterian Church, later to be called the Presbyterian Church in Korea (Daeshin). At the 64th General assembly in 1979 the church suffered another division. Kim Hee Bo the President of the ChongShin Seminary advocated for the historical-critical approach to the Pentateuch. The church divided into a mainline and non- mainline groups. The debate centered about two issues: the authorship of the Pentateuch and the relationship with the ChongShin Seminary. The non-mainline section fragmented in the following years. In the 1990s the current HapDong experienced phenomenal growth. By the early 2000s, HapDong developed into the largest denomination in South Korea with more than 2.2 million communicant members, 5,123 congregations, and 6,300 ordained pastors. These figures differ from the statistics offered by Chongshin Seminary, which claims the church has 11,000 congregations and about 3 million members. In South Korea there are about 15 million Protestants, about 9 million are Presbyterians in more than 100 denominations.  Doctrine  The Presbyterian Church in Korea (HapDong) is a theologically conservative denomination. The Hapdong group subscribe the historic Presbyterian Confessions like: = Creeds = *Apostles' Creed = Confessions = *Westminster Confession of Faith *Westminster Larger Catechism *Westminster Shorter Catechism According to the Apostle Paul's instructions, there are no women ordinations.  Theological Education  The Chongshin University and Chonshin Seminary are the only official educational institutions of the HapDong Church to train pastors.  Missions  The Presbyterian Church in Korea HapDong created the Board of Global Missions in South Korea for supporting evangelism and missions. The Global Mission Society, the missionary body of the Hapdong General Assembly of Presbyterian Churches of Korea, is the single largest Presbyterian missionary organization in the South Korea with mission fields in Europe, Asia, Russia, Latin America, Africa.

In the poem Koyczan talks about bullying he and others received during their lives and its deep, long-term impact. Background The animated film for \\"To This Day\\" was released onto YouTube on February 19, 2013. The video received 1.4 million hits in the first two days and currently has over 24 million. It features the work of 12 animators, supported by 80 artists. Koyczan first came to international notice when he read his poetry at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics' Opening Ceremony. The poem describes Koyczan's experience of being abandoned by his parents, to be brought up by his grandmother Loretta Mozart and how he was bullied at school, given the name 'Pork Chop'. He commented: > My hope is [that it] would reach some of the people who were just out there > looking for something to get them through another day. When I wrote the poem > two years ago and people started coming to me because they just needed to > talk after hearing it, I realized this is not a Canadian problem or an > American problem, it‚Äôs everywhere...I believe the bullies must be forgiven. > That‚Äôs how we heal. Koyczan describes how, following torment at school, he became a bully himself around the age of 14, an image of the thing he hated. He says that keeping communication channels open and clear between parents and their children will help address bullying issues. He commented that he hopes the poem and the project will promote a connectivity between those who have suffered from bullying, that they might feel less isolated. The project aims to help schools engage better with bullying and child suicide. Reception for the poem has been overwhelmingly positive, receiving coverage on CBS and CBC News. Koyczan was chosen to read the poem and show to film at the TED conference, California, in 2013, accompanied by violinist Hannah Epperson. After the video's release Koyczan received hundreds of letters from people that have experienced bullying. The poem is part of the To This Day project and was released to mark Pink Shirt Day, an anti-bullying initiative. The project aims to highlight the deep and long-term impact of bullying on the individual and help schools engage better with bullying and child suicide.

He attended Hawkshead School with William Wordsworth.The Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth: The middle years: pt. II. 1812-1820 (1993_, revised by Mary Moorman and Alan G. Hill, note p. 417. Wilson went into the cotton spinning trade, near Staveley.Satchell and Wilson, p. 55. He had a business interest in gunpowder, being a partner in the Low Wood Gunpowder Mill at Haverthwaite. This mill was a major supplier of export gunpowder for Africa to Liverpool, up to the Slave Trade Act 1807.Satchell and Wilson, p. 3. Wilson was connected to Liverpool through his uncle Thomas Parke.David Richardson, Anthony Tibbles, Suzanne Schwarz, Liverpool and Transatlantic Slavery (2007), p. 130; Google Books. Wilson joined the Kendal Bank, founded by his father, Joseph Maude, and Thomas Crewdson, as a partner, in 1795.Chandler, p. 63. He became senior partner in 1812, when the bank became Wilson, Crewdson & Co.Chandler, p. 77. Election of 1818 The 1818 election for Westmorland was closely contested by Henry Brougham, against two Tories of the locally predominant Lowther family, Viscount Lowther and Henry Lowther. Wilson acted as chairman of the local Lowther Committee. He held an anti-Reform meeting; while John Wakefield II, of the rival banking family, held a pro-Brougham meeting.Satchell and Wilson, pp. 3‚Äì4. The Kendal Chronicle alleged that Wilson, a commissioner for the land tax, had employed \\"sly cunning\\", after Brougham had repeatedly claimed in Parliament that Wilson had delayed returning assessments in order to disenfranchise reform voters.Chandler, p. 79. Matters became rowdy, with a Reform mob setting up a barricade in Kendal to keep out the Lowther party arriving from Dallam Tower to the south. At this time Wordsworth, whose politics were Tory, commented in a letter to Lord Lonsdale, Viscount Lowther's father, that Wilson was wealthy, but not popular. Both Lowther candidates were returned in the two-member constituency. Later life Rigmaden Park Wilson lived at Abbot Hall. He then bought Mansergh manor from Charles Satterthwaite in 1821. After the Panic of 1825 he sold out of the Kendal Bank, in 1826.Chandler, p. 80. He had the old manor house at Mansergh, called Rigmaden, rebuilt (1828), to a design by George Webster. An enclosure act was passed in 1837 for Mansergh, where Wilson built and endowed a school. Thomas Chalmers, who encountered Wilson in the 1820s socially, described him as \\"banker, with ¬£10,000 a year, a great landed proprietor, a magistrate, and most intimately and intelligently acquainted with pauperism\\". He later quoted correspondence with Wilson, on the select vestry principle, in his work on poor relief, in The Christian and Civic Economy of Large Towns (1823).Thomas Chalmers, The Christian and Civic Economy of Large Towns (1823) p. 269; archive.org.

He was well known for representing, with well-known San Francisco criminal defense attorney George T. Davis, the defendant in the 1946 Thomas Talle murder trial. Talle, a millionaire cattleman from New Mexico, was accused of murdering his wife in their home in Monte Sereno. The case was widely publicized in the media. Boccardo acted as both the lawyer and witness for the defense. Found guilty at the first trial, the conviction was reversed on appeal due to a technicality.\\"Hey Picks Up First Annual Prosecutors' Award,\\" San Jose Post-Record, January 4, 1989. Boccardo also represented San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto in a libel suit against Look, after the magazine suggested that the mayor was connected to the Mafia. Boccardo was a pioneer in the use of visual aids, models, and videotape as courtroom exhibits to explain complex facts. In 1970, Boccardo appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records for winning $3.6 million in a personal injury case, at the time the largest such verdict. After his death, Santa Clara County District Attorney George Kennedy said that Boccardo's \\"reputation was one of the first things I knew about this area. He is the legal skyscraper of this area--and in the country, really. He was at the top of his game in criminal law and pioneered the way civil cases were handled in court.\\" During his life, Boccardo was profiled in Time and Forbes magazines. In addition to his legal practice, Boccardo engaged in business and banking. He was a defense contractor during World War II, organizing the San Jose Manufacturers, a non-profit coalition of small machine shops that produced 105-mm gun carriages for the U.S. Army in San Jose. Boccardo also created a forge and shipbuilding facility for the Navy, another- not-for-profit venture, during the war. Boccardo formed the Western Gravel Company, which merged with another company and became the largest concrete and building materials supplier in Santa Clara County. In 1963, Boccardo established the Community Bank of San Jose, which later became California Commerce Bank, now owned by Grupo Financiero Banamex. Boccardo was also known for a tax law case brought by Boccardo and his wife, Boccardo v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue. In that case in 1987, the Ninth Circuit ruled in favor of Boccardo, reversing the United States Tax Court. The case changed how attorney-client contracts were taxed.Boccardo v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 56 F.3d 1016 (9th Cir. 1995). Boccardo was a member of the Inner Circle of Advocates. Described as \\"mercurial\\" and \\"well-dressed,\\" with a \\"neat, trimmed mustache,\\" he had homes in Los Gatos, Palm Springs, and Pebble Beach. According to one story, Boccardo and Melvin Belli once \\"drove down the Spanish Steps in Rome in a rented Rolls-Royce\\" together. Retirement After retiring from the practice of law, Boccardo increased his philanthropic activities. He was a major benefactor of San Jose State University; in 1997, he gave $2 million for renovations to the business school building (later renamed the James F. Boccardo Business Education Center). Boccardo also donated to the university gate project, and the gate at Fourth Street and Paseo de San Carlos was renamed the Boccardo Gate in his honor. The university awarded Boccardo and his wife the Tower Award in 1998. Boccardo was named a commander of the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity in 1970. He also received the 2002 Achievement Award of the Italian American Heritage Foundation. Boccardo also contributed to homelessness projects. In 1997, he gave funds for a 250-bed homeless shelter for the San Jose Emergency Housing Consortium, the James F. Boccardo Regional Reception Center. Boccardo also endowed the John H. Boccardo Family Living Center. In 2002, Boccardo funded the creation of the Boccardo Trail Corridor at Alum Rock Park, a hiking and equestrian trail, and doubling the amount of protected land at the park. Boccardo died in his sleep at age 91 on March 17, 2003, in Los Gatos, California. He was survived by his wife of 67 years, Lorraine; a son, John Boccardo II of Sausalito, California; a daughter, Leanne Rees of Maryland; two grandsons James \\"Jim\\" Rees of Los Gatos and Evan Rees of New Mexico; and a great-grandson, Zachary Rees.

According to the philosopher and critic Andrei Ple≈üu, Ramniceanu is \\"one of those artists who know how to seduce, surprise and irritate; in other words, he has the gift to be unpredictable.\\" From communist Romania to the \\"Free World\\" Ramniceanu graduated in 1979 from the Nicolae Grigorescu Faculty of Fine Arts at the University of Bucharest. In 1985 when he began showing his art work in two galleries of Bucharest: Atelier 35 and Galeria Orizont. Art critic and historian Radu Bogdan and writer and philosopher Nicolae Steinhardt both praised his work for re-envisioning light in painting, making it a \\"light from the inside\\", i.e., a light coming from the artistic shape itself that makes it lighter and raises it to a higher spirituality. The excitement that accompanied the artist's revelation to the public was reflected in a landmark essay entitled \\"Stefan Ramniceanu, artistic path\\", in which art critic and historian RƒÉzvan Theodorescu expressed how Ramniceanu's oeuvre had been a revelation to him, inspiring him \\"the feeling of a new future for contemporary art\\" in Romania. A couple of years later, in 1988, as his work was beginning to be exhibited abroad ‚Äì notably in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Austria where he represented Romania at the Expositia de Arta Plastica Romaneasca, Ramniceanu held his solo exhibition \\"FerecƒÉtura\\" in the Curtea Veche palace, the most ancient palace of the Bucharest and a voivodal residence from the 14th century. RƒÉzvan Theodorescu who was to become Minister of Culture and Religious Affairs some years later served as a curator for that exhibition which was to become a landmark event in the capital's cultural life. Designed as a tribute to celebrate three centuries from the coming to power of Romania's leading historical figure Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu as Prince of Wallachia, the exhibition re-envisioned the imagery of Orthodox church through contemporary, abstracted \\"icons\\", turning art as a form of coded dissent against the oppression of the Ceausescu regime of that time. FerecƒÉtura attracted Ramniceanu much attention and the Romanian television devoted him a 45-minute reportage entitled \\"the sense of grandeur, the cult of the effort and the joy of the offensive in Stefan Ramniceanu's art work\\" named after the striking expression used by Andrei Ple≈üu (Romanian Minister of Culture from 1989 to 1991 and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1997 to 1999) in his essay entitled \\"The Crusade of Stefan Ramniceanu\\". The confrontation with the international art trials Following this exhibition, Ramniceanu's art work gained the interest of the \\"free world\\" diplomatical circles, which opened him doors to exhibitions outside the communist world. This is how his solo exhibition FerecƒÉtura was itinerated in Athens on the initiative of the Greek Ministry of Culture in Greece one year later, in 1989. The exhibition, held at the Rizarios Theological Institute under the name \\"Report to Byzantium\\", made Ramniceanu one of the very few Romanian artists to access the Western world during Nicolae Ceau≈üescu's Romania. This initiative received widespread coverage from the Greek media and the City of Athens received as a tribute Ramniceanu's \\"Byzantine Bell\\" - one of the most emblematic sculptures of the exhibition - that is now exhibited on Vassilissis Sofias Avenue as part of the city public art collection. Shortly after having taken part in the Romanian Revolution in December 1989, Ramniceanu was invited, by the French government and eventually established his studio in Paris in 1991. First a fellow of the French government, he became a resident of the Cit√© internationale des arts in 1992 and was awarded the French citizenship some years later. \\"I paint neither with tubes of paint nor with paintbrushes, I paint with the memory of things\\" Ramniceanu declared recently about his work, which has been exhibited widely in Paris and extensively abroad since the early 1990s in galleries such as Bernanos, Sandoz-Cit√© Internationale des Arts, Louis, FH Art Forum' and Visio Dell'Arte in Paris, Jardin de Lumi√®re in Belgium, HS Kunst in Germany, Uni- Terre in Geneva, and in numerous contemporary art fairs in Paris, in Istanbul, and in Dubai. Over the years, Ramniceanu has distinguished himself as one of the emblematic artists of the Romanian diaspora in Paris, as reflected by his being portrayed in several Romanian TV shows. In 1994, the vernissage of its major exhibition \\"The Shirts of the Wall\\" held at the Romanian Cultural Institute of Paris is broadcast by the Romanian television. The following year, he interviewed with Mihaela Cristea as part of her TV report on Romanian success stories in France and sit down with Monica Zvirjinski in her \\"top personalities\\" show. Some years later, in 2004, he interviewed with Vlad Nistor on Realitatea TV. One year after, the Romanian television dedicated Ramniceanu a special one-hour live biographical show where the artist discussed his art, work process, as well as his transition to the Paris art arena. The search of the \\"Universal Man\\" Dan HƒÉulicƒÉ described Ramniceanu's creative ambition in his critical essay entitled \\"Byzantium after Pollock\\" inspired to him by Ramniceanu's 2001 solo exhibition \\"Gaze at the Golden Nights\\" held in the Paris premises of F.H. Art Forum Gallery: \\"A Byzantium which has gone through the radical exclamation of blacks by Soulages or Kline, and by Pollock's vibratory expansion.\\" Ramniceanu's art cannot be simply categorized in any particular style, nor does it subscribe to a single artistic tradition. However Ramniceanu derives inspiration from a variety of sources, including the detail and refinement of Romanian embroideries, and the imagery of Orthodox artworks. The language of material plays an essential role in the work of Stefan Ramniceanu, most of whose pictures have a three- dimensional structure. For the past forty years, his work has been developing in a process of accumulation, mingling and reworking of themes, motifs and symbols which recur and overlap repeatedly in diverse media. Highly symbolic connections emerge from metal, concrete, wire and other heterogeneous materials. Numerous pastose layers of muted colors lend the surface of his paintings a relief-like structure and thus an almost sculptural plasticity. The artist has borrowed indeed vocabulary from the specifics of painting crossing the disciplines of photography, sculpture, where he now focuses his efforts. When provocation has been erected as a system in contemporary art, Ramniceanu's artistic position is to constantly question and expand the classical notion of sensibility. The artist defines this search as an accompaniment towards the figure of the \\"universal human\\", a new abstracted understanding of the figure. In 2014 a large-scale retrospective of his oeuvre is to be held at the Cultural Center of the Mogo≈üoaia Palace in Bucharest.

The Trophy The oak bust, displaying a picture of Sitting Bull, designed in 1953 after a suggestion by newspaperman Al Neuharth. The inspiration for the trophy was a minor 1953 dispute over which state was home to the final resting place of the famed chief, after it revealed that Sitting Bull's family members had exhumed and reinterred what they believed to be his remains, moving them from Fort Yates, North Dakota to Mobridge, South Dakota. In 2000, the Sitting Bull Trophy retired, amid the ongoing NCAA controversy over the use of Native American names and symbols by its member institutions. Future As of 2017, the two teams are currently not competing in the same conference, with North Dakota joining the Big Sky Conference and South Dakota joining the Missouri Valley Football Conference following the demise of Great West Conference football in 2011. 2012 also marked the first year the two teams did not play each other since the 1940s, when World War II interrupted the rivalry; however, they both played each other in 2016 and 2017 in non-conference play.

They can have positive and negative effects on transcription and are important in recruiting other transcription factors and histone modification enzymes as well as controlling DNA methylation. They were first discovered in 2002 as factors capable of binding to target sites on nucleosomal DNA in compacted chromatin and endowing competency for gene activity during hepatogenesis. Pioneer factors are involved in initiating cell differentiation and activation of cell-specific genes. This property is observed in histone fold-domain containing transcription factors (fork head box (FOX) and NF-Y) and other transcription factors that use zinc finger(s) for DNA binding (Groucho TLE, Gal4, and GATA). The eukaryotic cell condenses its genome into tightly packed chromatin and nucleosomes. This ability saves space in the nucleus for only actively transcribed genes and hides unnecessary or detrimental genes from being transcribed. Access to these condensed regions is done by chromatin remodelling by either balancing histone modifications or directly with pioneer factors that can loosen the chromatin themselves or as a flag recruiting other factors. Pioneer factors are not necessarily required for assembly of the transcription apparatus and may dissociate after being replaced by other factors. Active rearrangement Opening of condensed chromatin by a pioneer factor to initiate transcription. The pioneer factor binds to tightly packed chromatin and causes a nucleosomal rearrangement. This new configuration allows space for other transcription factors to bind and initiate transcription. Pioneer factors can also actively affect transcription by directly opening up condensed chromatin in an ATP-independent process. This is a common trait of fork head box factors (which contain a winged helix DNA- binding domain that mimics the DNA-binding domain of the linker H1 histone), and NF-Y (whose NF-YB and NF-YC subunits contain histone-fold domains similar to those of the core histones H2A/H2B). =Fork head box factors= The similarity to histone H1 explains how fork head factors are able to bind chromatin by interacting with the major groove of only the one available side of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome. Fork head domains also have a helix that confers sequence specificity unlike linker histone. The C terminus is associated with higher mobility around the nucleosome than linker histone, displacing it and rearranging nucleosomal landscapes effectively. This active re-arrangement of the nucleosomes allows for other transcription factors to bind the available DNA. In thyroid cell differentiation FoxE binds to compacted chromatin of the thyroid peroxidase promoter and opens it for NF1 binding. =NF-Y= NF-Y is a heterotrimeric complex composed of NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC subunits. The key structural feature of the NF-Y/DNA complex is the minor-groove interaction of its DNA binding domain-containing subunit NF-YA, which induces an ~80¬∞ bend in the DNA. NF-YB and NF-YC interact with DNA through non-specific histone-fold domain-DNA contacts. NF-YA's unique DNA- binding mode and NF-YB/NF-YC's nucleosome-like properties of non-specific DNA binding impose sufficient spatial constraints to induce flanking nucleosomes to slide outward, making nearby recognition sites for other transcription factors accessible. Passive factors An example of the cell ‚Äòpriming‚Äô for rapidly induced transcription. The pioneer factor, FoxA1 binds the enhancer in the first step but can not initiate transcription. Next when the signal, estrogen, is present the estrogen receptor can quickly find the ‚Äòbookmark‚Äô pioneer factor. When the estrogen receptor is bound transcription is initiated. Pioneer factors can function passively, by acting as a bookmark for the cell to recruit other transcription factors to specific genes in condensed chromatin. This can be important for priming the cell for a rapid response as the enhancer is already bound by a pioneer transcription factor giving it a head start towards assembling the transcription preinitiation complex. Hormone responses are often quickly induced in the cell using this priming method such as with the estrogen receptor. Another form of priming is when an enhancer is simultaneously bound by activating and repressing pioneer factors. This balance can be tipped by dissociation of one of the factors. In hepatic cell differentiation the activating pioneer factor FOXA1 recruits a repressor, grg3, that prevents transcription until the repressor is down-regulated later on in the differentiation process. In a direct role pioneer factors can bind an enhancer and recruit activation complex that will modify the chromatin directly. The change in the chromatin changes the affinity, decreasing the affinity of the pioneer factor such that it is replaced by a transcription factor that has a higher affinity. This is a mechanism for the cell to switch a gene on was observed with glucocorticoid receptor recruiting modification factors that then modify the site to bind activated estrogen receptor which was coined as a ‚Äúbait and switch‚Äù mechanism. Epigenetic effects Pioneer factor, PU.1, binding cell-specific gene regulation in hematopoietic differentiation. In hematopoietic stem cells PU.1 binds different lineage-specific enhancers and recruits histone modification enzymes that mark these enhancers with H3K4me1. These modified histones are then recognized by cell-specific transcription factors that activate genes leading to the differentiation of B-cells or macrophages. Pioneer factors can exhibit their greatest range of effects on transcription through the modulation of epigenetic factors by recruiting activating or repressing histone modification enzymes and controlling CpG methylation by protecting specific cysteine residues. This has effects on controlling the timing of transcription during cell differentiation processes. =Histone modification= Histone modification is a well-studied mechanism to transiently adjust chromatin density. Pioneer factors can play a role in this by binding specific enhancers and flagging histone modification enzymes to that specific gene. Repressive pioneer factors can inhibit transcription by recruiting factors that modify histones that further tighten the chromatin. This is important to limit gene expression to specific cell types and has to be removed only when cell differentiation begins. FoxD3 has been associated as a repressor of both B-cell and melanocytic cell differentiation pathways, maintaining repressive histone modifications where bound, that have to be overcome to start differentiation. Pioneer factors can also be associated with recruiting transcription-activating histone modifications. Enzymes that modify H3K4 with mono and di-methylation are associated with increasing transcription and have been shown to bind pioneer factors. In B cell differentiation PU.1 is necessary to signal specific histones for activating H3K4me1 modifications that differentiate hematopoietic stem cells into either the B-cell or macrophage lineage. FoxA1 binding induces HSK4me2 during neuronal differentiation of pluripotent stem cells as well as the loss of DNA methylation. =DNA methylation= Pioneer factors can also affect transcription and differentiation through the control of DNA methylation. Pioneer factors that bind to CpG islands and cytosine residues block access to methyltransferases. Many eukaryotic cells have CpG islands in their promoters that can be modified by methylation having adverse effects on their ability to control transcription. This phenomenon is also present in promoters without CpG islands where single cytosine residues are protected from methylation until further cell differentiation. An example is FoxD3 preventing methylation of a cytosine residue in Alb1 enhancer, acting as a place holder for FoxA1 later in hepatic as well as in CpG islands of genes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. For stable control of methylation state the cytosine residues are covered during mitosis, unlike most other transcription factors, to prevent methylation. Studies have shown that during mitosis 15% of all interphase FoxA1 binding sites were bound. The protection of cytosine methylation can be quickly removed allowing for rapid induction when a signal is present. =Other pioneer factors= A well studied pioneer factor family is the Groucho-related (Gro/TLE/Grg) transcription factors that often have a negative effect on transcription. These chromatin binding domains can span up to 3-4 nucleosomes. These large domains are scaffolds for further protein interactions and also modify the chromatin for other pioneer factors such as FoxA1 which has been shown to bind to Grg3. Transcription factors with zinc finger DNA binding domains, such as the GATA family and glucocorticoid receptor. The zinc finger domains do not appear to bind nucleosomes well and can be displaced by FOX factors. Role in cancer The ability of pioneer factors to respond to extracellular signals to differentiate cell type has been studied as a potential component of hormone-dependent cancers. Hormones such as estrogen and IGFI are shown to increase pioneer factor concentration leading to a change in transcription. Known pioneer factors such as FoxA1, PBX1, TLE, AP2, GATA factors 2/3/4, and PU.1 have been associated with hormone-dependent cancer . FoxA1 is necessary for estrogen and androgen mediated hepatocarcinogenesis and is a defining gene for ER+ luminal breast cancer, as is another pioneer factor GATA3. FOXA1 particularly is expressed in 90% of breast cancer metastases and 89% of metastic prostate cancers. In the breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, it was found that FoxA1 was bound to 50% of estrogen receptor binding sites independent of estrogen presence. High expression of pioneer factors is associated with poor prognosis with the exception of breast cancer where FoxA1 is associated with a stronger outcome. The correlation between pioneer factors and cancer has led to prospective therapeutic targeting. In knockdown studies in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line it was found that decreasing pioneer factors FoxA1 and AP2 decreased ER signalling. Other fork head proteins have been associated with cancer, including FoxO3 and FoxM that repress the cell survival pathways Ras and PPI3K/AKT/IKK. Drugs such as Paclitaxel, Imatinib, and doxorubicin which activate FoxO3a or its targets are being used. Modification to modulate related factors with pioneer activity is a topic of interest in the early stages as knocking down pioneer factors may have toxic effects through alteration of the lineage pathways of healthy cells.

Until 1801, there were two distinct posts, 'Organist' and 'Master of the Choristers', which were merged upon the appointment of James Target. Since the mid-nineteenth century, there has existed the role of Assistant Organist. Currently, the 'Organist and Master of the Choristers' is responsible for the direction of the choir and cathedral liturgy, and the 'Assistant Organist' accompanies the choir. The sacking of Chichester Cathedral in December 1642 caused all cathedral services to be suspended. They were not resumed until the restoration of the monarchy in 1661.

In 1909‚Äì1910 a new organ was built by Harrison & Harrison with the best parts of the old organ retained (approximately one-third of the stops being by Willis), and this has been maintained by the same company since. =Organists= *1416‚Äì1418 Walter Bagele (or Vageler) *1421‚Äì1422 Robert Cator *1428‚Äì1431 John Marshal *1437‚Äì1462 John Marchell *1461‚Äì1462 John Menyman (joint) *1461‚Äì1462 Richard Hygons (joint) *1497‚Äì1507 Richard Hygons *1507‚Äì1508 Richard Bramston *1508 John Clawsy (or Clavelleshay) *1514 William Mylwhard *1515‚Äì1531 Richard Bramston *1534‚Äì1538 John Smyth *1547‚Äì1554 Nicholas Prynne *1556‚Äì1557 John Marker *1558 Robert Awman *1559‚Äì1562 William Lyde *1563 Thomas Tanner *1568 Matthew Nailer *1587 John Clerk *1600 Thomas Hunt *1608 James Weare *1613‚Äì1614 Edmund Tucker *1614‚Äì1619 Richard Brown *1619‚Äì1642 John Oker (or Okeover) *1663‚Äì1674 John Brown *1674 Mr Hall *1674‚Äì1688 John Jackson *1688‚Äì1690 Robert Hodge *1690‚Äì1712 John George *1713‚Äì1726 William Broderip *1726 Joseph Millard *1727‚Äì1740 William Evans *1741 Jacob Nickells *1741‚Äì1771 John Broderip *1771‚Äì1773 Peter Parfitt *1773‚Äì1781 Robert Parry *1781‚Äì1820 Dodd Perkins *1820‚Äì1859 William Perkins *1859‚Äì1895 Charles Williams Lavington *1896‚Äì1899 Percy Carter Buck *1899‚Äì1933 Revd.

Early life A Mountain Battery ‚Äì in the mule-lines (Art.IWM ART LD 4229) Pressing Repairs (Art.IWM ART LD 4227) Luard was born in Calcutta, the son of a colonel in the Royal Engineers. Educated in England, and having won a place at the University of Oxford to study mathematics at Balliol, he decided instead to study art, and in 1892 enrolled at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, where his contemporaries included Augustus John and Ambrose McEvoy. He left the Slade in 1897 and then studied in Paris under Lucien Simon and Rene Menard. He moved to Paris in 1905 with his wife Louey and their baby daughter Veronica and, except for the war years, lived in the city for almost thirty years. In Paris he became well known for his paintings and drawings of large working horses. Two of his most notable paintings, Timberhauling on the Seine (1914) and Percherons at Water (1911), are from this period. World War I Lowes Luard enlisted in the British Army Service Corps in 1914, and served throughout the First World War, being awarded both the DSO, the Croix de Guerre and was mentioned in despatches five times. Even whilst serving in the army Luard continued to draw, usually charcoal studies of horses pulling heavy guns or other loads through mud. In 1922, the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Rouennais, in Rouen, exhibited eight paintings and pastels by Luard. Later life After the war Luard's interests broadened to include landscapes and seascapes. He moved to London in 1934 and became a regular visitor to the racecourse and stables at Newmarket, where he would often paint scenes of thoroughbred racehorses training on the gallops. In 1936 Faber and Faber published his book The Horse: Its Action and Anatomy, the first study of the skeleton, muscles and physiognomy of the horse since George Stubbs' treatise, The Anatomy of the Horse.

It was designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach.  History  The church is designed as a central building and was built in the years 1694‚Äì1702. Authority of the church and the seminary was the founder Prince Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun. The contract was carried out in 1694, the consecration of the partly unfinished church took place in 1699. The church, together with the same time build St. John's Church (hospital church) the first building designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach in Salzburg. He used as models various religious buildings in Rome‚Äîespecially Francesco Borromini's Church Sant'Agnese in Agone in Piazza Navona. While the church is characterized by a discreet use of decorative elements, the entire structure conveys a palatial impression. In addition to Fischer von Erlach and Bernhard Michael Mandl, who created the dome murals, the following sculptors and stonemasons also contributed: Wolf Wei√ükirchner, Mathias Wilhelm Wei√ükirchner, Sebastian Stumpfegger, Andreas G√∂tzinger, and Lorenz Dr√§xl.  Exterior  The construction of the Holy Trinity Church did not originally take place on Hannibal Square (present-day Makart Square), but on a narrow side street between the outer mountain road (present-day Rainerstra√üe) and the Linzergasse. The pawnshop situated directly opposite the church was demolished in 1907, leaving the elevated church forecourt facing Dreifaltigkeitsgasse, forming the upper end of the Makart Square. The original steeples were much lower than the present-day steeples, which were later increased for a better visibility of the church behind the pawnshop. The belfries were built in 1757, and the chief cupola towers were added after the fire of Neustadt in 1818. The overall image of the church was improved by the expanding of the towers. The church is the architectural center of a sprawling complex with the two great wings of the seminary forming a uniformly composed fa√ßade with the central church representing the powerful central drum dome of the church. The outer church portal is supported on the parapet in front of the dome on twin columns bearing four figures, three of which symbolize the theological virtues‚ÄîFaith, Hope, and Love. The fourth figure represents Divine Wisdom. All four characters have been designed by Bernhard Michael Mandl. Between the figures is the double coat of arms of the Prince Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun, connected to the Salzburger country coat of arms.  Interior  The church interior is a longitudinal oval room with four short barrel vaults with crossed arms, which are surmounted by the large drum dome. The monumental effect of the interior arises mainly from the simplicity of the building and the towering height of the dominant drum dome. The design is reminiscent of the inner shape of the Karlskirche in Vienna, which was the second sacral masterpiece by Fischer von Erlach. The large dome fresco inside the church, Coronation of the Virgin, was executed by Johann Michael Rottmayr between 1697 and 1700. It was Rottmayr's first sacral dome fresco and shows the Coronation of the Virgin by the Holy Trinity with the assistance of the Archangel Michael, as well as other saints, angels, prophets, the ten holy popes, and the Church patriarch. The fresco sums up the Christian salvation and church history impressively together. The figures are grouped in concentrically arranged cloud banks. At the top lantern a Holy Spirit dove is present. The large dome fresco completes the impression of Baroque ecclesia triumphans, the triumphant Church, within the meaning of Baroque self-understanding of the church building. The stucco work by Andrea Sallari and Johann Baptist Redi is limited in the main room to the capitals, and in the cross arms stucco boxes. The high altar was created in 1700 according to plans by Fischer von Erlach. It was revised in 1841, but was returned to its original state in 1947. The altar contains a sculptural group of the Trinity group with two adoring angels. The reliquary of St. Ernestus was designed in 1959 by Otto Prossinger. The two side altars contain magnificent life-size angels, which were designed by Fischer von Erlach and Michael Bernhard Mandl from 1700‚Äì02. The Marie miraculous image of the right side altar dates from the sixteenth century. The Baroque frame was carried out by Sebastian Stumpfegger.

It is a specific parasite of myrtle beech (Nothofagus cunninghamii) trees. History English botanist Miles Joseph Berkeley described the beech orange in 1848. In 1886, a New Zealand fungus similar to the beech orange was described as Cyttaria purdiei; later, however, the two species were assumed to be the same. A molecular study has now found the Australian and New Zealand fungi known as C. gunnii to be two distinct species. New Zealand populations are restricted to Nothofagus menziesii while the Australian ones are only found on Nothofagus cunninghamii and are hence found in southern Victoria and Tasmania. The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia records that \\"This edible fungus is found on the branches of Fagus Cunnittghamii, or native Beech. Tasmania.\\" The evolution of the genus parallels that of the host genus Nothofagus; hence C. septentrionalis, the closest relative, parasitises Antarctic beech (Nothofagus moorei), the closest relative of myrtle beech. Ancestors of the two species are thought to have diverged from the South American and New Zealand Cyttaria species between 28 and 44 million years ago. Appearance and uses The fungi form globose woody galls on their host trees, though they do not appear to spread through them. They are perennial and produce crops of fruit bodies annually. Said to resemble bunches of grapes, the fruit bodies appear in clusters in late spring and summer (November to January). Globular or pear-shaped, these can reach 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter. They are covered by a membrane that bursts, uncovering a network of concavities. The spore print is black and the spores measure 12 by 7‚Äì12 Œºm. Aborigines have used the fruit bodies as food. The fruits have a consistency akin to jelly and are reportedly pleasant-tasting.

He embarked on a political career, and was a Member of Parliament. Graham was born into the nobility, the younger son of a duke, and embarked on a naval career early in his life. Rising through the ranks, he was given his first commands early in the War of the Austrian Succession, and served in the Mediterranean and in escorting convoys. He entered parliament through the influence of his father, and represented the Scottish constituency of Stirlingshire from 1741 until his death. He was a Whig and a political supporter of the Duke of Argyll. Turning down the command of a ship of the line in favour of a frigate, Graham won renown for a victory over several powerful privateers and their prizes. Rewarded with a larger ship, he also commissioned a painting from William Hogarth to commemorate the event, Captain Lord George Graham in his Cabin. He continued in the navy, intercepting privateers and enemy ships, but was struck down with a severe illness, and despite moving ashore, died in 1747. Family and early life Lord George Graham was born on 26 September 1715, the son of James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose, and his wife Christian, the daughter of David Carnegie, 3rd Earl of Northesk. He entered the navy at an early age and served at first as a midshipman from 1730, and was promoted to lieutenant in 1734. He was given a command in 1739, when he was appointed to the fireship HMS Mercury and sent out to the Mediterranean to join Sir Nicholas Haddock's fleet. He held the command until 15 March 1740, when he was promoted to captain. He was appointed to command the 40-gun HMS Lark in 1741 with orders to escort a convoy of merchants bound for Turkey. He does not appear to have held the command long, for by late 1741 Lark was under the command of Captain Rupert Waring, escorting a convoy to the West Indies. Graham combined his naval career with a political one, and using the influence of his father, was returned for Stirlingshire as an opposition Whig in 1741. He was one of a number of Scottish MPs who gathered together under John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll to oppose the administration, and were known as the Duke of Argyll's gang. As part of this faction Graham voted against the administration in 1742 and 1744. He also spoke out against the decision to court-martial Admiral Thomas Mathews in the spring of 1745, defending him in a vigorous debate over his actions at the inconclusive Battle of Toulon. Command Graham was appointed to command the 60-gun in 1745, but turned it down, preferring an active cruising frigate to a ship of the line. He was instead offered the 24-gun HMS Bridgewater and cruised in the English Channel. While cruising in the Channel off Ostend on 2 July, in company with the 24-gun under Captain William Gordon, and the armed vessel Ursula under Lieutenant Fergusson, he came across three large privateers from Dunkirk, sailing in company with their prizes. The French privateers were the 28-gun Royal, 26-gun Duchesse de Penthierre, and a 12-gun dogger. They had taken seven prizes, and were taking them into Dunkirk. The British force attacked them early in the morning of 3 July. After a fierce fight lasting until 4.am, four of the prizes surrendered to the Sheerness, the Royal and Duchesse de Penthierre struck their colours to the Bridgewater, and the Ursula captured the remaining three prizes. The dogger managed to escape. For his success in the engagement, Graham was commended to the First Lord of the Admiralty, John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, and was given command of a larger ship, the 60-gun . =Hogarth's portrait= Captain Lord George Graham, 1715-47, in his Cabin Shortly after the engagement Graham commissioned William Hogarth to paint as a conversation picture a cabin portrait to celebrate his victory, probably using the cabin of the Nottingham as a setting. Hogarth painted Graham smoking his pipe in his cabin before dinner, while listening to pipe and tabor music played by his black servant, while his chaplain and clerk sing. Two dogs are visible, one is Graham's own, which joins in the singing. The other is Trump, Hogarth's dog, which is shown wearing Graham's wig, holding a scroll, and reading from a sheet of music propped against a wine glass. A steward, holding a plate of fowl, looks out of the painting at the viewer with a smile, and drops gravy down the back of the chaplain's neck. The painting has several political and social allusions in Hogarth's satirical style. Cabin scenes in oil are rare, and Hogarth's is considered by the current owner, the National Maritime Museum, to be the most famous in British art. =Last deployments= The Nottingham was attached to the fleet in the Downs under Admiral Edward Vernon that winter, and cruised with a squadron in the Bay of Biscay the following year. Some of Graham's later actions included the capture of the privateer Hermine on 29 September 1746, and the sinking of the privateer Bacchus. He was deployed off the north of Scotland in April 1746 to intercept any French vessels that might attempt to rescue survivors of the failed Jacobite rising, and so missed the political debates in parliament that month, though he was classed as a \\"new ally\\". Death and legacy Graham appears to have been taken ill during his time at sea, and he went ashore at Bristol. His brother, William Graham, 2nd Duke of Montrose came to meet him there in October, but Lord George Graham's health declined further, and he died at Bath on 2 January 1747. John Charnock concluded his biography of Graham with the observation that \\"from a multitude of concurrent testimonies he appears to have been an officer that attained a great share of popularity, and was indeed, very deservedly, the idol of all seamen who knew him, as well on the account of the high opinion entertained of his gallantry, of an invincible fund of good humour, which latter quality conciliated the affections of men in the same degree that the first related excited their admiration and esteem.\\" His group portrait by Hogarth survived him, and is now held in the collections of the National Maritime Museum. Notes a. It has been difficult to determine which son he was. The Dictionary of National Biography and John Charnock's Biographia Navalis state he was the fourth son, while Sedgwick's The History of Parliament instead has him as the seventh. A number of other sons appear to have died in infancy, and Lord George was one of the few to reach adulthood. b. Some sources, such as Charnock's Biographia Navalis and John Knox Laughton in the Dictionary of National Biography have the promotion accompanied by an appointment to command the 40-gun on the Newfoundland station as Commodore-Governor. Winfield's British Warships in the Age of Sail considers the appointment to Adventure \\"unlikely\\", noting that by 1740 Adventure was a hulk. The website of Government House, Newfoundland and Labrador, dismisses the claim that Graham was governor, noting that there is \\"no evidence to support this appointment\\", and that the governor in 1740 was Henry Medley.

A conversational picture, it shows Captain Lord George Graham, of the Royal Navy, in the cabin of his ship with several people. The painting was probably commissioned by Graham to commemorate a naval battle he had fought recently. While commanding a 24-gun sixth rate, he had been one of three British ships to attack a squadron of three powerful French privateers and their prizes. The British were successful in their engagement, capturing all of the prizes, and all but one of the privateers. Lauded for his achievements, Graham was given another, larger, ship to command. The painting is probably set aboard this new command, the 60-gun , and shows Graham relaxing in the great cabin before a meal, smoking a pipe. With him are the ship's chaplain and clerk, who sing and listen to music played by a black servant. A steward brings a roast duck to the table. Two dogs are also present in the scene, one joins in the singing, the other wears a wig and reads a sheet of music. The scene contains elements of satire and symbolism, in common with Hogarth's other works. The relaxed scene contrasts the tension of the naval battle it commemorates, with elements of humour including the officious pose and behaviour of one of the dogs, who apes Graham's official position. The steward looks out of the painting at the viewer with a smile, while obliviously tipping gravy down the chaplain's back. The positioning and depiction of Graham and the black servant invite comparisons, with Hogarth's presentation of black subjects in paintings being studied by later academics. Hogarth drew from his own experience in group portraits, and was probably influenced by an earlier cabin work by Bartolomeo Nazari. Graham's enjoyment of the painting was short-lived, he died in 1747. His family kept the portrait in their collections until 1932, when it was sold to Sir James Caird, who subsequently donated it to the National Maritime Museum, where it remains. Background Lord George Graham was a younger son of James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose, and had entered the Royal Navy at a young age. He served with some distinction during the wars of the early eighteenth century, and also entered politics, sitting as member of parliament through his father's interest. He was appointed to command the 24-gun in 1745 and cruised in the English Channel. While cruising in the Channel off Ostend on 2 July, in company with the 24-gun under Captain William Gordon, and the armed vessel Ursula under Lieutenant Fergusson, Graham came across three large privateers from Dunkirk, sailing in company with their captured prize vessels. The French privateers were the 28-gun Royal, 26-gun Duchesse de Penthierre, and a 12-gun dogger. They had captured seven prizes, and were taking them into Dunkirk. The British force attacked them early in the morning of 3 July. After a fierce fight lasting until 4.am, four of the prizes surrendered to the Sheerness, the Royal and Duchesse de Penthierre struck their colours to the Bridgewater, and the Ursula captured the remaining three prizes. The dogger managed to escape. The subject of the portrait, Captain Lord George Graham, leans against the table, holding a pipe For his success in the engagement, Graham was commended to the First Lord of the Admiralty, John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, and was given command of a larger ship, the 60-gun . He probably commissioned a portrait from Hogarth at about this time, and the resulting painting is believed to be set aboard Graham's new command, which in late 1745 was on the Downs station. Positioning Trump, who represents his master in the portrait Graham is seated to the right of the picture, on the left of the table that divides the picture. He is seen in full length, facing forwards though looking to the side, while smoking a long pipe. Standing to Graham's right, his lower half obscured by the table cloth, a man holds a sheet of music and is in the act of singing. The third member of the dining party is seated on the left of the painting, and like Graham is visible in full length. Ronald Paulson identifies them as the ship's clerk and chaplain. The music the men are listening or singing along to is provided by a black manservant, standing on the right of the painting and playing a pipe and tabor. A steward stands opposite him on the left of the painting, framing the composition. The steward holds a plate of roast duck, but looks out of the painting towards the viewer with a smile, while gravy drips from the plate down the back of the chaplain's coat. The remaining members of the portrait are two dogs. One is Graham's own, sitting at the chaplain's feet and apparently joining in the singing. The other, sat on his haunches on a chair on the right of the painting, is Hogarth's own pug, Trump. Trump, his tongue lolling out and wearing Graham's wig, holds a scroll and appears to read from his own sheet of music, balanced against a wine glass in front of him. Clothing The men are well dressed, Graham smokes a pipe while wearing a fur-lined red velvet cape and a red velvet cap which is slightly askew. The grey coat he wears with a white neckerchief is opened at the chest, revealing a gold-brocade waistcoat, his lower half is clothed in breeches, stockings and slippers. The chaplain wears a black coat with a white collar, grey stockings and black shoes with gold buckles, the costume of a social inferior to Graham, but indicating his educated status. The clerk's dress is similarly simple, a brown jacket, bluish-green waistcoat and white collar, while the steward wears a white apron, smock and cap with a black collar, and brown trousers. The black servant's dress is richer, a white cap and pink neckerchief, and a green buttoned velvet coat with a yellow waistcoat. Trump wears Graham's wig. The colours of the painting are mostly of cool greys, blues and reds, with the brown of some of the clothes and the wooden pilaster panelling, and the lighter blue through the window on the left of the painting. Imagery and symbolism The black servant on the right of the painting plays a pipe and tabor. Below, Hogarth's pug dog Trump balances on a chair while wearing Graham's wig. Hogarth included numerous elements in the painting. The scene is probably the great cabin of Graham's latest command, and the sails of ships are visible through the line of windows on the left of the painting. The furniture and objects are luxurious and the room is richly panelled and decorated. The chaplain holds a ledger and at his feet is a large famille-rose punch bowl, the punch bowl being an invitation to the viewer to join the levity at the table. He is separated from Graham across the table by a salt- cellar, possibly symbolising their social difference. His presence at the captain's table for this informal occasion nevertheless indicates that he is a privileged member of Graham's entourage. The clerk, standing in the centre of the portrait and uniting the two-halves, holds the music he is singing from, possibly entitled 'Farewell my Judy'. Jeremy Barlow speculates that this might be a sentimental love song. The two servants frame the picture, the black servant playing a pipe and tabor. The combination of these musical instruments had a popular accompaniment to dancing for several centuries, but was in decline in England by the eighteenth century. Barlow considers Hogarth's representation of the tabor pipe a poor one, arguing that it is too short and has too many holes to be the usual three-holed tabor pipe, the boy holds it too far up its length and does not cover all the holes. Barlow points out that Hogarth may have intended the instrument to be a flabiol instead. He also notes that the lively music the instruments would have produced would be unlikely to complement a sentimental ballad that the clerk appears to be singing, and instead suggests the painting combines and conflates a number of typical activities in the cabin into one scene. The dogs join the people, their inclusion with the servants in the portrait invites commentary on Graham's circle. Trump's officious pose and lolling tongue, while wearing Graham's wig and brandishing the scroll of paper, makes light of the formality of Graham's position. Trump represents Hogarth in the painting, while his pose with the scroll, as used by musical conductors of the time, suggest that he may be the humorous conductor for the music and singing taking place. The steward stands at the left of the painting under a hanging crown compass, and carelessly drips gravy down the chaplain's neck, adding a final element of farce to the setting. In the relaxed and informal setting of the cabin, adding touches of humour and foolishness, Hogarth provides a contrast with the dangers of the pitched battle that the painting commemorates. The black servant in the painting reveals Hogarth's careful study of black and white forms. His positioning, clothes and stance echoes Graham's with his pipe, but they face different directions so as to present different profiles. The red of Graham's cape connects with the colour of the servant's neckcloth, while their similar caps, coats and waistcoats heighten the sense of connection, with the servant given equally colourful and variegated clothing. The facial features and textures are similar, showing off their youthfulness, while Graham's fair skin and the servant's dark skin complement and contrast each other. Hogarth has also varied the appearance of the dark skin to show that the colour is not uniform, but changes in the light. Art historian David Bindman argued that Hogarth's representation of the servant avoided the traditional stereotypes of black people in art. Influences Gustavus Hamilton, 2nd Viscount Boyne, and Friends in a Ship's Cabin, 1731-2, by Bartolomeo Nazari. Lord Boyne is depicted on board a ship while making a Grand Tour, accompanied by Sir Francis Dashwood, Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle and Lord Middlesex. The piece probably influenced Hogarth's work. It is unknown whether the idea for the setting came from Graham or Hogarth, though Hogarth had already produced a similarly composed conversational piece for John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey, entitled Lord Hervey and His Friends. Hogarth reworked the concept for a naval setting, though he probably also drew inspiration from a 1732 painting by Bartolomeo Nazari. Nazari produced a similar cabin scene showing Lord Boyne and his companions during a voyage to Lisbon from Venice. A number of elements, such as the hanging compass, punch bowl, and the presence of animals, were included in Hogarth's work. Nazari's work had been popular, resulting in a large number of copies, and Hogarth knew Boyne, having painted his portrait. Ownership Graham did not enjoy his portrait for long, dying on 2 January 1747. The painting remained in the collections of the Dukes of Montrose and was exhibited on a number of occasions; at Glasgow in 1888, the Royal Naval College in 1891 and at the Royal Academy in 1934. It was purchased by Sir James Caird in 1932, and was a particular favourite of his. It was later presented to the National Maritime Museum, where it remains today. Cabin scenes are rare in oil painting, and the museum considers this to be the most famous example in British art.

In Crumpsall , its name changes to Bury Old Road. It is lined with churches, mosques, synagogues and temples, as well as terraced houses. Route Cheetham Hill Road and Bury Old Road are part of the designated A665. Cheetham Hill Road starts at the junction of the A6042 Corporation Street and the A665 Miller Street. It crosses the culverted River Irk to the east of Victoria Station. At its junction with New Bridge Street, it turns north-northeast and is straight for 1 km, to the A6010 Queen's Road (east side). This stretch was called York Street until about 1900. Cheetham Hill Road leads from here to the community of Cheetham Hill, where at Bourget Street and Crescent Road (formerly Sandy Lane), Cheetham Hill Road becomes Bury Old Road. This is the boundary between Manchester and Salford, and between postcodes M8 and M7. To the north-west is Crumpsall and to the south-east is Broughton Park. It crosses the A567 Middleton Road and passes into Prestwich, in the M25 postcode area. To the east is Heaton Park, and to the west Heaton Park Metrolink station. Bury Old Road passes over the M60 motorway and under the Bury metrolink tram line at Besses o' th' Barn Metrolink station. At Whitefield Bury Old Road joins with A56 Bury New Road, the 1827 toll road that was built to replace it. Bury New Road is a feeder to junction 17 of the M60 (formerly M62), the trans-Pennine motorway and, here, the Manchester ring road. History Roman Manchester ran from the castrum (fort) at the Medlock crossing in Castlefield, along Deansgate to the crossing of the River Irk at the foot of Red Bank. Cheetham Hill Road starts at the River Irk crossing. The course of the Roman road has not been determined, though it is likely that there was a path that followed Red Bank up the sandstone river cliff following the gentle gradient that was preferred by draught animals. Cheetham, with its other spelling Chetham is an interesting name, the first syllable is a Celtic pre-Roman given name, while the suffix ham, meaning settlement has a Mercian or Northumbrian post-Roman name. Almost all Manchester placename are post-Roman; this implies that Cheetham was of sufficient importance in Roman times for the Celtic name to survive. . In the Middle Ages, the land was ceded to Roger de Midleton who leased it to Henry de Chetham. A descendant was Humphrey Chetham who was born at Crumpsall Hall in 1580. Crumpsall Hall, which stood at the junction of Cheetham Hill Road, Sandy Lane (Crescent Road) and Humphrey Street, was demolished in 1825. A new Crumpsall Hall was built in Crumpsall Park 300m away. Another important estate was Stocks, at the corner of Elizabeth Street and Cheetham Hill Road. At Stocks, the main road into Manchester passed by North Street and Red Bank and over the bridge into Long Millgate. A new road called York Street cut through from here to New Bridge Street and the Miller Street-Corporation Street junction. York Street was renamed Cheetham Hill Road around the turn of the nineteenth century due to the large number of York Streets in central Manchester. York Street and its parallel streets were a planned development with elements of a gridiron structure. In the late 1830s, the very wealthy were living in villas in Crumpsall, leaving the a range of relatively cheap and spacious houses along York Street that were ideal for the traders with retail properties in town, and along Deansgate. The Jewish community had expanded into retailing-taking the skill of the hawker into fixed shops. Jacob Frank, an optician, opened a shop at 114 Deansgate, where 8 of his 11 sons became opticians: the three others moved away to open different shops in Leeds and Hull. Benjamin Hyam, who opened his Pantechnethica at 26 Market Street in April 1841 moved to Higher Broughton. Successful retailers moved from garrets above their shops in town to the new inner suburbs. Joseph Braham moved onto York Street in 1841 and bought other houses which he tenanted with his co-religionists. By 1845 there were 12 Jewish retailers living along York Street or close by. In 1858, two synagogues opened on York Street, the Great Synagogue and the Reformed Synagogue. A classic hawker to shop trader story is that of Joseph and Adelina Davis who left Chodziez in NE Poland in 1857 and came with their children Nathan, Aaron, Elkan, David and Theresa to Manchester where they started out hawking jewellery all around the north of England. Later, they established Davis jewellers shop in Deansgate. Two of Elkan's sons, Louis Henry Davis and Michael Joseph Davis, ran an antiques business on Long Millgate and lived at 453 Cheetham Hill Road. In July 1933, their Manchester-born sister Frances (Fanny) Levin (nee Davis), and her two adult daughters were living with them in that Large, red-brick semi detached house. At that time, Frances was separated from her Dublin-resident husband, Nathan Levin. Tragically, on the extremely hot afternoon of Wednesday 19 July 1933, Frances was unwell and was lying down to rest on the sofa in the front lounge, when she was brutally attacked by someone who used an iron bar taken from the kitchen grate. She died of her injuries later that evening at the Jewish Memorial Hospital. A homeless former sailor, Billy Burtoft, was convicted of her murder and was executed at Strangeways prison, but, according to research carried out by local author Denise Beddows in her book 'The Cheetham Hill Murder - A Convenient Killing?', Burtoft was almost certainly innocent of the crime. 453 Cheetham Hill Road was demolished in 1958 and, the Cheetham Hebrew Congregation Synagogue was built on the site but this later became the Al-Hirah centre, housing a travel agent, immigration law centre and beauty parlour.

He was educated at the Diocesan College in Rondebosch, and in 1885 married Georgina Bain, daughter of Thomas Charles John Bain, the roadbuilder and engineer. Lister joined South African forestry during a period when commercial plantations of exotic timbers were being established and expanded on a large scale. Fresh from Punjab and the Indian Forest Service, he was appointed in 1875 as Superintendent of Plantations and based in Cape Town. Remarkably he was also selected to be custodian of Langalibalele, who had been banished to Robben Island after a mock trial by the British authorities for his part in a Zulu rebellion, and Cetewayo, deposed and exiled, first to Cape Town, and then to London for his role in the Anglo-Zulu War. Lister soon came to understand the urgent need for growing exotic timbers which would reduce the pressure on indigenous species, and started by establishing at Worcester in 1876 a plantation of fast-growing Eucalypts to supply fuel for the railways. De Beers bought the Worcester plantation in 1892, and this sale resulted in a profit of some ‚Ç§60/acre, stimulating a wave of afforestation. Lister also planted the Tokai Arboretum against the slopes of Constantiaberg outside Cape Town in 1885 - an experimental stand of some 1555 trees representing 274 species of commercially promising trees including oaks, eucalypts and Californian Redwood. Between 1902 and 1903 he organised Forest Departments for Zululand and Natal, and for the Orange River Colony. In 1906 he established the South African Forestry School at Tokai in order to train men for the higher grades of forest service, and in 1912 the School started training foresters. Twenty years later in 1932 the training of foresters was moved to Saasveld Forestry College near George and was known as the 'Saasveld College for Foresters'. In 1910 Lister became the first Chief Conservator of Forests for the newly constituted Union of South Africa.Immelman, W.F.E., C.L. Wicht, & D.P. Ackerman. 1973. Our Green Heritage: The South African Book of Trees. Tafelberg. . In 1877, Lister turned his attention to driftsand reclamation at Bellville near Cape Town, where sand was threatening both the road and railway line to the north. He arranged for the town refuse to be spread over the dunes and then planted Acacia cyclops and Acacia cyanophylla between - this stopped movement of the sand and created a valuable source of fuel. In 1893 he carried out the same reclamation program at Port Elizabeth with complete success. The Port Elizabeth suburb of Listerwood was named in his honour, and a small stone monument, next to Marine Drive in Summerstrand, was built as a memorial.Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa (NASOU, 1972) Lister retired in 1913 having rendered 38 years of distinguished service.

The two crosses have been designed with the same solution, two bridges of about 164 ft (50 m) total light elastically with a single flush vain in their stirrups (solution integral). The bridges allow for a generous platform 13 ft (4 m) useful for pedestrian and bicycle use.  Construction  Materials GFRP The design concept is based on three basic ideas: the use of light-weight materials, the use of materials free of maintenance such as stainless-steel and GFRP (Fiberglass) and minimalism approach (sober and elegant forms and clean lines, creating a bridge with a clearly identity but not dominating the beautiful port environment). The two bridges have a main longitudinal span of 148 ft (45,2 m) and a width-deck of 13 ft (4 m). The structures are built-in on both abutments. The cross-section consists of two supported Vierendeel trusses combined with double-sheets of GFRP as structural webs. The height of the trusses is variable being 11 ft (3,4 m) at the elastomeric support and 3 ft (1,2 m) at mid-span.

Thankappan, The Growth and Development of Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, pp. 12-19j, Oxford University Press, . History The East India Company obtained from the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar, in 1717, the right to rent from 38 villages surrounding their settlement. Of these 5 lay across the Hooghly in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side. After the fall of Siraj-ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, it purchased these villages in 1758 from Mir Jafar and reorganised them. These villages were known en-bloc as Dihi Panchannagram and Shealdah was one of them.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, first published 1909/reprint 1980, pages 103-4 and 221, General Printers and Publishers Pvt.

In 1756, when Siraj-ud-daulah attacked the English at Calcutta, a major part of his troops and artillery crossed the Maratha Ditch in Sealdah.Sinha, Pradip, Siraj‚Äôs Calcutta 1756-57, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, p. 8. There was hard fighting here with 39 English soldiers and 18 Indian sepoys killed on the spot. The English dragged their guns through the rice fields. Baithakkana was a resting place, where merchants formed and dispersed their caravans, sheltered by an old banyan tree (called a peepul tree by Cotton). Job Charnock is said to have chosen the site of Kolkata for a city, in consequence of the pleasure he found in sitting and smoking under the shade of a large tree.

Westmill Solar Co-operative is the industrial and provident society that owns the Westmill Solar Park in Oxfordshire, England, believed to be the largest community-owned photovoltaic power station in the world. Project The project was originally conceived by Adam Twine, the pioneer behind the neighbouring Westmill Wind Farm Co-operative, built in 2011 and registered for the UK feed-in tariffs. It has a capacity of 5 MWP. Westmill Solar Co- operativie acquired the solar park in October 2012, under an option agreement with the original developers. It raised the necessary finance through public and private share offers and a senior debt bond with a pension fund. Westmill Solar Park Westmill solar park is in the United Kingdom located on a site of 30 acres near to Watchfield, on the Wiltshire/Oxfordshire border, just off the A420. The site adjoins that of the Westmill Wind Farm Co- operative. The solar power plant has over 21,000 solar panels and has been operational since July 2011. When acquired by the Co-operative, it was the largest community-owned photovoltaic power station in the world. Co- operative membership and equity Visitors at a Westmill Solar Co-operative Open Day at Westmill Solar Park. The Co-operative invited members through a public share offer, launched in June 2012. Despite the tight timetable caused by the expiry date on the option, the issue was 50% over-subscribed, when it closed at the end of July. This raised ¬£4m from c. 1,650 members. An additional c. ¬£2m was raised by a private placement of B-Shares, mainly from members who had subscribed to the original issue. Other financing The Co- operative raised the balance of funding required in the form of a 23¬Ω-year senior debt bond. This was arranged with the Lancashire County Council Pension Fund, in what was believed to be the first major funding by a local authority in community-owned energy infrastructure.

He is best known as the principal political cartoonist for the South China Morning Post (SCMP). However he also illustrates children's books and provides satirical cartoons to many journals in the South China area. Biography Harry Harrison was born in England, but because his father was in the Air Force, he travelled, spending time in Libya and Singapore as well as Britain. He left school at 16 and took up a junior position in a supermarket, moving through a variety of careers and finally into illustration. In 1994 he moved from England to Hong Kong where he now lives on Lamma Island. Harry plays part-time in a band called the Yung Shue Wan Curs - a play on words relating to the village, Yung Shue Wan, near which he lives. Cartoons Harry Harrison is probably best known for his daily cartoons in the SCMP which have appeared since 2001. He is the principal cartoonist for the paper, his work appearing six days a week. Harry collaborates with Sarah Brennan on children's books. His most prominent works include a series on Chinese zodiac animals such as Oswald Ox, Run Run Rat and Temujin the Tiger. He is also the illustrator of the 'Dirty Story' series. His works have appeared in a variety of journals such as The Guardian, Time magazine, Asia Wall Street Journal, International Finance Review, and Far Eastern Economic Review. Harrison has won many awards for his work including top Editorial Cartooning recognition at the Society of Publishers in Asia Editorial Awards 2012 and special prize for a body of work at the Hong Kong 14th Human Rights Press Awards. Relationship to the author Harry is commonly confused with the science fiction author of the same name. The Guardian newspaper in the UK printed a cartoon by Harry Harrison 16 February 2008 edition, along with the caption, \\"Harry Harrison is a comics artist, writer and editor specialising in science fiction. His book Make Room! Make Room! was adapted for the cult film Soylent Green.\\" A correction and clarification was published three days later. Influences Carl Giles and Ronald Searle are quoted as significant role models. In particular Ronald Searle has been a major influence on him because of the 'darkness' associated with his work. Harry attributes this dark edge to Searle's near-death experiences as a POW in the Second World War.

It was founded by leaders of the former Internal Macedonian Adrianople Revolutionary Organization, who did not participate into the new Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) founded by Todor Alexandrov after the First World War. It supported the creation of a federal Macedonian state within a future Balkan Federation, which concept was similar to the ideas proclaimed by the Balkan Communist Federation at that time. In 1924 Alexandrov several times spoke with Petar Atsev, then president of the organization, on the occasion of a growing communist propaganda among its members. In 1924 Aleksandrov was killed, but as participants in the conspiracy against him were suspected the leaders of the Ilinden organization. Subsequently, many of them became victims of the Gorna Dzhumaya events and the subsequent fratricidal killings among the IMRO factions. In the following years Ilinden organization was primarily engaged in cultural and educational activities. The organization was formally dissolved after the military coup d'√©tat from 19 May 1934, but it continued its existence. After the accession of most of the Vardar Macedonia to Bulgaria in April 1941, the organization created there its branches. After the coup d'√©tat from 9 September 1944 a new leadership was elected, loyal to the Communist government. On 15 June 1947 the communist authorities disbanded the organization.

To be sure, Borgesian influence is still unmistakable, but only in the background: the novel, as a whole, is animated by the author's own meticulous and in-depth study of Yi Sang, the Korean existentialist writer of the 1930s who produced some of the most exotic and complex stories in Korean literary history. Goodbye, Yi Sang is concerned with the question of truth and of existence as well as the very definition of literature which, in Kim's view, are not mutually exclusive. ‚ÄúThe reason why I write,‚Äù the author has said,‚Äù is to find out whether the truth does indeed exist in the act of writing.\\"ÍπÄÏó∞Ïàò \\" LTI Korea Datasheet: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# ‚Äù When I Was Still A Child, which first appeared in serial form, is a collection of stories based on his childhood and adolescence.

Blending alternative rock with continental jazz and Balkan music, their music frequently incorporates Gothic themes and has been described as Gypsy Jazz Noir. History Adopted as Holograph was originally formed in 2009 by former Uncle John & Whitelock and Cannon guitarist, David Philp. After touring with Isobel Campbell & Mark Lanegan in 2008, Philp enlisted Andrew Gifford (Fiddlers' Bid, Cannon) on double bass and Tom Pettigrew (Cannon) on violin. The band gigged as a three piece for the next year before adding Hussy and the Wolf band members Caroline Hussey and Ryan Buchanan respectively on accordion and guitar, and Chris Houston on drums. The band's name is a term from Scots law concerning documents like wills (where \\"holograph\\" means signature ). The phrase was removed from legal usage in 1995 as part of a modernisation of archaic jargon. The band toured the UK festival circuit in 2011 and were featured in session on Mary Ann Kennedy's Global Gathering show on BBC Radio Scotland in April 2012. Influenced by Eastern European music, 1950s Rock and Roll and Gypsy Jazz, they have a style that has been described as Gypsy Jazz Noir and as having a \\"vaguely eastern/klezmer-y feel\\", and their music has drawn broad comparisons with The Doors, The Divine Comedy, Tindersticks and The Monochrome Set. Their eponymous debut album, Adopted as Holograph, was released in January, 2013 and received positive reviews.

Seuthes III was the King of the Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace from c. 331 to c. 300 BC and founder of the nearby Thracian city of Seuthopolis. It is one of the most elaborate tombs in the Valley of the Thracian Rulers. Design The tomb has an impressive fa√ßade, an unusual 13m long entry corridor and three consecutive spacious rooms. The first room is rectangular and has a rainbow-shaped, double-pitched roof. A horse had been sacrificed in this chamber. The next room is circular and domed, while the third room is carved in a huge stone block and has double-pitched covering (resembling a sarcophagus). Inside, there is a modeled funeral bed.

History The school was founded by Adrian Stokes and Richard Arnold Jones in 1961 with patronage of The Bishop of Portsmouth. and with a Board of Governors chaired by Thomas Shaw, 3rd Baron Craigmyle. A later chairman was William O'Brien.Schools, Volume 45; Volume 50; Volume 52.

Ministry of Education H.M.S.O., 1963 . page 44An account of the opening of the School. The Ampleforth Journal, Volume 72. Page 255 The school was dedicated to the 40 English Martyrs, whose names were given to the houses and dormitories. The school crest depicted the martyr's crown and palm leaves. After the Second World War, there was an increased demand for Catholic education. In the private sector, the Catholic preparatory and public schools were often oversubscribed. When Redrice opened in 1961 it was the first entirely lay-run Catholic public school. Originally, there was a planned limit of 200 boarders. A pupil could start after passing the Common Entrance examination, and end after taking 'A' levels. That five- year period, and through the use of streaming, gave an average class size of fewer than 15 pupils. In 1969, the school began to admit girls. The name changed in 1980 from 'Redrice School' to 'Redrice College' to assist in marketing the school abroad. The school closed in 1982, and the premises were taken over by Farleigh School. The school's former pupils are named 'old martyrs'. Annual reunion dinners take place in London. In February 2013, there were over 140 ex-pupils connected in a Facebook group for ex-pupils and staff. This Roman Catholic boarding school had the motto Alta Patens (English: 'Aiming High'). Building and grounds Some trees were removed to create space for rugby and cricket fields. New buildings were built onto the existing building to accommodate classrooms and dormitories. Some attempts were made to convert an ornamental water garden into a swimming pool. A new house was built in the grounds as accommodation for one of the headmasters (Adrian Stokes) and his family.From accounts given in the Redrice School annual magazines.

Early life and education Harold G. Clarke was born in Forsyth, Georgia on September 28, 1927 to Jack H. and Ruby Lumpkin Clarke. He attended Mary Persons High School, before enlisting in the United States Army, at age 17, during the final years of World War II. While in the service, he worked as a journalist, quickly rising to the position of managing editor of Pacific Stars And Stripes. After the war, with help from the G.I. bill, Clarke enrolled in the University of Georgia, where he earned a bachelor's degree, then a law degree. He then returned to his hometown of Forsyth, to set up his law practice. In addition to practicing law, Clarke continued his earlier work as a journalist when he took on the added duties of editor and publisher of the Monroe Advertiser, a local paper owned by his father. Political career Clarke served five terms as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives. First elected in 1960, he took office in January 1961 under the county unit system representing Monroe County as representative from the 33rd district. After the abolition of the county unit system, the 33rd district was expanded to include Butts County. Clarke was a member of the Democratic party, and served during a 10-year period when the Georgia General Assembly began transitioning from a body comprised almost exclusively of Democrats to one with a growing number of Republicans. Judicial career After serving in the legislature, Clarke returned to the full-time practice of law. In 1976 he was elected president of the State Bar of Georgia. During his tenure as Bar president, he challenged lawyers to improve their work and better themselves. In 1979, Georgia Governor George Busbee appointed Clarke to the Georgia Supreme Court, where he served as Associate Justice until 1990. In 1990 he was elected by his colleagues to the position of 22nd Chief Justice, which he held until June 1992 when he stepped down, to allow his friend Justice Charles L. Weltner, who was battling cancer, to serve the last few months of his life as Chief Justice. When Justice Weltner died in August 1992, Clarke resumed the position of 22nd Chief Justice, until 1994. He has been described as one of the most influential jurists in state history. In 1985, he published a book: Remembering Forward, about growing up in a small Southern town in the 1930s and 1940s.

With a ten-day extension agreed by Sultan Abdul Hamid II, it was dissolved on 28 June. Article 119 of the constitution required a new electoral law to be in place by the time of the second elections. However, although it had been passed by the Chamber of Deputies, it was still under discussion by the Senate, and had not become law, so the election was held in accordance with the previous system. The Provisional Electoral Regulations issued on 29 October 1876 stated that the elected members of the Provincial Administrative Councils would elect MPs.

J Street U web J Street U was founded in 2009. History J Street U logo, 2007‚Äì2016 In 2009, J Street's staff sought to enlarge and improve the organization with the addition of a 501(c)(3) grassroots organizing component. As college campuses are traditionally hotspots of organizing and action, J Street investigated the possibility of incorporating a student arm. However, rather than create an organization from scratch, J Street opted to absorb the Union of Progressive Zionists (UPZ), an organization active on campuses like the University of Michigan, Washington University, and several others. They renamed the organization J Street U and hired a director, Daniel May, and deputy director, Ira Stup. In 2014, J Street hired former deputy director Sarah Turbow to serve as director of J Street U.http://jstreet.org/about/staff In 2015, J Street U elected University of Maryland senior Amna Farooqi as president‚Äìthe first time a primarily Jewish pro-Israel group in the U.S. had elected a Muslim or non- Jewish person as its leader.

Each region is run by students with the assistance of a full-time regional organizer. Regional organizers are currently based out of offices in Boston, New York, Washington, Chicago and San Francisco, facilitating chapter creation and maintenance. Criticism and controversy In October 2013, J Street U was denied membership to the Jewish Student Union at University of California, Berkeley, for the second time. Some students said they would feel uncomfortable if J Street U were admitted to the Jewish Student Union; the Jewish Student Union president said, \\"A lot of people have said that they want the (Jewish Student Union) to stay a place they feel comfortable saying they love Israel.\\" Shayna Howitt, J Street U‚Äôs national communications co-chair, on the other hand, noted that J Street U is not anti-Israel simply because it is critical of its government's approaches occupied territories‚Äì‚ÄúThe best way to support Israel is not by refusing to talk about the politics that are often uncomfortable and scary ‚Äî it‚Äôs by addressing those politics.‚Äù In early 2014, 129 alumni signed a letter urging Berkeley Hillel to be more open to varied views on Israel, and suggesting that the Jewish Student Union become an ‚ÄúOpen Hillel,‚Äù rejecting some of the constraints on free speech embodied in the rules upheld by Hillel International Headquarters (see Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life).UC Berkeley alumni urge Berkeley Hillel to welcome more views on Israel policy The Daily Cal, 24 February 2014 In 2014, Boston University Hillel at first rejected J Street as an affiliate, and then at the end of the year, reversed its decision. The B.U. Hillel chapter acknowledged that some students were uncomfortable overturning the initial decision, but issued an official statement in The Daily Free Press: ‚ÄúAt the present time, it is critical for our students to set aside their differences and come together under the idea that we, in the end, are pro-Israel.

Fingerhut issued a statement saying he had withdrawn out of ‚Äúconcerns regarding my participation amongst other speakers who have made highly inflammatory statements against the Jewish state.‚Äù Several people involved in US Jewish student life noted that in an era when the number of Jewish students engaging with Jewish and Israel-related campus groups is shrinking, it might be unproductive to alienate the 3,000 participants in the J Street conference, a population that included 40 Hillel professionals, and that HIllel donor pressure was the likely cause of Fingerhut's withdrawal.Hillel faces backlash after CEO Fingerhut withdraws from J Street Conference Haaretz, 19 March 2015 On March 23, 250 J Street students marched to Hillel headquarters, leaving letters for Fingerhut demanding a meeting with him and sharing their view that he caved to the demands of \\"more conservative donors instead of engaging with the full range of student voices ‚Äî including those on the more liberal end.\\"Tensions among U.S. Jews over Israel on display as Hillel leader pulls out of speech The Washington Post, 23 March 2015 Fingerhut then wrote to Benjy Cannon, the board president of J Street U and a senior at the University of Maryland, to arrange a meeting between the students and members of Hillel International‚Äôs board of directors. In his letter, Fingerhut said that there was \\"work to do in the Jewish community at large to be one people that respects, honors and celebrates its diversity rather than fearing it.

An American by birth, his rule spanned the reigns of four monarchs: George V, Edward VIII, George VI and Elizabeth II. Early life and career Hathaway was born in East Orange, New Jersey, the third of four sons of the Wall Street banker Charles Hathaway and his wife Cora (n√©e Southworth Rountree). After graduating from Yale University, Hathaway and a number of other Yale alumni moved to Canada in order to serve in the Royal Flying Corps. He soon became a flying instructor. After the war, he took up residence in London as chief of the city's branch of the sports equipment firm Spalding, eventually becoming a naturalised British citizen. Rule Aerial view of Sark In 1929, Hathaway met Sibyl Beaumont, dame of Sark in the Channel Islands and widowed mother of seven children. She was three years his senior. The couple dated for twelve days before marrying at St Marylebone Parish Church on 5 November 1929. They immediately moved to her native island, where Hathaway was astonished to learn that, according to the feudal custom, he had become jure uxoris seigneur of the island upon their marriage. Due to her strong personality, the dame nevertheless remained the island's effective ruler and influenced Hathaway's decisions during Chief Pleas meetings. The marriage was very happy, but the \\"Yankee Seigneur\\", as he was called, was troubled by the fact that the island he ruled was not large enough for a golf course. Shortly after the German occupation of France during World War II, Sark too was occupied. The Hathaways decided not to flee their territory, but allowed inhabitants to do so; a vast majority remained.

He was the only son of Thomas Bishop of Henfield, Sussex and his wife, Elizabeth Belknap. He was educated at St John's College, Oxford (1562), Clifford's Inn and the Inner Temple (1572). Before 1549, Thomas Bishopp senior had acted as feoffee to Elizabeth, who was a recusant. Her father, Sir Edward Belknap, was active both on the battlefield and as a court official during the 16th and 17th centuries. He had fought for Henry VII of England and been appointed to the post of \\"surveyor of the King's prerogative\\", which gave him the power to appropriate lands and property. By Thomas's marriage to Elizabeth he had obtained a considerable estate in Sussex.A General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire, Volume 2, John Burke, pub 1833, page 651 They had settled at Henfield in Sussex where Thomas became a JP and attorney to the bishop of Chichester, Robert Sherburne (bishop 1508-36), who annexed the prebendary of Henfield in 1499 to his bishopric and then conveyed the estate to Thomas senior. In 1560, Thomas junior was just 10 years old when he inherited from his father Thomas senior the parsonage and park at Henfield, the manors of Beeding, Drayton, Hunston, Stubcroft, and certain farms and stock including a flock of 1,000 sheep. However, as he was a minor he became the ward first of the very wealthy and influential Sir Richard Sackville (cousin to Anne Boleyn) and later of his son Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, a favourite of Elizabeth I. Thomas Bishopp's connection with the Sackville family explains his swift promotion to office in his father‚Äôs adopted county and also his return to Parliament, first in 1584 for Gatton, then in 1586 and 1604 for Steyning. He was probably nominated for these seats in Parliament by Lord Burghley (Master of the Court of Wards amongst other lucrative offices) William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley. From 1578 until his death he sat on the Sussex bench as a Justice of the Peace. In the 1587 report on Sussex justices of the peace Bishopp was a \\"young man\\" who was a \\"good justice\\". He was appointed High Sheriff of Surrey and Sussex for 1584‚Äì85 and 1601‚Äì02. He bought the Parham House estate, Sussex in 1597 and was invested by King James I as a knight on 7 May 1603 at Theobalds House,J.B. Nichols, 1828 The Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities, of King James the First, Volume 4, published 1828 p. 613 shortly after King James I had acceded to the throne. He was made baronet Bishopp of Parham in the County of Sussex in 1620 when almost 70 years old. Sir Thomas Bishopp married, firstly, Anne Cromer, daughter of William Cromer, on 19 September 1577. He married secondly, Jane Weston, daughter of Sir Richard Weston and Jane Dister. Their eldest son was Sir Edward Bishopp, 2nd Baronet.

Soon after, Bustin was converted, writing in 1953: :During the early part of December of 1921 special meetings were conducted in a country school house. W. M. Lusk was the leading light in this meeting. He looked straight at me while he preached -- even pointed at me, as I supposed -- and uncovered my sins to the extent that I became angry and accused my mother of telling him all about me. This conviction climaxed with my conversion on the 12th day of December. What a change! My friends thought I had lost my senses. One sinning religionist who was a strong believer in unconditional eternal security remarked, \\"Bustin is a good boy, but he has gone crazy over religion.\\"G.T. Bustin, My First Fifty Years (Intercession City, FL: 1953; Reprint: Wesleyan Heritage Publications, 1997, 1998):15. In January 1922 Bustin was entirely sanctified and acknowledged a call to become a holiness preacher. Bustin wrote in 1953: :Four weeks after my conversion I was praying in a corn crib loft -- consecrating my heart and life to God. I even promised Him I would be a \\"holiness preacher,\\" or anything else He wanted me to be if He would fill me with His precious Holy Spirit He answered by fire. The heavenly flame burned upon the altar of my heart, and after nearly thirty-two years it still burns. Praise Him! Praise Him! I did praise Him, and sang hours on end even though I am not a singer. His call was clear. I didn't know all that the future held, but I knew that I must preach the blessed Gospel of complete deliverance, and began to plan accordingly. I knew nothing of how far this call would take me in the years to come. Its joys and sorrows were in the unknown bundle, but I shall have reason to praise Him for ever that I heard His voice and heeded the call.G.T. Bustin, My First Fifty Years (Intercession City, FL: 1953; Reprint: Wesleyan Heritage Publications, 1997, 1998):16.

Two months after Bustin enrolled at Trevecca, his mother died in a hospital in Memphis, Tennessee just before he was able to travel to visit.G.T. Bustin, My First Fifty Years (Intercession City, FL: 1953; Reprint: Wesleyan Heritage Publications, 1997, 1998):19. Just after Fannie's funeral at Lepanto, Arkansas, Bustin rededicated his life to serve God, writing in 1953: :\\"Alone with God on this occasion I pledged my life and service anew to go where He wanted me and to serve Him with all my soul. My last earthly support had slipped away, but I had a feeling that mother's God would see me through.\\"G.T. Bustin, My First Fifty Years (Intercession City, FL: 1953; Reprint: Wesleyan Heritage Publications, 1997, 1998):19. While at Trevecca, Bustin participated each weekend in religious services. During the summer vacation of 1923 Bustin assisted a husband and wife evangelistic team, but due to their illness was given the responsibility of leading the services and preaching at the concluding evangelistic meetings at Salt Lick, Kentucky.G.T. Bustin, My First Fifty Years (Intercession City, FL: 1953; Reprint: Wesleyan Heritage Publications, 1997, 1998):19-20. Despite his inexperience, Bustin performed well in his first preaching services and won over many in the initially resistant audience.G.T. Bustin, My First Fifty Years (Intercession City, FL: 1953; Reprint: Wesleyan Heritage Publications, 1997, 1998):21. During his second and final year at Trevecca College, Bustin continued to hold religious services and preach. After Thanksgiving 1923, Bustin convinced his stepfather to allow his daughter, Lottie May Davis, to enrol at Trevecca also but at Bustin's expense.G.T. Bustin, My First Fifty Years (Intercession City, FL: 1953; Reprint: Wesleyan Heritage Publications, 1997, 1998):22. During the summer of 1924 Bustin preached in services in Tennessee, Arkansas, and Mississippi, including for four weeks at Cookeville, Tennessee, where Bustin later recalled: :\\"[God] graciously answered and gave us one of the finest meetings I had ever witnessed. A large group of young people were brought into the fold during those weeks, and some of these were mightily baptized by the Holy Spirit. One of the number shouted her way into heaven within six weeks.G.T. Bustin, My First Fifty Years (Intercession City, FL: 1953; Reprint: Wesleyan Heritage Publications, 1997, 1998):23-24. Ministry After his summer of preaching, Bustin was offered the pastoral responsibilities for two churches by a district superintendent and a guaranteed salary of $100 a week, however Bustin decided to accept the pastorate at a newly organized church in Columbus, Mississippi with no guaranteed stipend.G.T.

It was used by the Air Service, United States Army as the Air Service Replacement Concentration Barracks during World War I. From the facility, Air Service personnel were sent into combat on the Western Front. History= Origins = After the initial elements of the Air Service began deploying to France in 1917, arrangements were made with the French Government for where large numbers of airmen, at the time undergoing training in the United States, France or England would be received in France and be organized for service.Series \\"I\\", Volume s, History of theSt. Maixent Replacement Barracks. Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917‚Äì1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. In December 1917, the French Government suggested Saint-Maixent-l'√âcole in the Poitou-Charentes region. A survey was made of the facilities and arrangements were finalized for Air Service Barracks #3, Base Section #2, which was later changed to the St. Maixent Replacement Barracks. When France was invaded in 1914, the French Army quartered a regiment of the 114th Infantry at Denfert Barracks and partially Canclaux Barracks in St. Maixent; the latter being a former Benedictine Monastery occupied by the French Army since the French Revolution in the late 18th Century. Another building, named the Presbytere Barracks had been used for the previous ten years on a part-time basis for casual quartering and detachments passing through St. Maixent. A new group of buildings, Coiffee Barracks (Site \\"A\\") was under construction and completed in 1916. The Americans were the first to occupy them. These, along with the Presbytere Barracks (Site \\"B\\") and Canclaux (Site \\"C\\") were accepted for use by the Air Service. = Initial operations= The first cadre of Air Service personnel to arrive and begin setting up the facilities for use arrived on 4 December 1917. Construction of kitchens and mess facilities, improvements to the barracks and parade grounds commenced. Additional station personnel arrived on 16 December. On 1 January 1918, the first fourteen Aero Squadrons arrived. Four were quartered in the Coiffee Barracks; four in Presbytere and the balance at Canclaux Barracks. Initially the station was used principally as a receiving location for newly arrived personnel in France. On 1 June 1918, its mission radically changed. It became a staging depot for classification of enlisted personnel and re-organization of existing squadrons. It also became the site of four important schools for commissioned officers. It became the policy of the Air Service in France for all units to proceed directly to St. Maixent upon their arrival in France.Maurer, Maurer (1978), The US Air Service in World War I. Volume I, the Final Report and a Tactical History. Office of Air Force History, Headquarters USAF, Washington D.C. Enlisted personnel were given a thorough trade test on arrival. Upon completion and qualifications verified, Aero Squadrons were re-organized in accordance with the tables of organization developed by the Air Service in France. They were then equipped and given instructions on the use of Gas Masks and qualified in their use before being deployed to the Zone of Advance (Combat area). Four Officer's schools were established as follows: * Adjutants' School * Supply Officers' School * Engineer Officers' School * Flying Officers' School These were refresher courses for training previously received, with intensely practical training pertaining to conditions they would encounter in France. In case a squadron was being prepared for early assignment to the Zone of Advance, a squadron commander nominated by an Air Service commander and approved by the Chief of Air Service was usually sent to join this command at St. Maixent. The squadron, as soon as it was in readiness, then moved to a training center or to the acceptance field at Orly Airport, Paris or to the Air Service Production Center No. 2 at Romorantin Aerodrome for temporary duty in order that men in specialized trades might get some familiarity with their duties. Each squadron then proceed to the 1st Air Depot at Colombey-les-Belles Airdrome; their date of departure being determined by the availability of its equipment and flying personnel. The squadron supply officer with a detachment was sent to a supply warehouse to collect the squadron equipment and accompany it to the point of assembly. Pilots and observers were collected at the 1st Air Depot. The squadron commander, with a nucleus of officers and soldiers preceded the remainder of the squadron to prepare for its coming and to assure himself that the airplanes and squadron were in readiness. Upon its arrival in the Zone of Advance, the squadron reported to general headquarters, G-3 for assignment to an Army. Squadrons assigned to Instructional Centers went directly from St. Maxient to their assigned Center.

Scott Frazier and the camera work was by Icelandic cinematographer √ìttar Gu√∞nason with Production Design by Ged Clarke. It was produced by brothers Sean and Bryan Furst of American Furst Films and Nigel Thomas at British production and film finance company Matador Pictures. Plot CIA operative Emerson Kent (John Cusack) is sent to kill a man who owns a bar. Before being killed by Kent, the man reveals he is a former agent who wanted to retire. A witness flees the scene, accidentally leaving his wallet behind. Kent finds the wallet and tracks the witness to his home, where he kills him. Kent spares the life of the man's daughter, Rachel, who follows him outside, hysterical. As Kent tries to convince his boss, Michael Grey, not to kill her, Grey strikes Kent on the back and he falls to the ground. Kent and Rachel share a last look at each other as Grey kills her. Kent is transferred to Suffolk, England to watch over a numbers station. While there, he befriends Katherine, the station broadcaster, and is haunted by memories of the woman who was killed. When the numbers station comes under attack, Kent and Katherine barricade themselves inside. One assassin is already inside the secure station and, after a lengthy shootout, is killed by Kent. Kent requests assistance, and the operator tells him help will arrive in four hours; since the code has been compromised, he must kill Katherine. Kent notices that Katherine has a serious leg wound and dresses her wound. Kent receives an update from the operator, and, when he reports that he has not killed Katherine yet, the operator orders him to do so immediately. Kent contemplates her death but ultimately decides to recruit her help in tracing fifteen unauthorized messages sent from the station. On the computer, Kent and Katherine discover dossiers of fifteen different government officials, including Grey. The unauthorized codes are instructions to assassinate the officials, and Katherine is to be eliminated so she can't cancel the broadcasts. Kent says that the assassinations would leave the intelligence world crippled and the world unrecognizable. Kent tricks the telephone operator by giving him a false confirmation code, proving that the operator isn't the real agency operator; the operator offers Kent a deal, and Kent pretends to have killed Katherine. Kent escapes to his car, where he recovers a cell phone, and then races back to protect Katherine, who has cracked the code and is broadcasting orders to cancel the previous instructions. Katherine leaves her station when she sees the assassin, but he manages to wound her before Kent kills him. Katherine insists that Kent complete the final cancellation order, and he leaves her side briefly. When he returns, he administers an anesthetic, and she asks him if she will wake. Kent reassures her that he will not kill her, but he reports her as dead to Grey. Kent spreads C4 explosives throughout the base and drops Katherine's jewelry on the floor. After he carries Katherine outside, the base explodes, destroying all evidence. Kent hijacks a car, only to realise that the driver is the telephone operator. When Kent asks him who he works for, the operator replies that he used to work for the same people that Kent does, but he now works for the other side; they are just as twisted, but they pay better. The two shoot each other at the same time, but Kent survives and drives away. As they reach the hospital, Kent falls unconscious from shock and crashes into a car in the hospital parking lot. Kent wakes up in the hospital and discovers that Katherine is alive. Grey steps in and says that she is a liability, but Kent is able to save her life by convincing Grey that she is responsible for saving his life. Grey volunteers to find their bodies at the ruins of the station, and, as the end credits roll, cars are shown passing over the Orwell Bridge in Ipswich at night, implying that Kent and Katherine escaped.

Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 31% of 26 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 4.8/10. Metacritic rated the film 39/100 based on eight reviews.

John Hazelton of Screen Daily called it \\"a serviceable CIA spy thriller whose solid international cast, led by John Cusack, doesn‚Äôt quite make up for the film‚Äôs lack of scope and flair.\\" One of the movie's most positive reviews came from Chuck Wilson of The Village Voice who wrote, \\"there are some decent shootouts, but the movie's strongest assets are the soulful performances from John Cusack and Malin √Ökerman\\". Another positive review came from Lou Lumenick of The New York Post who rated the film three out of four stars and stated, \\"Kasper Barfoed, a Danish director in his English-language debut, makes great use of the main location, a bunker on a former airbase in the UK, as well as a novel premise.

A true median mandibular cyst would therefore be classified as a non-odontogenic, fissural cyst. The existence of this lesion as a unique clinical entity is controversial, and some reported cases may have represented misdiagnosed odontogenic cysts, which are by far the most common type of intrabony cyst occurring in the jaws. It has also been suggested that the mandible develops as a bilobed proliferation of mesenchyme connected with a central isthmus.

It is an A Category railway station of Division. The Katihar Junction railway station is connected to most of the major cities in India by the railway network. Katihar lies in between Barauni‚ÄìKatihar section of Barauni‚ÄìGuwahati line Katihar‚ÄìSiliguri line which serves the city with numerous trains to Guwahati, Kolkata, Delhi, Muzaffarpur, Patna, Gorakhpur, Lucknow and with many other cities. It is ISO certified ISO 14001:2015 for its clean and green environment throughout the station premises. History East Indian Railway Company opened the Manihari‚ÄìKatihar‚ÄìKasba section in 1888 and the North Bengal Railway opened the Katihar‚ÄìRaiganj section the same year. The Barsoi-Kishanganj section opened in 1889. All these lines were -wide metre-gauge lines. Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, operating narrow-gauge lines, extended their operations from Siliguri to Kishanganj in 1915 and to Dalkhola. Siliguri was connected to Kolkata via the eastern part of Bengal since 1878 (for details see Howrah‚ÄìNew Jalpaiguri line). However, with the partition of India in 1947, railway services in the region were completely disrupted. In 1949, the narrow gauge Siliguri-Kishanganj section was upgraded to metre gauge. Thus there was a direct metre-gauge connection from Manihari to Siliguri via Katihar. The importance of Katihar station grew because of the jute mill in the region.  Development  In the early 1960s, when Farakka Barrage was being constructed, Indian Railways took the initiative to extend -wide broad gauge rail link from Kolkata. The long Farakka Barrage carries a rail-cum-road bridge across the Ganges. The rail bridge was opened in 1971 thereby linking the Barharwa‚ÄìAzimganj‚ÄìKatwa loop to Malda, New Jalpaiguri and other railway stations in North Bengal. Gauge conversion work (from metre gauge to broad gauge) in the Barauni‚ÄìKatihar section was taken up in 1978‚Äì79 and completed in 1982. The Siliguri‚ÄìKatihar line was the last surviving metre-gauge line in the area. The Aluabari Road‚ÄìKatihar section already had a broad-gauge line running alongside the metre-gauge line. The Aluabari Road‚ÄìSiliguri section needed to be converted. Conversion work was taken up in 2008, train services in the section was suspended and conversion work completed early in 2011.  Platforms  There are 8 functional platforms at Katihar Junction which are interconnected & have multiple foot overbridges.

The book won McCullough's second National Book Award and his first Los Angeles Times Prize for Biography.  Summary  The story begins in New York in 1869 by introducing the family: father Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., mother Mittie Bulloch Roosevelt and their children Anna (called Bamie), Theodore, Elliott (who becomes the father of Eleanor Roosevelt) and Corinne (called Conie). McCullough then flashes back to the backgrounds of Theodore, Sr. and Mittie, followed by their courtship and marriage, then the stories of their children, ending with Theodore's engagement to Edith Carow.  Writing process  During his research for The Path Between the Seas, describing the history of the Panama Canal and Theodore Roosevelt's role in its construction, McCullough says \\"I was interested in knowing what was involved in the metamorphosis of this most conspicuous animate wonder.\\" Discovering thousands of letters in the Theodore Roosevelt Collection at Harvard's Houghton Library between the members of the Roosevelt family, \\"I realized what a truly marvelous and very large subject I had.\\" The wealth of correspondence allowed him to reveal the life of a well-to-do Victorian American family in depth heretofore unseen. He says \\"I've tried to see that individual, not just in the context of his family who were the closest to him and most important to him, but also to see the family in the context of a particular social class in which they were prominent.\\" McCullough speaks of the value in knowing who raised the future President: \\"If there was one discovery or revelation that meant the most, it was coming to know Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., who is central to this book, as he was in the life of his small namesake. I think it is fair to say that one can not really know Theodore Roosevelt...without knowing the sort of man his father was. Indeed, if I could have one wish for you the reader, it would be that you come away from the book with a strong sense of what a great man Theodore Roosevelt, Sr. was\\" McCullough chose to end the story \\"when I thought he was formed as a person, when I felt I could say, when the reader could say, there he is.\\"  References  Further reading  * Theodore Roosevelt Collection at Houghton Library * The Theodore Roosevelt Association * The Almanac of Theodore Roosevelt * The Theodore Roosevelt Center  External links  * Official site at Simon & Schuster National Book Award-winning works Books about Theodore Roosevelt 1981 non-fiction books Books by David McCullough ","title":"Mornings on Horseback"},{"id":"38667025","text":"Nolan Matthew McCarty (born December 10, 1967 in Odessa, Texas) is an American political scientist specializing in U.S. politics, democratic political institutions, and political methodology.

In March 2011 it was acquired by Audebert Boissons, based in Bort-les-Orgues.  History  The origins of Auvergnat Cola lie with Jean-Philippe Nicolaux, head of the societ√© Julhes, a tripe production company, who wanted to diversify his company's products. After looking for a possible niche product, he turned his attention to mass consumer products, seeking one with strong regional popularity and identity, but which would not have a local competitor or require large-scale production and reduced profit margins. He was convinced that this type of product is only viable as an adjunct to an existing enterprise, where it can be added to the existing structure of the business and economies of scale be realised by that means. The idea of Auvergnat Cola came to him when he was on holiday in Corsica and was drinking the local Corsica Cola.\\"Consommation - L‚ÄôAuvergne lance son Cola! Jean-Philippe Nicolaux lance son Auvergnat Cola. Objectif: 1 million de bouteilles vendues par an\\", Argent, France Soir, 23 February 2009 \\"La folle saga du cola auvergnat\\" , Actualit√©, mon 43.fr, 16 February 2010 (Other pre- existing regional colas in France included Breizh Cola in Brittany, Fada Cola in Marseille and Chtil√† Cola, since renamed Ch'nord Cola, in Nord-Pas-de- Calais, and Meuh Cola in Normandy, Montania Cola in Chamb√©ry and Poitou Cola have since been launched.)Bertrand, \\"Auvergnat Cola, le Coca made in Auvergne\\", Cyberbougnat, 22 January 2009 \\"Meuh Cola: le cola normand √©quitable\\", Boire & manger, Marcel Green.com, 28 October 2010 L'actu en r√©gion, \\"Et vous, quel cola vous buvez?\\" , Le Post, 18 May 2010 Shirley Pellicer, \\"Montania Cola, √† J - 2 du lancement de sa campagne d'affichage\\" , emarketing.fr, 17 August 2010 \\"Le Poitou-Charentes a maintenant son Cola \\", Charente libre.fr, 5 November 2010 = Initial goal = The objective was to appeal to the apple growers in the Auvergne amongst both consumers and food service professionals, and in addition to the attachment of many Parisians to their roots in the region, in particular that of owners of bars and brasseries that have succeeded Auvergne-style bougnats. To be successful, Auvergne Cola would have to be launched in a humorous manner, playing on a quirky, maybe even a completely crazy image. The minimum order to start production would be 20,000 units, and the break-even point would be 50,000 units. The cola recipe was intentionally as close as possible to that of Coca-Cola, because customers were used to it, but with the addition of gentian for a regional touch.\\"L'Auvergnat cola, une affaire qui p√©tille\\", Auvergne, 2012-13, Petit fut√©, Paris: Nouvelles √©ditions de l'Universit√©, 2012, , p. 222 = Targets = In the first phase, the commercial targets were to be regional: restaurant operators, large retailers which were already customers of Julhes, and, to broaden the customer base beyond those who usually bought tripe, local drink distributors. = Implementation = Planning and preparation included the cola recipe and decisions about the name, a slogan-- (local dialect variously glossed as \\"It's going to make everything explode\\" and \\"It makes everything fizz, nom de Dieu\\"), the bottle shape and the label design featuring a volcano, and lasted from October to December 2008. The first sample presentation of the product took place at SIRHA, the international food and hospitality trade fair in Lyon and immediately led to orders. The Julhes display, usually not busy, had queues in front of it. In four days, the first lot of 20,000 bottles sold out prior to production and customers excitedly awaited the actual appearance of the product. The official launch was at the agriculture trade fair on 25 February 2009, when bottles of Auvergnat Cola were finally available. In the media and on the internet, there has been appreciation for the humorous way the product is presented, its rebel side and its down-to-earth and regional aspects, in complete contrast to the current tendency towards globalisation of business and reminiscent of a mosquito attacking a giant of the fizzy drink business. The associated blogs, particularly on Facebook, are often well trafficked. Auvergnat Cola strikes everyone as resembling a big dose of laughter and sunshine alleviating the grey reality of today, between the global economic and financial crisis, the battle over Roquefort in the United States and other problems large and small. A website was created for the product, maintaining a high level of humour, with totally unconventional animation, the opportunity to register to receive news about the product and links to Facebook and Twitter. = Goals reached = The goal had been to sell the minimum initial production of 50,000 units within the first year; actual sales had reached 500,000, ten times that, after three months and 750,000 after four months. Initial orders were renewed, which seemed to be a sign that customers were beginning to form a habit of buying the product, after initially trying it out of curiosity. Reorders from vendors demonstrated that the public liked it. Auvergnat Cola had also brought considerable attention to Julhes, and there was an unexpected degree of identification with it on the part of Auvergne businesses, caf√©s, restaurants and brasseries, and engagement with the brand's internet presence. Aur√©lien Rougerie, who plays international rugby for France and captains ASM Clermont Auvergne, volunteered to be a spokesman for the product.\\"Auvergnat Cola: dej√† deux millions de bouteilles vendues\\", News du Jour, News Auvergne, 5 April 2010 Jean-Philippe Nicolaux arranged various partnerships for the brand, both with tastemakers such as Les toques d'Auvergnes, an association of chefs in the region which no longer serve any other cola, and with sports clubs which he sponsored with a donation of bottles of the product. Production of 1 million units by the end of 2009 was an initial objective;\\"Boissons sans alcool: Julhes lance l‚ÄôAuvergnat Cola\\", Rayon Boissons, 16 February 2009 this mark was reached in time for le quatorze juillet and two million by April 2010.\\"Auvergne - Un succ√®s pour l'Auvergnat Cola\\", Actus voyageur, Routard mag, 21 April 2010 = Jean-Philippe and Philippe = Jean-Philippe Nicolaux then decided to devote himself exclusively to Auvergnat Cola and to split it off from Julhes in early 2010. Seeking a business partnership for both production and distribution, he found Philippe Audebert, CEO of Audebert Boissons (beverages), a company founded in 1901 in Bort-les-Orgues by Jacques Audebert to sell lemonade and wine. Audebert already had an extensive distribution network and a bottling plant and in March 2011 acquired Auvergnat Cola, which has replaced their Le Bougnat brand of soft drinks; they now use that brand name only for their beers.Lydie Anastassion, \\"Auvergnat Cola: bouteille en verre et nouveau propri√©taire\\", L'H√¥tellerie-Restauration, 17 June 2011 Bougnat Cola had launched as a rival a few months after Auvergne Cola, although the brand name had been registered in 2004.\\"Auvergne: la guerre des colas!\\", Radio Scoop, 21 July 2009  Manufacturing  Glass bottles, sold in bars, are produced in Bort-les-Orgues.

He was previously a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and branchchief at the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Over his career, he has made discoveries in studies of drugs and the brain for which he has received a number of awards, and has contributed as a consultant to the government and industry, and as an expert witness in forensic cases.  Biography  Kuhar was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania on March 10, 1944 and attended local schools. He obtained his BS degree in physics and philosophy from the University of Scranton in 1965. After spending a year at Harvard University in applied physics, he transferred to Johns Hopkins University to study biophysics and pharmacology. He obtained his PhD in 1970, and did a postdoctoral fellowship at Yale in the Department of Psychiatry. His focus was on how the brain works and on the mechanism of action of therapeutic drugs that are used to treat psychiatric illness. He then took a faculty position in the Department of Pharmacology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1972, becoming professor in 1981. In 1969, he married Joan Barenburg (1945-2008) and has two children.https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome- instant&ion;=1&espv;=2&ie;=UTF-8#q=Michael+J.+Kuhar+Joan+Barenburg&tbm;=bkshttp://maryland.sites.acs.org/Chesapeake%20Chemist/Archives/1990/apr-1990.pdf According to Emory University, he has more literary citations than any other Emory scientist and he is often an expert witness in both patent and medical malpractice legal cases.

He was a member of the town council for Georgetown, Delaware from 2008 to 2010 and mayor from 2010 to 2012.  Biography  Pettyjohn graduated from Sussex Central High School and the University of Delaware. He first ran for elective office as a member of the Georgetown, Delaware town council in 2008. He was elected to a 2-year term after defeating incumbent Chester Johnson in ward 4. In 2010, Pettyjohn was elected mayor of Georgetown after defeating Matt Walsh by 430-25. In 2012, he began a write-in campaign for Delaware Senate after incumbent Joseph W. Booth was defeated by Eric Bodenweiser in the Republican primary and Bodenweiser was subsequently indicted by a Delaware grand jury. When Bodenweiser filed the necessary paperwork to officially withdraw, Pettyjohn and the Republican Party petitioned the Delaware Department of Elections to replace Bodenweiser's name on the ballot with Pettyjohn's. The Department of Elections refused, and the Delaware Republican Party brought legal action against the department. After favorable rulings by the Delaware Court of Chancery and Delaware Supreme Court, Pettyjohn was placed on the November ballot. He won the election with slightly less than 60 percent of the vote. Pettyjohn was unopposed for reelection in the 2016 primary and general elections. In June 2017, Pettyjohn was charged with a felony for having a firearm on an airplane after a loaded handgun was found in his carry-on luggage at Salisbury Regional Airport by TSA agents. He did not have a concealed carry license for Maryland, although at the time he did have a valid Delaware concealed carry license. He stated he accidentally forget the firearm was in his laptop bag, and could have faced up to 10 years in jail for the offense. However, he avoided a criminal conviction and jail time after being sentenced to 18 months of probation before judgement. He was also required to turn over his handgun as part of his plea bargain. Pettyjohn has frequently spoken out against and opposed gun control laws. In 2018, Pettyjohn reversed his earlier support for the Delaware Equal Rights Amendment and was one of five Republican senators to vote against it.

Memorial to Friedrich von Zoller at the Ostenallee in Regensburg, Germany Biography Von Zoller was on born on 25 May 1762 in Baden-Baden, and because his father was a colonel in the French Army, in command of battalion in the Royal Deux-Ponts Regiment (ZweiBrucken/Two Bridges) commanded by Christian Graf von Forbach. On 8 April 1779 von Zoller was commissioned as a second lieutenant (sous- lieutenant) in the regiment, went with his regiment to North America where he participated in the Seven Years' War during which he was promoted to the First Lieutenant and Adjutant Major. Shortly after the outbreak of the French Revolution von Zoller left France and in the years 1793 and 1794 served on the staff of the Prussian general Frederick of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen in the War of the First Coalition against France. In 1799 he joined the armed forces of Elector Maximilian (the and later King of Bavaria). As a major in the Wrede battalion he fought against the French at the Battle of M√∂skirch on the night of 5/6 March 1800 he was badly wounded and lost an eye. During the War of the Third Coalition (1805), von Zoller saw action on the Tyrolean border as lieutenant colonel in a corps of mountain militia troops (Gebirgssch√ºtzen), and for this service was awarded the Legion of Honour and the Military Order of Max Joseph. In the campaign of 1806/7, he commanded a light infantry regiment against Prussia. In 1809 in the war against Austria and in 1812 during the Russian Campaign he was a colonel of a regiment. During the Russian Campaign he was promoted to major general and brigadier. After the disastrous retreat from Russia, von Zoller was posted to P≈Çock on the Vistula (were the remnants of the Bavarian regiments which had taken part in the Russian Campaign were refitted and remanded) to take command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade. On 20 January 1814 marched the brigade to Toru≈Ñ and took over the occupation of the city. After an honourable defence against the besieging Russians he surrendered the city on 18 April and returned to Bavaria. When Bavaria changed sides and joined the Coalition against France, von Zoller was with the Bavarian forces that fought against the French at the battle of Hanau (October 1813). In the same month was promoted to lieutenant-general, given command of a division. He was ordered do take command at the siege of the fortress of Huningue. The siege lasted until the end of the war which ended with the recognition of Louis XVIII as the French monarch in 1814. The next year, during Napoleon's Hundred Days he again led an infantry division but it saw little action. In recognition of his service to Bavaria he was ennobled as baron von Zoller on 30 January 1816. He died on 25 February 1821 in Regensburg.

Alberto Meschi (27 May 187911 December 1958) was an Italian anarchist, trade union organizer, writer, and anti- fascist fighter. Meschi was born on 27 May 1879 in Borgo San Donnino (now Fidenza), Parma, Kingdom of Italy. He was involved in the workers' movement in La Spezia from a young age, working as a bricklayer. By 1899, he had become a political writer, creating articles for Pro Coatti, the union magazine L'Edilizia, and the anti-militarist La Pace. After emigrating to Argentina in 1905, Meschi mixed with anarcho-syndicalist militants and became involved in union organizing and writing. He returned to Italy in 1909 after being expelled from Argentina. He took up similar activities in Italy, writing for the anarchist newspaper Il Libertario and being heavily involved in the Camera del Lavoro from 1919 to 1922. Meschi was drawn to Carrara, a hotbed of anarchist and union activity, where his organizing work with Ugo Del Papa led to a two-week strike by quarry workers in the summer of 1911 that resulted in improved conditions. A year later, a general strike occurred within the marble industry for the right to a pension. In the spring of 1913, workers in Carrara and Versilia achieved the eight-hour day. The most difficult struggle occurred at the end of that year and in early 1914, involving a lockout in the marble industry. Meschi, Del Papa, and Riccardo Sacconi were all arrested on 11 January 1914, but a strong reaction led to their release on 31 January and the end of the lockout. In 1912, Meschi helped to found the Unione Sindacale Italiana (USI) a revolutionary syndicalist organisation. With the outbreak of the First World War, the USI experienced a major split over the issue of Italian involvement in the war. The pro-war minority were thrown out of or left the USI in September 1914, with the passing of a motion by Meschi which expressed \\"their trust in the proletariat of all countries to rediscover in themselves the spirit of class solidarity and the revolutionary energy required to take advantage of the inevitable weakening of State forces and of the general crisis caused by the war in order to act to sweep away the bourgeois and monarchist states which have been cynically preparing for this war for fifty years\\". Meschi was conscripted to fight in the Italian army and became a prisoner in the Carpathians. After the war, he returned to Carrara and rejoined the General Council of the USI, but by 1922 he had left for France to escape fascist repression. In Paris, he helped to found the Antifascist Concentration and the Italian League for Human Rights, also being a member of the Pietro Gori group of anarchists. He also founded the exile newspaper La Voce del Profugo and magazine Il Momento. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Meschi joined the Rosselli Column, fighting until the fall of the Republic. After returning to France and being imprisoned in a concentration camp, he escaped to Italy in 1943. With the Italian Liberation, he returned to the Camere del Lavoro in Carrara, where he served until 1947. He was also involved in the publication of Il Cavatore (The Quarry Worker), a libertarian workers' news sheet. He died in Carrara on 11 December 1958.

It was the foundation for a face-off between the two nations that would emerge as the world's superpowers. Allied intervention The United States responded to the Russian Revolution of 1917 by participating in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War with the Allies of World War I in support of the White movement. The United States withheld diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Union until 1933.Recognition of the Soviet Union, 1933 Under his Aide Memoire, President Woodrow Wilson officially entered the United States into the Allied Intervention in Russia. In his doctrine, Wilson called on several reasons behind his decision to intervene: to facilitate the safe exit of a stranded Czech Legion from Russia, to safeguard allied military stores located in northern Russia, to put pressure on the Germans with the potential of an eastern front, and to facilitate self-determination with the hope of the creation of a democratic Russia. As Wilsonianism or Wilsonian Idealism was prevalent in Wilson's actions with the Mexican Revolution and the creation of the League of Nations, American intervention consisted of idealistic features as Wilson preferred the creation of a democratic government in Russia. This was seen when American troops, specifically the 339th Infantry Regiment, found themselves in routine engagements with Bolshevik forces in an effort to support Russian revolutionaries. Following Wilson's decision, the 339th Infantry Regiment was mobilized and sent to Archangel, with a brief stop in England. Under British leadership, Generals F.C. Poole and Edmund Ironside, the 339th was tasked with operations on a railroad between Archangel and Lake Onega, including surrounding towns. The allied contingent found little success as fronts were stretched so wide that lines of communications and supply were difficult to procure. Before American forces withdrew from Archangel on June 7, 1919, 222 soldiers of its 5,000 man force were killed. Domestic response Inevitably, Americans became concerned about Bolshevism in the United States. Many viewed labor unions as the primary method by which radicals acted in American society. Cries for action against such radicals reached their peak after Attorney-General A. Mitchell Palmer's home was bombed and numerous bombs intended for other government officials were intercepted. Terror and outrage, remembered as the Red Scare, swept the country. Riots broke out in cities across the country against the Union of Russian Workers and other organizations that the public believed to be filled with Communist conspirators. In response to these riots, Palmer created the General Intelligence Division in the Justice Department. J. Edgar Hoover was selected as the leader of this new division that would investigate the identities and actions of suspected revolutionaries. Palmer, who was still not convinced of Bolshevik responsibility, was highly criticized for a lack of definitive action. However, once he believed the country to be in danger of a revolution, Palmer acted decisively. After meeting with his advisors, he decided that the most appropriate action was mass arrests and deportation of foreign radicals. It was on this premise that he ordered the first of the Palmer Raids. In these raids, Hoover and his agency orchestrated a series of massive dragnets and the simultaneous arrests of suspected revolutionaries in multiple cities. During these raids, many suspects were arrested without warrants and suffered from physical injuries incurred from the raiding forces. These abuses of civil liberties were overlooked by the public who enthusiastically backed Palmer and Hoover. They conducted these raids with the mindset that Constitutional Rights were a necessary sacrifice in order to preserve the Government of the United States. Amid these raids, there was still little evidence that the Communists were even involved in the bombings or labor strikes, and many of those arrested were released because of lack of evidence. It was not until men such as Francis Fisher Kane, a member of the Justice Department, and Lewis F. Post, Acting Secretary, exposed the violation of civil liberties that the public began to question the actions of the Palmer Raids. With the economy stable once again and no violent anarchist acts since the bombing of Palmer's home, the public began to criticize Palmer once again for these violations. The Red Scare was coming to an end.  Cold War implications  Once Americans left Archangel in 1919, distrust grew between communist Russia and democratic America as the twentieth century developed. At the height of the Cold War, Nikita Kruschev recalled America's Russian Expedition by saying \\"We remember the grim days when American soldiers went to our soldiers headed by their generals‚Ä¶Never have any of our soldiers been on American soil, but your soldiers were on Russian soil. These are facts.\\" The creation of the Cold War evolved out of World War II, but American intervention in the Russian Revolution created a sentiment between the United States and USSR that either communism or capitalism should prevail. Results The results of U.S. action toward the Bolsheviks and the Soviet Union created an anti-Soviet attitude in America. This attitude, along with the Soviet's anti-capitalism ideals, created a hostility that would remain strong throughout the rest of the century. World War II proved to be the high point of Soviet-U.S. relations, which would quickly drop off after the war. Journalist Harry Schwartz sums it up in his article in the July 7, 1963 New York Times: \\"Soviet-United States relations since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution have gone through almost all possible phases from warm comradeship in arms to the deepest hostility\\".

He is infamous for his sharp political cartoons which, artistically speaking, share a closer resemblance to paintings than regularly drawn cartoons. Throughout the years his work has received several prizes and awards. Biography GAL was born in 1940 in Oudergem, Flanders, together with his twin brother Edgard. At the age of twelve he won a drawing contest in the newspaper Het Nieuws van den Dag. He studied painting and graphic art at the higher St. Lucas-instituut in Brussels, where he would become a teacher at a later age. In his penultimate year at Sint-Lucas Gal worked as apprentice at the Jesuit weekly magazine De Linie. The next two years he was in charge of the magazine's layout. When the publication of the magazine ceased in 1964 Gal drew the final cover featuring a cut down tree with the words \\"De Linie\\" written on the tree bark, crushing the Flemish Lion in its fall. Gal's first cartoons were published in 1960 and appeared in various magazines, most prominently De Nieuwe and De Zwijger, where he was the house cartoonist. Since 1984 GAL publishes in the weekly magazine Knack. Over the years his cartoons have been the subject of censorship by the magazine's editors and those published sometimes caused offended letters from readers. In 1996 GAL was a guest in the political talkshow De Zevende Dag on the Flemish national TV station VRT, in a special transmission live from the Flemish Parliament. When he showed some cartoons critical of the then popular far-right party Vlaams Blok (today Vlaams Belang) all members of the party left the building in offense. In 2004 GAL temporarily lost his eyesight due to an emboly. After a while he discovered a handy method to continue his work. On 2 April 2019 Gal will receive an honorary doctorate from the Free University in Brussels. Status GAL's social engagement as a cartoonist is not restricted to solely drawing and painting. The past decades he participated in many public demonstrations. He also devoted his talent and energy to many political and social causes, including Oxfam, Amnesty International, and made cartoons and illustrations for magazines like Humo, De Nieuwe, Panorama/De Post, De Zwijger and De Morgen. He is also a well requested illustrator of book covers, posters and logos. His posters against South Africa's apartheid policy were distributed globally. One time GAL was watching a news bulletin on TV when he saw a report about a house of an ANC activist destroyed by a bomb attack. On the walls of the burned-out building he saw one of his anti-apartheid posters. This is also the reason why GAL prides himself in having made an important contribution in getting \\"apartheid down to its knees\\".GAL, Johan Anthierens: \\"GAL: de overspannen jaren, opgetekend van 1960 tot 1996\\", uitgeverij Epo, Brussel, 1996. Style GAL's cartoons are quite unique. They share a closer resemblance to paintings than regular black-and-white cartoons. Also they are seldom trivial jokes about modern day affairs, but biting accusations against certain events, systems and/or politicians. He has illustrated novels by Kristien Hemmerechts and Geert van Istendael, as well as non-fiction works about political topics. Gal also illustrated the album cover of Zjef Vanuytsel's album \\"Tederheid\\" (1983).

It is known for its theory of nationality and nationalism, and its attempt to conciliate it with socialism in the imperial context. Hence, Otto Bauer thought of the \\"personal principle\\" as a way of gathering the geographically divided members of the same nation. In Social Democracy and the Nationalities Question (1907), he wrote that \\"The personal principle wants to organize nations not in territorial bodies but in simple association of persons\\", thus radically disjoining the nation from the territory and making of the nation a non-territorial association.  Overview  Beginning in 1904, the Austro-Marxist group organized around magazines such as the Bl√§tter zur Theorie und Politik des wissenschaftlichen Sozialismus and the Marx-Studien. Far from being a homogeneous movement, it was a home for such different thinkers and politicians as the Neokantian Max Adler and the orthodox Marxist Rudolf Hilferding. In 1921 the Austro-Marxists formed the International Working Union of Socialist Parties (also known as 2¬Ω International or the Vienna International), hoping to unite the 2nd and 3rd Internationals, something which eventually failed. Austro-Marxism inspired later movements such as Eurocommunism and the New Left, all searching for a democratic socialist middle ground between communism and social democracy and a way to eventually unite the two movements. Austro-Marxism also instituted economic and social reforms such as healthcare, municipal housing, and educational system in Vienna, which later inspired the Scandinavian social democratic parties and the British Labour Party. Austro-Marxism was also the first movement in Europe to mount an armed resistance to a fascist government, although eventually defeated in 1934. The Austro-Marxist principle of national personal autonomy was later adopted by various parties, among them the Bund (General Jewish Labour Union), left-wing Zionists (Hashomer Hatzair) in favour of a binational solution in Palestine, the Jewish Folkspartei between the two world wars and the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania after 1989. Heritage Austro-Marxism can be seen as the predecessor of Eurocommunism. Both ideologies are conceived as alternatives to Marxism-Leninism.

It was established in 1952 by George Habash. Origins and ideology The Arab Nationalist Movement had its origins in a student group led by George Habash at the American University of Beirut which emerged in the late 1940s. In the mid-1950s Habash and his followers joined a larger student group led by Constantin Zureiq. The group's ideology owed much to Zureiq's thinking: it was revolutionary and pan-Arabist. It placed emphasis on the formation of a nationally conscious intellectual elite which would play a vanguard role in a revolution of Arab consciousness, leading to Arab unity and social progress. Ideologically, it was committed to socialism and secularism, but initially not Marxism. Its Arab nationalist approach meant an uncompromising hostility to Western imperialism in general, and Israel in particular, as the movement took a lead in the formation of anti-Zionist doctrine. The group formed branches in various Arab states, and adopted the name Arab Nationalist Movement in 1958. Some political divergence arose within the movement. Many, especially in Syria and Iraq, became close to local Nasserist movements, and indeed turned into the main pillar of Nasserism in some parts of the Levant. However, another faction moved towards Marxism, including Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh, which brought them into conflict with Gamal Abdel Nasser and increasingly led them to place a heavier emphasis on socialism than pan-Arab nationalism. Also, the differing systems of government in the Arab countries forced the ANM branch organizations to adapt to local conditions, and it became increasingly difficult to find common ground. Decline and disintegration These tensions caused the movement's decline during the late 1960s, and it had ceased to exist as a regional political force by 1970. This development was partially propelled by the defeat of Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day War, which had led to the discrediting of Nasserism, and forced the ANM to play down its uniting, pan-Arab creed. The final blow to the ANM had come in 1967‚Äì69, as the Levantine branches fractured into competing Marxist parties, precipitated by conflicts within the Palestinian movement. The tendency around Habash tried to regroup the movement by forming the Arab Socialist Action Party as a new Pan-Arab political structure. Even if nothing remains of the ANM itself today, its disintegration spawned a great number of parties and movements on the left flank of Arab politics. Some of these, for example those in the Palestinian movement and in South Yemen, were to become very influential in their respective countries. Bahrain The Bahraini ANM cadres initially joined the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Occupied Arabian Gulf. In 1974 the Bahraini sector of PFLOAG was converted into the Popular Front for the Liberation of Bahrain. Today the Popular Front has given birth to National Democratic Action Society, a prominent secular opposition party in country. Egypt In Egypt the ANM branch merged into Nasser's Egyptian branch of the Arab Socialist Union, but were later depoliticized after an internal purge. Iraq Similar events led to the growth of the ANM in Iraq. In the aftermath of the overthrow of Abd al-Karim Qasim in 1963, the Iraqi branch of the Ba'ath Party had established a government which collapsed in disorder and was replaced in November that year by a more broadly-based pan-Arab government under Abdul Salam Arif. The ANM again played a major role in Iraqi politics, close to the Nasserist elements in Arif's government. After the Nasserists lost influence and withdrew from the government in July 1964, the ANM continued to collaborate with them and in September that year attempted a coup. In 1964, the ANM merged into the Iraqi Arab Socialist Union. Kuwait In Kuwait the ANM branch was reconstituted as the Progressive Democrats, a political party still in existence. Lebanon In Lebanon the Hawatmeh wing (which had in majority in the Lebanon branch) reconstituted itself as the Organization of Lebanese Socialists in 1968, and in later merged with Socialist Lebanon to form the Communist Action Organization in Lebanon, which was active during the Lebanese Civil War and in the Hezbollah-led resistance to Israel's occupation of the Lebanese south (1982-2000). The Habash loyalists formed the Arab Socialist Action Party ‚Äì Lebanon. Oman In 1964 the ANM branch in Oman participated in the formation of the Dhofar Liberation Front (DLF). The ANM as a whole supported the Dhofar struggle. NLFD later transformed into the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Occupied Arabian Gulf (PFLOAG), later the Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman (PFLO). This group led an insurgency in Dhofar for several years in the 1960s and early 1970s, driving government forces from large swaths of territory. It was eventually defeated in the early 1970s by Sultan Qaboos, backed by British and Iranian forces. After resistance inside Oman was broken in 1975, the group remained as a minor military and political force based in the sympathetic neighboring state of South Yemen, which had backed the Dhofar rebellion, until the 1980s. Palestine=Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine= The Marxist elements in the ANM reconstituted its Palestinian branch in the mid-1960s as the Palestinian National Liberation Front . In December 1967 NFLP unified with two other Palestinian factions, Heroes of Return (abtal al-awda) and Ahmed Jibril's Palestine Liberation Front (PLF). Together they formed the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), under Habash's leadership. =Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine= In early 1968, a leftist, supposedly Maoist, faction headed by Hawatmeh broke away from PFLP to form the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP, initially PDFLP). At this point, both the PFLP and the DFLP had embraced Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, a break with the ANM heritage that would be replicated in other branches, and tear what remained of the movement apart. The PFLP and DFLP subsequently both spawned a number of breakaway factions, such as the PFLP-GC, the PLF and the FIDA. Many of these groups were active as a leftist hardline opposition within the PLO, and most participated in the Rejectionist Front of 1974. =Current situation= Even though the PFLP and DFLP remain very active in Palestinian politics and both have played a military role in the Second Intifada, their political support is rather reduced, especially within the occupied territories. Partly, this is related to the decline of the Arab left in general, a trend related to changes in Arab political culture but also to the fall of the Soviet Union. But in addition to that, the specific circumstances of the occupied territories have led to dual pressure from the radical Islamist opposition of Hamas, on the one hand, and the patronage resources available to Fatah through its control of the Palestinian National Authority on the other. Saudi Arabia The Saudi branch gave birth to the Arab Socialist Action Party ‚Äì Arabian Peninsula, a Marxist-Nationalist faction aligned with the PFLP. Syria In 1962 the Syrian branch, until then a small group of intellectuals almost all of whom were Palestinian, reacted to the break-up of the United Arab Republic by establishing a mass-movement calling for immediate re-unification with Egypt. Membership quickly surged to several thousand, and the leadership participated in the first Ba'athist-led government established after the coup of 8 March 1963, though on a non-party basis. The Ba'ath Party and its allied officers almost immediately after the March coup began purging Nasserists from power, with dismissals, transfers and arrests during the Spring of 1963; the ANM was viewed as one of the most serious threats, because of its numerical force and ideological appeal to the Ba'athist constituency. The Ba'ath-ANM tensions culminated in a Nasserist coup attempt led by Jassem Alwan that was struck down in July, 1963, after which Nasserism and the ANM in particular was a spent force in Syria. The ANM entered the Arab Socialist Union, but both the Hawatmeh and Habash loyalists later reconstituted themselves as independent parties, and the ASU itself splintered repeatedly during the Syrian 1960s and early 1970s. Yemen In South Yemen the local ANM branch was instrumental in forming the National Liberation Front which would later become the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), the leading political party in the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. In North Yemen, the members of ANM broke away from the mother organization in June 1968, forming the Revolutionary Democratic Party of Yemen (which would eventually merge into the YSP). After the reuniting of the two Yemens in 1990, the YSP became the major opposition party in the Republic of Yemen.

Arab nationalism () is a nationalist ideology that asserts the Arabs are a nation and promotes the unity of Arab people, celebrating the glories of Arab civilization, the language and literature of the Arabs, calling for rejuvenation and political union in the Arab world. Its central premise is that the peoples of the Arab world, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, constitute one nation bound together by common ethnicity, language, culture, history, identity, geography and politics.Sela, 151 One of the primary goals of Arab nationalism is the end of Western influence in the Arab world, seen as a \\"nemesis\\" of Arab strength, and the removal of those Arab governments considered to be dependent upon Western power. It rose to prominence with the weakening and defeat of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century and declined after the defeat of the Arab armies in the Six-Day War.\\"Requiem for Arab Nationalism\\" by Adeed Dawisha, Middle East Quarterly, Winter 2003Charles Smith, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, in International Relations in the Middle East by Louise Fawcett, p. 220. Personalities and groups associated with Arab nationalism include King Faisal I of Iraq, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, the Arab Nationalist Movement, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party which came to power in Iraq for some years and is still the ruling party in Syria, and its founder Michel Aflaq. Pan-Arabism is a related concept, in as much as it calls for supranational communalism among the Arab states. Ideology Arab nationalists believe that the Arab nation existed as a historical entity prior to the rise of nationalism in the 19th‚Äì20th century. The Arab nation was formed through the gradual establishment of Arabic as the language of communication and with the advent of Islam as a religion and culture in the region. Both Arabic and Islam served as the pillars of the nation. According to writer Youssef M. Choueiri, Arab nationalism represents the \\"Arabs' consciousness of their specific characteristics as well as their endeavor to build a modern state capable of representing the common will of the nation and all its constituent parts.\\"Choueri, p.23. Within the Arab nationalist movement are three main ideas: that of the Arab nation; Arab nationalism; and pan-Arab unity. The 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine led to the foundation of the Arab nationalist Ba'ath Party, which asserts that the Arab nation is the group of people who speak Arabic, inhabit the Arab world, and who feel they belong to the same nation. Arab nationalism is the \\"sum total\\" of the characteristics and qualities exclusive to the Arab nation, whereas pan-Arab unity is the modern idea that stipulates that the separate Arab countries must unify to form a single state under one political system.Choueri, p.25. Local patriotism centered on individual Arab countries was incorporated into the framework of Arab nationalism starting in the 1920s. This was done by positioning the Arabian Peninsula as the homeland of the Semitic peoples (the Canaanites and Arameans of the Levant and the Assyrians and Babylonians of Mesopotamia) who migrated throughout the Near East in ancient times or by associating the other pre-Islamic cultures, such as those of Egypt and North Africa and Horn of Africa, into an evolving Arab identity.Choueiri, p.26. The modern Arabic language actually has two distinct words which can be translated into English as \\"nationalism\\": qawmiyya ŸÇŸàŸÖŸäÿ©, derived from the word qawm (meaning \\"tribe, ethnic nationality\\"), and wataniyya Ÿàÿ∑ŸÜŸäÿ©, derived from the word watan (meaning \\"homeland, native country\\"). The term qawmiyya means attachment to the Arab nation, while wataniyya means loyalty to a single Arab state. Wataniyya is sometimes disparaged as \\"regionalism\\" by those who consider pan- Arabism the only legitimate variant of Arab nationalism. In the post-World War years, the concept of qawmiyya \\"gradually assumed a leftist coloration, calling for ... the creation of revolutionary Arab unity.\\"Sela, 154 Groups who subscribed to this point of view advocated opposition, violent and non- violent, against Israel and against Arabs who did not subscribe to this point of view. The person most identified with qawmiyya was Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, who used both military and political power to spread his version of pan-Arab ideology throughout the Arab world. While qawmiyya still remains a potent political force today, the death of Nasser and the Arab defeat in the Six-Day War has weakened faith in this ideal. The current dominant ideology among Arab policy makers has shifted to wataniyya.Sela, 154‚Äì155 History=Origins= Soldiers in the Arab Army during the Arab Revolt of 1916‚Äì1918, carrying the Flag of the Arab Revolt. Throughout the late 19th century, beginning in the 1860s, a sense of loyalty to the \\"Fatherland\\" developed in intellectual circles based in the Levant and Egypt, but not necessarily an \\"Arab Fatherland\\". It developed from observance of the technological successes of Western Europe which they attributed to the prevailing of patriotism in those countries.Khalidi, p.6. During this period, a heavy influx of Christian missionaries and educators from Western countries provided what was termed the \\"Arab political revival\\", resulting in the establishment of secret societies within the empire. In the 1860s, literature produced in the Mashriq (the Levant and Mesopotamia) which was under Ottoman control at the time, contained emotional intensity and strongly condemned the Ottoman Turks for \\"betraying Islam\\" and the Fatherland to the Christian West. In the view of Arab patriots, Islam had not always been in a \\"sorry state\\" and attributed the military triumphs and cultural glories of the Arabs to the advent of the religion, insisting that European modernism itself was of Islamic origin. The Ottomans, on the other hand, had deviated from true Islam and thus suffered decline. The reforming Ottoman and Egyptian governments were blamed for the situation because they attempted to borrow Western practices from the Europeans that were seen as unnatural and corrupt. The Arab patriots' view was that the Islamic governments should revive true Islam that would in turn, pave way for the establishment of constitutional representative government and freedom which, though Islamic in origin, was manifested in the West at the time.Khalidi, p. 7. Arabism and regional patriotism (such as in Egypt or in the Levant) mixed and gained predominance over Ottomanism among some Arabs in Syria and Lebanon. Ibrahim al-Yaziji, a Lebanese Christian philosopher, called for the Arabs to \\"recover their lost ancient vitality and throw off the yoke of the Turks\\" in 1868. A secret society promoting this goal was formed in the late 1870s, with al-Yazigi as a member. The group placed placards in Beirut calling for a rebellion against the Ottomans. Meanwhile, other Lebanese and Damascus-based notables, mostly Muslims, formed similar secret movements, although they differed as Christian groups who disfavoured Arabism called for a completely independent Lebanon while the Muslim Arab societies generally promoted an autonomous Greater Syria still under Ottoman rule.Khalidi, p. 8. As early as 1870, Syrian Christian writer Francis Marrash distinguished the notion of fatherland from that of nation; when applying the latter to Greater Syria, he pointed to the role played by language, besides customs and belief in common interests, in defining national identity. This distinction between fatherland and nation was also made by Hasan al-Marsafi in 1881. By the beginning of the 20th century, groups of Muslim Arabs embraced an Arab nationalist \\"self-view\\" that would provide as the basis of the Arab nationalist ideology of the 20th century. This new version of Arab patriotism was directly influenced by the Islamic modernism and revivalism of Muhammad Abduh, the Egyptian Muslim scholar. Abduh believed the Arabs' Muslim ancestors bestowed \\"rationality on mankind and created the essentials of modernity,\\" borrowed by the West. Thus, while Europe advanced from adopting the modernist ideals of true Islam, the Muslims failed, corrupting and abandoning true Islam. Abduh influenced modern Arab nationalism in particular, because the revival of true Islam's ancestors (who were Arabs) would also become the revival of Arab culture and the restoration of the Arab position as the leaders of the Islamic world. One of Abduh's followers, Abd al-Rahman al- Kawakibi, openly declared that the Ottoman Empire should be both Turkish and Arab, with the latter exercising religious and cultural leadership.Khalidi, p.9. =Rise of modern Arab nationalism= In 1911, Muslim intellectuals and politicians from throughout the Levant formed al-Fatat (\\"the Young Arab Society\\"), a small Arab nationalist club, in Paris. Its stated aim was \\"raising the level of the Arab nation to the level of modern nations.\\" In the first few years of its existence, al-Fatat called for greater autonomy within a unified Ottoman state rather than Arab independence from the empire. Al- Fatat hosted the Arab Congress of 1913 in Paris, the purpose of which was to discuss desired reforms with other dissenting individuals from the Arab world. They also requested that Arab conscripts to the Ottoman army not be required to serve in non-Arab regions except in time of war. However, as the Ottoman authorities cracked down on the organization's activities and members, al- Fatat went underground and demanded the complete independence and unity of the Arab provinces.Choueiri, pp.166‚Äì168. Nationalist individuals became more prominent during the waning years of Ottoman authority, but the idea of Arab nationalism had virtually no impact on the majority of Arabs as they considered themselves loyal subjects of the Ottoman Empire.Karsh, Islamic Imperialism, 229 The British, for their part, incited the Sharif of Mecca to launch the Arab Revolt during the First World War.Karsh, Islamic Imperialism, 8‚Äì9 The Ottomans were defeated and the rebel forces, loyal to the Sharif's son Faysal ibn al-Husayn entered Damascus in 1918. By now, Faysal along with many Iraqi intellectuals and military officers had joined al-Fatat which would form the backbone of the newly created Arab state that consisted of much of the Levant and the Hejaz. Damascus became the coordinating center of the Arab nationalist movement as it was seen as the birthplace of the ideology, the seat of Faysal‚Äîthe first Arab \\"sovereign\\" after nearly 400 years of Turkish suzerainty‚Äîand because the nationalists of the entire Mashreq region were familiar with it. Nonetheless, Jerusalem, Beirut, and Baghdad remained significant bases of support. Following the creation of Faysal's state, a serious tension within the Arab nationalist movement became visible; the conflict between the ideology's highest ideal of forming a single independent unit comprising all countries that shared the Arabic language and heritage, and the tendency to give precedence to local ambitions.Choueiri, pp.171‚Äì173. To further tensions, a rift formed between the older nationalist members of various Syrian urban-class families and the generally younger nationalists who became close to Faysal‚Äîhis Hejazi troops, Iraqi and Syrian military officers, and Palestinian and Syrian intellectuals. The older guard was mainly represented by Rida Pasha al-Rikabi, who served as Faysal's prime minister, while the younger guard did not have one particular leader. However, the youth within al-Fatat founded the Arab Independence Party (\\"al-Istiqlal\\") in February 1919. Its goal was to achieve unity and complete Arab independence. Prominent members included Izzat Darwaza and Shukri al-Quwatli. Centered in Damascus with branches in various cities throughout the Levant, al-Istiqlal received political and financial support from Faysal, but relied on the inner circle of al-Fatat to survive.Choueiri, pp.175‚Äì176. During the war, Britain had been a major sponsor of Arab nationalist thought and ideology, primarily as a weapon to use against the power of the Ottoman Empire. Although the Arab forces were promised a state that included much of the Arabian Peninsula and the Fertile Crescent the secret Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement between Britain and France provided for the territorial division of much of that region between the two imperial powers. During the inter-war years and the British Mandate period, when Arab lands were under French and British control, Arab nationalism became an important anti-imperial opposition movement against European rule. =Growth of the movement= French Mandate authorities during the Great Syrian Revolt, 1925 A number of Arab revolts against the European powers took place following the establishment of the British and French mandates.Choueiri, p.92. Resentment of British rule culminated in the Iraqi revolt of 1920. The uprising which was carried out by the urban population as well as the rural tribes of Iraq ended in 1921. The British drastically changed their policy in Iraq afterwards. Although the mandate was still in place officially, the British role was virtually reduced to an advisory one.Dodge, pp.8‚Äì10. In 1925, the Druze of southern Syria under the leadership of Sultan al-Atrash revolted against French rule. The revolt subsequently spread throughout Syria, particularly in Damascus where an uprising by the citizens took place. The French responded by systematically bombarding the city, resulting in thousands of deaths. The revolt was put down by the end of the year, but it is credited with forcing the French to take more steps to ensure Syrian independence.Cavandish, p.126-127. In Egypt, resentment of British hegemony led to wide-scale revolts across the country in 1919. As a result of three-year negotiations following the uprising, the British agreed to allow Egypt's official independence in 1922, but their military still held great influence in the country. The political leaders of the Egyptian revolution espoused Egyptian nationalism, rather than an Arab nationalist alternative.Gershoni and Jankowski, pp.40‚Äì41. The relative independence of Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and North Yemen encouraged Arab nationalists to put forward programs of action against colonial powers in the region. According to historian Youssef Choueiri, the \\"first public glimmerings\\" of a pan-Arab approach occurred in 1931, during the convention of a pan-Islamic conference in Jerusalem which highlighted Muslim fears of the increasing growth of Zionism in Palestine. Arab delegates held a separate conference and for the first time delegates from North Africa, Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula and the Fertile Crescent convened together to discuss Arab matters. A pan-Arabist covenant was proclaimed centering on three main articles: *The Arab countries form an integral and indivisible whole. Hence the Arab nation does not accept or recognize the divisions of whatever nature to which it has been subjected. *All efforts in every Arab country are to be directed towards the achievement of total independence within one single unity. Every endeavor which confines political activities to local or regional issues is to be fought against. *Since colonialism is, in all its forms and manifestations, incompatible with the dignity and paramount aims of the Arab nation, the Arab nation rejects it and will resist it with all the means at its disposal. Plans for a near-future conference were made, but never came into play due to Faysal's death in 1933 (delegates chose Faysal of Iraq to be their patron and he agreed to provide moral and material support for the movement) and fierce British opposition. However, the Arab Independence Party was formed by Palestinian and Iraqi activists from al-Fatat as a direct result of the Jerusalem conference on 13 August 1932. Most of the AIP's activities were centered in the Palestinian political field, but the party also worked towards achieving Arab unity and solidarity as a means to strengthen Arab resistance against the British Mandate in Palestine and increased Jewish settlement occurring there. In August 1933, the League of Nationalist Action (LNA) was founded in Lebanon by Western-educated professional civil service groups with the aims of creating a common Arab market and industrial base as well as the abolishment of customs barriers between the Arab countries.Choueiri, p.93. By proposing agrarian reforms to limit the power of landowners, abolishing what they considered \\"feudalism\\" and promoting the growth of an industry, the LNA sought to undermine the absentee landlords in the Levant who tended to encourage local nationalism and were open to working with European authorities or Jewish land purchasers. The LNA enjoyed a level of popularity throughout the 1930s, but did not survive into the 1940s.Choueiri, p. 94. Arab rebels during the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine Following the killing of the Syrian Arab guerrilla leader Izz ad-Din al-Qassam by British forces in Ya'bad, Arab-Jewish tensions in Palestine reached a climax. Anti-Zionist sentiments reached a boiling point on 15 April 1936, when an armed group of Arabs killed a Jewish civilian after intercepting his car near the village of Bal'a. After Jews retaliated by killing two Arab farmers near Jaffa, this sparked an Arab revolt in Palestine. The AIP along with Palestinian notables selected popular leader and Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini to lead the uprising.Nafi, pp. 192‚Äì193. The Arab Higher Committee (AHC), a national committee bringing together Arab factions in Palestine, was established to coordinate the uprising. To protest increased Jewish immigration, a general strike was declared and a political, economic, and social boycott of Jews soon ensued.Nafi, p. 194. The events in Palestine followed similar anti-colonial activities in Egypt and Syria which helped inspire the uprising. In Egypt, week-long anti-British demonstrations had eventually resulted in the restoration of the Egyptian constitution while in Syria, a general strike held in January‚ÄìFebruary 1936 led to major negotiations for an independence deal with the French government. The British took a firm stance against the nationalist revolt in Palestine, dissolving the AHC forcing al-Husayni into exile in Lebanon in 1937.Choueiri, p.97. Al-Husayni, who leaned more towards Palestinian nationalism, was instrumental in organizing the pan-Arab Bloudan Conference on 9 September 1937 in Syria which gathered 524 delegates from across the Arab world, although al-Husayni himself was not in attendance.Choueiri, p. 98. According to author Adeeb Dawisha, although the uprising had been quelled by 1939, it greatly \\"contributed to the growth of Arab nationalist sentiment\\" and began the development of \\"solidarity\\" between Arab governments.Dawisha, p. 117. King Ghazi of Iraq was a strong supporter of Arab nationalism. He died in a car accident in 1939, but his death was blamed on the British by Iraqi army officers loyal to him. Meanwhile, a clandestine Arab nationalist society was formed in Iraq in 1938 which came to be known as Arab Nationalist Party (ANP). The ANP typically confined itself to influencing events and leaders in Iraq rather than taking the lead of a mass nationalist movement. King Ghazi of Iraq was one such leader. Ghazi intended to build a strong Iraqi army and actively sought to annex Kuwait. Many Arab nationalist politicians from Kuwait, who favored independence particularly after the discovery of oil there in 1938, were provided safe haven in Iraq after being repressed by the quasi-rulers of the sheikhdom, the al-Sabah family (Kuwait was still a British territory at the time.) Ghazi died in a car accident in 1939, prompting a number of his army officers to allege the king was assassinated by British forces.Choueiri, pp. 95‚Äì96. That same year, al-Husayni arrived in Baghdad after escaping from Lebanon, giving a morale boost to the pan-Arab dimension in Iraqi politics. The prime minister at the time, Nuri al- Said and the regent king 'Abd al-Ilah, did not harbor the pan-Arabist sympathies Ghazi espoused. Amin al-Husseini (center, wearing headress) and Rashid Ali al-Gaylani (to al-Husayni's left) commemorating the anniversary of the 1941 Iraq coup in Berlin, Germany. Rashid Ali al-Gaylani succeeded al-Said as Prime Minister in March 1940 and took a neutral position regarding World War II, opening dialogue with the German government which was at war with Britain. Under great pressure from the latter, al-Gaylani resigned on 31 January 1941 and al-Said took his place. The perceived British interjection in Iraq's internal affairs angered Arab nationalist officers in the army, leading a group of them to overthrow the government in April and install al-Gaylani as Prime Minister. To counter a British military response to the coup, al-Gaylani enlisted the support of Germany, but the German military did not arrive to aid the Arab nationalist government. With pro-German Vichy France having taken control of neighboring Syria, Britain reoccupied Iraq in May to prevent it from joining the Axis powers. By 1 June, al-Gaylani and al-Husayni fled to the country for Germany, while the army officers who carried out the coup were captured and executed. Al-Husayni became increasingly acquainted with Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader of Germany, and other Nazi officials and attempted to coordinate Nazi and Arab policies to solve what he believed was the \\"Jewish problem\\" in Palestine.The Israel-Arab reader: a documentary history of the Middle East conflict by Walter Laqueur, Barry M.

Throughout World War II, the Nazi government, seeking to take advantage of widespread anti-imperialist feelings in the Middle East, had broadcast anti-Semitic messages tailored to Arabic- speaking Muslims in the Middle East via radio.Herf, Jeffrey. \\"Nazi Propaganda for the Arab World.\\" Google Books. 30 January 2013. The conflict in Iraq provoked anger and frustration throughout the Arab world and the British acknowledged the rapid growth of Arab nationalist feeling among the Arab population, large segments of which saw the events in Iraq as a valiant struggle against imperialism.Dawisha, p. 118. British Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, officially stated Britain's support of strong pan-Arab ties in a bid to ease anti-British sentiments in the region.Choueiri, p.99. The events of the region influenced the creation of the Arab Union Club in Egypt in 1942 which called for developing stronger ties between Egypt and the Arab world. Branches were subsequently opened in Baghdad, Beirut, Jaffa and Damascus, and Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa El-Nahas adopted its platform, pledging to help protect \\"the interests and rights\\" of the \\"sister Arab nations\\" and explore the \\"question of Arab unity.\\" =Establishment of the Arab League= Rivalry for the leadership of the Arab world developed mostly between the political establishments of Iraq and Egypt in the period following the failure of Rashid Ali coup. Eden's stated support for increased Arab ties encouraged Nuri al-Said of Iraq to propose his own plan for Arab unity in January 1943, dubbed the \\"Fertile Crescent Union.\\" The plan recognized the linguistic, cultural and economic ties between the states of the Fertile Crescent region as well as the differences between their inhabitants. It sought to unify those states in a stage-based process whereby the initial stage would see Syria, Transjordan, Palestine and Lebanon unite with limited autonomy given to the Jews in Palestine and special rights for the Christians in Lebanon.Dawisha, p. 119. Afterward the Levantine state and Iraq would form an \\"Arab League,\\" to which other Arab states could join, that would oversee matters of defense, foreign policy, customs, currency and the safeguarding of minorities. The proposal reflected a combination of factors, namely the expansionist ambitions of the Hashemites, the attempt by Iraq's political establishment to secure the mantle of Arab leadership in their rivalry with Egypt and a genuine embrace of Arab identity by Iraq's leaders. The Egyptian government of Nahas Pasha launched a rival initiative for establishing closer inter-Arab relations, and sent delegations to several Arab states. Influential Arab nationalist figures in the country sought to emphasize Egypt's Arab character, the most of prominent of them, Abdul Rahman al-Azzam, even writing \\"Egypt was an Arab country before Christ.\\" The apparent Egyptian embrace of Arabism was met with general Arab excitement at the popular level and Pasha's efforts gained more traction among the various Arab governments than al-Said's Fertile Crescent proposal.Dawisha, p. 122. Reasons for this ranged from the antipathy of the Saudi royal family and the Damascus political establishment to the leadership ambitions of the rival Hashemite family to the belief by Lebanon's Maronite Christian community that Egypt's plan would not require conceding future independence. Between 25 September-8 October 1944, the leaders of Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Transjordan, Yemen and the Palestinian Arab community convened in Alexandria, Egypt in a meeting hosted by the Egyptian government which ended with an agreement known as the \\"Alexandria Protocol.\\"Dawisha, p. 123. =Peak under Egyptian leadership= Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser returns to cheering crowds in Cairo after announcing the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, August 1956. After the Second World War, Gamal Abdel Nasser, the leader of Egypt, was a significant player in the rise of Arab nationalism. Opposed to the British control of the Suez Canal Zone and concerned at Egypt becoming a Cold War battleground Nasser pushed for a collective Arab security pact within the framework of the Arab League. A key aspect of this was the need for economic aid that was not dependent on peace with Israel and the establishment of U.S. or British military bases within Arab countries. Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal and directly challenged the dominance of the Western powers in the region. At the same time he opened Egypt up as a Cold War zone by receiving aid and arms shipments from the Soviet bloc countries that were not dependent on treaties, bases and peace accords. However, because of the connotations for Cold War dominance of the region, Egypt also received aid from the US, who sought to promote the emerging Arab nationalism as a barrier to communism. The question of Palestine and opposition to Zionism became a rallying point for Arab nationalism from both a religious perspective and a military perspective. The fact that the Zionists were Jewish promoted a religious flavor to the xenophobic rhetoric and strengthened Islam as a defining feature of Arab nationalism. The humiliating defeat in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War strengthened the Arabs' resolve to unite in favor of a pan-Arab nationalist ideal. With the advent of Palestinian nationalism, a debate circled between those who believed that pan- Arab unity would bring about destruction of Israel (the view advocated by the Arab Nationalist Movement) or whether the destruction of Israel would bring about pan-Arab unity (the view advocated by Fatah).Karsh, Arafat's War, 35‚Äì36 Arab nationalists generally rejected religion as a main element in political identity, and promoted the unity of Arabs regardless of sectarian identity. However, the fact that most Arabs were Muslims was used by some as an important building block in creating a new Arab national identity. An example of this was Michel Aflaq, founder along with Salah al-Din al-Bitar and Zaki al-Arsuzi of the Ba'ath Party in Syria in the 1940s. Aflaq, though himself a Christian, viewed Islam as a testament to the \\"Arab genius\\", and once said \\"Muhammed was the epitome of all the Arabs. So let all the Arabs today be Muhammed.\\" Since the Arabs had reached their greatest glories through the expansion of Islam, Islam was seen as a universal message as well as an expression of secular genius on the part of the Arab peoples. Islam had given the Arabs a \\"glorious past\\", which was very different from the \\"shameful present\\". In effect, the troubles of the Arab presence were because the Arabs had diverged from their \\"eternal and perfect symbol\\", Islam. The Arabs needed to have a \\"resurrection\\" (ba'ath in Arabic). After the Ba'athist military coups in Iraq and Syria in the 1960s, the Ba'athists \\"contributed very little to the development of all-Arab nationalism, which was its original raison d'etre.\\" Meanwhile, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia sought to counter the influences of Arab nationalism and communism in the region by promoting pan- Islamism as an alternative. He called for the establishment of the Muslim World League, visiting several Muslim countries to advocate the idea. He also engaged in a propaganda and media war with Nasser. =Decline= After the defeat of the Arab coalition by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War‚Äîwhich the reigning Arab nationalist leader Nasser had dubbed al-Ma‚Äòraka al-Masiriya, (the battle of destiny)‚Äîthe Arab nationalist movement is said to have suffered an \\"irreversible\\" slide towards \\"political marginality\\". From the mid-1960s onward, the movement was further weakened by factional splits and ideological infighting. The formerly pro-Nasser Arab Nationalist Movement, publicly abandoned Nasserism in favor of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and fell apart soon after. In 1966, the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party split into rival factions based in Baghdad and Damascus, respectively. Reasons for decline Aside from the 1967 defeat, factors credited with weakening the movement include: *the elimination of many of the irritants that stoked nationalist passion as imperialism and pro-Westernism waned in the Arab world during the 1950s and early 1960s; :The historian Adeed Dawisha said: : > The British presence in Egypt and Iraq had been eliminated; the Baghdad Pact > had been defeated; Jordan's British chief of staff, Sir John Bagot Glubb, > had been dismissed; Lebanon's pro-Western president, Camille Chamoun, had > been replaced by the independent Fu'ad Shihab; and the Algerians, > sacrificing a million dead in a heroic struggle, had triumphed over French > colonial power. *regional attachments such as Iraqi president Abd al-Karim Qasim's \\"Iraq first\\" policy; *attachments to tribes and \\"deeply-ingrained tribal values\\"; *suspicion of Arab unity by minority groups such as Kurds in Iraq who were non-Arab, or Shia Arabs in Iraq who feared Arab nationalism was actually \\"a Sunni project\\" to establish \\"Sunni hegemony\\"; *the Islamic revival, which grew as Arab nationalism declined, and whose Islamist adherents were very hostile towards nationalism in general, believing it had no place in Islam; *lack of interest by the movement in pluralism, separation of powers, freedom of political expression and other democratic concepts which might have \\"resuscitated\\" the ideology in its moment of weakness. Attempts at unity Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser signing unity pact with Syrian president Shukri al-Quwatli, forming the United Arab Republic, February 1958 In the 1940s, rulers such as Abdullah I of Jordan and Nuri al-Said of Iraq sought to create an expanded Arab empire constructed out of the smaller nation-states that had been created in the mandate period. Abdullah's dream was to be king of a Greater Syria while as-Said's dream was for a Fertile Crescent Federation. These aspirations, however, were unpopular and met with suspicion in the countries they sought to conquer. The creation of the Arab League and its insistence on the territorial integrity and respect for sovereignty of each member state, the assassination of Abdullah, and the 14 July Revolution weakened the political feasibility of these ideas.Sela, 153 During much of the 20th century, the rivalry between Syria and Nasser in Egypt for who would lead the union undermined the effort of forming a united Arab state.Charles Smith. \\"The Arab-Israeli Conflict\\". (International Relations of the Middle East by Louise Fawcett), p. 220. In 1958, Egypt and Syria temporarily joined to create the United Arab Republic. It was accompanied by attempts to include Iraq and North Yemen in the union. This very exercise, while fostering Egypt's position at the centre of Arab politics, led to the weakening of Syria. With the 14 July Revolution taking place in Iraq the same year, Western powers feared the fallouts of a powerful Arab nationalism in the region. Foreign powers were not only concerned about the possible spread of such revolutionary movements in other Arab states, but also worried about losing the control and monopoly over the region's natural oil resources. However, due to discontent over the hegemony of Egypt and after a coup in Syria that introduced a more radical government to power, the United Arab Republic collapsed in 1961. The term United Arab Republic continued to be used in Egypt until 1971, after the death of Nasser. Another unsuccessful attempt at union occurred in 1963. That year the Arab nationalist Ba'ath Party came to power in Syria and Iraq and talks were held on uniting the two countries with Egypt. On 17 April an agreement to unite the countries was signed, but Ba'ath leaders complained of what they considered Egyptian president Nasser's \\"patronizing, bullying tone\\" and his insistence on a single centralized party structure under his leadership. In Syria, pro-Nasserists were purged from the Syrian military and cabinet. In response, large pro-Nasser riots erupted in Damascus and Aleppo but were crushed with 50 rioters killed. A pro-Nasser coup attempt on 18 July 1963 in Syria also ended unsuccessfully. Hundreds of people killed or wounded in an attempt to take over the Damascus radio station and army headquarters, and 27 rebel officers were summarily executed. Nasser then formally withdrew from the union agreement, denouncing the Syrian Ba'athists as \\"fascists and murderers\\".Seale, Patrick, Asad, the Struggle for the Middle East, University of California Press, 1989, p.83 In 1964, Egypt, Iraq and North Yemen formed a Unified Political Command in order to prepare the gradual merger in a new United Arab Republic, however, both projects failed in 1966 and 1967. In 1971 and 1972 Muammar Gaddafi attempted to unite Libya, Egypt, Sudan and Syria to form the Federation of Arab Republics.Sela, 155 This loose union lasted until 1977 when it split due to political and territorial disputes between the republics' leadership. In 1974, Muammar Gaddafi and Habib Bourguiba attempted their two nations of Libya and Tunisia to form the Arab Islamic Republic. The plan was rejected by Bourgiba due to his realization of unity of the Maghreb states. This would later become the Arab Maghreb Union. In October 1978, Iraqi President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr began working closely with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to foil the Camp David Accords. They signed a charter in Baghdad for Joint National Action which provided for the \\"closest form of unity ties\\" including \\"complete military unity\\" as well as \\"economic, political and cultural unification\\".Ma'oz, 153 An agreement to unify the two states was to come into effect in July 1979. However, Iraqi Vice President Saddam Hussein was fearful of losing his power to Assad (who was supposed to become the deputy leader in the new union) and forced al-Bakr into retirement under threat of violence.Dawisha, 214McDonald, 128 Although unity talks did continue between Assad and Saddam after July 1979, but Assad rejected Iraqi demands for a full merger between the two states and for the immediate deployment of Iraqi troops into Syria. Instead Assad, perhaps fearful of Iraqi domination and a new war with Israel, advocated a step-by-step approach. The unity talks were eventually suspended indefinitely after an alleged discovery of a Syrian plot to overthrow Saddam Hussein in November 1979.

Its objective is to pressure Israel to meet what it describes as Israel's obligations under international law, defined as withdrawal from the occupied territories, removal of the separation barrier in the West Bank, full equality for Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, and \\"respecting, protecting, and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties\\". The movement is organized and coordinated by the Palestinian BDS National Committee.\\"Palestinian BDS National Committee\\". BDS Movement, 9 July 2005. Archived on 31 January 2016 BDS is modeled after the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. Its proponents compare the Palestinians' plight to that of apartheid-era black South Africans.\\"Israel is new South Africa as boycott calls increase\\", Jonathan Owen, The Independent, 3 June 2012. Protests and conferences in support of the movement have been held in several countries. Its mascot, which features on its logotype, is Handala, a symbol of Palestinian identity and defiance. Critics say BDS is antisemitic, delegitimizes Israel, and resembles historical discrimination against Jews.Nasr, Joseph and Riham Alkousaa. \\"Germany designates BDS Israel boycott movement as anti-Semitic.\\" Reuters. 17 May 2019. 5 August 2020. \\"The motion said a BDS campaign calling for Israeli products to be labeled with 'Don‚Äôt Buy' stickers was reminiscent of the Nazi-era boycott of Jewish businesses.\\" Countering BDS is a top priority for the Israel lobby; it has successfully lobbied for laws targeting BDS supporters in many U.S. states.  Background  Area C (blue), the part of the West Bank under full Israeli control, in 2011 During the Second Intifada, groups of Palestinians, frustrated with the military occupation's brutality, began developing new nonviolent methods focused on garnering international support for pressuring Israel. This led to international calls for boycotts of Israeli institutions, including academic and cultural ones. In April 2002, during Operation Defensive Shield, a British-led initiative called for a moratorium on academic collaboration with Israeli institutions. It quickly racked up over 700 signatures, among them Colin Blakemore and Richard Dawkins, who said they could no longer \\"in good conscience continue to cooperate with official Israeli institutions, including universities.\\" Similar initiatives followed in the summer. In August, Palestinian organizations in the occupied territories called for a comprehensive boycott of Israel. In October 2003, a group of Palestinian intellectuals called for a boycott of Israeli academic institutions.\\"Boycotting the Israeli Academy\\". Lisa Taraki, ZNet, 19 August 2004 In 2004, an attempt to coordinate the boycotts gained momentum after the start of the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier. Colin Shindler has argued that the peace process's failure created a political void that allowed what had been a marginal rejectionist attitude to Israel to enter the European far-left mainstream in the form of proposals for a boycott.Colin Shindler,The Hebrew Republic: Israel's Return to History, Rowman & Littlefield 2017 p.xv. Others have argued that BDS should be understood in terms of its purported roots in the Arab League's boycott of Zionist goods from Mandatory Palestine. The Israeli anti-boycott law: Should artists be worried? Cardozo AELJ Israel's economic relations with Arab countries have thawed somewhat since then, and the League's boycott has been only sporadically enforced. According to the archaeologist and ancient historian Alex Joffe, BDS is merely the spearhead of a larger anti-Western juggernaut in which the dialectic between communism and Islam remains unresolved, and has antecedents in The Palestine Solidarity Campaign, the General Union of Palestinian Students and the Muslim Brotherhood.Alex Joffe, \\"Palestinians and Internationalization: Means and Ends.\\" Begin‚ÄìSadat Center for Strategic Studies. 26 November 2017. 28 November 2017. Andrew Pessin and Doron Ben-Atar contend that BDS has its origins in the 2001 Durban UN Conference against Racism. They believe BDS should be viewed in a historical context of other boycotts of Israel.  Philosophy and goals  BDS demands that Israel end its \\"three forms of injustices that infringe international law and Palestinian rights\\" by:\\"Palestinian Civil Society Call for BDS\\". BDS Movement, 9 July 2005. Archived on 31 January 2016 * Ending its occupation and colonization of all Arab lands occupied in 1967 and dismantling the Wall;According to Hitchcock, occupied in 1967 wasn't in the original BDS Call. She writes: \\"It is not clear who decided to revise this phrase or exactly why, but it is likely that this phrase was added to clarify that the statement refers only to the West Bank and Gaza and not to the entirety of Palestine including Israel inside the internationally recognized 1967 Green Line... While I was unable to find any credible discussion of how this clarifying phrase came to be inserted into later versions of the BDS call, is seems fair to guess that it may have been added after criticism by those who thought it was too suggestive of a one-state solution. The fact that the original 2005 Call text and wording remains publicly available on the BDS movement website and in other locations may still elicit different readings from different audiences, though.\\" * Recognizing the fundamental rights of the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality; and * Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN Resolution 194. These demands, enshrined in a declaration named the BDS Call, are non-negotiable to BDS. Co- founder of the movement Omar Barghouti, citing South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, has written: \\"I am not interested in picking up crumbs of compassion thrown from the table of someone who considers himself my master. I want the full menu of rights.\\" Barghouti has also written: BDS sees itself as a holistic movement for all Palestinians, whether they live in the West Bank, Gaza, Israel, or as refugees. BDS believes that negotiations with Israel should focus on \\"how Palestinian rights can be restored\\" and that they can only take place after Israel has recognized these rights. It frames the Israel-Palestinian conflict as between colonizer and colonized, between oppressor and oppressed, and rejects the notion that both parties are equally responsible for the conflict. For those reasons, BDS opposes some forms of dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians, which it argues are counterproductive. According to BDS, \\"all forms of international intervention and peace-making until now have failed\\" and so the international community should impose punitive measures, such as broad boycotts and divestment initiatives, against Israel, like those against South Africa during apartheid. BDS uses the framework of \\"freedom, justice, and equality,\\" arguing that Palestinians are entitled to those rights like everyone else. It is therefore an antiracist movement and rejects all forms of racism, including anti- Semitism and Islamophobia. More generally, BDS frames itself as part of a global social movement that challenges neoliberal Western hegemony and struggles against racism, sexism, poverty and similar causes. Its struggle for Palestinian rights should be seen as a small but critical part of that struggle, BDS argues. = Israel = BDS believes that Israel is an apartheid state as defined by two international treaties, the 1973 The International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid and the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. It says that while there are differences between Israel and apartheid-era South Africa, such as Israel's lack of explicit racial segregation laws, the systems are fundamentally similar. One of the main differences between South African and Israeli apartheid, BDS argues, is that in the former a white minority dominated a black minority, but in Israel, a Jewish majority discriminates against a Palestinian minority in Israel and also keeps Palestinians under military occupation. It further contends that South African apartheid depended on black labor while Israeli apartheid is grounded in efforts to expel Palestinians from \\"Greater Israel\\". BDS sees the Israeli legal definition of itself as a \\"Jewish and democratic state\\" as contradictory. According to BDS, Israel upholds a facade of democracy but is not and cannot be a democracy because it is, in Omar Barghouti's words, \\"a settler-colonial state.\\" Opponents argue that comparing Israel to South Africa's apartheid regime is \\"demonizing Israel\\" and anti-Semitic. Supporters argue that there is nothing anti-Semitic in calling Israel an apartheid state. To support that view, they cite prominent anti-apartheid activists such as Desmond Tutu and South African politician Ronnie Kasrils, who both have said that the situation in Gaza and the West Bank is \\"worse\\" than apartheid. = Right of return = BDS demands that Israel allow the Palestinian refugees displaced in the 1948 war to return to what is now Israel. The international community has repeatedly reaffirmed the refugees' right to return, but Israel has prevented them from returning. According to BDS's critics, calling for their right to return is an attempt to destroy Israel. If the refugees returned, Israel would become a Palestinian- majority state and Jewish dominance of Israel would be in jeopardy. They argue that this would undermine the Jewish people's right to self-determination and thus calling for it is a form of anti-Semitism.\\"Boycotts, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Resource Page\\". NGO Monitor. 14 July 2011. 1 June 2013. Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League has called it \\"the destruction of the Jewish state through demography.\\" Nadia Abu el-Haj has written, \\"Yes, this is a challenge to the state's future‚Äîthat is, those of us advocating for boycott and divestment think that the Israeli state has no right to continue exist as a racial state that builds the distinction between Jew and non-Jew into its citizenship laws, its legal regimes, its education system, its economy, and its military and policing tactics.\\" BDS supporters further note that the Palestinian liberation movement has always rejected the idea that Israel has a right to exist as a racial state. While BDS deliberately refrains from advocating any particular political outcome, such as the one-state or two-state solution, Barghouti argues that a Jewish state in historical Palestine contravenes the Palestinians' rights: Norman Finkelstein, a vocal supporter of the two-state solution, offers scathing criticism of BDS on this issue. Like Foxman, Finkelstein believes that BDS seeks to end Israel through demography, something he believes Israel will never acquiesce to. He therefore calls BDS a \\"dishonest cult\\" because it does not explicitly state that its goal is to end Israel and because, according to him, that goal is unrealistic and broad public support cannot be found for the return of the refugees. However, he believes that BDS's tactics, boycotts, divestment, and sanctions, are correct. Ali Abunimah, in a reply to Finkelstein, insists that the two- state solution is compatible with BDS's demands and that the Good Friday Agreement that settled the conflict in Northern Ireland could serve as model for the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Finkelstein's criticism ignores history, Barghouti argues: apartheid was abolished in South Africa, so it can be abolished in Israel too. = Normalization = BDS describes \\"normalization\\" as a process by which Palestinians are compelled to stop resisting and to accept their subjugation. BDS sees it as a \\"colonization of the mind\\" whereby the oppressed subject comes to believe that the oppressor‚Äôs reality is the only reality and the oppression a fact of life. BDS opposes normalization as a means to resist oppression. Normalization, BDS says, can arise when Israelis and Palestinians in the occupied territories meet without the Israeli side acknowledging the fundamental injustices Israel inflicts on the Palestinians, corresponding to the BDS s's three demands. BDS calls it \\"co-existence\\" and argues that it feeds complacency and privileges the oppressor at the expense of the oppressed. Instead, BDS encourages \\"co-resistance,\\" where \\"anti- colonial Jewish Israelis\\" and Palestinians come together to fight against the injustices afflicting the Palestinians. Similarly, BDS denounces projects bringing Palestinians and Israelis together without addressing the struggle for Palestinian rights. BDS asserts: \\"Dialogue, 'healing,' and 'reconciliation' processes that do not aim to end oppression, regardless of the intentions behind them, serve to privilege oppressive co-existence at the cost of co-resistance\\". It also denounces projects that portray the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians as symmetrical: \\"This is not a symmetric struggle where ‚Äòboth sides‚Äô are ‚Äòin conflict‚Äô and where the most effective remedy is to promote dialogue and coexistence to overcome ‚Äòentrenched hatred‚Äô and reach a compromise on ‚Äòcompeting claims‚Äô, as often portrayed in the mainstream Western media. This is a case of occupation, settler-colonialism and apartheid by one side over the other.\\" One example of a project BDS denounces is OneVoice, a joint Palestinian-Israeli youth- oriented organization that brings Israelis and Palestinians together under the slogan of ending the occupation and establishing a Palestinian state. Since OneVoice concerns itself with neither Israeli apartheid nor Palestinian refugees' rights, BDS concludes that it serves to normalize oppression and injustice. Critics of \\"anti-normalization\\" rhetorically ask how BDS is supposed to win over the hearts and minds of unconvinced Jewish Israelis if a precondition for dialogue is that they first commit to BDS's principles. They believe that dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians can convince Jewish Israelis that BDS's demands are just. Barghouti argues that the \\"peace industry,\\" the many dialogue initiatives launched in the 1990s in the aftermath of the Oslo Accords, has not helped the Palestinians at all. According to him, they have failed to produce results because they are based on the false premise that the conflict is between two equals, rather than about one group oppressing another. He further argues that dialogue needs to be based on freedom, equality, democracy, and ending injustice, or else it is at best a form of negotiation between a stronger and weaker party. Founding and organization BDS was founded on 9 July 2005, on the first anniversary of the advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice in which the West Bank barrier was declared a violation of international law. 171 Palestinian non-governmental organizations representing every aspect of Palestinian civil society adopted the BDS Call, calling for international boycotts of Israel.\\"Introducing the BDS Movement\\". BDS Movement. Accessed April 2016 The Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC) was established at the first Palestinian BDS conference in Ramallah in November 2007 and in 2008 it became the reference and guiding force of BDS. All members of the BNC are Palestinian organizations. As of 2020, the BNC has 29 members. The BNC is governed by an 11-seat secretariat elected every two years by the BNC. Mahmoud Nawajaa serves as the BNC's General Coordinator. Riya Hassan serves as the Europe Campaigns Officer of the BNC. A precursor to BDS is the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI), which was founded in April 2004 in Ramallah with Barghouti as a founding committee member.\\"History\\", PACBI website, 21 December 2008. Archived 3 December 2014.SodaStream controversy continues to bubble. Patrick Strickland, Al Jazeera, 11 February 2014\\"Academic boycotter to study in Tel Aviv\\". Anshel Pfeffer, The Jewish Chronicle, 23 April 2009 PACBI led the campaign for the academic and cultural boycotts of Israel. It has since been integrated into the larger BDS movement. The U.S. arm of PACBI, the United States Association for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (USACBI), was founded in 2009. The global BDS movement is by design highly decentralized and independent. This has allowed thousands of organizations and groups to become part of it, some of which are the BNC's main partners. In Israel, BDS is supported by a number of left-wing groups, such as Women in Black, ICAHD, ACRI, and New Profile. Boycott from Within often uses creative performances to display its support for the boycott and the research group Who Profits supplies BDS with information about companies complicit in the Israeli occupation. On campuses in the US, Canada and New Zealand, the student organization Students for Justice in Palestine supports BDS. According to the American coordinating body National Students for Justice in Palestine, it had about 200 chapters in the US as of 2018. The left-wing activist organization Jewish Voice for Peace advocates BDS among American Jewry. In addition to these, political parties, trade unions and other NGOs have endorsed the BDS Call.  Methods  BDS protest in Melbourne, Australia against Israel's 2007‚Äìpresent Gaza blockade and 2010 attack on a humanitarian flotilla, June 2010 BDS organizes campaigns for boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel. Boycotts are facilitated by urging the public to avoid purchasing goods made by Israeli companies, divestment by urging banks, pension funds, international companies, etc. to stop doing business in Israel, and sanctions by pressuring governments to end military trade and free-trade agreements with Israel and to suspend Israel's membership in international forums. Global targets for boycott are selected by the BNC, but supporters are free to choose targets that suit them. The BNC encourages supporters to select targets based on their complicity in Israel's human rights violations, potential for cross-movement solidarity, media appeal, and likelihood of success. It also emphasizes the importance of creating campaigns and events that connect with issues of concern in their own communities. At the grassroots level, BDS uses social media, petitions, articles, on-campus events and organizes public demonstrations to apply pressure on individuals and corporations to cut ties with Israeli institutions.\\"Palestinians urge Oscar nominees to reject Israel junket\\". Ali Abunimah, Electronic Intifada, 10 February 2016  Campaigns and activities  In addition to the campaigns listed in this section, a number of local campaigns have been created by BDS- affiliated groups and endorsed by the movement, including Code Pink's Stolen Beauty campaign launched in 2009 against Israeli cosmetics manufacturer Ahava, an Australian campaign against Max Brenner, whose parent company, the Strauss Group, sent care packages to Israeli soldiers, and a campaign by the group Vermonters for Just Peace in Palestine against ice-cream maker Ben & Jerry over its sales of ice cream in Israeli settlements. ;Israel Apartheid Week (2005-) Groups affiliated with BDS hold events known as Israel Apartheid Week (IAW) in February or March each year. IAW began in Toronto in 2005, but has since spread and in 2014 was held on 250 campuses worldwide. According to BDS, the events' aim is to raise awareness of Israel's apartheid regime. IAW allows activists to frame the issue as one of racial oppression and discrimination rather than a \\"conflict\\" between two equal sides. According to BDS's opponents, the events are intended to link Israel to evils such as apartheid and racism. ;Derail Veolia and Alstom (2008-) Since November 2008, BDS has campaigned against the multinational French conglomerates Veolia and Alstom for their involvement in the Jerusalem Light Rail because it runs through the Israeli-occupied parts of East Jerusalem. According to BDS, the boycott had cost Veolia an estimated $20 billion as of 2015. In 2015 Veolia sold off its final investment in Israel, a 5% state in CityPass owned by its subsidiary Transdev. BDS attributed the sell-off to its campaign, but Richard Dujardin, a member of Transdev's executive committee, said: \\"I will not say that it is pleasant to be chased by people saying we are not good guys all the time but really it was a business decision.\\" ;Stop G4S (2012-) Since 2012 BDS has campaigned against G4S, the world's biggest security company, to get it to divest from Israel. The campaign's first success came in October 2011, when the student council of the Edinburgh University Students' Association adopted a motion to ban G4S from campus. In 2014 the Gates Foundation sold its $170 million state in G4S, a move BDS activists attributed to their campaign. The same year activists thanked officials in Durham County, North Carolina, for terminating its contract with G4S, though it wasn't clear that BDS's campaign was the cause. In February 2016, Crepes & Waffles terminated its security transport contracts with G4S.G4S loses major contract in Colombia after BDS campaign , Middle East Monitor, 26 February 2016. G4S sold off its Israeli subsidiary G4S Israel in 2016, but BDS continues to campaign against G4S because it maintains a 50% stake in Policity, an Israeli police training center with presence inside Israeli prisons where thousands of Palestinians are detained. ;Boycott HP (2016-) BDS runs a boycott campaign against the multinational information technology company Hewlett-Packard's two successors, HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which it says are complicit in \\"Israel's occupation, settler-colonialism and apartheid regime\\". According to the campaign, HP supplies Israel with a biometric ID card system used to restrict Palestinians' freedom of movement and provides servers for the Israel Prison Service. In April 2019, Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging, the Netherlands' largest trade union, dropped HP in its offer to its members. According to a spokesperson for the boycott HP campaign, the union used to offer a 15% discount on HP products and this would no longer be the case. In June 2019, Unite, the UK's second-largest trade union, joined the boycott against HP.\\"Unite joins boycott of Hewlett Packard over company's complicity in Palestinian rights violations.\\" Morning Star. ;Orange (2016-) In January 2016, it was reported that French telecom operator Orange would end its licensing agreement with Israel's second-largest mobile company, Partner Communications. According to BDS, the deal was the result of its six-year campaign by unions and activists in France, Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco. While BDS hailed the move as a significant victory, Orange said it was ending its relationship with Partner for purely commercial reasons. ;AXA Divest (2016-) The French multinational insurance agent AXA has since 2016 been the target of a campaign urging it to divest from Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems and five major Israeli banks. AXA has, according to BDS, a responsible investment policy that forbids it from investing in, among other things, manufacturers of cluster bombs, and Elbit Systems makes cluster bombs. According to a report by corporate responsibility watchdog SumOfUs, AXA's involvement in Israel's occupation could expose it to criminal prosecution. ;Red Card Israel (2016-) Red Card Israel is BDS's campaign to get Israel expelled from FIFA due to alleged violations against Palestinian football and because several Israeli teams from the Israeli-occupied West Bank are allowed to play in its national league, the Israel Football Association. In 2018, it scored a victory as Argentina's national football team canceled an upcoming friendly game in Jerusalem. ;Puma (2018-) In July 2018, sportswear manufacturer Puma signed a for-year sponsorship deal with the Israel Football Association (IFA). The IFA includes six football clubs based in Israeli settlements. BDS wrote an open letter signed by over 200 Palestinian sports clubs urging the brand to end its sponsorship of teams in the settlements. The sportswear manufacturer didn't, and BDS therefore launched a boycott campaign under the slogan \\"Give Puma the Boot\\". In October 2019, activists placed unauthorized posters in the London underground urging people to boycott Puma. Transport for London said that it was flyposting and that it would immediately take action against the posters. In February 2020, Malaysia's largest university, Universiti Teknologi MARA, announced that it would end its sponsorship deal with Puma due to its involvement in Israel. ;Boycott Eurovision 2019 (2018-2019) BDS ran a campaign to get artists to boycott Eurovision Song Contest 2019, which was held in Tel Aviv in Israel. BDS accused Israel of using Eurovision to whitewash and distract attention from alleged war crimes against Palestinians. It also accused Israel of pinkwashing, due to Eurovision's popularity among LGBTQ fans. Although none of the acts scheduled to appear pulled out, activists considered the campaign successful due to the controversy it generated. American pop star Madonna was one of the artists BDS urged to cancel her appearance at Eurovision. Roger Waters of Pink Floyd also tried to get her to cancel, saying that it \\"normalizes the occupation, the apartheid, the ethnic cleansing, the incarceration of children, the slaughter of unarmed protesters.\\" Madonna refused, saying that she would neither \\"stop playing music to suit someone's political agenda\\" nor \\"stop speaking out against violations of human rights wherever in the world they may be.\\"Israel brushes off Eurovision boycott calls with a big assist from Madonna In September 2018, 140 artists (including six Israelis) signed an open letter in support of a boycott of Eurovision. In response to the calls for boycott, over 100 celebrities, including English actor Stephen Fry, signed a statement against boycotting Eurovision in Israel: \\"We believe the cultural boycott movement is an affront to both Palestinians and Israelis who are working to advance peace through compromise, exchange, and mutual recognition\\". Hatari, the band representing Iceland in the contest, held up Palestinian banners in front of the cameras at the event's finals, defying the EBU's rules against political gestures. BDS was not mollified: \\"Artists who insist on crossing the Palestinian boycott picket line, playing in Tel Aviv in defiance of our calls, cannot offset the harm they do to our human rights struggle by ‚Äòbalancing‚Äô their complicit act with some project with Palestinians. Palestinian civil society overwhelmingly rejects this fig- leafing,\\" it said. ; Divestment campaigns at U.S. universities In North America, many public and private universities have large financial holdings. Campus BDS activists have therefore organized campaigns asking universities to divest from companies complicit in the occupation. These campaigns often revolve around attempts to pass divestment resolutions in the school's student government. While few universities have heeded the call to divest, activists believe the resolutions are symbolically important. According to the Jewish Virtual Library, activists have fielded 135 divestment resolutions since 2005, of which 91, including those vetoed by the student government president or repealed, were defeated. In 2009, Hampshire College became the first U.S. college to divest from companies profiting from Israel's occupation as its board of trustees voted to sell its shares in Caterpillar, Terex, Motorola, ITT, General Electric, and United Technologies. Hampshire's president said that SJP's campaigning brought about the decision, but members of the board of trustees denied that. In 2010, the UC Berkeley Student Senate passed a resolution calling for the university to divest from companies that conduct business with Israel. The resolution was vetoed by the Student Body president, who said it was \\"a symbolic attack on a specific community.\\" In 2013, another divestment bill passed but the university stated that it would not divest. Many divestment campaigns began in the early 2000s, years before BDS was founded. In some cases, it has taken them over a decade to get resolutions passed. For example, at the University of Michigan, a student group called Students Allied for Freedom and Equality (SAFE) began campaigning for a divestment resolution in 2002. It was brought up for the eleventh time in 2017 and passed 23-17 with five abstentions. Reportedly, the hearing on the resolution was the longest in student government history. In December, the Board of Regents at the university rejected the resolution, stating, \\"we strongly oppose any action involving the boycott, divestment or sanction of Israel.\\" Also in 2002, students at Columbia University began promoting a divestment resolution, which passed in 2020. In 2019, Brown University became the first Ivy league university to pass a divestment resolution, with 69% of the students in favor and 31% against. BDS opponents often focus on the supposed divisiveness debates about divestment resolutions cause. According to Nelson, the primary effect divestment resolutions have is the promotion of anti-Israel (and sometimes antisemitic) sentiment within student bodies, faculty, and academic departments. Some opponents argue that activists promoting divestment resolutions often cheat or operate clandestinely. They claim that resolutions are often sprung with minimal notice, giving the opposition no time to react, that activists bring outsiders to influence opinion or to vote on university resolutions even when this is unauthorized, and that activists change the text of resolutions once passed. Judea Pearl believes that to BDS supporters it is irrelevant whether a particular resolution passes or not because the real goal is to keep the debate alive and influence future policymakers to find fault with Israel.  Academic boycott  Universities have been primary targets of the BDS movement, according to English professor Cary Nelson, \\"because faculty and students can become passionate about justice, sometimes without adequate knowledge about the facts and consequences. ... [U]niversities also offer the potential for small numbers of BDS activists to leverage institutional status and reputation for a more significant cultural and political impact.\\"Cary Nelson and Gabriel Brahm, The Case Against Academic Boycotts of Israel (MLA Members for Scholars Rights, 2015), 13. Qtd. in Pessin, Introduction, Anti-Zionism on Campus, 6. BDS argues that there is a close connection between Israeli academic institutions and the Israeli state, including its military, and that an academic boycott is warranted. Modern weapon systems and military doctrines used by the Israeli military are developed at Israeli universities that also use a system of economic merit and scholarship to students who serve in the army. Like the BDS-led cultural boycott, the academic boycott targets Israeli institutions and not individual academics. The events and activities BDS encourages academics to avoid include academic events convened or co-sponsored by Israel, research and development activities that involve institutional cooperation agreements with Israeli universities, projects that receive funding from Israel or its lobby groups, addresses and talks by officials from Israeli academic institutions at international venues, study-abroad programmes in Israel for international students, and publishing in Israeli academic journals or serving on such journals' review boards. = Reception = Thousands of scholars, including luminaries such as the late theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, and a large number of academic and student associations have endorsed the academic boycott against Israel. Some of the U.S. endorsers are the American Studies Association, the American Anthropological Association, the Association for Asian American Studies, the Association for Humanist Sociology, the National Association of Chicana and Chicano Studies, the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association, the Middle East Studies Association, the National Women's Studies Association along with dozens of other student associations. In 2007, the American Jewish Committee ran an ad in The Times titled \\"Boycott Israeli universities? Boycott ours, too!\\" It was initially signed by 300 university presidents and denounced the academic boycott against Israel. It argued that an academic boycott would be \\"utterly antithetical to the fundamental values of the academy, where we will not hold intellectual exchange hostage to the political disagreements of the moment.\\" Phil Gasper, writing for the International Socialist Review, argued that the ad grossly misrepresented the argument proponents of the boycott make and that its characterization of it as \\"political disagreements of the moment\\" was trivializing. In December 2013, the American Studies Association (ASA) joined the boycott of Israeli academic institutions.Redden, Elizabeth. \\"Backing the Israel Boycott\\". Inside Higher Ed. 17 December 2013. Israel is the only nation the ASA has boycotted in the 52 years since its founding.

After critics called a letter to the student antisemitic, Cheney- Lippold said he supported BDS for human rights reasons and rejected antisemitism. Guidelines from PACBI say faculty \\"should not accept to write recommendations for students hoping to pursue studies in Israel\\".Michigan professor embroiled in Israel boycott row, BBC, 21 September 2018University of Michigan professor refuses to write letter for student to study abroad in Israel, CBS, Jason Silverstein, 18 September 2018 58 civil rights, religious, and education advocacy organizations called on the university to sanction Cheney-Lippold.JEWISH GROUPS WANT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN TO SANCTION PROFESSOR, JPost, 25 September 2018 University officials ended the controversy by disciplining himBandler, Aaron. \\"U Mich Disciplines Professor Who Denied Rec Letter to Student Studying in Israel.\\" Jewish Journal. 9 October 2018. 10 October 2018. and issuing a public statement that read in part, \\"Withholding letters of recommendation based on personal views does not meet our university‚Äôs expectations for supporting the academic aspirations of our students. Conduct that violates this expectation and harms students will not be tolerated and will be addressed with serious consequences. Such actions interfere with our students' opportunities, violate their academic freedom and betray our university's educational mission.\\"Schlissel, Mark S. and Martin A. Philbert. \\"Letter: Important questions around issues of personal beliefs, our responsibilities as educators, and anti-Semitism.\\" Office of the President. 9 October 2018. 10 October 2018.  Cultural boycott  BDS believes that Israel uses culture as a form of propaganda to whitewash and justify its regime of occupation, settler-colonialism and apartheid over the Palestinian people. Therefore, it argues, Israel should be subjected to a cultural boycott like the one against apartheid-era South Africa. According to BDS, most, but not all, Israeli cultural institutions have \\"cast their lot with the hegemonic Zionist establishment in Israel\\" and are therefore implicated in Israel's crimes and should be boycotted by cultural organizations and workers worldwide. BDS distinguishes between individuals and institutions. Unlike the cultural boycott against South Africa, BDS's cultural boycott does not target individuals. BDS supports the right to freedom of expression and rejects boycotts based on identity or opinion. Thus, Israeli cultural products are not per se subject to boycott. But if a person is representing Israel, aids its efforts to \\"rebrand\\" itself, or is commissioned by an official Israeli body, then their activities are subject to the institutional boycott BDS is calling for. BDS also argues for a boycott of \\"normalization projects\\", which it defines as The only Israeli-Palestinian projects that BDS favors are those in which the Israeli party recognizes the three rights enumerated in the \\"BDS Call\\" and that also emphasize resistance to oppression over coexistence. BDS strongly discourages \\"fig-leafing\\" by international culture workers‚Äîattempts to \\"compensate\\" for participating in Israeli events using \\"balancing gestures\\" that promote Palestinian rights. BDS argues that fig-leafing contributes to the false perception of symmetry between the colonial oppressor and the colonized. = Reception = The cultural boycott has been supported by thousands of artists around the world, such as musician Roger Waters and American author Alice Walker. In 2015, more than 1,000 British artists pledged their support for the boycott, drawing parallels to the one against South African apartheid: Many artists are not heeding BDS's call not to perform in Israel, arguing that: * Performing in a country is not the same as supporting that country's regime;  * By performing in Israel, artists have a chance to tell the Israelis what they feel about their regime and that can help bring peace;  * By not performing in Israel, artists sever contacts with Israel's strongly pro-Palestinian cultural community, which risks hardening opposition to the Palestinian struggle among Israelis;  * BDS supporters like Roger Waters and Brian Eno who urge fellow artists not to perform in Israel are engaging in a form of bullying. = Controversies = The organizers of the weeklong Rototom Sunsplash music festival held in Spain in 2015 cancelled the scheduled appearance of Jewish American rapper Matisyahu after he refused to sign a statement supporting a Palestinian state. Matisyahu said that it was \\"appalling and offensive\\" that he was singled out as the \\"one publicly Jewish-American artist\\".Matisyahu Kicked Off European Festival Over Palestinian Politics. Kory Grow, 17 August 2015 After criticism from Spain's daily paper El Pa√≠s and the Spanish government as well as Jewish organisations, the organisers apologised to Matisyahu and reinvited him to perform, saying they \\"made a mistake, due to the boycott and the campaign of pressure, coercion and threats employed by the BDS Pa√≠s Valenci√†.\\" BDS Pa√≠s Valenci√† denied that Matisyahu was targeted because he is Jewish, writing that they tried to get him cancelled because of his views on Israel. In particular, they noted that he had played at a fundraiser for the IDF and at a conference for AIPAC and had defended Israel's boarding of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla in international waters.Goldberg, J.J. \\"How Matisyahu Ban ....\\" Forward. 21 August 2015. 2 August 2020. Mark LeVine commented that it would hardly have been surprising if a festival had canceled a Palestinian-American rapper who professed support for Hamas. In July 2019, after the Open Source Festival in D√ºsseldorf disinvited the American rapper Talib Kweli for refusing to denounce the BDS movement, 103 artists, including Peter Gabriel, Naomi Klein and Boots Riley, signed an open letter condemning Germany's attempts to impose restrictions on artists who support Palestinian rights.  Impact =Economic= The economic impact of BDS's and other boycott initiatives on Israel is disputed, with proponents generally saying that the impact has been major and opponents that it has been minor. In June 2015, a RAND Corporation study estimated that a successful BDS campaign against Israel, could cost the Israeli economy a cumulative $47 billion over ten years. The figure was based on a model that examined previous international boycotts; the report noted that making an assessment of BDS's economic effects is difficult because evidence of the effectiveness of sanctions is mixed.Study: Peace would boost Israel's economy $123b by 2024 by Niv Elis, The Jerusalem Post, 6 June 2015. A leaked Israeli government report estimated a more modest $1.4 billion per year. Pessin and Ben-Atar have argued that since Israel's gross domestic product nearly doubled between 2006 and 2015 and foreign investment in Israel tripled during the same period, BDS has not had a significant impact on Israel's economy. A 2015 Israeli Knesset report concluded that BDS had no impact on Israel's export-dependent economy and that exports to Europe were growing. Adam Reuter of the Israeli Reuter Meydan Investment House has argued that boycotts of consumer goods are ineffective because 95% of Israel's exports are business-to-business. Proponents of BDS point to a number of public and private organizations that have divested from Israel. In 2014, it was reported that Luxembourg's state pension fund, FDC, had excluded eight major Israeli firms, including Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, AFI Group and the American firm Motorola Solutions as part of its socially responsible investments programme. Norway's YMCA-YWCA joined the boycott in 2014, announcing that it would support \\"[a] broad economic boycott of goods and services from Israel and Israeli settlements\\".Norwegian YMCA embraces boycott Israel policy, Jewish Telegraphic Agency (reprinted in The Jerusalem Post), 2 March 2014.Jewish NGO wants YMCA rapped for Israel boycott, The Local, 14 March 2014. =Non-economic= According to Haaretz columnist and Brown University student Jared Samilow, BDS's most significant impact is the social cost it puts upon Jews living outside Israel.Samilow, Jared. \\"Students for Justice in Palestine at Brown University.\\" Anti-Zionism on Campus, Pessin and Ben-Atar, Indiana UP, 2018, pp. 384-389. A 2016 poll found that 58% of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza think BDS has had a positive impact, and 14% believe it to be negative. Reviewing four lists of achievements published by the BDS movement between July 2017 and December 2018, analyst Amin Prager concluded that, with some exceptions, the impact was limited but that BDS's greatest potential effect arises from its long-term aim to influence discourse about Israel's legitimacy and international standing.  Countering BDS  Countering BDS is a top priority for the Israel lobby, which believes BDS is an \\"existential threat\\" to Israel.Whether or not BDS is actually an \\"existential threat\\" to Israel has been debated even within the pro-Israel community. It has organized a counter-campaign to oppose BDS, relying on strategies of defamation, intimidation, and lawfare. = Blacklisting activists = One tactic the counter-campaign uses to silence activists in academia is blacklisting. This can cause students and untenured faculty, who worry about reprisals and negative publicity, to refrain from activism. The best-known blacklist is the anonymous website Canary Mission, which publishes photos and personal information about students and faculty who promote BDS. The website has threatened to send students' names to prospective employees. According to the Intercept, the website has made it harder for activists to organize activities because people worry that they will end up on the site. Activists listed on the site have reported receiving death threats. Another blacklist was the now defunct outlawbds.com, operated by the Israeli private intelligence agency Psy-Group. It sent threatening emails to BDS activists in New York, warning them that they had been identified as \\"BDS promoter[s].\\" Many activists have attempted to defuse the chilling effects of blacklisting by treating inclusion on blacklists as a badge of honor or by attempting to get themselves blacklisted. = Anti-BDS laws and resolutions = In response to BDS, several legislatures have passed laws designed to hinder people and organizations from boycotting Israel and goods from Israeli settlements. Proponents of such laws say that they are necessary because BDS is a form of antisemitism. Opponents say that Israel and its supporters are engaging in lawfare and that anti-BDS laws infringe upon the right to free speech. In the US, a large number of anti-BDS laws have been passed. As of 2020, 32 states have laws that prevent boycotts against Israel and a number of non-binding resolutions have been passed denouncing BDS. A majority of these have passed with strong bipartisan support. Two federal acts have been introduced, the 2017 Israel Anti-Boycott Act and the 2019 Combating BDS Act, both intended to deprive entities participating in boycotts of Israel of government contract work. In several states, these laws have been challenged on First Amendment grounds for violating citizens' freedom of speech. Supporters of anti-BDS statutes argue that boycotts are economic activity, rather than speech, and that laws prohibiting government contracts with groups that boycott Israel are similar to other anti-discrimination laws that have been upheld as constitutional. Opponents, such as the ACLU, contend that the laws are not analogous to anti-discrimination legislation because they only target boycotts of Israel. Texas, Kansas, and Arizona have amended their anti- BDS laws in response to lawsuits.Bandler, Aaron. \\"Federal Court Upholds Amended Arizona Anti-BDS Law.\\" Jewish Journal. 10 January 2020. 10 January 2020.Kampeas, Ron. \\"After legal challenges, Texas moves to amend its Israel boycott law.\\" Jewish Telegraphic Agency. 11 April 2019. 10 January 2020. Israel has enacted two anti-BDS laws, the 2011 Law for Prevention of Damage to State of Israel through Boycott and the 2017 Amendment No. 28 to the Entry Into Israel Law. The former criminalizes calls to boycott Israel and the latter prohibits foreigners who call for such boycotts from entering Israel or its settlements. In 2019, Israel caused some controversy by denying entry to two BDS-supporting U.S. Representatives, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar. = Israel's counter-measures = In Israel, the counter-campaign is led by the Ministry of Strategic Affairs. In 2015, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the Ministry would receive over 100 million shekels as well as ten employees to fight BDS. Some of the funds have been used to buy space in the Israeli press to promote its anti-BDS message. In June 2016, Haaretz reported that Israeli Ministry of Strategic Affairs was going to establish a \\"dirty tricks\\" unit to \\"establish, hire or tempt nonprofit organizations or groups not associated with Israel, in order to disseminate\\" negative information about BDS supporters. The news came on the heels of a report that Israel's efforts to fight BDS had been ineffectual, in part because the responsibility had been transferred to the Strategic Affairs Ministry from the Foreign Ministry. \\"Despite receiving expanded authority in 2013 to run the government's campaign against the delegitimization and boycott efforts against Israel, the Strategic Affairs Ministry did not make full use of its budget and had no significant achievements in this area,\\" Haaretz quotes the report as saying. \\"In 2015, it still did not carry out its work plans.\\" In 2017, the cabinet allocated 128 million shekels over three years for a front company but it spent only 13 million with little to show by way of results. On 21 March 2017, Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan announced a plan to set up a database of Israeli citizens who support BDS. The database would be compiled using open sources such as Facebook and social media posts. Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit objected, saying that only the Israeli secret police, Shin Bet, has the authority to monitor citizens in that way. Arab Israeli Knesset member Ayman Odeh slammed the idea, saying the government was afraid of a nonviolent struggle against occupation. The Israeli government has threatened and harassed leading BDS activists. In March 2016, Israeli Intelligence and Atomic Energy Minister Yisrael Katz argued that Israel should employ \\"targeted civil eliminations\\" against BDS leaders. The expression puns on the Hebrew word for targeted assassinations.Mairav Zonszein, 'In Israel, BDS is winning,'+972 magazine 28 March 2016. In response, Amnesty International issued a statement expressing its concern about the safety and liberty of Barghouti and other BDS activists. Barghouti has been the target of several travel bans and in 2019 the Israeli government announced that it was preparing to expel him. On 31 July 2020, Israeli soldiers arrested Mahmoud Nawajaa, General Coordinator of BNC, in his home near Ramallah and detained him for 19 days. In 2018 a new code of ethics was adopted for Israeli universities. The code prohibits faculty from calling for or participating in boycotts of Israel. In 2020 it was revealed that an Israeli state-funded lobby group had been instrumental in pushing for anti-BDS laws in many U.S. states. 'U.S. pro-Israel groups failed to disclose grants from Israeli government,' The Forward 31 August 2020. Barghouti sees Israel's heavy-handed measures to counter BDS as a sign that the state is getting nervous.  Palestinian reactions  BDS enjoys overwhelming support among Palestinians living in the occupied Palestinian territories. In a poll from 2015, 86% supported the boycott campaign, 64% believed that boycotting would help end the occupation, and 88% said they had stopped buying Israeli products. The number of Palestinian civil society organizations that support BDS has been rising steadily since its inception in 2005. Some of the Palestinian NGOs supporting BDS are umbrella organizations, such as the Palestinian NGOs Network, which has 135 members as of 2020. According to Melanie Meinzer, many Palestinian NGOs refrain from endorsing BDS because their dependence on donors constrain their politics. According to Finkelstein, BDS is exaggerating its level of support and many Palestinian NGOs endorsing it are small, one-person NGOs. Palestinian trade unions have been very supportive of BDS; the 290,000-member Palestine General Federation of Trade Unions was one of the original signatories of the BDS Call. In 2011, the Palestinian Trade Union Coalition for BDS was created with the objective of promoting BDS among trade unions internally. Leading voices in the Palestinian diaspora, such as Ali Abunimah,Ali Abunmiah,, 'Why Israel won't survive,' Electronic Intifada, 10 November 2009. Joseph Massad, and Linda Sarsour have thrown their weight behind BDS, as have several Palestinian members of the Israeli parliament, including Haneen Zoabi, Basel Ghattas, and Jamal Zahalka. The Palestinian leadership's position on BDS is ambivalent. President Mahmoud Abbas does not support a general boycott against Israel and has said that the Palestinians don't either. Barghouti has disputed Abbas's statement, saying that \\"[t]here is no Palestinian political party, trade union, NGO network or mass organization that does not strongly support BDS. Abbas does, however, support a boycott of goods produced in Israeli settlements, and the Palestinian Authority has at times used boycotts to gain leverage on Israel. For example, in 2015, it imposed a boycott on six major Israeli food manufacturers to retaliate against Israel withholding Palestinian tax funds. The second-highest authority of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the Palestinian Central Council, has meanwhile announced its intention to: A handful of Palestinian scholars have opposed the academic boycott of Israel. Examples include former Al-Quds University president Sari Nusseibeh, who acknowledges that his view is the minority viewpoint among his colleagues. Some Palestinian academics have criticized Nusseibeh's collaboration with Hebrew University, seeing it as a form of normalization. Matthew Kalman speculated in The New York Times that opposition to boycott is more widespread among Palestinian academics but that they are afraid to speak out.\\"Palestinian academic opposes Israel boycott\\" AP, Ynetnews 18 June 2006 Palestinian-Israeli video blogger Nas Daily has expressed opposition to boycotts of Israel. BDS has in turn denounced him for engaging in normalization. Support= South African support = BDS has received support from South African organizations and public figures that were involved in the struggle against apartheid. Such support is symbolically important for BDS as it tries to position itself as the spiritual successor of the anti-apartheid movement. The South African cleric Desmond Tutu, known for his anti-apartheid and human rights activism, has endorsed the BDS Movement, saying, In an essay for Haaretz, Tutu wrote, \\"Those who contribute to Israel‚Äôs temporary isolation are saying that Israelis and Palestinians are equally entitled to dignity and peace.\\" In 2012, South African African National Congress (ANC) party gave BDS its blessing, stating that it was \\"unapologetic in its view that the Palestinians are the victims and the oppressed in the conflict with Israel.\\" The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) also supports BDS, fully endorsing it in July 2011. During the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict, COSATU vowed to \\"intensify\\" their support for the campaign, picketing Woolworths for stocking Israeli goods. =Political= Members of the Green Party of Canada voted to endorse BDS in August 2016, despite the objections of the party's leader and sole MP Elizabeth May. In June 2018 the Socialist International issued a Declaration expressing support for \\"Boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) against the Israeli occupation, all the occupation institutions, and the illegal Israeli settlements, including the total embargo on all forms of military trade and cooperation with Israel as long as it continues its policies of occupation and Apartheid against the Palestinian people\\". Some political parties have supported BDS, such as the NSW Greens in Australia and the Qu√©bec solidaire in Canada. According to Newsweek and The Jerusalem Post, three German Nazi parties, The III. Path, The Right and the National Democratic Party, support BDS.Paton, Callum. \\"German Neo-Nazi Party Resurrects 100-year-old Anti-Semitic Slogan To Attack Israel\\" Newsweek. 29 May 2019. 10 August 2020.'POST' REPORTS STOP FUNDING FOR GERMAN NEO-NAZI PARTY LINKED TO HEZBOLLAH According to Ha'Aretz, German Nazi parties and BDS find common ground in the effort to dilute \\"the widely accepted definition of anti-Semitism put forward by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.

On 7 February 2019, Ninna Hedeager Olsen of the Danish party Enhedslisten, and mayor of technical and environmental affairs in Copenhagen, gave an award to three BDS activists known as the Humboldt 3, for their work \\"to reveal the Apartheid-like nature of the Israeli regime and its systematic violation of international law.\\" =Trade unions= In April 2014, the UK's National Union of Teachers, the EU's largest teacher's union, passed a resolution backing boycotts against Israel. In July of that year, the UK's Unite the Union voted to join BDS. In December, 2014 UAW Local 2865, a local chapter of the United Auto Workers union representing over 14,000 workers at the University of California, adopted a resolution in support of BDS with 65 percent of the vote in favor. It became the first major US labor union to endorse BDS. A year after the vote, the UAW International Executive Board (IEB) informed UAW Local 2865 that it had nullified the vote. The opposition to the BDS resolution came from a small pro-Israel group known as the Informed Grads, represented by the global law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. IEB said that the endorsement of the boycott would interfere with the \\"flow of commerce to and from earmarked companies.\\" UAW 2865's BDS Caucus repudiated the IEB's argument, saying that the IEB cared more about the \\"flow of commerce\\" than solidarity with Palestinian labor unions. The IEB further alleged that the resolution was anti-Semitic; the BDS Caucus called the allegation \\"the same baseless accusations of anti-Semitism frequently attributed to anyone who is critical of Israel.\\" In April 2015, the Conf√©d√©ration des syndicats nationaux, Quebec, Canada, representing 325,000 in nearly 2,000 unions, voted to join the campaign for BDS and support a military embargo against Israel. On 11 September 2019, the British Trades Union Congress passed a motion titled \\"Palestine: supporting rights to self- determination\\", called for the prioritization of \\"Palestinians' rights to justice and equality, including by applying these principles based on international law to all UK trade with Israel\\", and declared its opposition to \\"any proposed solution for Palestinians, including Trump‚Äôs 'deal', not based on international law recognising their collective rights to self-determination and to return to their homes\\". Opposition=Artists, actors, and writers= Holocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt has argued that if the boycott of Israel was the main goal, then we \\"would all have to give up our iPhones\\" because a lot of technology is created in Israel. According to Lipstadt, BDS's objective is to make anything coming out of Israel seem toxic but did not think that \\"any kid who supports B.D.S. is ipso facto an anti- Semite\\".Chotiner, Isaac (24 January 2019) \\"Looking at Anti-Semitism on the Left and the Right: An Interview with Deborah E.

Jerusalem Post. 22 May 2017. In 2017 all 50 US state governors and the mayor of Washington, D.C., signed on to \\"Governors United Against BDS\\", an initiative sponsored by the American Jewish Committee that condemns BDS as \\"antithetical to our values and the values of our respective states\\" and emphasizes \\"our support for Israel as a vital U.S. ally, important economic partner and champion of freedom.\\" On 17 May 2017, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu encouraged Danish minister of foreign affairs Anders Samuelsen to stop funding Palestinian organizations supporting the BDS movement. Two days later, the Danish ministry of foreign affairs began an investigation of the 24 organizations in Israel and Palestine that Denmark supports. On 24 May Netanyahu called Danish PM Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen to complain about Denmark's funding activities in the area. In December 2017, the Danish ministry of foreign affairs announced that Denmark would fund fewer organizations and that the conditions for obtaining Danish funds needed to be \\"stricter and clearer\\". Michael Aastrup Jensen, spokesman of foreign affairs for Venstre, said, \\"Israel has objected emphatically. And it is a problem that Israel sees it as a problem, so now we clear up the situation and change our support\\". In a response to Ireland's progressing of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018,https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/bill/2018/6/eng/initiated/b0618s.pdf Netanyahu issued a press release condemning the bill as an attempt to support BDS and to \\"harm the State of Israel\\". According to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, the Irish ambassador said that the Irish government opposes BDS. =Public figures= Israeli President Reuven Rivlin wrote in an op-ed in Ynetnews in 2016: \\"Boycotts, violence, and incitement only deepen divides, and don't bring us any closer to a solution. When BDS takes over, criticism turns into camouflage for the delegitimization of the existence of the State of Israel,\\"Rivlin, Reuven. \\"Taking Down BDS\\". Ynetnews. 28 March 2016. He added, \\"some parts of BDS even include factions which are connected to enemies of the State of Israel, and who work in order to eradicate Israel as a Jewish state. Some of them are even worse, and hide their anti-Semitism by calling their actions 'criticism of Israeli policy.'\\" Former Spanish Prime Minister Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar said, \\"I think BDS is an unfair, discriminatory movement based on a moral double standard that is, in the final analysis, anti-Semitic [...] BDS is, in fact, trying to harm every Israeli citizen and not only the government. In reality, what BDS wants is to make life in Israel intolerable so the Jewish nation will not be able to have a normal existence in its state. BDS does not only want to change the government's policy, it wants to empty the country of Jews.\\"\\"BDS movement seeks to empty Israel of Jews, former Spanish PM says\\", Haim Isserovitz, 20 June 2015, The Jerusalem Post. Former and current British Prime Ministers Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May, and Boris Johnson all have opposed or condemned boycotts of Israel. = Other = The Arab Council for Regional Integration, a group of 32 Arab intellectuals, repudiated BDS at a London conference in November 2019. It said that BDS has cost the Arab nations billions in trade, \\"undercut Palestinian efforts to build institutions for a future state, and torn at the Arab social fabric, as rival ethnic, religious and national leaders increasingly apply tactics that were first tested against Israel.\\"Halbfinger, David M. \\"Arab Thinkers Call to Abandon Boycotts and Engage With Israel.\\" The New York Times. 20 November 2019. 21 November 2019.

Criticism Criticism of the BDS According to the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies, by depicting Israel as a racist, fascist, totalitarian, and apartheid state, BDS engages in defamation and demonization of Israel. They state that boycotting Israeli targets, regardless of their position or connection to the Israel- Palestinian conflict is incitement. In a 2009 opinion column for The Jerusalem Post, Gil Troy argued that BDS targets not Israel's policies but its legitimacy. In 2007, The Economist called the boycott \\"flimsy\\" and ineffective, noted that \\"blaming Israel alone for the impasse in the occupied territories will continue to strike many outsiders as unfair,\\" and pointed out that the Palestinian leadership did not support the boycott. By early 2014, however, they noted that the campaign, \\"[o]nce derided as the scheming of crackpots\\", was \\"turning mainstream\\" in the eyes of many Israelis. According to Alan Dershowitz, BDS disincentivizes Palestinians from negotiating with Israel. The Anti-Defamation League similarly encouraged critics of Israel to promote constructive dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian actors rather than destructive and one-sided delegitimization tactics.\\"BDS: The Global Campaign to Delegitimize Israel.\\" ADL. 5 February 2019. = BDS hurts Palestinians economically = BDS's opponents argue that it is good for Palestinians in the West Bank that Israeli companies operate there. They say that they offer employment with higher wages than Palestinian employers and that the employees do not feel exploited. It is therefore counterproductive to boycott companies operating in the settlements, they argue. BDS supporters say that many Palestinian workers in settlements earn less than the Israeli minimum wage, that their salaries are often withheld, their social rights denied, and that they are often exposed to danger in the workplace. To work in settlements, Palestinians must obtain work permits from the Israeli Civil Administration. The permits can be annulled at any time‚Äîfor example, if the workers try to unionize or engage in any kind of political activity.\\"Palestinian Workers in Settlements‚ÄìWho Profits' Position Paper\\" . Who Profits, 2013 BDS supporters further argue that, regardless of the economic costs, the boycott against Israel enjoys overwhelming support among Palestinians. Dershowitz and the Israeli Action Network point to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's support of a boycott specific to Israeli businesses that operate in Israeli settlements in the Palestinian Territories over a general boycott of Israel as evidence that BDS is not in the Palestinians' favor.Dershowitz, Alan. \\"Israel and the myopic BDS movement\\". The Boston Globe. 26 December 2013. 1 January 2014.Guttman, Nathan. \\"Academic Backers of Boycott Israel Movement Take Aim at Bigger Targets\\". The Jewish Daily Forward. 18 December 2013. 1 January 2014. Dershowitz added, \\"The BDS movement is immoral because it would hurt the wrong people\\", such as Palestinians employees of the firms affected by BDS or patients awaiting medicine made by those firms. Similarly, Cary Nelson wrote, \\"BDS actually offers nothing to the Palestinian people, whom it claims to champion. Perhaps that is the single most cruel and deceptive feature of the BDS movement. Its message of hate is a route to war, not peace.\\" = Connections to terrorism = Some of BDS's opponents have stated that it has ties to militant organizations. Jonathan Schanzer, vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former terrorism finance analyst for the U.S. Treasury Department, has argued that there are links between BDS and American supporters of Hamas. In April 2016 Schanzer testified before the U.S. House Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade that \\"in the case of three organizations that were designated, shut down, or held civilly liable for providing material support to the terrorist organization Hamas, a significant contingent of their former leadership appears to have pivoted to leadership positions within the American BDS campaign.\\" A report published in 2018 by the Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry, titled The Money Trail: The millions given by EU institutions to NGOs with ties to terror and boycotts against Israel accused the EU of having giving 5 million euros to organizations that \\"promote anti-Israel delegitimization and boycotts\\". The report was sharply rebuked by EU officials such as the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini who said the accusations in the report were \\"vague and unsubstantiated\\" and that it conflated \\"terrorism with the boycott issue.\\" Another report by the Ministry in February 2019, Terrorists in Suits: The Ties Between NGOs promoting BDS and Terrorist Organizations said that BDS was a \\"complementary track to terrorism\\" and that Hamas and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) members had infiltrated organizations affiliated with the movement to advance their goal: \\"the elimination of the State of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people\\". As examples of such infiltration the report listed Rasmea Odeh, a former member of PFLP who was involved in a bombing in Jerusalem in 1969 and who had participated in meetings organized by Jewish Voice for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine and Leila Khaled, also a former PFLP member who carried out a plane hijacking in 1969 and an attempted plane hijacking in 1970 and who is a well-known figure in the boycott movement. In June, the Israeli Ministry announced that its economic campaign against BDS had shut down 30 accounts linked to it over the last two years - ten in the United States and 20 in Europe. BDS dismissed the report: \\"This wildly fabricated and recycled propaganda report from the far-right Israeli government cannot be dignified with any response.\\" Both the Ministry's reports were cited by an Amnesty report from 2019 as examples of Israel's efforts to delegitimize Israeli and Palestinian human rights defenders and organizations. = Anti-Semitism= The Anti-Defamation League, the Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC), Israeli officials, and others describe BDS as antisemitic.Fishman, Joel S. \\"The BDS Message of Anti-Zionism, Anti-Semitism, And Incitement To Discrimination\\".

USA Today. 17 March 2013. 8 June 2013.\\"The Wrong Way To Fight BDS\\". The Jewish Daily Forward. 21 February 2013. According to Ira M. Sheskin of the University of Miami and Ethan Felson of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, BDS efforts have, at times, targeted Jewish people who have little or nothing to do with the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. They argue that BDS causes Jews to be blamed for the supposed sins of other Jews. Other arguments include: * Some argue that academic boycotts often target Israelis who oppose the Israeli presence in Palestinian territories and support Arab‚ÄìIsraeli peace initiatives.Wistrich, Robert S. A Lethal Obsession: Anti-Semitism from Antiquity to the Global Jihad. New York: Random House, 2010. p. 407 * The AMCHA Initiative stated that there is a \\"strong correlation\\" between BDS support and anti-Semitism on U.S. campuses.Bandler. \\"UCI Student Senate Repeals BDS Resolution.\\" Jewish Journal. 14 April 2020. 15 April 2020. * Some see similarities between BDS and historical acts of discrimination against Jewish minorities.Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England, By Anthony Julius, Oxford University Press 2010, page 478-484 Several replies have been made to these allegations: *Daniel Blatman, professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at the Hebrew University, has challenged the suggestion of similarity between BDS and boycotts imposed on Jews.Blatman, Daniel. Not anti-Semitism but hysteria, Haaretz, 18 June 2015. A liberal Zionist and BDS opponent, Blatman argues that \\"the boycott imposed on Jews by antisemitism and the boycott of Israel today have nothing in common... The antisemitic boycott movement was directed against the authorities who had not acted against those who were not considered to belong to the nation, and even deemed the nation's enemy. The Israeli equivalent of the boycott movement can be found in right-wing circles, who have called for a boycott of Arab produce\\".  Targeting Jews  Some opponents argue that there are similarities between BDS and historical boycotts against Jews. For example, in May 2019, the German Bundestag passed a resolution stating that BDS was \\"reminiscent of the most terrible chapter in German history\\" and that it triggered memories of the Nazi slogan \\"Don't buy from Jews.\\" Blatman, though a BDS opponent, argues that BDS's calls for boycotts of Israel and historical boycotts against Jews have nothing in common.Blatman, Daniel. Not anti- Semitism but hysteria, Haaretz, 18 June 2015. Supporters argue that BDS does not target Jews because boycott targets are selected based on their complicity in Israel's human rights violations, potential for cross-movement solidarity, media appeal, and likelihood of success, but not on their national origin or religious identity. According to Barghouti, the majority of companies targeted are non-Israeli foreign companies that operate in Israel and Palestine.  Singling out Israel  Many critics argue that BDS employs a \\"double standard\\" and \\"singles out\\" Israel. In their view, it is a form of anti- Semitism to campaign against Israeli human rights violations when other regimes are much worse.  * BDS supporters reply that by that logic any movements focusing on a single country's human rights violations would be racist. For example, the Anti-Apartheid Movement singled out South Africa while ignoring human rights violations in other African countries. The United States sanctions against Iran would also be racist, they argue, as they affect only Iran and not other countries committing similar human rights violations. Barghouti argues that BDS focuses on Israeli oppression because it is the oppression affecting the Palestinians and BDS is a Palestinian movement. He rhetorically asks: \\"If you suffer from the flu and seek medication from it, is it misguided to do so when there are worse diseases out there? Well, the flu is the disease that is afflicting you!\\" He believes that it is the US and most of the Western world, not BDS, that is guilty of applying a double standard by not holding Israel accountable for its human rights violations.  Jewish support for BDS  Some supporters of BDS, including Jewish supporters, argue that Jewish support for BDS is evidence that BDS is not anti-Semitic. Jewish activists thus makes themselves visible or are made visible by others to refute accusations of anti-Semitism. Barghouti has written, \\"The growing support among progressive European and American Jews for effective pressure on Israel is one counter-argument that is not well publicized.\\" Feldman argues that this strategy is a sign of a changing Jewish identity among young Jewish Americans who no longer identify with Israel as strongly as older generations. Opponents note that Jews too can be anti-Semitic. David Hirsh has written, \\"Jews too can make anti-Semitic claims, use anti-Semitic images, support anti- Semitic exclusions and play an important, if unwitting, part in preparing the ground for the future emergence of anti-Semitic movement.\\"  Conflating anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism  BDS supporters frequently allege that accusations of anti-Semitism against the movement are deliberately or mistakenly conflating anti-Zionism and criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism. For example, in 2018, 41 left-wing Jewish groups stated that BDS's tools and tactics \\"should not be defined as antisemitic\\" and that it was important to distinguish between anti-Semitism and criticism of Israel. Jay Michaelson wrote that accusing BDS of anti-Semitism \\"cheapens the meaning of the term 'anti-Semitism' itself\\". Judith Butler, a strong BDS supporter, argues that if BDS is anti-Semitic, then human rights, which she believes BDS advocates, are also anti-Semitic.Judith Butler's Remarks to Brooklyn College on BDS, The Nation, 7 February 2013 She argues that calling BDS anti-Semitic is a \\"lamentable stereotype\\" about Jews since it assumes that all Jews are politically committed to Israel. Barghouti similarly argues that those who criticize BDS as an attack on Jews are equating Jews with Israel.Why the boycott movement scares Israel, The New York Times, 31 January 2014.  Progressive Zionism and settlement boycotts  According to some progressive Zionists, BDS and right-wing Zionists both risk destroying Israel, defined as turning Israel into a Palestinian-majority state. BDS wants to destroy Israel by allowing equal citizenship for Arab-Palestinians and by letting the Palestinian refugees return, while right-wing Zionists, by insisting on building settlements, could also destroy Israel by making a two-state solution impossible. With the two-state solution off the table, Israel would either have to grant citizenship to the Palestinians living under occupation, thus destroying Israel, or become an apartheid state. Progressive Zionists find apartheid repugnant and oppose apartheid in Israel, so they propose a boycott limited to Israeli West Bank settlements to put pressure on the Israeli government to stop building settlements. One proponent of this strategy is Peter Beinart, who proposes a \\"Zionist BDS\\" that would advocate for divestment from Israeli West Bank settlements but oppose divestment from Israeli companies. This, Beinart argues, would legitimize Israel and delegitimize the occupation, thus challenging both the vision of BDS and that of the Israeli government. Barghouti has called this idea of distinguishing between Israel and Israel's conduct \\"preposterous\\". Steven Salaita argues that no distinction can be made between the racial discrimination that befalls the Palestinians in the West Bank and those in Israel Philip Weiss contends that by opposing BDS, liberal Zionists have joined forces with the Zionist right. Sunaina Maira believes that Zionists of all political persuasions are more concerned with preserving Israel as a Jewish state than with Palestinian rights. Maira sees similarities between the white \\"moderates\\" criticized in Martin Luther King Jr.'s Letter from a Birmingham Jail who sympathized with the civil rights movement's goals but denounced its tactics and leftists who have condemned BDS as an inappropriate strategy for Palestinians. In effect, she argues, they are telling the Palestinians that they are incapable of deciding what is an appropriate form of resistance.

It is closely connected to Arab nationalism, which asserts the view that the Arabs constitute a single nation. Its popularity reached its height during the 1950s and 1960s. Advocates of pan-Arabism have often espoused socialist principles and strongly opposed Western political involvement in the Arab world. It also sought to empower Arab states against outside forces by forming alliances and, to a lesser extent, economic co-operation. Origins and development The origins of pan-Arabism are often attributed to Jurji Zaydan (1861‚Äì1914) and his Nahda (Revival) movement. He was one of the first intellectuals to espouse pan-Arabism as a cultural nationalist force. Zaydan had critical influence on acceptance of a modernized version of the Quranic Arabic language (Modern Standard Arabic) as the universal written and official language throughout the Arab world, instead of adoption of local dialects in the various countries. Zaydan wrote several articles during the early 20th century which emphasized that Arabic-speaking regions stretching from the Maghreb to Persian Gulf constitute one people with a shared national consciousness and that this linguistic bond trumped religious, racial and specific territorial bonds, inspired in part by his status as a Levantine Christian emigre in 19th century Egypt. He also popularized through his historical novels a secular understanding of Arab history encompassing the pre-Islamic and Islamic periods into a shared history that all Arabs could claim as their own. As a political project, pan-Arabism was first pressed by Sharif Hussein ibn Ali, the Sharif of Mecca, who sought independence for the Mashreq Arabs from the Ottoman Empire, and the establishment of a unified Arab state in the Mashreq. In 1915 and 1916, the Hussein-McMahon Correspondence resulted in an agreement between the United Kingdom and the Sharif that if the Mashreq Arabs revolted successfully against the Ottomans, the United Kingdom would support claims for Mashreq Arab independence. In 1916, however, the Sykes-Picot Agreement between the United Kingdom and France determined that parts of the Mashreq would be divided between those powers rather than forming part of an independent Arab state. When the Ottoman Empire surrendered in 1918, the United Kingdom refused to keep to the letter of its arrangements with Hussein,Contemporary Politics in the Middle East, Beverly Milton-Edwards, Polity Press, 2006, p. 57-59 and the two nations assumed guardianship of Mesopotamia, Lebanon, Palestine and what became modern Syria. Ultimately, Hussein became King of only Hijaz, in the then less strategically valuable south, but lost his Caliphate throne when the kingdom was sacked by the Najdi Ikhwan forces of the Saudites and forcefully incorporated into the newly created Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A more formalized pan-Arab ideology than that of Hussein was first espoused in the 1930s, notably by Syrian thinkers such as Constantin Zureiq, Sati' al-Husri, Zaki al-Arsuzi, and Michel Aflaq. Aflaq and al-Arsuzi were key figures in the establishment of the Arab Ba‚Äôath (Renaissance) Party, and the former was for long its chief ideologist, combining elements of Marxist thought with a nationalism to a considerable extent reminiscent of nineteenth-century European romantic nationalism. It has been said that Arsuzi was fascinated with the Nazi ideology of \\"racial purity\\" and impacted Aflaq.The Syrian Arab Republic: a handbook, Anne Sinai, Allen Pollack, 1976, p. 45Google BooksPan- Arabism and Arab nationalism: the continuing debate by Tawfic Farah, Publisher Westview Press, 1987, p. 37 Abdullah I of Jordan dreamed of uniting Syria, Palestine, and Jordan under his leadership in what he would call Greater Syria. He unsuccessfully proposed a plan to this effect to the United Kingdom, which controlled Palestine at that time. The plan was not popular among the majority of Arabs and fostered distrust among the leaders of the other Middle Eastern countries against Abdallah. The distrust of Abdallah's expansionist aspirations was one of the principal reasons for the founding of the Arab League in 1945.Sela, Avraham. \\"Arab League.\\" Sela. The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East. 147-150. Once Abdallah was assassinated by a Palestinian nationalist in 1951, the vision of Greater Syria was dropped from the Jordanian agenda.\\"Arab Unity.\\" The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East. Ed. Avraham Sela. New York: Continuum, 2002. pp. 160‚Äì166. Although pan-Arabism began at the time of World War I, Egypt (the most populous and arguably most important Arab country) was not interested in pan- Arabism prior to the 1950s. Thus, in the 1930s and 1940s, Egyptian nationalism ‚Äì not pan-Arabism ‚Äì was the dominant mode of expression of Egyptian political activists. James Jankowski wrote about Egypt at the time, Attempts at Arab union It was not until Gamal Abdel Nasser that Arab nationalism (in addition to Arab socialism) became a state policy and a means with which to define Egypt's position in the Middle East and the world,For more information, see Aburish, Said K. (2004), Nasser, the Last Arab, New York City: St. Martin's Press, \\"Before Nasser, Egypt, which had been ruled by Britain since 1882, was more in favor of territorial, Egyptian nationalism and distant from the pan- Arab ideology. Egyptians often did not identify themselves primarily as Arabs, and it is revealing that when the Egyptian nationalist leader Saad Zaghlul met the Arab delegates at Versailles in 1918, he insisted that their struggles for statehood were not connected, claiming that the problem of Egypt was an Egyptian problem and not an Arab one.\\" Makropoulou, Ifigenia. Pan - Arabism: What Destroyed the Ideology of Arab Nationalism? . Hellenic Center for European Studies. January 15, 2007. usually articulated vis-√†-vis Zionism in the neighbouring state of Israel. Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, pan- Arabism dominated politics in the 1950s and 1960s There have been several attempts to bring about a pan-Arab state by many well-known Arab leaders, all of which ultimately resulted in failure. British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden called for Arab unity during the 1940s, and was followed by specific proposals from pro-British leaders, including King Abdullah of Transjordan and Prime Minister Nuri al-Said of Iraq, but Egyptian proposals for a broader grouping of independent Arab states prevailed with the establishment of the League of Arab States, a regional international organization, in 1945. In large part representing the popularity Nasser had gained among the masses in the Arab world following the Suez crisis, the United Arab Republic (UAR) in 1958 was the first case of the actual merger of two previously-independent Arab countries. Hastily formed under President Nasser's leadership but on the initiative of Syrian leaders who feared a takeover by communists or \\"reactionaries\\" and hoped to lead the new entity, the UAR was a unitary state, not a federal union, with its critics seeing this as hardly more than a small country being annexed by a larger one. It lasted until 1961, when Syrian army officers carried out a coup d'√©tat and withdrew from the union. As politicians felt pressured by the wide public to espouse the idea of unity, Egypt, Syria and Iraq entered into an abortive agreement in 1963 to form the United Arab Republic, which was to be \\"federal in structure, leaving each member state its identity and institutions.\\" By 1961, Egypt had become the only remaining member but continued to call itself \\"the UAR\\" (thereby implying it was open for unification with other Arab countries), but it eventually renamed itself the \\"Arab Republic of Egypt\\" in 1973.\\"United Arab Republic (UAR).\\" Sela. The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East. 873-874. Also in 1958, a Hashemite-led rival, the Arab Federation, was founded between Jordan and Iraq. Tensions with the UAR and the 14 July Revolution made the Arab Federation collapse after only six months. Another attempt, the United Arab States, existed as a confederation between the United Arab Republic and the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen, but it dissolved in 1961. Two later attempts represented the enthusiasm of Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, the Federation of Arab Republics, which lasted five years, and the Arab Islamic Republic, which never emerged in practice. Aside from the forcible unification of much of the Arabian Peninsula by the Saudi rulers of Najd during the 1920s, the unity of seven Arab emirates that form the United Arab Emirates and the unification of North Yemen and South Yemen stand today as rare examples of actual unification. The current Syrian government is and the former government of Iraq was led by rival factions of the Ba'ath Party, which continues to espouse pan-Arabism and is organized in several other countries. Decline States and territories in the Arab League The decline of pan-Arabism is attributed to several factors. Problems persisted over a wide range of issues since the inception of pan-Arabist philosophy in the late 1800s, which, until its decline, had kept pan-Arabism on course for causal failure. The factors include: the promotion of pan-Islamism, the sectarian and social differences within the different Arab societies; the competition between different Arab leaders to be the leading voice for the Arab and Islamic worlds; and, to a lesser extent, military defeat against an enemy force. The promotion of pan- Islamism had been a key aspect within Arab and Muslim societies. Such philosophy dictated for a united Islamic ‚ÄòUmmah‚Äô or the close bounding of all Islamic communities to maintain and promote an essence of one family, one cause. The philosophy of pan-Arabism placed itself in contradiction to the philosophy of pan-Islamism as was clarified by religious scholars and Sheikhs within the various Arab countries, especially the Gulf. The belief held by critics emphasized that pan-Arabism separated itself from the Ummah in that it only promoted Arab unity and ideals, not Islamic ones. The religious conservatism within the societies propelled pan-Islamism to defeat alternative thoughts such as pan-Arabism. Various sectarian and social differences within the various Arab societies was another fueling factor for pan-Arabism‚Äôs decline. Sporadic Sunni and Shia religious divide exacerbated by internal and foreign factors caused reconsideration within Arab circles as to whether pan- Arabism was viable although the issue was religiously oriented. Social differences toed a similar line. Countries like Lebanon and Syria considered secular brought about a clash of thought with the likes of religious Saudi Arabia, whose longstanding promotion of religion was contradictory to the goals of the secular hierarchy within the two Levantine countries, for example. Different Arab leaders competed to become the leading voices for the Arab and Islamic worlds. Such competition sporadically resulted in friction between the leaders of these Arab countries. The United Arab Republic, which was formulated by Egypt‚Äôs Gamal Abdel Nasser and Syria‚Äôs Hafez al-Assad, was promoted to be the collective voice for the Arab world and the spearhead of pan-Arabism. Being the only physical incarnation of pan-Arabism, it did not receive the expected praise from other Arab nations, especially in the Gulf, which further added to the decline of pan-Arabism. To a lesser extent, the military defeat to ‚Äúarch-enemy‚Äù Israel made both prominent sources of pan- Arabism reconsider such philosophy. The United Arab Republic, consisting of Egypt and Syria, received ideological burden due to the unfavorable outcome, thus putting pan-Arabism in question. The victory of Israel in the 1967 Six- Day War and the inability of Egypt and Syria to generate economic growth severely damaged pan-Arabism's credibility. \\"By the mid-1970s,\\" according to The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East, \\"the idea of Arab unity became less and less apparent in Arab politics, though it remained a wishful goal among the masses.\\" By the late 1980s, pan-Arabism began to be eclipsed by both nationalist and Islamist ideologies. Pan-Islamic philosophy has taken shape within Arab societies that through the Ummah, the collective Muslim unity, the Palestinian cause can be resolved against Israel. Various pan-Islamic governments outside the Arab world, such as in Iran and Turkey, have professed of its attempt to lead the Muslim world in the cause.

BBC children's television During an attachment to Blue Peter, Whitby was commissioned to write an internal BBC report on Watch with Mother; five pre-filmed series had been on air for a decade. The first Controller of BBC 2, Michael Peacock was aware of the shortage of nursery schools in the country and appointed Whitby to create and produce Play School, a new television series for pre-school children, running Monday to Friday through the year. In developing the series, Whitby consulted teachers, writers and illustrators. Nancy Quayle, an expert on \\"learning through play\\", became a permanent consultant and Wendy Duggan provided the many animals featured in Pet's Corner. There were other familiar landmarks like the story telling chair, the dressing up pegs, the revolving clock and three \\"windows\\" which led to the outside world through a library of specially made films. Because of a blackout the previous night, the first edition of Play School inadvertently opened the new BBC 2 service on 21 April 1964.Sarah Williams \\"How we made: Joy Whitby and Phyllida Law on Play School\\", The Guardian, 15 October 2012 One of its innovations was a rotating team of diverse presenters with as many men as women.

Eric Thompson soon adapted and created all the voices for The Magic Roundabout which was based on the French series, Le Man√®ge Enchant√©. Following the success of Play School, Michael Peacock asked Whitby to create a new daily programme at teatime for slightly older children. The result, Jackanory, was launched in 1965. It drew on quality stories from around the world and invited actors, writers, artists and celebrities to present stories that were particularly suitable to them. For example, Sir Compton Mackenzie retold Greek Legends and Margaret Rutherford read five Beatrix Potter tales. Commercial television In 1967, Peacock became Managing Director of London Weekend Television. Amongst other BBC executives, he invited Whitby and her boss, Doreen Stephens, the former head of Family Programmes, to join the new franchise. Whitby ran the Children's Department which enabled her to branch out into drama. She produced The Growing Summer, with Wendy Hiller, Knock Three Times with Hattie Jacques, and Catweazle starring Geoffrey Bayldon. In 1969, she resigned along with other heads of department in protest at Michael Peacock's dismissal.John Butler Obituary: Doreen Stephens, The Guardian, 24 April 2001. She founded her own company, Grasshopper Productions, and in 1970, wrote and produced her first independent film series, Grasshopper Island, for ITV. In 1975, Whitby joined Yorkshire Television and, during her ten years as Head of Children's Programmes, she created many original programmes. Among these were The Book Tower, with Tom Baker as its first presenter, and an international children's drama series for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). During this period, she also produced two independent productions, Emma and Grandpa, which she wrote and directed, as well as the television film A Pattern of Roses, which she adapted KM Peyton's ghost story. It featured Helena Bonham Carter in her first screen appearance. Since 1985, Whitby has focused on making animated films based on quality picture books. These include the Mouse and Mole five minute series for the BBC, voiced by Richard Briers and Alan Bennett, later to be joined by Imelda Staunton for a Christmas special.

Although the topics generally revolve around each specific team, the shows also includes topics from the national level within each sport (example: Red Wings coverage also includes NHL-wide topics). In addition to online radio and podcasts, Sports Radio Detroit delivers traditional digital print content. With an emphasis on alternative perspectives driven by fact-based opinions, SRD's staff is composed of experienced broadcasters and writers (from major/minor media companies and organizations) who provide a fresh voice in Detroit media. Media Affiliations Sports Radio Detroit is a member of Detroit Sports Media (formerly the Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association). On December 7, 2019, Roger Castillo of SRD was announced as a board member of the organization.

The tool is largely maintained by Basis Technology Corp. with the assistance of programmers from the community. The company sells support services and training for using the product. The tool is designed with these principles in mind: * Extensible ‚Äî the user should be able to add new functionality by creating plugins that can analyze all or part of the underlying data source. * Centralised ‚Äî the tool must offer a standard and consistent mechanism for accessing all features and modules. * Ease of Use ‚Äî the Autopsy Browser must offer the wizards and historical tools to make it easier for users to repeat their steps without excessive reconfiguration. * Multiple Users ‚Äî the tool should be usable by one investigator or coordinate the work of a team.

Process  Autopsy analyzes major file systems (NTFS, FAT, ExFAT, HFS+, Ext2/Ext3/Ext4, YAFFS2) by hashing all files, unpacking standard archives (ZIP, JAR etc.), extracting any EXIF values and putting keywords in an index. Some file types like standard email formats or contact files are also parsed and cataloged. Users can search these indexed files for recent activity or create a report in HTML or PDF summarizing important recent activity. If time is short, users may activate triage features that use rules to analyze the most important files first. Autopsy can save a partial image of these files in the VHD format.

From the mansion, the family tended to the Confucian sites in Qufu and also governed the largest private rural estate in China. The Kong family was in charge of conducting elaborate religious ceremonies on occasions such as plantings, harvests, honoring the dead, and birthdays. Today, the mansion is a museum and part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \\"Temple and Cemetery of Confucius and the Kong Family Mansion in Qufu\\". Layout The mansion is located immediately to the east of the Temple of Confucius to which it had been formerly connected. The layout of the mansion is traditionally Chinese and separates official spaces in the style of a YamenXinian Fu, Nancy Shatzman Steinhardt: Chinese Architecture, Yale University Press, 2002 in the front of the complex from the residential quarters in the rear. Besides the yamen and the inner quarters, the complex also contains an eastern and a western study as well as a back garden. Within this overall arrangement, the spatial distribution of the buildings according to the seniority, gender, and status of their inhabitants reflects the Confucian principle of order and hierarchy: The most senior descendant of Confucius took up residence in the central of the three main buildings; his younger brother occupied the Yi Gun hall to the east. The eastern study was used by the Duke of Yansheng to meet official guests and worship his ancestors. The western study was used by the family for study, meals, and entertaining friends. In its present layout, the mansion comprises 152 buildings with 480 rooms, which cover an area of . Its tallest structure is the 4-story refuge tower () that was designed as a shelter during an attack but was never used. The mansion houses an archive with about 60,000 documents related to the life in the mansion over a period of 400 years during the Ming and Qing dynasties. History Third Hall A side courtyard The first mansion for the Kong family of the Duke Yansheng was built in 1038 during the Song Dynasty. In 1377, the mansion was relocated and rebuilt under orders of the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty. In 1503, during the reign of the Hongzhi Emperor, the complex was expanded into three rows of buildings with 560 rooms and - like the neighboring Confucius Temple - nine courtyards. During the Qing Dynasty, the mansion underwent a complete renovation in 1838 only to be damaged in a fire 48 years later that destroyed the women's quarters in 1886. Even during the fire, men did not dare to enter the women's part of the mansion to fight the fire, leading to greater damage to this portion of the mansion complex. The damaged portions of the mansion were rebuilt two years later; the cost of both these 19th-century renovations was covered by the emperor. Despite these later renovations, the Kong Family Mansion remains the best preserved Ming-era residential complex of its size. The last head of the Kong family to live in the mansion was Kong Decheng, the 77th generation descendant of Confucius. Kong Decheng fled to Chongqing because of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. He did not return to Qufu but moved on to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War.Kong Mansion, Qufu, China. Asian Historical Architecture There is another Kong Family Mansion in Quzhou built by the southern branch of Confucius descendants. Traditional Ming dynasty Hanfu robes given by the Ming Emperors to the Chinese noble Dukes Yansheng descended from Confucius are still preserved in the Confucius Mansion after over five centuries. Robes from the Qing emperors are also preserved there. The Jurchens in the Jin dynasty and Mongols in the Yuan dynasty continued to patronize and support the Confucian Duke Yansheng. Structures Holy Mansion The major structures along the central axis of the mansion (from south to north) are: =Administrative portion=Main Gate The main entrance gate to the complex () is marked by a tablet that reads \\"Holy Mansion\\" (). Central Courtyard The central courtyard is flanked to the east and west by former administrative office buildings. The administration of the Kong family's official functions and businesses was structured into departments similar to the six ministries of the imperial government: Department of Rites (ancestor worship), Department of Seals (jurisdiction and edicts), Music, Letters, and Archives, Rent Collection and Sacrificial Fields.David Leffman, Simon Lewis, Jeremy Atiyah: China, Rough Guides, May 1, 2003 Gate of Double Glory Gate of Double Glory Corridor Hall Rear Building Back Garden Located to the north of the Central Courtyard, the Gate of Double Glory () was erected in 1503 and opened only for ceremonial purposes, visits by the emperor, or the arrival of imperial edicts.Eastern Central China, including Qingdao and Nanjing: Frommer's ShortCuts, John Wiley & Sons, Apr 2, 2012 The structure is 6.24 meters wide, 2.03 meters deep, and 5.95 meters in height. It is also known as the \\"Yi Gate\\" () or \\"Sai Gate\\" () . Great Hall The Great Hall () was the site of the duke's official business and the place for the proclamation of imperial edicts. When holding court, the duke was seated in the hall on a wooden chair that was covered by a tiger skin. Second Hall The Second Hall () was used for receiving high-ranking officials as well as for examinations in music and rites by the duke. It contains seven tablets inscribed by emperors, including one with the character \\"shou\\" (longevity) written by the Empress Dowager Cixi. Third Hall The Third Hall (), also known as the \\"Hall of Withdrawal\\", was used by the duke for drinking tea. =Residential portion=Gate to the Inner Apartments This gate () dates to the Ming Dynasty. The gate building stands 11.8 meters wide, 6.1 meters deep, and 6.5 meters tall. During the residence of the Kong family, the gate was heavily guarded and restricted access to the residential portion of the mansion accessible only to the family and a small number of mostly female servants. Trespassing into the inner compound was punishable by death. Drinking water had to be delivered through a trough in the wall. On the internal ghost wall behind this entrance is a painting of a \\"tan\\" (tƒÅn), a mythical animal representing greed. Although the tan already has the Eight Treasures (associated with the Eight Immortals, it is still attempting to swallow the sun.

Although comparisons between man and animal are rather old, it was not until the findings of science that mankind recognised itself as a part of the animal kingdom. (However, in some religious beliefs, mankind still plays a unique role above animals and is not considered part of the animal kingdom)Cf. Andreas Bl√ºhm and Louise Lippincott, Tierschau. Wie unser Bild vom Tier entstand (K√∂ln: Wallraf-Richartz-Museum & Fondation Corboud, 2007), 14. Caricatures of Darwin and his evolutionary theory reveal how closely science was intertwined with both the arts and the public during the Victorian era.Diana Donald, introduction to Endless Forms. Charles Darwin, Natural Science and the Visual Arts, ed. Diana Donald and Jane Munro (Cambridge: Fitzwilliam Museum, 2009), 1. They display the general perception of Darwin, his \\"monkey theory\\"Julia Voss, \\"Monkeys, Apes and Evolutionary Theory: from Human Descent to King Kong,\\" Endless Forms. Charles Darwin, Natural Science and the Visual Arts, ed. Diana Donald and Jane Munro (Cambridge: Fitzwilliam Museum, 2009), 222. and apes in 19th-century England. Shortly after the Publication of On the Origin of Species Linley Sambourne's cartoon Man Is But a Worm was published in Punch's Almanack. It depicts the evolution of the worm into the human ‚Äì in this case, the English gentleman ‚Äì as a means of ridiculing Darwin's theory.  Image description  Prof. Darwin in Figaro's London Sketch Book of Celebrities, 18 February 1874. = Professor Darwin = We see Darwin portrayed as a monkey with his own human head. He holds a mirror up to another monkey which is sitting next to him. It seems as if he would invite the monkey to ponder over himself and his existence. This is underlined by the two accompanying quotations of Shakespeare: \\"This is the ape of form\\" (from: Love's Labour's Lost, act 5, scene 2) and \\"Some four or five descents since\\" (All's Well that Ends Well, act 3, scene 7). Darwin's facial expression seems to encourage the monkey to recognise their common ancestry. The ape, in turn, looks into the mirror and tries to touch the reflection to literally grasp Darwin's suggestion and to assure himself of the authenticity of their kinship. = Man Is But a Worm = Linley Sambourne drew a \\"wild evolutionary polonaise\\"Julia Voss, \\"Variieren und Selektieren: Die Evolutionstheorie in der englischen und deutschen illustrierten Presse im 19. Jahrhundert,\\" Darwin. Kunst und die Suche nach den Urspr√ºngen, ed. Pamela Kort and Max Hollein (K√∂ln: Wienand, 2009), 250. which spirals up from C H A O S and ends in the English gentleman holding a cylinder. Among the stages in the process are the earthworm, the monkey and the cave man. Clocks are displayed in the background; the path on which the evolution proceeds is labelled as \\"times meter\\" both indicating that the evolution is depicted in time lapse. Darwin is enthroned next to the gentleman and seems to watch the whole development. Thereby he resembles one of the figures of Michelangelo's ceiling fresco in the Sistine Chapel.Cf. Voss, \\"Variieren und Selektieren,\\" 250.  Interpretation = Professor Darwin = This caricature offers various starting points for an art-historical analysis. It was published three years after Darwin's work The Descent of Man (1871). Here, Darwin finally takes a stand and argues that humans and monkeys share a common ancestor. In the caricature, however, this view is put into question. Moreover, it goes back on the widespread assumption that humans exhibit certain animal features ‚Äì the ape as a mirror for humankind so to speak. In this respect the caricature stands also in the tradition of vanitas which is symbolised by the hand mirror reflecting human vanity. The fact that the ape-like Darwin is holding the mirror and not the real ape shows that Darwin and his theory should be ridiculed. Darwin himself has acknowledged that \\"[he] has given man a pedigree of prodigious length, but not, it may be said, of noble quality.\\"Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (New York: D. Appleton, ¬≤1874), 165. Consequently, the ape is not enhanced in status through his kinship with man. After the publication of The Descent of Man Darwin was increasingly identified with the theory of evolution although his friend Thomas Henry Huxley was the first to put it forward. As a result, Darwin himself was considered more and more as a suitable object to caricature. The cover of the French satirical magazine La Petite Lune is a telling example of the paradigmatic representation of Darwin in contemporary cartoons and caricatures.Cf. Janet Browne, \\"Darwin in Caricature: A Study in the Popularization and Dissemination of Evolution,\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 145 (2001): 506. Front page of the French satirical magazine La Petite Lune by Andr√© Gill (1871?). = Man Is But a Worm = Sambourne's caricature deals in a playful manner with the topics \\"evolution\\" and \\"descent of man.\\" The title alludes to a publication of Darwin entitled The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms, with Observations of their Habits which was issued in October 1881. In the caricature, evolution is associated with metamorphosis and portrayed as a gradual process which inevitably leads to advancement. This, however, conveys a reduced if not false picture of Darwin's theory in which competition, hereditary transmission, coincidence and selection play a major role.Cf. Bernd Herkner, \\"Die Welt des Charles Darwin,\\" Darwin. Kunst und die Suche nach den Urspr√ºngen, ed. Pamela Kort and Max Hollein (K√∂ln: Wienand, 2009), 259. Besides, these circular images of evolutionary progression form a striking contrast to Darwin's own linear and branching evolutionary trees. In The Origin of Species Darwin \\"took pains to emphasize that evolution was neither progressive nor circular.\\"Browne, \\"Darwin in Caricature,\\" 501. That the earthworm is transformed into a monkey and not into another animal might indicate that the thesis of a kinship between ape and human received a wider acceptance among the British public (The Descent of Man had been published 10 years earlier). Still, the monkey is depicted as the underdeveloped version of a human. At the same time, however, the \\"superior\\" human being or rather the English gentleman is ridiculed: he too is descended from an earthworm.  Precursors and reception  Precursors for the depiction of anthropomorphic animals were the works of Grandville who portrayed individuals for example in Les M√©tamorphoses du jour (1828‚Äì29) with the bodies of men and faces of animals. The caricatures of Charles Philipon can also be considered as a role model for the illustrators of Punch and other English satirical magazines.Cf. Voss, \\"Variieren und Selektieren,\\" 254. The cyclical depiction of Darwin's evolutionary theory might have been modelled on the wood engravings of the illustrator Charles H. Bennett which show transformations of humans into immobile objects and vice versa. The caricatures provide not only insights into the public perception of Darwin's evolutionary theory but also played an essential part in its dissemination and popularisation.Cf. Browne, \\"Darwin in Caricature,\\" 508-09. During the 1860s and 1870s the kinship between ape and man was doubted more frequently than in later decades where this idea received a wider acceptance. Today we meet the evolutionary theory on T-shirts in the form of graphic arts. Quite often, it is the lifestyle of modern man that is ridiculed. The monkey is now only depicted as the underdeveloped stage of the human and does not function as the caricature of human behaviour any more. Likewise, Darwin has lost his prominent position as a motif for caricatures.

A member of the Great Train Robbery gang, of which he was treasurer, he was killed by a hitman on his doorstep in 1990 whilst living in Marbella, Spain. Early life Wilson was born on 30 June 1932 to Bill and Mabel Wilson in Battersea, London. Possessing a heavy build, a handsome appearance and piercing blue eyes, Wilson was, from an early age, an intimidating presence. His friends from childhood included Jimmy Hussey, Tommy Wisbey, Bruce Reynolds and Gordon Goody. Later on, he met Ronald \\"Buster\\" Edwards and the young driving enthusiasts Mickey Ball and Roy James, who had taken up car theft. From 1948 to 1950 he was called up for National Service, and in 1955 he married Patricia (Pat) Osbourne, with whom he had three children. Early career Wilson turned to crime early in life and spurned his father's legitimate but low-income wage. While he did have legitimate work in his in-laws' grocer's shop, he also was a thief and his criminal proceeds went into buying shares in various gambling enterprises. He went to jail for short spells for numerous offences. In 1960, Wilson began to work with Bruce Reynolds and planned to get into the criminal big league. In 1962, a gang led by Reynolds stole ¬£62,000 in a security van robbery at London Heathrow Airport. They then attempted to rob a Royal Mail train at Swindon, which netted only ¬£700. But Reynolds, now looking for his career-criminal defining moment, started planning his next train robbery over a period of three months. Reynolds organised a gang of 17 men to undertake the Great Train Robbery (1963). Wilson was the gang's treasurer who gave each of the robbers their cut of the haul: ¬£150,000 each. He was captured quickly, and during the trial at Aylesbury Crown Court in April 1964 he got the nickname \\"the silent man\\" as he refused to say anything at all. Sentenced to 30 years, he was held at HMP Winson Green, where after just four months on 12 August 1964, he arranged for a three-man gang to break in and break him out. Wilson and his family settled in Rigaud, Quebec, Canada, situated west from Montreal and east from Ottawa. For Christmas 1964, the family travelled to Acapulco to join Reynolds and Edwards, who had not yet been caught. Reynolds and his family later moved to Montreal, but a proposed theft of Canadian dollars with Wilson was stopped due to Royal Canadian Mounted Police observation. Reynolds then moved to Vancouver, before returning that summer to the South of France. Capture Having successfully evaded capture for four years, Wilson was caught on 24 January 1968, after his wife telephoned her parents in England, thus enabling Scotland Yard to track them down. Returning to England, Wilson served 10 more years in the train robbers secure unit at HMP Durham. He was the final train robber to emerge from prison in 1978. Later career A later suspect in a ¬£100 million gold fraud, Wilson moved to Marbella, Spain, where he was suspected to be involved in drug smuggling. Engaged to launder some of the proceeds from the Brink's-Mat robbery, he lost the investors ¬£3 million. Death On 23 April 1990, Wilson's cousin and his wife who were staying with the Wilsons, left the house, noticing a young man with badly dyed spiky blond hair sunning himself beside his yellow bicycle on a nearby roundabout. The same man knocked on the front door of Wilson's hacienda north of Marbella, and when Pat Wilson opened the door, he asked (in a London accent) to speak to Wilson, as he had a message from Eamon Evans, a baseball cap pulled down shielding his eyes from view. Pat got him to leave the bike near the front door, and let him go out the back yard to talk to Wilson who was preparing a barbecue dinner to celebrate his and Pat's wedding anniversary. After five minutes of conversation, the visitor kicked Wilson in the groin, broke his nose, and shot him twice, once in the neck and once in the head. One of Wilson's two guard dogs sustained a broken leg trying to defend its master (it later had to be put down). The killer then jumped over the back fence in the one spot where it was possible to do so and land on the ground outside safely, and circled back to the front of the house to grab the yellow bike. An accomplice pulled up in a van nearby and the killer was able to put the bike in the back and escape. The whole hit was expertly designed to take out Wilson alone, and leave his wife alive. Charlie's wife Pat moved back to London to live near her daughters, leaving her terrier with Gordon Goody, and her surviving guard dog with the neighbour. Wilson was buried in Streatham Cemetery in London.Douglas Greenwood, Who's Buried Where in England, Constable, London (2006) pg 345 It is likely that Wilson was murdered on the orders of Roy \\"The Lump\\" Adkins, with killers identified by Pat Wilson as Bill \\"Porky\\" Edmunds, with Danny \\"Scarface\\" Roff as the accomplice. The two men were known to work as a team. Adkins was furious with Wilson, that he had supposedly given 'permission' for smuggler Jimmy Rose to admit to police that a drug shipment he was carrying was owned by Adkins, who was already on the run from police. After a request from Rose, Wilson rang one of Adkins' associates, Eamon Evans, to ask whether Rose could name him. While Rose denies naming Adkins, two days after Wilson's call to Evans, police raided Adkins hideout in Amsterdam, only shortly after he had left it. Adkins, a heavy drug user as well as dealer was furious with Wilson, and would not agree to peaceful terms arranged by intermediaries. Whether or not the three men were guilty, they were widely held responsible and Adkins was himself gunned down on 28 September 1990. On 10 February 1996, Danny 'Scarface' Roff who had recently been released from prison was shot in the spine when a gunman walked into a club where he was present and sprayed him with bullets. In March 1997, a crippled Roff, now no longer able to walk, was shot dead in his car when he returned home.https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/feb/25/features.magazine37 Edmunds has survived by going on the run.

Although Rume√≠ka, along with the Turkic Urum language, remained the main language spoken by the Azov Greeks well into the 20th century, currently it is used by only a small part of Ukraine's ethnic Greeks. History The Crimea was Greek-speaking for more than a thousand years as a part of the Byzantine Empire. After the Fourth Crusade's sacking of Constantinople fragmented the Byzantine Empire, the Crimea became a principality within the Greek Empire of Trebizond. When that state, which was centered on the eastern Black Sea coast and Pontic Alps of northeastern Anatolia, fell to the Ottomans in 1461, the Crimean Greek principality (Principality of Theodoro) remained independent, becoming subject to the Ottomans in 1475. The beginning of large-scale settlement of Greeks in the steppe region north of the Sea of Azov dates to the Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì74), when Catherine the Great of Russia invited Greeks of the Crimea to resettle to recently conquered lands (including founding Mariupol) to escape persecution in the then Muslim-dominated Crimea. Due to the centuries of living under the Tatar and Turkish rule, many of the Greeks did not speak the Greek language anymore; thus the community was divided into the Greek-speaking Romeiis and the Turkic speaking Urums (see Urum language). In the 20th century, the Rume√≠ka was the Greek dialect used by most Greek-speaking villages in the North Azov Sea Coast region. There are about 17 villages that speak this language today. Modern scholars distinguish five subdialects of Rume√≠ka according to their similarity to standard Modern Greek. The Rume√≠ka is not the only Greek variety spoken in the northern Azov regions: the village of Anadol speaks Pontic proper, being settled from the Pontos in 1826. Dialectal affiliation Ethnic Greeks (including Urums) in Donetsk Oblast Quite often Rume√≠ka is described as a Pontic dialect. According to modern researchers, the situation is not as simple: arguments can be brought both for Rume√≠ka's similarity to the Pontic Greek and to the Northern Greek dialects. In the view of Maxim Kisilier, while the Rume√≠ka shares some features with both the Pontic Greek and the Northern Greek dialects, it is better to be considered on its own terms, as a separate Greek dialect, or even a group of dialects. Research and literature After the October Revolution of 1917, a Rumaiic revival occurred in the region. The Soviet administration established a Greek-Rumaiic theater, several magazines and newspaper and a number of Rumaiic language schools. The best Rumaiic poet Georgi Kostoprav created a Rumaiic poetic language for his work. This process was reversed in 1937 as Kostoprav and many other Rumaiics and Urums were killed as part of Joseph Stalin's national policies. A large percentage of the population was transported to Gulags. The Rume√≠ka dialect became subject of linguistic study in the late 1920s and 1930s, as part of the general program of identifying and describing languages of the USSR. However, linguists studying the language became victims of Stalin's repressions by 1937, and the research on the Rume√≠ka did not resume until the 1950s and 1960s. Scholars of Greek from Kiev, led by Andriy Biletsky compiled a detailed description of the language and recorded the folklore. As the Azov Greeks had apparently lost literacy in Greek already during the Crimean period of their history, a Cyrillic writing system, based on the Russian and Ukrainian Cyrillic was developed for them. (Literature of the Azov Greeks and the problem of the preservation of the cultural traditions of the ethnic Greeks) A number of books have been published in the Rume√≠ka Greek using this Cyrillic orthography. Besides native works, they included translations of the Lay of Igor's Campaign and of Taras Shevchenko's Kobzar. A new attempt to preserve a sense of ethnic Rumaiic identity started in the mid-1980s. Though a number of writers and poets make use of the Cyrillic Rume√≠ka alphabet, the population of the region rarely uses it; the majority of self-identified ethnic Greeks of Ukraine now consider Russian their mother language. The Rumaiic language is declining rapidly, most endangered by the standard Modern Greek which is taught in schools and the local University. Nonetheless, the latest investigations by Alexandra Gromova demonstrate that there is still hope that elements of the Rumaiic population will continue to use the dialect.. The work is based on field research in the Greek villages in Mariupolis region. The expeditions were carried out in 2001‚Äì2004 and were organised by St. Petersburg State University See also * Mariupol#Language structure, for the overall linguistic situation in the region * Varieties of Modern Greek#Other outlying varieties *Poetry of Leontij Kyrjakov in Rumaic language Notes Varieties of Modern Greek Languages of Ukraine ","title":"Mariupol Greek"},{"id":"38668592","text":"Patricia Ariza is a Colombian poet, playwright and actor.

The term \\"state capture\\" was first used by the World Bank, around the year 2000, to describe the situation in certain central Asian countries making the transition from Soviet communism. Specifically, it was applied to situations where small corrupt groups used their influence over government officials to appropriate government decision-making in order to strengthen their own economic positions; these groups' members would later become known as oligarchs. Allegations of state capture have led to protests against the government in Bulgaria in 2013‚Äì2014 and Romania in 2017, and have caused an ongoing controversy in South Africa beginning in 2016. Defining state capture The classical definition of state capture refers to the way formal procedures (such as laws and social norms) and government bureaucracy are manipulated by private individuals and firms so as to influence state policies and laws in their favor. State capture seeks to influence the formation of laws, in order to protect and promote influential private interests. In this way it differs from most other forms of corruption which instead seek selective enforcement of already existing laws. State capture may not be illegal, depending on determination by the captured state itself, and might be attempted through private lobbying and influence. The influence may be through a range of state institutions, including the legislature, executive, ministries and the judiciary, or through a corrupt electoral process. It is similar to regulatory capture but differs in the scale and variety of influenced areas and, unlike regulatory capture, the private influence is never overt. The private influences cannot be discovered by lawful processes, since the legislative process, judiciary, electoral process, and/or executive powers have been subverted. A distinguishing factor from corruption is that, while in cases of corruption the outcome (of policy or regulatory decision) is not certain, in cases of state capture the outcome is known and is highly likely to be beneficial to the captors of the state. In 2017 a group of South African academics further developed the concept in a report on state capture in South AfricaState Capacity Research Group, 2017, Betrayal of the Promise, Johannesburg: Public Affairs Research Institute Betrayal of the Promise Report. The analysis emphasised the political character of state capture arguing that in South Africa a power elite violated the Constitution and broke the law in the service of a political project, which they believed unachievable in the existing constitutional/ legal framework. Further, in cases of corruption (even rampant) there is plurality and competition of corruptors to influence the outcome of the policy or distribution of resources. However, in state capture, decision-makers are usually more in a position of agents to the principals, i.e., the captors, who function either in monopolistic or oligopolistic (non-competitive) fashion. Examples by country=Bulgaria= Protests in Bulgaria in 2013‚Äì14 against the Oresharski cabinet were prompted by allegations that it came to power due to the actions of an oligarchic structure (formerly allied to Boyko Borisov) which used underhand maneuvers to discredit the GERB party. Conversely, in 2020 large anti-GERB protests broke out, accusing Borisov and his party of once again allying themselves with oligarchic organizations, permitting corruption and undermining political opposition. =Hungary= The state capture of Hungary began after 2010 when the former main opposition party, Fidesz‚ÄìKDNP, won the requisite two-thirds of the vote in the parliamentary election. This made manipulation of the constitutional law and the Constitutional Court possible. Parliamentary election laws were later changed to benefit the new governmental party. Step by step, the different institutional applications, competitions, and tenders have been won almost exclusively by organizations and individuals loyal to the government. The winners have frequently been relatives of the governmental staff or otherwise connected with them. The management of different institutions has been filled with persons loyal to the government. Independent applicants have been rejected without explanation or by formal causes. The incomes of the government-independent media evaporated and their fortunes fell. The hungarian government has wanted also major influence on the distribution of the EEA and Norway Grants founding several government independent organisation. Therefore the founding has been stalled. The grants and advertising expenditures of the state-owned and government-loyal companies have been directed to the purpose of the widely accessible propagandistic state media and to the government- loyal press. The pro-government media foundation, the Central European Press and Media Foundation (abbreviated as KESMAhttps://cepmf.hu/ in Hungarian) dominates the media landscape. The majority of the Hungarian population can only access government-influenced radio stations. Only a single government- independent television channel has been tolerated as a source of unfiltered news. The propaganda applies classical Machiavellian cunning, regularly using war terms and touts three ostensible public enemies: \\"Brussels\\", \\"migrants\\" and \\"George Soros\\". Altogether, these proceedings provided additional two- thirds majority for the governmental party in 2014 and 2018, and more unrestricted possibilities for the administration. = Latin American countries = Instances where politics have been ostensibly deformed by the power of drug barons in Colombia and Mexico are also considered as examples of state capture. =South Africa= In 2016 there were allegations of an overly close and potentially corrupt relationship between the wealthy Gupta family and the South African president Jacob Zuma, his family and leading members of the African National Congress (ANC). South African Opposition parties have made claims of \\"State Capture\\" following allegations that the Guptas, said to be close to President Jacob Zuma, his family and other ANC leaders, had insinuated themselves into a position where they could offer Cabinet positions and influence the running of government. These allegations were made in light of revelations by former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor and Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas that they had been offered Cabinet positions by the Guptas at the family's home in Saxonwold, Johannesburg. COSATU protester in Cape Town holding a protest placard calling for the prosecution of \\"all people involved in the state capture activities.\\" The protest was against government corruption and state capture in the administration of South African President Jacob Zuma. Mentor claimed that in 2010 the Guptas had offered her the position of Minister of Public Enterprises, provided that she arranged for South African Airways to drop their India route, allowing a Gupta linked company (Jet Airways) to take on the route. She said she declined the offer, which occurred at the Guptas' Saxonwold residence, while President Zuma was in another room. This came a few days before a cabinet reshuffle in which minister Barbara Hogan (then Minister of Public Enterprises) was dismissed by Zuma. The Gupta family denied that the meeting took place and also denied offering Mentor a ministerial position. President Zuma claimed that he had no recollection of Vytjie Mentor. Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas said he had been offered a ministerial position by the Guptas shortly before the dismissal of Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene in December 2015, but had rejected the offer as \\"it makes a mockery of our hard-earned democracy‚Äö the trust of our people and no one apart from the President of the Republic appoints ministers\\". The Gupta family denied offering Jonas the job of Finance Minister. In 2016, Paul O'Sullivan's 'Forensics for Justice' published a report, which alleged that South Africa's criminal justice system had been 'captured' by the underworld. Following a formal complaint submitted in March 2016 by a catholic priest, Father Stanslaus Muyebe, the Guptas' alleged \\"state capture\\" was investigated by Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. President Zuma and Minister Des van Rooyen applied for a court order to prevent the publication of the report on 14 October 2016, Madonsela's last day in office. Van Rooyen's application was dismissed, and the President withdrew his application, leading to the release of the report on 2 November 2016. On 25 November 2016, Zuma announced that the Presidency would be reviewing the contents of the state capture report. He said it \\"was done in a funny way\\" with \\"no fairness at all,\\" and argued he was not given enough time to respond to the public protector. Zuma and Van Rooyen denied any wrongdoing whilst the Guptas disputed evidence in the report and also denied being involved in corrupt activities. In an exclusive interview with ANN7 (belonging to the Gupta Family), South African President Jacob Zuma said 'State Capture' was a fancy word used by media houses for propaganda proliferation. He said that a real state capture would include seizure of the three arms of the constitution - Legislative, Executive and Judiciary - which has never been the case in South Africa. The report recommended establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry into the issues identified, including a full probe of Zuma's dealings with the Guptas, with findings to be published within 180 days. In May 2017, Jacob Zuma denied the allegation of blocking an attempt to set up a commission of inquiry to probe state capture. The report led to the establishment of the Zondo Commission of Inquiry in 2018, set up to investigate allegations of state capture in South Africa. In May 2017 a group of academics convened by Mark Swilling and including Ivor Chipkin, Lumkile Mondi, Haroon Bhorat and others, published the Betrayal of the Promise report, the first major study of state capture in South Africa. It helped galvanise civil-society opposition to the unconstitutional developments in South Africa Civil-Society Response. The analysis was further developed in the book Shadow State: the Politics of State Capture written by Ivor Chipkin and Mark Swilling Chipkin, I and Swilling, M et al, 2018, Shadow State: The Politics of State Capture, Johannesburg: Wits University Press The 2017 book How to Steal a City details state capture within the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality in South Africa during the Zuma government.  Economic impact  On 11 September 2017 the former Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan, estimated the cost of state capture at 250 billion rand, in a presentation at the University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business. The South African news publication The Daily Maverick estimated that state capture cost the country roughly R1.5 trillion (roughly US$100 billion) in the four years preceding 2019. South African Reserve Bank economist, David Fowkes, stated that the negative impact of state capture on the country's economy was worse than expected, stating that it likely reduced GDP growth by an estimated 4% a year. =United States= Donald Trump and his administration have faced allegations of attempting state capture and colluding with foreign powers (see Links between Trump associates and Russian officials) to increase the political and financial gain of individuals in the administration. Donald Trump has differed from historic presidential precedent by not placing his assets into a blind trust,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferwang/2016/11/15/why-trump-wont-use- a-blind-trust-and-what-his-predecessors-did-with-their-assets/#18077c2229c0 thus resulting in a conflict of private and public interests.

Biography  Sargant was born in London, the son of barrister and conveyancer Henry Sargant, and of Catherine Emma, daughter of Samuel Beale. Among his siblings were the painter Mary Sargant Florence and the botanist Ethel Sargant. He was a precocious child, and was said to have taught himself to read at the age of three. He was educated at Rugby School and New College, Oxford, where he took first-class honours in classical moderations (1876), second-class honours mathematical moderations (1877), and first-class honours in literae humaniores (1879). He was elected an honorary fellow of his college in 1919. After spending a year in a solicitors' firm, and reading as a pupil in the chambers of conveyancer Edward Parker Wolstenholme, he was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1882. After practicing as a conveyancer, he turned to court work. He was a fine draftsman, and two of his pupils, Sir Frederick Francis Liddell and Sir William Graham-Harrison, became First Parliamentary Counsel. He was appointed junior counsel to the Treasury in equity matters in 1908 and was elected a bencher of Lincoln's Inn the same year. He was said to not be very ambitious or industrious, and as a consequence he never took silk. Sargant was appointed a Justice of the High Court of Justice in 1923 and was assigned to the Chancery Division, receiving the customary knighthood. After the First World War, Sargant chaired the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors, but was forced to give up the chairmanship upon his promotion to the Court of Appeal. He was appointed a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1923 and was sworn of the Privy Council. He resigned from the bench in 1928. After his retirement he chaired a Board of Trade committee on patent law and practice and sat occasionally in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. He died at his home in Cambridge in 1942 and was buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground.

The Italian electoral law of 2015, also known as Italicum, was an Italian electoral law passed in 2015. The law, which came into force on 1 July 2016, regulated only the election of the Chamber of Deputies, replacing the previous electoral law of 2005, which had been ruled partly unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Italy in December 2013. It provided for a two-round system based on party-list proportional representation, including a majority bonus and a 3% election threshold. Candidates would have run in 100 multi-member constituencies using open lists. The largest party which won over 40% of the vote would automatically win a majority of seats; if no party won 40% of seats, a second round of voting would be held between the two largest parties, with the winner of the second round winning a majority of seats. The name \\"Italicum\\" was coined in 2014 by Democratic Party secretary and later Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who was one of the legislation's main proponent. The law was written under the assumption that major constitutional reforms would have taken place by the time it came into force. The failure of the reforms in the 2016 constitutional referendum created unforeseen complications, as electoral law for the Chamber of Deputies and Senate were not harmonised. This was compounded by a January 2017 Constitutional Court ruling finding the Italicum partly unconstitutional. In October 2017, the Italicum was repealed by the Italian Parliament and replaced by the Rosatellum. The Italicum is the first and only electoral law to have been approved by the Italian Parliament but never used in a general election.  History  The 2005 electoral law passed by the centre-right government, nicknamed the Porcellum, immediately received widespread criticism. The use of long closed lists, which gave party executives great power in deciding the composition of Parliament, was called into question, as was the regional allocation of the majority bonus in the Senate, which made a \\"clear winner\\" of the elections less likely. After two unsuccessful attempts at repealing the law by referendum, in the 2013 general election, the law failed to produce a majority in the Senate: as a consequence, the only way to form a government was by means of a grand coalition between left wing and right wing parties that had harshly fought each other in the election. The resulting Letta Cabinet was perceived by many people as the second \\"unelected government\\" in a row (after the Monti Cabinet). While the coalition agreed that a new electoral law was needed, it failed to agree on a specific model. The Democratic Party executive and prime minister Enrico Letta even went as far as requesting that his party vote against a parliamentary initiative by fellow democrat Roberto Giachetti to restore the previous Mattarellum law. On 4 December 2013, the Constitutional Court judged the Porcellum partly unconstitutional: in particular, the implementation of a majority bonus without a threshold required to achieve it was struck down. This made electoral reform even more urgent, since proportional representation without majoritarian correction was thought to be incompatible with the competitive party system of Italy. A few days later, on 8 December 2013, Matteo Renzi became the new leader of the Democratic Party. In his victory speech, he vowed to change the electoral law to counter the risk of \\"stabilized grand coalitions\\". Renzi's reformist agenda ultimately led to him replacing Letta as prime minister. Renzi came to an agreement with coalition partner Silvio Berlusconi regarding a set of institutional reforms, including a new majority-assuring law based on a two-round system, designed to make the necessitation of a grand coalition impossible. This law was nicknamed the Italicum. The new law faced harsh opposition, even by members of the parties proposing it. However, it was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on 12 March 2014 and, in an amended form, by the Senate on 27 January 2015, with the support of a large majority. After the election of Sergio Mattarella as President of Italy on 31 January 2015, Berlusconi withdrew his support of the bill. In order for it to receive its final approval by the Chamber of Deputies, the government decided to link it to a confidence vote (hinting at a snap election in case of a negative outcome). The bill was finally approved on 4 May 2015 and signed by President Mattarella two days later. =Political background= Several events contributed to the development of the electoral law into the current system: * The collapse of the consociative party system that dominated Italian politics between 1946 and 1993, which was replaced by a new (sometimes harshly) competitive system, making pure party-list proportional representation undesirable and arguably demanding a strong majoritarian correction. * The mediocre performance of electoral coalitions from 1994 to 2013: the two electoral laws of this period (the first a semi- proportional additional member system, the second providing a majority bonus for the winning coalition) gave rise to electoral coalitions which were prone to dissolving once in power. * The presence of small centrist parties in the Renzi Cabinet which lacked concentrated support, and as such were hostile to pure majoritarian solutions based on single-member constituencies, such as a first-past-the-post system. * The effectiveness of the system used to elect Italian mayors and city councils which assures a majority and employs a runoff election (though, unlike the Italicum, gives the majority bonus to an electoral coalition rather than a single party). Provisions Map of the electoral constituencies. Numbers indicate the number of deputies allocated to each constituency. The Italicum system regulates the allocation of 617 of the 630 seats of the Chamber of Deputies, excluding 12 seats attributed to representatives of Italians living abroad and one seat for the Aosta Valley region. One uncommon feature of this system is that it is majority assuring, thanks to a majority bonus assigned to the winning party, after a second round of voting if necessary. The territory of Italy is divided into 100 constituencies electing between 3 and 9 deputies, depending on their population. For each constituency, the parties designate a list of candidates: \\"head of list\\" candidates can run in up to 10 constituencies, while other candidates are limited to a single constituency. Gender balance is promoted by requiring that, in each region, head of lists of either sex for the same party should not exceed 60% of the total; additionally, candidates in all lists must be in a sequence alternating by gender. In the first round, voters receive a ballot allowing them to vote for a single party and for its head of list candidate (pre-printed on the ballot), and are given the option to express up to two additional preference votes for other candidates of that party, by writing their name next to the party symbol. If two preference votes are expressed, they must be of a different sex, otherwise the second preference is discarded. Only parties passing a 3% minimum election threshold in the first round are assigned seats. If the party receiving the plurality of the votes achieves over 40% of total votes, it is attributed a minimum of 340 seats (54%). The remaining seats are allocated to the other parties in a proportional fashion, and no second round takes place. If no party achieves over 40% in the first round, a second round takes place two weeks after the first. This time, only the two highest-voted parties from the first round participate. The party winning the second round is attributed 340 seats, and the remaining seats are allocated to the other parties in a proportional fashion, according to the results of the first round. The proportional allocation of seats follows the largest remainder method. Each party receives a certain number of seats depending on its national result: these seats are then distributed amongst the 100 constituencies, starting from the head of list and continuing according to the number of preference votes for each candidate. An amendment, known as \\"Erasmus amendment\\", ensures Italians studying abroad in the Erasmus programme can vote. Reactions Roberto D'Alimonte (LUISS), who was the main scholar proposing the new system, said that \\"the Italicum is a good instrument that represents a point of satisfactory equilibrium between governability and representativeness. However [...] good government [...] depends mostly on the men and women who use it\\".The Long Road to a Majority System He also made a comparison with the 2015 United Kingdom general election, stating that \\"the Italicum's advantage is indeed that the winner will be assigned 340 seats and the losers will have to divide the remaining 278 seats.... The point is that the Italicum is a majority-assuring system, such that it ensures that there will be an undisputed winner, but unlike the British system, it is not a winner-takes-all system. In fact, the winner does not take the entire pot, but only 54 percent\\".The English Lesson Former president of Italy Giorgio Napolitano, who was a key player in pushing Italian parties into reforming the electoral system, remarked that \\"this law certainly hasn't been written in a month, it took more than one year, there have been many discussions, there has been a committee of scholars who opened the way, therefore I believe this has been an important accomplishment\\". https://stefanoceccanti.wordpress.com/2015/05/07/napolitano-connette-la- riforma-elettorale-alla-commissione-dei-saggi/ Among the politicians critical of the reform, former prime minister Enrico Letta judged the Italicum \\"a close relative to the Porcellum\\" and voted against its adoption. Letta: Italicum parente del Porcellum, domani voto no. Cuperlo: noi contrari, ma no agguati Likewise, scholars have been divided on the electoral reform. Augusto Barbera (emeritus professor at the University of Bologna and one of the most prominent experts of Italian constitutional law) was unhappy with the possibility for a candidate to run in more than one constituency and with the low 3% election threshold but otherwise praised the law. He said that the system does not introduce presidentialism but strengthens the powers of the prime minister, which is \\"the characteristic of all functioning parliamentary systems (United Kingdom, German chancellorship, Spanish premiership)\\". https://stefanoceccanti.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/augusto-barbera-oggi-alla- camera-su-riforma-elettorale-e-costituzionale/ According to Stefano Ceccanti (Sapienza University of Rome), the law is \\"definitely a good one, it would have been difficult for this fragmented, troublesome Parliament... to do any better\\". https://stefanoceccanti.wordpress.com/2015/05/03/perche-si- allitalicum-sullhuffington-post-le-mie-16-risposte-alle-domande-del- sole-24-ore/ Tommaso Frosini (Suor Orsola Benincasa University of Naples) stated that \\"it is to the lawmaker's credit to have been able to make a synthesis of the two principles\\" of governability and proportionality. https://stefanoceccanti.wordpress.com/2015/05/09/tommaso-frosini-sullitalicum/ According to Pasquale Pasquino (New York University), the Italicum \\"should be preferred over pure majoritarian systems\\" in which \\"the electoral law decimates not only small parties, but even parties going close to a 20% of the people's votes\\". https://stefanoceccanti.wordpress.com/2015/05/09/pasquale- pasquino-su-elezioni-inglesi-ed-italicum-per-il-mulino/ Among critics, Gianfranco Pasquino (University of Bologna) wrote that \\"the Italicum is a bad reform with a single merit: the runoff giving real power to electors. As for the rest, the party bonus is wrong, as well as multiple candidatures and the low threshold for the access to the Parliament\\". Quel premier debordante Constitutional law expert Michele Ainis (Roma Tre University) was also critical of the reform. According to him, \\"the Italicum determines a direct election of the prime minister, giving him a turnkey majority\\", introducing a constitutional reform by means of an ordinary law. Le regole come atto di fede Among the foreign press, the Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s commented that \\"the important thing is that the law approved by the Chamber of Deputies obtains stability and governablity, nevertheless respecting the decision coming from the polls as much as possible\\" Renzi arriesga y gana Moshe Arens, writing for Haaretz (the main left-wing journal in Israel), has suggested to use the Italicum to regulate the election of the Knesset.Israel's formula for a stable government lies in Italy Constitutional review On 24 February 2016 a court in Messina sent the election law for review to the Constitutional Court after declaring petitioners' applications admissible. To save the Italicum from the application that hangs over its head, it would have been enough to pass an amendment to Article 66 of the Constitution, thereby eliminating the electoral esclusive cognisaince of the elected House, which is unknown in other countries : They objected to the law mainly on the grounds that it awards an unfairly large bonus to the winner and does not sufficiently enable voters to pick their MPs: http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2016/02/24/court-sends- election-law-to-constitutional- court-2_650916ba-6698-4589-8f83-68469f3234bb.html The judges called for the Constitutional Court to rule on eight out of thirteen claims that the Italicum breached the Italian Constitution. On 25 January 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled some aspects of the Italicum unconstitutional, including the two- round system and the clause allowing head candidates, who were permitted to run in multiple constituencies, to choose which constituency they wished to represent. The majority bonus was left intact, giving a majority to any party which won over 40% of votes in a single round of voting. After the ruling, the Italicum essentially provided for pure proportional representation, unless a party was able to win over 40% of the vote and secure a majority. Repeal The victory of the \\"No\\" votes in the 2016 Italian constitutional referendum prompted the resignation of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, the chief proponent of both the constitutional reform and the Italicum law. Electoral law became a pressing issue, as the Italicum was written under the assumption that the Senate would be an indirectly-elected body by the next general election. As such, the Senate was not addressed in the bill, and remained under the previous election law (Porcellum). The issue of two different election laws for the two houses of Parliament was further compounded after the Constitutional Court ruled that the two-round aspect of the Italicum was unconstitutional, revising part of the law, and effectively removing one of the distinctive aspects of the law, whose main goal was to guarantee the existence of a parliamentary majority. A new electoral law was needed, however opinions were diverse among political forces. Renzi personally supported a return to a semi-proportional system similar to the 1993 Mattarellum law. Berlusconi's Forza Italia called for pure proportional representation, while both the Five Star Movement and Northern League called for snap elections using the revised Italicum, with the same law applied to the Senate. Multiple proposals were floated, including a mixed-member proportional system similar to the German system, but failed to garner enough support for a serious debate. Ultimately, a parallel voting system similar to the Mattarellum was passed in October 2017, succeeding both the Italicum in the Chamber of Deputies and the Porcellum in the Senate. This system, known as the Rosatellum, allocates 37% of seats to single-member constituencies and 61% to proportional lists.

He was Professor of Astrophysics (1909) at Cambridge. He was the son of Robert Stirling Newall FRS and his wife Mary, daughter of Hugh Lee Pattinson, FRS. Newall took the Mathematics and Natural Sciences Tripos from Trinity College, Cambridge, and was elected Fellow in 1909. His father was an astronomer, and the Newall Telescope, a 25-inch refractor, built at Gateshead, was in its time the largest in existence. As things turned out, the telescope would dominate the son's life. Newall took up school mastering at Wellington after graduating. He returned to Cambridge when J.J. Thomson, the Nobel prizewinning physicist, asked him to be his assistant. After a period as demonstrator in experimental physics at the Cavendish Laboratory he turned to astronomy. This came about because in 1889 the university was offered Newall senior's telescope, but claimed to lack the funds to receive it and use it. Newall (junior) thereupon paid the removal expenses and then served as observer, and, from 1909 to 1928, as first holder of the chair of astrophysics, without a stipend. The telescope was installed beside the 1810 telescope at the Observatory on Madingley Road, and Newall built a home at Madingley Rise which became for half a century a resort of visiting astronomers. He served as President of the Royal Astronomical Society for a customary two-year term, 1907‚Äì1909. In 1913 he became the first director of the Solar Physics Observatory. Though elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in June 1902 for work on the spectrum of Capella, Newall was more a facilitator than a creative scientist. He led many eclipse expeditions. He married twice, first to Margaret (a pianist) the granddaughter of Thomas Arnold, the famed headmaster of Rugby School, and second, Dame Bertha Surtees Phillpotts, Scandinavian Scholar, formerly Mistress of Girton College, and the only woman member of the Royal Commission on Cambridge (1923-7), who is buried in Tunbridge Wells. He is buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge.

It contains a single species, Almadasuchus figarii. It is known from the holotype MPEF-PV 3838, a well-preserved posterior region of the skull as well as other skull and postcranial remains.  Description  According to a phylogenetic analysis that accompanied the first description of the species, A. figarii is the sister taxon or closest relative of the clade Crocodyliformes, a large group that originated in the Late Triassic and includes modern crocodilians. It is also a close relative of \\"sphenosuchians\\", a paraphyletic group of more basal non-crocodyliform crocodylomorphs. Almadasuchus is most closely related to the \\"sphenosuchian\\" Junggarsuchus from the Middle Jurassic of China. Almadasuchus is one of only four non-crocodyliform crocodylomorphs known from after the Early Jurassic, the others being Junggarsuchus and two \\"sphenosuchians\\" from the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation in the western United States, Hallopus and Macelognathus. Crocodyliforms appeared in the Late Triassic and began a major evolutionary radiation in the Jurassic, making Almadasuchus one of the last non- crocodyliform crocodylomorphs. Almadasuchus is considered a transitional form between crocodyliforms and earlier archosaurs with respect to its braincase. In nearly all diapsid reptiles the braincase is weakly connected to other bones that make up the back of the skull, making this region flexible or kinetic. In crocodyliforms, the braincase is strongly sutured to a bone called the quadrate, making the skull completely immovable or akinetic. The quadrate of Almadasuchus is not completely fused to the braincase, but makes connections with two braincase bones, the basisphenoid and the exoccipital. These two attachment points probably made the skull of Almadasuchus completely akinetic. Jungarrsuchus, which is the second most closely related non- crocodyliform crocodylomorph to crocodyliforms, has a quadrate that only attaches to the exoccipital.

It is scored for SATB soloists, SATB choir, violin I and II, 2 oboes, 2 clarini (high trumpets), 3 trombones colla parte, timpani and basso continuo. Although classed as a missa brevis (brief mass), the inclusion of trumpets in the scoring makes it a missa brevis et solemnis. Background The mass is often referred to as the Spaur Mass, although this is misleading; Leopold Mozart wrote in 1778 of a mass the family nicknamed the Spaur, as Wolfgang had written it for the consecration of Count Ignaz Joseph von Spaur. However, this could refer to one of many masses, including K. 257, K. 262 and K. 275/272b. The original score of this mass was discovered in the archives of the Brixen in 2007; this provides another link to the Spaur family, some of whom held power in the Bishopric of Brixen. An alternative nickname, Piccolomini Mass, is speculated to refer to the brevity of the mass; it does not appear to have any connection with the Piccolominis, a Sienese noble family. This is one of three masses Mozart composed in November and December 1776, all set in C major, including the Credo Mass (K. 257) and the Organ Solo Mass (K. 259).

Pope John Paul II with US President George W. Bush and his wife Laura during their first meeting at the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo in July 2001. The Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo, or the Apostolic Palace of Castel Gandolfo from its Italian name Palazzo Apostolico di Castel Gandolfo, is a 135-acre (54.6-ha) complex of buildings in a garden setting in the city of Castel Gandolfo, Italy, including the principal 17th-century villa, an observatory and a farmhouse with 75 acres (30.4 ha) of farmland. The main structure, the Papal Palace, has been a museum since October 2016. It served for centuries as a summer residence and vacation retreat for the pope, the leader of the Catholic Church, and is afforded extraterritorial status as one of the properties of the Holy See. It overlooks Lake Albano. History Palace of Castel Gandolfo with the domes of the Vatican Observatory visible at centre \\"The oldest parts of the castle date back to the 13th century,\\" according to Saverio Petrillo, former Director of the Papal Villas. \\"It was acquired by the Vatican in 1596 when the Savelli family, who owned it, were unable to pay a debt to the Papacy.\\" The gardens occupy the site of a residence of the Roman Emperor Domitian. The palace was designed by Swiss-Italian architect Carlo Maderno for Pope Urban VIII. Since then, about half of his successors have used the properties as a summer residence and vacation retreat, except for the years between 1870 and 1929 when the popes, in dispute with Italy over territorial claims, did not leave Vatican City. Pope Pius XI had the facilities modernized and began using the retreat again in 1934. In accordance with the Lateran Treaty of 1929, the palace and the adjoining Villa Barberini added to the complex by Pope Pius XI are extraterritorial properties of the Holy See. During World War II, an unknown number of Jewish refugees took shelter at the palace under the protection of the Holy See and many people used the site as a refuge from Allied bombing raids in 1944, though more than 500 people died in one such attack. Pope Pius XII died at the palace in 1958, as did Pope Paul VI in 1978. Pope John Paul II had a swimming pool built at the palace, which was criticized by some. Paparazzi used the opportunity to take photos of him. Pope Benedict XVI flew to the palace at the conclusion of his papacy on 28 February 2013, was joined by Pope Francis for lunch on 23 March, and returned to Vatican City on 2 May. Francis visited the property twice more, but has never stayed overnight. In June 2013, Francis announced he would not spend the summer in Castel Gandolfo as many of his predecessors had, but would lead the Angelus there on 14 July. In retirement, Benedict used it at Francis' invitation for a two-week vacation in 2015. On 7 December 2013, Pope Francis named Osvaldo Gianoli as the Director of the Pontifical Villas of Castel Gandolfo. In March 2014, the Vatican opened the Barberini Gardens to paid visitors on escorted tours during morning hours every day but Sunday. Beginning 11 September 2015, the public was able to travel from Vatican City to Castel Gandolfo by a train that had previously been reserved for use by the pope. Before the end of the year, products from the farm, previously only available to Vatican employees, were made available for purchase by the public. On 21 October 2016, the palace was opened to the public for viewing without undergoing any structural changes. When asked if the building would again become a papal apartment, Castel Gandolfo mayor Milvia Monachesi said: \\"the fact that the palace is now a museum will make a reversal in the future difficult\\". Legal status Pursuant to the Lateran Treaty of 1929, the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo is Italian territory, but owned by the Holy See and equipped with extraterritoriality comparable to that of diplomatic missions. It is exempt from Italian taxes and expropriations, and Italian authorities are prohibited from entering it without the consent of the Holy See.Lateran Treaty, Article 15 and annex II..

After some works performed by a detachment of 484th Aero Squadron (Construct.) on 1‚Äì11 September, Maulan was used as a main operating base by the 1st Day Bombardment Group during both the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne Offensives, with four squadrons of aircraft (11th, 20th, 96th and 166th) from 23 September onwards. In support of the flying squadrons, the 4th Air Park's 648th Aero Squadron had a flight of mechanics for repair of both aircraft and vehicles. Also, the airfield was the home of Photo Section #12 for processing and analyzing aireal photography. The ground support station consisted of various aircraft hangars, support buildings and quarters for personnel, primarily in the woods to the north and west of the field. After the armistice, the 1st Day Bombardment Group stayed there until 17 January 1919, when its HQ and three remaining squadrons166th had already left to join the 3rd US Army Air Service at Jopp√©court moved to Colombey les Belles to be demob'ed.

Roadway  La Rumorosa La Rumorosa also refers to the famous road that crosses the Sierra de Ju√°rez Mountains in Baja California, which is part of Mexican Federal Highway 2D. Initially, this road was a two- way street only somewhat dangerous due to the wind in the region and the steep grade of the road, as well as the recklessness of some drivers to try to finish this stretch of highway faster, causing numerous accidents. Currently there are two two-lane roads each, one upstream and the other downstream, with improved marking and consequently, a significant reduction of accidents. However, even with security measures, the road is still considered one of the most dangerous for inexperienced drivers, so it is always advisable to observe a minimum safe distance, to not exceed the speed limit, and use engine braking whenever possible. Headlights are advised in adverse conditions.  El Vallecito artifacts  In the town of La Rumorosa is the archaeological site \\"El Vallecito\\", a collection of native paintings that are a true portrait of the native American heritage of Baja California. The sites also contain pottery scattered on guards and a lot of mortars. To date, in El Vallecito more than 18 sets of paintings have been identified, important ones are: the \\"Rooted Man\\" group, the \\"Indian Cave,\\" \\"The Imp\\" group, the \\"Wittin√±ur\\" group and \\"The Shark\\".  Climate  Owing to its relatively high altitude, La Rumorosa has a cool semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen BSk), just above an arid climate (BWk). During the winter season can occur with prolonged cold periods of significant snowfall, with January being the month with the most snow. The area is subject to sporadic summer thunderstorms known as monsoons, whilst in winter snow storms occasionally affect the region. The average temperature of La Rumorosa in the coldest month (January) is and the hottest month (July) . The area has strong winds, facilitating development of wind power.Duncan Wood, Samantha Lozano, Omar Romero & Sergio Romero. \\"Wind energy on the border ‚Äî a model for maximum benefit\\" page 14-19.

It rises between the River Drava (Drau) and the Gail valley (in southwestern Carinthia) and through the southern part of East Tyrol. Its western group called \\"Lienz Dolomites\\" (Lienzer Dolomiten), is sometimes counted as part of this range and sometimes seen as separate. Classification According to the Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps (AVE) the Gailtal Alps (No. 56) are subdivided into the Drauzug proper and Lienz Dolomites subgroups, while in common parlance the umbrella term Drauzug conversely applies to the whole Limestone Alps range between the Drava and Gail rivers, including the Gailtal Alps and the Lienz Dolomites. In traditional geography according to Eduard Suess and Leopold Kober, Drauzug or Drau-Save-Zug denoted all Southern Limestone Alps ranges stretching along the Drava River, from the Lienz Dolomites in the west to the Karawanks in the east. Located south of the broad Drava Valley, the Gailtal Alps orographically count as part of the Southern Limestone Alps. However, they rise north of the Periadriatic Seam an therefore geologically do not rank among the Southern Alps ranges. In regard to their orogenesis, they represent the remnants of the limestone nappes which had been moved northwards across the Central Eastern Alps to form the Northern Limestone Alps. Despite their name, the Lienz Dolomites are not made up of dolomite, though the steep rugged karst topography resembles the South Alpine Dolomite rock formations. The northern Latschur group with Mt. Goldeck near Spittal an der Drau does not consist of limestone rocks, but is a crystalline basement massif.

Constituted by the Supreme Court of Pakistan on the request of the Government of Pakistan on 21 June 2011, the commission was chaired by the Senior Justice Javaid Iqbal and other members selected by the supreme court. The Commission critically evaluated and provided analysis on \\"ascertain full facts regarding the presence of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan\\" and thoroughly \\"investigated circumstances and facts regarding the American operation in Abbottabad on 2 May 2011.\\" The commission extensively interviewed local residents of Abbottabad, government ministers, military officials, and investigative espionage journalists. The Commission's final report included 300 witnesses and reviewed 3,000 official documents over two years. The final report was based on public testimonies and was prepared by the Senior Justice Javid Iqbal. The reports were submitted to Prime Minister Pervez Ashraf on January 2013 and were marked as \\"classified\\" by the government. No details were made public despite the requests of officials.

Despite Prime Minister Gillani addressing his concerns to PML, the party pushed for an independent commission to be formed. The PML persuasion was that \\"it did not want the armed forces to face another fiasco like the 1971 war or the Kargil misadventure. After meeting with the Lieutenant-General Shuja' Pasha of the ISI, Justice minister Bux Chandio hinted that the commission would be formed after the consultation. In June 2011, Prime Minister Gillani announced to form the commission under Supreme Court's Senior Justice Javed Iqbal. =Interview and studies= The Commission extensively interviewed 300 people and among the notable people summoned and testified to the commission were: **Hina Khar‚Äî Foreign minister at that time **Ahmad Mukhtar‚Äî Defense minister during this period. **Ziauddin Butt‚Äî former director-general of the ISI (in 1999). **Lieutenant-General Nadeem Taj‚Äî director-general of Military Intelligence (MI) **Ijaz Shah.‚Äî former director- general of Intelligence Bureau (IB), working under former President Pervez Musharraf from 2004‚Äì07 The 700-page report was prepared after the commission interviewed 300 witnesses and reviewed 3000 documents.

It occurs on reefs in shallow waters in the Red Sea, off the coast of East Africa, and in other parts of the tropical Indo-Pacific. Description Lobophyllia corymbosa is a coral that either forms flat sheets or hemispherical domes. Though usually under in diameter this coral is sometimes several times that size. In the Red Sea, particularly large specimens are found. The individual lobes of the coral are united at their bases and are long and wide. The polyps are large and each one secretes a corallite or stony cup around itself. These are irregular in shape and form the skeleton of the coral. There is a distinct wall between the corallites, each one of which has numerous radiating vertical ridges known as septa. These septa are narrow within the corallite but thicker and longer on the walls. Their blunt teeth give the coral a prickly appearance. The corallites tend to be the shape of an hourglass and the polyps inside are thick and fleshy. They are normally retracted in the daytime but extend their tentacles at night to feed. The colour of the polyps is bluish or greenish-grey, or yellowish-brown. This colour is due to the zooxanthellae, the minute symbiotic dinoflagellates which reside within the tissues of the coral. These photosynthetic algae use sunlight to create organic compounds and the coral is able to use these as part of its nutritional needs. Distribution The type locality of Lobophyllia corymbosa is the Red Sea. It is also found in the tropical Indian Ocean and the central and eastern Pacific Ocean at depths down to about . Its western range includes Mozambique, Madagascar, the Seychelles, R√©union, Mauritius, Aldabra and Chagos. It also occurs further east in Australia, Indonesia, Japan and the East China Sea. It is found on upper reef slopes and is common in some localities, but less so than the closely related Lobophyllia hemprichii. Biology When young, Lobophyllia corymbosa is a colonial coral with a layer of living tissue covering the skeleton and connecting the polyps. As the coral grows, this layer disintegrates, and the individual polyps, although clones of one another, live independent lives on the coral skeleton in close proximity but unconnected by living tissue. It has been found that healthy polyps are prepared to transfer nutrients to injured neighbouring polyps that they recognize as clonemates. However, when corals were grafted so that neighbouring polyps were not clones of each other, no such transfer took place. This experiment showed that the polyps were not only able to recognise clones (even when they had been experimentally separated from them for years) but were also prepared to \\"help\\" them when they needed assistance. It is not clear if the transport of nutrients between the polyps is made by the transfer of blobs of mucus or whether it depends on the active movement of migratory cells. Status There are no specific threats facing this coral and it has a wide range so the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists it as being of \\"Least Concern\\". It is, however, subject to the reef degradation that threatens all corals, although it seems to be more resilient than many other species. It is collected for use in reef aquaria and in 2005, Indonesia, the chief exporter, had a quota of 12,800 live pieces.

There is still doubt as to whether he should be identified with the Master of the legend of St. Barbara or was only one of the artists active in a workshop responsible for the works of that master.  Life  Little is known about the life of Aert van den Bossche. It is believed that he was born ca. 1455 or earlier. He was possibly originally from Bruges although he or his ancestors may have come from the town of 's-Hertogenbosch. This can possibly be concluded from the fact that in Brussels where he was active from the 1490s he was recorded in 1499 as 'Aert van Panhedel alias van den Bossche, schilder' (painter). The town of 's-Hertogenbosch is colloquially referred to as Den Bosch (hence van den Bossche would mean \\"from 's-Hertogenbosch') and his name could therefore indicate he was originally from there. This assumption is further confirmed by the fact that when he registered in the Bruges Guild of Saint Luke he signed with the name 'Harnoult van den Boske'. It is also known that Aert's father, the painter Yanne van den Bossche, had received some orders from the Brussels guild as well. Aert van den Bossche had a son Gielis, a.k.a. Gielis Panhedel, who signed Gilken van den Booeske and was an accomplished painter. Aert van den Bossche became a city councillor of Brussels.Aert van den Bossche and the Master of the Legend of Saint Barbe at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium There is speculation that he may have been a pupil or assistant of Hugo van der Goes.  Work Martyrdom of Saints Crispin and Crispinian (right wing) There is uncertainty about which works can be attributed to Aert van den Bossche. The famous Virgin and Child in a Landscape, on view at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts is currently attributed to: 'artist(s) unknown, possibly Master of the Madonna Grog or Aert van den Bossche, formerly Master of the Embroidered Foliage'. The St Augustine sacrificing to an idol of the Manichaeans is now attributed to the Master of the legend of St. Barbara. The name 'Master of the legend of St. Barbara' was created by the German art historian Max Jakob Friedl√§nder to denote an anonymous painter or a group of painters who worked out of Bruges and Brussels. The only written proof that a specific artwork had been commissioned from him personally is a receipt of 1490 for the remuneration paid by the Brussels shoemakers' guild for the triptych of the Martyrdom of the Saints Crispin and Crispinian. The triptych was intended for the guild's altar in the St Nicholas Church. The discovery of this receipt led to the identification of an extant painting depicting the saints in question, and to the identification of its artist earlier referred to as the 'Master of the Legend of St. Barbara' with Aert van den Bossche. Since this discovery the triptych has been removed from the oeuvre of the Master of the Legend of St. Barbara. There is yet no unanimous view as to Aert van den Bossche's exact relationship with the Master of the Legend of St. Barbara and whether Aert van den Bossche formed part of the workshop of the Master of the Legend of St. Barbara. On stylistic grounds it is believed that Aert van den Bossche painted the right wing of the Triptych with the Miracles of Christ. Some specialists have claimed that he also collaborated with the Master of the Legend of St. Barbara: for example, in the panel of the Scenes of the Legend of Henry II, the figures in the section on the left could possibly be the work of van den Bossche.  The Martyrdom of Saints Crispin and Crispinian  The subject of the painting is the martyrdom of the Saints Crispin and Crispinian. According to the Christian legend the two saints were twin brothers born to a noble Roman family in the 3rd century AD. They were allegedly persecuted, tortured and put to death for their faith by Rictus Varus in Belgic Gaul. They became the patron saints of cobblers, tanners, and leather workers, and the church honoured them with a feast day celebrated on 25 October.The two saints were removed from the liturgical calendar (but not declared to no longer be saints) during the Catholic Church's Vatican II reforms. The martyrdom triptych has not survived in its original form, as the central part of the triptych has been separated from the wings. In the early 19th century, the central part (or the largest middle panel) was purchased in St. Petersburg from a private owner by Count Stanis≈Çaw Potocki, Master of the Horse (Konyushy) at the court of the Russian Tsar during the foreign Partitions of Poland. It was put on display at his Wilan√≥w Palace, which Potocki had turned into an art centre. Unlike other Polish nobles at the time, Potocki did not take part in the November Uprising against Russia. For over a hundred years after its last verified purchase, nobody knew what subject matter was depicted in the composition. Speculation included the Ten thousand martyrs and other themes known already from D√ºrer. The subject matter was finally discovered by Jan Bia≈Çostocki (pl) from the Polish Academy of Sciences, professor of Warsaw University and one-time curator at the National Muzeum in Warsaw. He identified some 13 plants in the painting, most of them used in leather tanning. The shoemakers' guild was a \\"connective tissue\\" in his subject-matter analysis. The written record confirms that the masterpiece was donated by the guild as an altarpiece for the St. Nicholas Church, located next to the Bourse, in Brussels to secure their own prosperity. The subject matter relates to the shoemaker trade. The painting depicts the legendary martyrdom of Saints Crispin and Crispinian. They had their bones broken (left), toenails extracted (upper left), skin ripped off of their backs in long narrow strips (center); they were thrown off the cliff into the Aisne river (upper right) and when they refused to drown they were boiled alive in a cauldron (upper corner) before being beheaded. The central panel of the painting is on display at the National Museum in Warsaw, on deposit from the collection of the Palace Museum in Wilan√≥w since 1995. Efforts to locate the missing panels continue even if only for the sake of historical record. Nothing is known about the left-hand side of the triptych including subject matter. Part of the outside panel of the right-hand wing (cut in half) is in the Moscow Pushkin Museum, while the inside of the same right wing panel is in the Museum of the City of Brussels. Triptych with the Miracles of Christ Triptych with the Miracles of Christ: The Raising of Lazarus The Triptych with the Miracles of Christ is held in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne. It is a fairly small scale work measuring about 112 by 184 cm.Lynn F. Jacobs, Opening Doors: The Early Netherlandish Triptych Reinterpreted, Penn State Press, 2012, p. 148-150 Although there is still no unanimity on the attribution of each panel of the work, it is generally believed that the triptych represents a collaboration between three artists working in Brussels at the same time: the Master of the Legend of Saint Catherine (central panel), the Master of the Princely Portraits (left wing) and Aert van den Bossche. There is evidence to suggest that the works were not produced in a single workshop where they could have been placed side by side during their execution. Rather, the fact that the line of the horizon varies in each panel and that the scale of the figures nor the perspective match up are indications that the three parts of the triptych were produced in separate locations where each artist worked in isolation from the others. It has been assumed that a possible reason for this work method had to do with the urgency of the commission or that it was in response to specific instructions of the commissioner of the work.The Triptych with the Miracles of Chris at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium The person who commissioned the work was Adolph of Cleves, Lord of Ravenstein, a powerful individual connected to the rulers of Burgundy. He is depicted in the front and middle of the left panel entitled The Marriage at Cana. The triptych depicts on the left wing Christ's first miracle at the wedding of Cana and ends with the last miracle of Christ, the raising of Lazarus, which is depicted on the right wing attributed to van den Bossche. The central panel depicts the miracle of the multiplication of the loaves.  References  Further reading    The Flemish primitives. Biography of Dieric Bouts (circa 1470-1475).

It can be found along the western coast of North America, ranging from the Aleutian Islands to San Francisco Bay. Common names for this clam include butter clam, Washington clam, smooth Washington clam and money shell. Numerous valves of this species have been found in the shell middens on Sidney Island in British Columbia, Canada. Description This large clam can live for more than twenty years and grow to a length of , with smaller individuals being nearly as high as they are long. The umbones are set at an angle of more than 110¬∞ and the ligament joining the valves is black and external. There are no radial ridges but the oval valves are sculpted by well-defined concentric rings. Each valve has three cardinal teeth. The general color of the exterior of the shell is white, but this may be stained reddish-brown by iron sulfide from the sediment. The interior of the shell is smooth and white, but not glossy, with a pallial line, a pallial sinus and two adductor muscle scars of equal size. The siphons are united and about long, and have black tips. Distribution and habitat S. gigantea is native to shallow waters in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from the Bering Sea and the Aleutian Islands southwards to San Francisco Bay in California, although it rarely occurs south of Humboldt Bay. It is found buried in soft sediments such as sand, muddy sand and gravel, from the low intertidal zone down to about . Ecology This clam lives buried in soft sediments, sometimes burrowing as deep as below the surface. It is a filter feeder and when feeding it extends its siphons to draw in a respiratory current of water, removes the phytoplankton and other planktonic organic particles, and expels the remaining water. Small pea crabs such as Pinnixa faba sometimes live symbiotically inside the mantle cavity, and the clam is preyed on by the larger Dungeness crab, the Lewis's moon snail, sunflower sea stars, mottled stars and sea otters. =Saxitoxins= Saxitoxins are a family of at least 21 neurotoxins produced by dinoflagellates that bioaccumulate in the clams and other bivalve mollusks as these algae are consumed and can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) when the clams are eaten. According to a 1996 report from the Marine Advisory Program at the University of Alaska, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers seafood unsafe if it contains more than 80 Œºg of PSP-causing toxins per 100 g of tissue of the seafood. It is clear that PSP-causing toxin levels are typically much higher in the summer months though this does not mean the seafood is necessarily safe at other times. Risks also vary based on species but seafood available for retail sale is required to meet the FDA standards. Although humans cannot detect the toxins in the tainted clams, it seems that sea otters and seabirds are able to do so, and avoid feeding on them. In PSP poisonings that occurred in the summer of 1993 in Kodiak, Alaska, saxitoxin levels as high as 19,600 Œºg / 100 g were measured in the Alaskan blue mussel Mytilus edulis - sufficient to provide a lethal dose in a single 2.5 g mussel. By contrast, the highest measured level of saxitoxin in the Pacific littleneck clam Leukoma staminea was 580 Œºg / 100 g according to this 1996 report. Butter clams \\"tend to accumulate the highest levels of PSP toxins\\" with levels as high as 7,500 Œºg / 100 g having been recorded. The toxicity difference between these two clams can be attributed to the fact that the littleneck clam has an enzyme that converts saxitoxin into decarbamoylsaxitoxin, a capability that significantly reduces the quantity of saxitoxins present and that is not shared by the blue mussel nor by the butter clam.

He was appointed to this position on February 28, 2012, subsequent to the Brady Campaign's merger with The Center to Prevent Youth Violence. This position ended in 2017.  Early life  Dan previously co-founded and directed the Center to Prevent Youth Violence (CPYV) (formerly known as PAX). He became an activist on the issue of gun violence when his brother was shot and severely wounded in the 1997 Empire State Building shooting. Prior to his activism on gun violence, Dan was a partner at JWT Advertising Agency in New York City. There he managed accounts such as Kodak, Lipton and Warner Lambert. Dan graduated from Tulane University in New Orleans with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and a minor in Economics.  Activism  The Brady Campaign was named after Sarah and Jim Brady. They worked through the late 1980s and early 1990s to institute the system of background checks in the United States. As the President of the Brady Campaign, Dan Gross worked closely with the White House and Congress on the set of comprehensive legislation they proposed after the Newtown shooting. Although legislation requiring new expanded background checks before gun purchases failed to pass in the U.S. Senate in April 2013, Gross and the Brady Campaign continue to promote legislation to prevent gun violence. Throughout his career as an advocate, Gross has also worked to address gun violence as a public health and safety issue through the ASK (Asking Saves Kids) campaign and related programs.Evaluation of the ASK Campaign in Two Midwestern Cities ISRN Public Health As President of the Brady Campaign, Gross has also overseen lawsuits and other measures to combat irresponsible conduct by small numbers of gun sellers that disproportionately supply guns recovered in connection to crime. Since the Newtown, CT shooting, Dan Gross has appeared on numerous news shows and participated in many press conferences on this issue. Some believe that public consensus has shifted since 2013 to support the positions that Gross and Brady Campaign have taken on gun violence prevention. In January 2016, Gross and the Brady Campaign supported executive actions by President Barack Obama to reduce illegal sales of guns without background checks. During the 2016 Democratic Presidential primaries, Dan Gross campaigned on behalf of candidate Hillary Clinton at events in Iowa and South Carolina, the site of a mass shooting by a White supremacist in 2015.

He finished medical school and became a doctor. He practiced medicine for four years and later took football coaching courses. Football career=Club= Cutillas played for the youth team of Atletico de Madrid. He was called up to suit for the first team but was unable to do so because Cutillas was doing a compulsory military service. Cutillas eventually suited for the first team in a game against Zaragoza. Andres Soriano of the San Miguel Corporation brought Cutillas along with Francisco Escalante, Enrique de la Mata Calvo, and Claudio Sanchez in 1961 to compete in local commercial leagues in the Philippines. Cutillas left the country in 1965 for Spain to finish his medical studies and earn his physical training diploma but later returned to the Philippines in 1967. =Managerial=Philippines After returning from Spain where he also obtained a national coaching license, Cutillas was appointed as the head coach of the Philippine national team in late 1967 succeeding Emilio Pacheco. Among his results with the national team on his first stint was 2-1 win over American club Dallas Tornado at home in 1968 with practically the same squad that played in the 0‚Äì15 record lost to Japan in the Asian Olympic qualifiers. He also coached the Philippine team that participated at the 1968 AFC Youth Championship. The Philippines reached the quarterfinals, its best finish in the tournament. Florentino Broce took over as head coach of the national team from 1993 until 1994. The national team's poor performance at the 1974 Asian Games caused the Philippine Football Association to reappoint Cutillas. Cutillas coached until 1978. He also led San Beda College to three consecutive football titles at the NCAA, as well as steering the San Miguel Corporation FC to five PFA championships.

Vivint Solar operates in 23 U.S. states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia). It has installed over 188,000 solar panel systems totaling over 1290 MegaWatts of rooftop solar as of March 2020. It uses fleet vehicles carrying the traditional Vivint orange coloration. Founded in 2011 as an offshoot of Vivint, Vivint Solar went public in 2014. Vivint Solar is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The company is considered to be a green home technology company and is the fastest growing solar energy company in the U.S. which uses the power purchase agreement (PPA) model. In 2016, Vivint Solar introduced a new CEO, David Bywater. In 2017, the company partnered with Mercedes-Benz Energy on home batteries; Vivint Smart Home to track energy consumption to save electricity; and ChargePoint, which provides electric vehicle (EV) charging stations for the home. History In October 2011, home automation company Vivint, Inc. started and incorporated a new, solar division of the company, Vivint Solar. In November 2012, the Blackstone Group acquired a controlling interest in Vivint, Vivint Solar, and 2GIGhttp://2gig.com/ Technologies for in excess of $2 billion. After the Blackstone acquisition, the solar division evolved and became Vivint Solar, LLC., a separate, but related company. According to GTM Research, Vivint Solar was the number two residential solar installer in the United States in 2013, and maintaining its No. 2 position as of the end of 2016. In October 2014, Vivint Solar opened for public trading on the New York Stock Exchange. A class-action lawsuit was filed against Vivint in December 2014, with allegations that the company misled investors in their initial public offering by omitting data that showed the company's PPA model was falling out of favor with consumers.Karl-Erik Stromsta Lawsuits against Vivint Solar 'lack merit', company say, RechargeNews.com 12 December 2014, accessed 03 Aug 2017 Vivint contended that the lawsuit lacked legal merit. In February 2015, Vivint Solar broke ground on a new corporate campus in Lehi, Utah near Thanksgiving Point, and began operating from there in May 2016. This five-story steel-construction high-rise is ultra-modern, and provides cafeteria service for its employees like its parent Vivint's corporate headquarters. In July 2015, SunEdison announced plans to buy Vivint Solar for $2.2 billion USD. In March 2016, Vivint Solar announced that the SunEdison deal had been terminated, and that the company was suing SunEdison for a \\"willful breach\\" of the planned merger. SunEdison is in bankruptcy as of January 2017, and Vivint Solar is one of many creditors.http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/07/13/vivint-solars-1-billion- lawsuit-adds-to-sunedison.aspx A second proposed class action lawsuit was filed in May 2016, arguing that Vivint misled investors about the SunEdison buyout offer.http://www.rosenlegal.com/cases-875.html Due to other financing arrangements after the failed SunEdison negotiations, Vivint Solar was predicted in mid-2016 to enter 2017 stronger than before, but from September 2017 until January 2019 their stock remained around $4 per share in comparison to a high of about $15 in 2015. In 2020 their stock price surpassed $15.http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/vslr/interactive-chart Analysis from early 2017 found that while Vivint Solar had greater access to capital, actual installation of home solar panels fell substantially with a drop of 21% from late 2015 to late 2016.Christian Roselund (2017). Vivint Solar installations decline in Q4, PVMag.com, 16 March 2017; accessed 12 April 2017 In 2017, the company expanded to 20 states. Vivint Solar has installed 100,000 solar energy systems as of February 2017. In July 2020, Sunrun acquired Vivint Solar for $3.2 billion. Technology Vivint Solar's customers can finance a system with a loan, purchase or lease a system, or purchase energy based on a long- term contract‚Äîa PPA. With a loan or cash sale, customers own the panels after paying for the installation outright or securing financing. In the PPA structure, customers pay a fee per kilowatt hour based on the amount of electricity the solar energy system actually produces. In the lease structure, the customer's monthly payment is fixed based on a calculation that takes into account expected solar energy generation. The lease includes a production guarantee under which Vivint Solar agrees to make a payment to the customer if the leased system does not meet the guaranteed production level. Most of Vivint Solar's growth as of 2013 had come from door-to-door sales. During 2016 the PPA model was losing favor with consumers who increasingly preferred to buy solar power systems outright rather than lease them or engage in PPAs. This change has contributed to Vivint's financial troubles.Vivint Solar Is Struggling To Survive, SeekingAlpha.com, Nov 4, 2016, accessed Aug 3, 2017 During Q3 of the 2016 calendar year, Vivint Solar started offering loans and cash sales, and recorded 84% year-over-year growth in revenue that quarter. Products In 2017, Vivint Solar expanded its products beyond solar panels to energy storage, EV charging and smart energy management. It announced partnerships with Mercedes-Benz Energy to offer home storage batteries, Vivint Smart Home to integrate energy consumption tracker and ChargePoint to charge electric vehicle (EVs) at home. As Mercedes-Benz was not able to fulfill some of Vivint Solar's requirements, LG Batteries became the new partner. The company's Fully Integrated Solar allows customers to purchase a Vivint Solar rooftop solar system, a ChargePoint Home electric vehicle charger, an LG storage home battery and Vivint Smart Home intelligent energy management.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/business/energy- environment/vivint-solar-mercedes-benz-battery.html  Controversy  In 2018, The Attorney General of New Mexico filed lawsuit against Vivint Solar, Inc. saying it was engaging in unfair and unconscionable business practices including clouding titles to consumers‚Äô homes, fraud and racketeering.Citation Needed Later in 2018, Vivint counter-sued the New Mexico Attorney General who was then under investigation for a pay-to-play scandal involving the original lawsuit against Vivint.

It is also known as Checkpoint or Check up on the Road. IMDb Trial on the Road was censored and taken out of circulation in the Soviet Union for 15 years after its release due to its controversial depiction of Soviet soldiers. The film is based on a story by the director's father, Yuri German. The screenplay was written by Eduard Volodarsky. This film is Alexei German's solo directorial debut which took a philosophical approach to the Soviet usage of \\"heroes\\" and \\"traitors\\". Screenplay by A. German and Eduard Y. Volodarsky (1941-2012), the film is based on the novel of his father (Operatsiya \\"S Novym Godom\\", or Operation \\"Happy New Year\\"), Yuri German (1910-1967), a Soviet novelist, screenwriter, and journalist. The original film title was that of the novel. Plot A memorial plaque to Alexander Lazarev. It mentions several Lazarev's depictions in literature and film The drama takes place in December 1942 during the Nazi occupation of the USSR in World War II. It revolves around the former Red Army sergeant Lazarev who was captured in his German uniform by Soviet partisans. Earlier he was captured by the Nazis and become a collaborator (hiwi), but after being captured by partisans he starts fighting against the Nazis. The title of the film was based on real events: partisans used to stop a truck full of \\"politsais\\" (police made of local collaborators) or Vlasovites and shoot them all after a brief trial, leaving one to tell the story. Lazarev's character is based on a real person as well, but his real-life role was to penetrate Vlasov detachments to convince Vlasovites to give themselves up. In the film, Lazarev voluntarily gives himself up to partisans, and two partisan leaders (of antipodal characters), Commander Lokotkov and Commissar Petushkov, put the collaborator to the test. For some partisans, he will be always a traitor and treated with suspicion, but for others this former Red Army officer, by joining the group of partisans, has to prove himself on the battlefield as a patriot and hero. In the end he got killed in action distinguishing himself by bravery and heroism.

It was \\"shelved\\" for the film's theme: it was harshly criticized for \\"deheroization of partisan movement\\" and for sympathy to a traitor, or collaborator with Nazi forces, but who becomes a hero in fighting against the Germans on the Soviets side. This \\"anti-heroic\\" depiction of Soviet history shows that distinctions like \\"traitor\\" and \\"hero\\" cease to have any real meaning, according to Alexei German's humane portrait of wartime.

She has worked as an anchor and reporter for the Tennis Channel and as the host of ESPN2's First Take. In July 2014, Champion became an anchor for ESPN's flagship program SportsCenter.  Early life  Champion was born in June 1978 and raised in Pasadena, California. Champion attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where she majored in English and minored in mass communications. She wrote for the Daily Bruin and was inspired to pursue a career in journalism by UCLA alumni, including Matea Gold of the Washington Post, who was the editor in chief of the student newspaper. Champion was drawn to journalism with goals of transforming negative stereotypes of African Americans: \\"I wanted to give people a voice that didn't have a voice. I'm always fighting for the underdog. I don't know where I got it from, but I've been like that all my life. That's why I love journalism.\\" In her junior year, she studied in Washington, D.C. and earned an internship at CNN. Champion graduated from UCLA in 1998, with an English degree.  Career = Early broadcasting work = Champion began her broadcasting career at several television stations. She moved to West Virginia for her first reporting job. She later said of working there: \\"I was a one- man-band carrying a camera and a tripod and that was God-awful. But I loved it because I wanted to do it. I always wanted to be a reporter.\\" She was a reporter at the Orange County Newschannel in Santa Ana, California before joining WPTV-TV in West Palm Beach, Florida in the same capacity in 2002. In November 2007, while working as an anchor for WGCL-TV in Atlanta, Champion was fired for allegedly uttering a profanity over the air. She appealed the firing and said in an interview for the Maynard Institute that the floor director had not cued her and her co-anchor following a commercial break, and that the microphone picked up a conversation they were having about an unhandy mechanical screenwriter: \\"I called the screenwriter a 'mothersucka' not the f-bomb.\\" She was rehired in January 2008, but left shortly after in March for a broadcasting job outside of Atlanta. After moving to Florida, Champion covered news such as human interest stories and devastating hurricanes in the state. While working as a reporter there, she developed an affinity for tennis after covering players such as Venus and Serena Williams: \\"They made me love the sport even more. They opened the door to tennis for so many different people.\\" She subsequently auditioned for the Tennis Channel's burgeoning news department and was one of three women selected from a pool of more than fifty candidates. She joined the network in 2009. Champion worked as a courtside reporter, and anchored the channel's Court Report news segment. She also worked as an entertainment reporter for the Starz network and shows such as The Insider and Hollywood 411. Cari is now a cohost of the Titan Games created by Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson. = Career at ESPN = On October 1, 2012, Champion joined ESPN as the new host of ESPN2's live debate show First Take. She was hired over Heidi Watney and Jemele Hill for the job. As the show's host, she moderated debates between sports pundits Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith, whom she said had \\"the biggest, strongest personalities in the building\\". After proposing ideas for stories to ESPN, Champion made her journalistic debut for the network on November 4, 2014 when she profiled and interviewed American football quarterback Cam Newton in a segment for E:60. That same day, she was the target of racist and sexist tweets from comedian Artie Lange, who jokingly portrayed himself and Champion in a sexual fantasy set during slavery. Lange tweeted an apology to Champion the following day and ESPN issued a statement to Sports Illustrated that rebuked Lange's tweets, while Champion did not respond publicly. After petitioning ESPN for six months to become an anchor on SportsCenter, Champion was promoted to the position in June 2015. She hosted her last episode of First Take on June 19 and began anchoring morning editions of SportsCenter in July.  Personal life  Champion grew up as an avid basketball fan. She is a fan of the Los Angeles Lakers and the UCLA Bruins. According to her, she is 6 feet 1 inch tall. Before working on the show, Champion was an avid watcher of First Take: \\"I love the barbershop debates that make First Take feel different than other programs\\".

Jack, who was Born a Gentleman, put 'Prentice to a Pick‚àíPocket, was Six and Twenty Years a Thief, and then Kidnapp'd to Virginia, Came back a Merchant; was Five times married to Four Whores; went into the Wars, behav'd bravely, got Preferment, was made Colonel of a Regiment, came over, and fled with the Chevalier, is still abroad compleating a Life of Wonders, and resolves to dye a General. The picaresque novel can be considered as a crime fiction, along with some of Defoe's other works such as Moll Flanders (1722) and Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress (1724).Gladfelder 2009, p. 64. It shares many plot elements and themes with Moll Flanders, the novels being published only eleven months apart. In common with many of Defoe's other works, Colonel Jack prominently tackles the subjects of money and crime. Plot summary The novel begins with Jack as an abandoned illegitimate child, whose attending nurse is instructed by his father to inform Jack when he grows up that he is a \\"Gentleman\\". The nurse dubs her own son \\"Captain Jack\\" to differentiate him from the two other Jacks under her care, and provides the protagonist with the name \\"Colonel Jack\\"; the other she calls \\"Major Jack\\". The nurse dies when Colonel Jack is ten, and the three young boys, thrown into the outside world, turn to crime; Colonel Jack becomes the assistant to a pick-pocket, Will, and is inducted into the skills of the trade. As the scale and nature of the crimes becomes more severe, Jack begins to understand the harm he is doing. After wandering the country with Captain Jack and settling in Scotland for a time, the two join the army but soon desert. Making their way to Newcastle, they are tricked into boarding a boat which they believed to be bound for London, but which is actually headed for Virginia. There they are sold into servitude. Jack serves his time and sufficiently impresses his master to become a plantation owner himself. He becomes a reformed character who repents his past life. On a return voyage to England, his ship is captured by the French, and Jack is landed at Bordeaux, where he is exchanged for a French merchant held by the English. Once back in England, and affecting French manners, Jack takes to calling himself Colonel Jacque. He is beguiled into marriage by a fortune-hunter who does not know the extent of his fortune. His wife proves to be a spendthrift and adulteress, and the marriage ends in divorce. Disgruntled, Jack leaves for France, where he purchases a company of soldiers and fights on the side of the French in the wars of the period. After being taken prisoner by the enemy, Jack becomes embroiled into marriage with a calculating woman, who is again an adulteress. He wounds her lover in a duel, and flees back to London. Jack marries again, though his wife becomes an alcoholic and an adulteress, and finally drinks herself to death. He remarries, but leaves the country after being involved in the unsuccessful Jacobite rising of 1715. He chooses to resettle in Virginia, his new wife, Moggy, having died in the meantime. There Jack encounters his divorced wife, reduced to being a house-keeper on his plantation, with whom he is reconciled and remarries. The colony becomes flooded with captured Jacobite rebels, transported there as punishment. Worried for his own security, Jack and his wife flee to the West Indies under pretence of illness, where he eventually learns of a general pardon of the remaining rebels and that consequently he is a free man. Returning to Virginia to join his wife, who has already made her way back to manage their business interests, Jack's ship is captured by the Spanish, and he finds himself taken to Havana. In spite of being a prisoner, he manages to profit handsomely from illicit trading adventures and soon returns to Virginia. Jack starts to trade on a regular basis with his Spanish contacts, but has to take refuge amongst them when his presence is discovered by the authorities. Pretending to be Spanish, Jack lives comfortably enough for some time, and has further thoughts of repentance and religion. The novel ends with Jack speaking of his intentions to travel to Cadiz, then from there to London, to be rejoined by his wife from Virginia. Themes Published only eleven months apart, Colonel Jack shares many plot elements with another of Defoe's works Moll Flanders. Amongst these similarities are: both Moll and Jack are orphans; they marry five times; they turn to crime initially from desperation; are wrongly arrested in the process; are transported as Indentured servants to America; become rich plantation owners; benefit from the advice of a teacher; reunite after many years with a lost spouse, with whom they live out their last days. In both cases the narrator reports to have returned to England at the closure of the novel. Similarly, they both aspire throughout to a state of gentility‚ÄîMoll from the influence of seeing those around her as a child, Jack after being informed it is his birthright‚Äîand both eventually achieve this.Gladfelder 2009, p. 73.

Dr. Jossi Jacob (IMOC Delegate and Faculty at Holy Trinity College, hasn't cuffs) Abune Mathias (born Teklemariam Asrat; 1941) is an Ethiopian patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church since 2013. His full title is \\"His Holiness Abune Mathias I\\", \\"Sixth Patriarch and Catholicos of Ethiopia\\", \\"Archbishop of Axum\\" and \\"Ichege of the See of Saint Taklehaimanot\\". Early life Teklemariam Asrat was born in 1941 in Tigray province, in the district of Agame, in Sebuha county.http://www.eotc- patriarch.org/images/PDF/Mesekel%202008%20English.pdf Teklemariam was ordained as deacon in 1954 by Abune Markos, the then Archbishop of Eritrea. Deacon Teklemariam served in several capacities at the Choh√© monastery, in Tembien district of Tigray, where he stayed for most of the subsequent 14 years. In 1963, he was ordained as a priest and monk at Choh√©. Now known as Abba Teklemariam, he left the monastery to further his education in Addis Ababa, and served in the Holy Trinity Cathedral from 1971 to 1976. During this time, the government of Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown, and the then Patriarch Abune Tewophilos was arrested and subsequently executed by the Derg military regime. Following the enthronement of Patriarch Teklehaimanot to replace Patriarch Tewophilos, Abba Teklemariam was appointed to serve as the Patriarchal Vicar to the new Patriarch, and functioned as his closest aide. In 1978, as the Derg identified the senior Archbishops and Bishops with the fallen Imperial government, it ordered that all the senior hierarchs go into retirement. As a result, Patriarch Abune Tekle Haimanot had to anoint 14 new bishops to fill the vacancies left by the retiring hierarchs. Abba Teklemariam was thus anointed as the new bishop of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem and the Holy Land in 1978 and adopted the new episcopal name and title of Abune Mathias. While serving in Jerusalem he was elevated from Bishop to Archbishop. In early 1980, Abune Mathias became the first leader of the church to issue a denunciation of the rule of the communist Derg. Consequently, he lived abroad for more than thirty years. He pronounced an anathema against Mengistu Haile Mariam and the members of the regime, and then went into exile. Abune Mathias eventually settled in Washington, D.C., where he presided over an Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church made up of exiles who had fled the Ethiopian revolution, and continued to broadcast messages against the Derg regime on Voice of America. In 1992, Abune Mathias returned to Ethiopia following the fall of the Derg and of Patriarch Abuna Merkorios to retake his seat in the Holy Synod. Following the enthronement of Patriarch Abune Paulos, Abune Mathias was named Archbishop of North America. Later, the Archdiocese was divided and Abune Mattias served as Archbishop of the United States, when Canada became a separate archdiocese. In 2009, the Archdiocese of the United States was divided again into three new Archdioceses, and Abune Mathias was asked to return to take up his former Archdiocese of Jerusalem. Before departing for the Holy Land, Abune Mathias played a key role in initiating attempts to reach a reconciliation between the Holy Synod in Addis Ababa, and the exiled Synod in the United States headed by former Patriarch Abune Merkorios.http://www.lastampa.it/2013/02/28/vaticaninsider/eng/world- news/ethiopia-matthias-is-elected-new-patriarch-of-the-orthodox- church-3dloFphVXZXeOrVaiJoFkI/pagina.html Patriarch Abune Mathias became the 6th Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in the election held on 28 February 2013 where he received 500 of the 806 the votes cast by a college of electors representing various sections of the Church. He was enthroned at Holy Trinity Cathedral on 3 March 2013, in the presence of the hierarchs of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in Egypt, the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church in India and many other representatives of other churches. Following an agreement made on July 27, 2018, the previously exiled Abune Merkorios was reinstated and now serves as co-patriarch with Abune Mathias. Abune Mathias is fluent in Amharic, Tigrigna, English, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic.

The company's apps include animal character readers. The company was founded in 2012 by chief executive officer Freddie Laker, and privately launched its mobile app in alpha in February 2013. The company closed in 2014. Guide app Guide is a visual newsreader app for personal computers, mobile devices and Smart TV, which uses text-to-speech and avatar technologies to turn text-based online news, blogs and social media updates into video content. These technologies allow Guide to turn articles into news program-style episodes, incorporating video or images from the original source, while the text content of the article or blog post is read aloud by a virtual news anchor. The app creates a \\"channel\\" for each site or news source, within which individual blog posts or news articles are separate episodes. Guide allows users to choose from three different virtual news anchors in the base application, and the company has stated it will offer additional avatars and newsroom backgrounds for purchase. An alpha version of the app, for iPad only, was privately released on February 8, 2013. Screenshot showing the Guide app's user interface Background Freddie Laker, former vice president of strategy at Sapient Nitro and founder of digital agency iChameleon Group, developed the idea for Guide in 2011 after he noticed the rising trend in Smart TVs and Smart TV content at that year's CES. He observed that the apps for Smart TV did not provide content in a TV-friendly format and decided to create an app that would provide a \\"TV experience\\". In January 2013, Laker was joined at the company by chief operating officer Leslie Bradshaw. The company is based in Miami, Florida, and has seven employees . Guide closed its seed funding round in February 2013. It raised $1 million from investors including Sapient, the Knight Foundation, MTV founder Bob Pittman, founding Google team member Steve Schimmel, and actor Omar Epps. The company stated that the seed money will be used to focus on further development of the Guide app and pursuing patents for its technology. In February 2013, Guide was one of 65 companies out of 500 applicants selected to demonstrate its app in the annual South by Southwest (SXSW) Accelerator in Austin.

Wong reflects on the universal representations of Western ideals of beauty advertised in American popular culture; from which, Wong expresses her desire to be white, to be normal. She states \\"...to become/a woman, a desirable woman, I began to wear/imaginary pale skin.\\"Nellie Wong, \\"This Bridge Called My Back\\", Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press, 1981, accessed 27 February 2013. The lack of and negative stereotypical representations of Asian-American women in Western popular culture denied Nellie Wong the agency to privilege her intersectional identity. The result of this patriarchal tool made Wong shameful of her Chinese heritage: \\"when I was growing up, I felt/dirty. I thought that god/made white people clean/and no matter how much I bathed/I could not change, I could not shed/my skin in the gray water.\\" Nellie Wong's piece identifies the invisibilization of racial issues in the second-wave feminist movement. Her work, particularly this piece, is often cited in the works of feminists or advocates of feminisms with intersectional frameworks like This Bridge Called My Back. Although some argue that we live in a post-feminist society, that women have achieved equality, today this poem still speaks great volumes regarding the ways in which hegemonic femininity is still perceived and the tokenism people of various racial, sexual, religious, class, socio- economic status are portrayed as in Western popular culture and media. The last section of the poem, :\\"I know now that once I longed to be white. :How many more ways? you ask. :Haven't I told you enough?\\" has its last line indicated in the Columbia Granger's Index to Poetry in Anthologies.

The company operates as a film production company, film publishing house, investment and exhibition. History During early 1995, Cheil Jedang invested in the upstart film company DreamWorks SKG, and in June of the same year, Cheil Jedang established Multimedia Division. The division's later changed to CJ Entertainment in September, in time for their first film distribution deal with the movie Secrets and Lies. To aid their position in the film distribution industry CJ Entertainment built the first multiplexes of Korea with the first one, CGV Gangbyeon 11, opening in April 1998. CJ Entertainment's importance in the Korean film industry grew in 1997‚Äì1998 when the nation was caught in the wave of the Asian financial crisis. Many smaller film companies had to close up, leaving the road open for CJ Entertainment to capitalize on the new-found popularity of Korean cinema brought on by the success of Shiri in 1999. In April 2000, CJ Entertainment Inc officially founded. The success of their own films, most notably Joint Security Area that broke the Korean box-office records previously set by Shiri, helped the company grow into one of the two largest film companies in the country along with Kang Woo-suk's Cinema Service. Lately CJ Entertainment has expanded into other fields of entertainment industry, including Internet and Cable TV businesses. From 2007 onwards, CJ Entertainment was the Korean distributor for films by Paramount Pictures, including films by DreamWorks which was bought by Paramount, as Universal Pictures had taken over the Korean branch of its joint venture with Paramount, United International Pictures. CJ had already been distributing DreamWorks films for nearly a decade as a result of investing in the studio. It holds the highest market share among the distributors at 27.8 percent. In 2010, CJ Entertainment was merged with CJ Media, M-net Media, On Media and CJ Internet to form the entertainment & media subsidiary CJ E&M.; Since then, CJ Entertainment operates as a company under CJ E&M.; As July 2018, CJ Entertainment's parent company CJ E&M; merged into new company CJ ENM as a result CJ Entertainment operates under the new company since then.

In these specific regions of the genome, chromatin has lost its condensed structure, exposing the DNA and making it accessible. This raises the availability of DNA to degradation by enzymes, such as DNase I. These accessible chromatin zones are functionally related to transcriptional activity, since this remodeled state is necessary for the binding of proteins such as transcription factors. Since the discovery of DHSs 30 years ago, they have been used as markers of regulatory DNA regions. These regions have been shown to map many types of cis-regulatory elements including promoters, enhancers, insulators, silencers and locus control regions. A high-throughput measure of these regions is available through DNase-Seq. Massive analysis The ENCODE project proposes to map all of the DHSs in the human genome with the intention of cataloging human regulatory DNA. DHSs mark transcriptionally active regions of the genome, where there will be cellular selectivity. So, they used 125 different human cell types. This way, using the massive sequencing technique, they obtained the DHSs profiles of every cellular type. Through an analysis of the data, they identified almost 2.9 million distinct DHSs. 34% were specific to each cell type, and only a small minority (3,692) were detected in all cell types. Also, it was confirmed that only 5% of DHSs were found in TSS (Transcriptional Start Site) regions. The remaining 95% represented distal DHSs, divided in a uniform way between intronic and intergenic regions. The data gives an idea of the great complexity regulating the genetic expression in the human genome and the quantity of elements that control this regulation. The high-resolution mapping of DHSs in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has been reported. Total 38,290 and 41,193 DHSs in leaf and flower tissues have been identified, respectively. Regulatory DNA tools The study of DHS profiles combined with other techniques allows analysis of regulatory DNA in humans: *Transcription factor: Using the ChIP- Seq technique, the binding sites to DNA in certain transcription factor groups are determined, and the DHS profiles are compared. The results confirm a high correlation, which show that the coordinated union of certain factors is implicated in the remodeling and accessibility of chromatin. *DNA methylation patterns: CpG methylation has been closely linked with transcriptional silencing. This methylation causes a rearrangement of the chromatin, condensing and inactivating it transcriptionally. Methylated CpG falling within DHSs impedes the association of transcription factor to DNA, inhibiting the accessibility of chromatin. Data argue that methylation patterning paralleling cell-selective chromatin accessibility results from passive deposition after the vacation of transcription factors from regulatory DNA. *Promoter chromatin signature: The H3K4me3 modification is related with transcriptional activity. This modification takes place in adjacent nucleosome to the transcription start site (TSS), relaxing the chromatin structure. This histone modification is used as a marker of promoters, using it to map these elements in the human genome. *Promoter/enhancer connections: distal cis- regulatory elements, such as enhancers are in charge of modulating the activity of the promoters. In this way, the distal cis-regulatory elements are actively synchronized with their promoter in the cellular lines which is active the expression of the gene controlled. Using the DHS profiles, were looked for correlations between DHS to identify promoter/enhancer connections. Thus, it was able to create a map of candidate enhancers controlling specific genes. The data obtained were validated with the chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) technique. This technique is based in the physical association that exists between the promoter and the enhancers, determining the regions of chromatin that enter in contact in the promoter/enhancer connections. It was confirmed that the majority of promoters were related with more than one enhancer, which indicates the existence of a complicated network of regulation for the immense majority of genes. Surprisingly, they also found that approximately half of the enhancers were found to be associated with more than one promoter. This discovery shows that the human cis-regulatory system is much more complicated than initially thought. The number of distal cis- regulatory elements connected to a promoter is related to the quantitative average of the regulation complexity of a gene. In this way, it was determined that human genes with more interactions with distal DHSs, and with at least one more complex regulation, corresponded with those genes with functions in the immune system. This indicates that the complexly of cellular and environmental signals processed by the immune system is directly encoded in the cis-regulatory architecture of its constituent genes.

He was instrumental in restoring the prestige and popularity to the Grand National as the race had been marred by corruption in previous years.  Breeding  Manifesto was bred by Harry Dyas and was a son of Man O‚ÄôWar (not to be confused with the American champion) out of a mare called Vae Victus. He was a good looking bay horse with a white snip on his nose.  Racing career= Early career = Manifesto was given time to mature before making his racing debut. He fell in his first race in 1892 before winning a maiden hurdle race over two miles. He went on to win the Irish Champion Steeplechase and the 1894 Lancashire Chase. = 1895 Grand National = Manifesto first attempted to win the Grand National aged 7. He managed to finish fourth behind Wild Man Of Borneo under a weight of 11 stone 2 lbs and ridden by Terry Kavanagh. = 1896 Grand National = This year ridden by his owner Harry Dyas, Manifesto got no further than first fence after he collided mid-air with Redhill and fell. = 1897 Grand National = In a bid to change his luck in the race, Dyas employed Willie McAuliffe to train Manifesto with Terry Kavanagh riding again. The horse was weighted with 11 stone 3 lbs and sent off the 6-1 favourite. After one false start, the field remained intact until the Canal Turn with Manifesto racing second. A duel developed between Manifesto and Timon, before that rival fell at the third last fence. Manifesto was left clear to win by 20 lengths from Filbert. = 1898 Season = Manifesto won a two-mile chase at Gatwick in February, before being sold to Mr J.G. Bulteel for ¬£4,000 and being sent to Willie Moore‚Äôs yard.  Injury  Disaster struck in the lead up to the 1898 Grand National, when a stable boy left Manifesto‚Äôs stable door open and the horse escaped. Although he was recaptured, he managed to badly bruise a fetlock jumping a gate, leading to him missing the race. = 1899 Grand National = Manifesto was weighted with 12 stone 7 lbs with his half-sister Gentle Ida the next highest weight on 11 stone 7 lbs. The mare was favourite at 4-1 with Manifesto at 5-1. Also in the line up was the five-year-old Ambush II, owned by the Prince of Wales (future Edward VII). George Williamson was employed to ride Manifesto. Due to frosty ground, Aintree officials spread hay on either side of some of the fences, including at the Canal Turn. Cruising in mid-field, Manifesto jumped the fence well, but lost his footing on landing. Williamson lost both stirrups and even touched the ground with his feet, but Manifesto was able to gather himself and continue with his jockey intact. Once Gentle Ida fell, Manifesto had a simple task and won by five lengths from Ford Of Fyne, equalling the weight carrying record in the process. = 1900 Grand National = By virtue of his two wins, Manifesto was given 12 stone 13 lbs to carry, while Ambush II carried 24 lbs less. The weight told and the younger horse won with Manifesto only third while easing down. Both the win by the Royal horse and Manifesto‚Äôs game effort under his burden were applauded by the crowd. = 1901 Grand National = Both Ambush II and Manifesto missed the 1901 renewal, and Grudon won in their absence. = 1902 Grand National = Manifesto was 14 when he lined up the following year, but he still carried 12 stone 8 lbs and was ridden by Ernest Piggott. In heavy ground, he finished third behind Shannon Lass who carried only 10 stone 1 lb. Many observers thought this was his finest effort in the race. = 1903 Grand National = Manifesto returned for the seventh time under 12 stone 3 lbs with old jockey George Williamson. He ran a tremendous race to finish third behind Drumcree, holding off the seven-year-old Kirkland (the 1905 winner) for third. Many onlookers were sure this would be Manifesto‚Äôs last appearance in the race. = 1904 Grand National = Manifesto ran in the National one final time as a sixteen-year-old. Champion Flat jockey Mornington Cannon gained permission to ride the horse in his final gallop before the race and Ernest Piggott partnered him over the fences.

History  Sniper of the rebel al-Siddiq Battalions during the offensive On 6 February, rebel forces launched an offensive, named \\"Battle of Armageddon\\", on the edge of Central Damascus, with rebels entering the Jobar District of Damascus after overrunning a Syrian Army roadblock. Parts of the Damascus ring road which acts as a barrier between Central Damascus and Ghouta were also seized by rebel fighters. Rebels have also launched attacks on Adra, north east of Damascus. On 10 February, a rebel claimed that opposition forces had captured another military checkpoint in the Jobar district. However, Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated that while fighting for the highway continued, government troops regained control of the area after bombing rebel positions the day before. On 19 February, rebels began moving truckloads of anti aircraft weapons into Jobar in an effort to consolidate advances made in the Eastern Damascus district. On 20 February, a SCUD missile, fired by government forces, hit the command center of the islamist militia Liwa Al-Islam near Douma, which had been spearheading the attack against the roundabout and the Jobar district. Sheikh Zahran Alloush, the commander and founder of the brigade, had been wounded in the strike. The area was devastated and other rebel fighters were also killed or wounded. On 21 February, rebels launched 3 car bombings on security targets in the Barzeh neighbourhood in Damascus. Also fired several mortar rounds at the Syrian army's general staff headquarters in Umayyad Square, as well as other streets and squares known to house government and security offices, according to residents and activists. SOHR claimed that 22 people, mostly soldiers, were killed in these other attacks. On 27 February, SOHR claimed that rebels had fired several mortar shells which exploded in the military Judiciary and literature department of the University of Damascus. On 2 March, heavy fighting was reported in Darayya between rebels and the Syrian Army. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria claimed that rebels targeted a military column attempting to storm Darayya, and also defended several attempts by the government to storm Jobar. On 3 March, rebels reportedly fired several rockets at security forces headquarters in Damascus, though it is unknown if there were any casualties. On 12 March, 30 military deserters were killed in an Army ambush near Damascus while they were heading towards the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area. Situation in Damascus, mid-March 2013 On 18 March, rebels operating within Damascus launched mortar bombs at the Damascus Presidential Palace, though its unclear if there were any casualties. On 21 March, an explosion in the Iman Mosque in Al-Mazraa district killed as much as 41 people, including Sunni cleric, Sheikh Mohammed al-Buti. Al-Buti was one of the most prominent supporters of the Syrian government from the Sunni branch of Islam in Syria. Syrian State TV claimed the explosion was a suicide bombing, though some residents claim it was caused by a mortar bomb that struck a nearby political office. On 25 March, rebels launched one of their heaviest bombardments of Central Damascus since the revolt began, with mortars reportedly hitting Umayyad Square, where Baath Party headquarters, Air Force Intelligence and state television are also located. The attack was launched when rebel forces advanced into the Kafr Souseh district of Damascus, and the Syrian Army retaliated with artillery launched from Mount Qasioun.

Graves-Brown's Matter, Materiality and Modern Culture. In the 15-page chapter, written informally in third-person narrative, Latour describes a common object used in Berlin, a \\"Berlin Key\\" which is constructed so that after opening leaving one's apartment house, after unlocking the street door from the inside, one can only retrieve the key from the outside in a manner which locks the door behind oneself; upon entering, after one unlocks the door with the key, one must retrieve it from the inside, again locking the door behind oneself; this prevents leaving the door open but unlocked. The essay shows how many layers of significance a key can connote. In the P.M. Graves- Brown version, Lydia Davis translated the piece into English. Additional editing was completed and illustrations redrawn by PMGB. The title could have been chosen as a witty word-play off of J.L. Austin's How to Do Things With Words. Latour argues that while an object's purposefully designed material nature may recommend or permit a highly controlled set of functional purposes, it may also offer a broad range of valuable possibilities. Latour uses the Berlin key to show that there are social constraints which force people to do whatever it is that the object makes them do; thus, the object (the Berlin key) is a sign, of sorts, telling the inhabitants to 'lock their doors at night, but never during the day.' Latour discusses the relationship between the social realm and the technological realm. He asserts that the Sociologist and the Technologist are \\"enemy brothers\\", thinking they will come to an end‚Äîthe sociologist with the social and the technologist with objects.

Background The law is named for Ally Bain, a 14-year-old girl from Illinois who had a flare-up of her Crohn's disease while shopping at a large retail store and was subsequently denied use of the employee-only restroom, causing her to soil herself. Bain's mother vowed it would never happen to anyone else. The two met with Illinois State Representative Kathy Ryg, helped her draft a bill, and testified before a committee at the state capital. The bill was signed into law in August 2005, making Illinois the first U.S. state to do so. Where in force As of December 2018, at least 15 U.S. states had passed versions of the law.

Sample law The Restroom Access Act of Illinois states: :Sec. 10. Retail establishment; customer access to restroom facilities. A retail establishment that has a toilet facility for its employees shall allow a customer to use that facility during normal business hours if the toilet facility is reasonably safe and all of the following conditions are met: ::(1) The customer requesting the use of the employee toilet facility suffers from an eligible medical condition or utilizes an ostomy device. ::(2) Three or more employees of the retail establishment are working at the time the customer requests use of the employee toilet facility. ::(3) The retail establishment does not normally make a restroom available to the public. ::(4) The employee toilet facility is not located in an area where providing access would create an obvious health or safety risk to the customer or an obvious security risk to the retail establishment. ::(5) A public restroom is not immediately accessible to the customer.

Mutua was the Kenyan government spokesman before resigning in 2012 to run for the office of Machakos County Governor. Early life and education Mutua was born in Masii, then a part of Machakos District in Kenya's Eastern Province. He was educated at Dagoretti High School (O level) and at Jamhuri High School (A level). Civil servant=Government spokesperson and public communications secretary= Mutua was appointed the first official government spokesperson of Kenya in June 2004 by then President Mwai Kibaki. He served in that capacity until 3 September 2012. He was also the public communications secretary and head of the Office of Public Communications in the Office of the President. He also ran a Nairobi beautification program which included beautifying Uhuru Highway, repainting zebra crossings, installation of street CCTVs and setting up a building addressing system in Nairobi CBD. Political career Mutua became the first governor of Machakos County, which is one of the 47 counties established under the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 and was sworn in on 27 March 2013. He was elected on a Wiper Democratic Movement Party ticket alongside Mr. Bernard Kiala as his Deputy Governor. In August 2016, Mutua formerly launched a political party called Maendeleo Chap Chap Party. This was a culmination of several months of speculation among the Kenyan media and general public that Mutua had abandoned Wiper Democratic Movement ‚Äì the party that had sponsored him for his election as Machakos Governor in 2013. Mutua's action of launching and supporting a political party other than the one that sponsored him was considered controversial. He was expected to vacate office and seek a fresh mandate as Machakos County Governor; being sponsored by his new political party in line with Kenyan electoral laws. When Mutua did not vacate office to seek fresh re-election, Wiper Democratic Movement Party's disciplinary committee found him culpable of launching and supporting another political party. The disciplinary committee deemed him to have resigned from the party. In November 2016, a notice to impeach Mutua was filed in the Machakos County Assembly by a member Mr. Stephen Muthuka. This was after the motion notice was signed by 46 out of 59 Machakos county assembly members ‚Äì meeting the two thirds threshold for an impeachment motion to progress. Included among the reasons for the impeachment motion were alleged breach of the Kenyan constitution, procurement laws and devolution laws. Several days before Mutua's impeachment motion at the Machakos County Assembly, over half of the assembly's 59 members travelled out of the country in what was considered to be a tactical move for scuttling the impeachment process. In the absence of 32 members of the county assembly, the impeachment motion was debated with Mutua being represented by his lawyer. When the final vote was taken 26 out of 27 members of the assembly voted to impeach Mutua. This however was too few votes to legally impeach Mutua as Governor of Machakos County since the threshold of 40 members of the county assembly voting in favor of the motion was not attained. =2017 gubernatorial election= Mutua contested the Machakos County Governor position for a second term at the 2017 general election against Wavinya Ndeti and his former Deputy ‚Äì Bernard Kiala. Mutua was declared winner amid claims of election rigging. This resulted in a protracted election petition process that saw high court judge Aggrey Muchelule initially annul Mutua's election. In June 2018, The court of appeal bench comprising judges W. Ouko, M. Warsame, and S. Gatembu Kairu nullified the election of Alfred Mutua. Subsequently, Alfred Mutua contested the ruling of the Court of Appeal at the Supreme court. This legal contest was considered an epic battle at the Kenyan apex court. The Supreme Court of Kenya would later on December 21, 2018, overturn the Court of Appeal ruling to reinstate Mutua's gubernatorial election win. =Stewardship of public funds= Though Mutua's stewardship of public funds as Governor for Machakos County saw the Auditor General raise numerous queries on the propriety of public expenditure throughout his first term, it turned out that his strategy of fiscal management was one of the best in the government. For example, in 2014, he chose to purchase second hand vans and retrofitted them into ambulances which enabled him to have 120 ambulances at the cost of a few new ones. This got him into trouble with the Auditor General, but was a big win for Machakos residents who got at least one ambulance in every location. In 2015, 2019 and 2020, Mutua was ranked the worst performing governor in Kenya. In 2015, a survey carried out to measure the successes of county government in satisfying their constituents also ranked Mutua's Machakos the best.

Upon moving to Mechanicsburg in 1853, he worked as a journeyman for three years before beginning his own carriage manufacturing business in 1856 with Cyrus Barr.

The Hof van Holland, Zeeland en West-Friesland (;In isolation, van is pronounced . usually shortened to Hof van Holland in the literature, and translated in English literature as \\"(High) Court of Holland\\") was the High Court of the provinces of Holland (including West Friesland) and Zeeland, instituted as a separate entity of the government of the Counties of Holland and Zeeland in 1428, under the Burgundian and Habsburg Netherlands, and continued with little change under the Dutch Republic, Batavian Republic, and the Kingdom of Holland, until its dissolution in 1811 by the First French Empire. It should not be confused with the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland which was the supreme court, founded in 1582 by the States-General of the Netherlands and intended for the entire Dutch Republic. The Hof was in practice the main Appellate court in Holland and Zeeland, and in number of cases-handled the most important in the entire Dutch Republic (in comparison to the sister- provincial courts like the Hof van Friesland) and its Precedents played an important role in the development of Roman-Dutch law, which is still influential in Southern Africa. History The Hof was constituted by Duke Philip the Good, in his capacity of new Count of Holland and Zeeland on 3 July 1428 (on the basis of the Treaty of Delft) as his \\"High Council\\" to govern the counties, together with his Stadtholder. At first the Council combined executive and judicial functions. In the period around 1445 the judicial tasks were more and more concentrated in a separate \\"chamber\\" of nine councillors, which became known as the Hof. This was first formalised by the Instructie (Instruction) of 1462, given by Philip's son Charles of Charolais, that formally governed the jurisdiction, competence and composition of the court. Such Instructions were again drawn up in 1480, 1522 and 1531 (to name the most important dates). The 1531 Instruction remained more or less in force (with small amendments) until the court's dissolution in 1811, despite the fact that after the Act of Abjuration of 1581 (when Philip II of Spain was formally deposed as Count Philip III of Holland and Zeeland) the sovereignty of the count was taken over by the States of the two counties (now sovereign provinces in a confederacy). The Habsburg Netherlands had since the 1470s always had the Great Council of Mechelen as their Supreme Court. This was replaced in 1582 by the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland as the Supreme Court of the Dutch Republic, but in practice only the States of Holland and of Zeeland recognized this highest Appellate Court. This meant that the Hof and the Hoge Raad in practice competed with one another as appellate courts (though formally decisions of the Hof could be appealed to the Hoge Raad) due to a vague delineation of the jurisdictions and competences of the two courts. When in 1795 the Batavian Republic overthrew the old Republic the Hoge Raad was dissolved, but the Hof remained in place, be it that its name was changed in 1798 to Hof van Justitie van Holland en Zeeland (Court of Justice of Holland and Zeeland). With the new constitution of 1801 the province of Zeeland got its own Hof van Justitie (Court of Justice), which was split off from the Holland one in 1803. When the Kingdom of Holland (which had succeeded the Batavian Republic in 1806) was annexed to the French Empire in 1810 all such provincial Courts of Justice were abolished as of January 1, 1811. But the Hof was only dissolved on 1 March 1811 with the inauguration of the new Imperial Court for the Departements that took the place of the province of Holland. Jurisdiction and Competence=Original Jurisdiction= In the Instructions that were drawn up since 1462 the jurisdiction of the court as a tribunal of first instance was defined according to people who fell under its jurisdiction (ratione personae) and subject matters (ratione materiae) under its jurisdiction. In the category of people fell privileged persons like noblemen, Church officials and government officials, and \\"defenseless\\" people like women, clergymen, and widows and orphans, who deserved the special protection of the Count. Furthermore, foreigners without a fixed abode in Holland fell into this category. As to subject matter for the original jurisdiction of the court: all matters of concern to the Count, like his feudal Fees and domains, his rights (like Mint and High justice), and offices in his gift (read for \\"Count\\" after 1572 the States of Holland and Zeeland, who had already de facto taken over his sovereignty). Furthermore, important land-use cases, and conflicts between local governments fell under its jurisdiction, as did legal actions in connection with Possession (as opposed to Property actions). The last category was transferred to the original jurisdiction of the Hoge Raad after 1582, as was the original jurisdiction over cases of maritime law, and the grant of middelen van herstel en gunst (certain legal actions like e.g. the Cession of property by a debtor to his creditor). Unfortunately, when the Hoge Raad received its Instruction from the States-General in 1582 the Instruction of the Hof was not changed at the same time to reflect the transfer of competences in these respects. The Hof therefore continued hearing cases that formally belonged to the Hoge Raad which caused some competition between the two courts. Only in 1660 did the States of Holland resolve that in possession cases each court had to inform the other of such cases to make some coordination possible. Procedure in first instance The procedure in most cases was the so-called rolprocedure (after the rol (roll of paper or parchment) on which the particulars of the cases were entered during the rolzitting (audience), which took place weekly on Monday before two councillors, taking turns, in the Rolzaal of the Binnenhof at The Hague where the Hof sat since 1511). A case was initiated by a petition for a mandement van dagvaarding (writ of civil summons) by an impetrant (plaintiff). This was executed by a deurwaarder (bailiff) to summon the gedaagde (defendant) to appear on a specific date at the audience, where the sollicitor of the plaintiff handed over a conclusie van eis ( comparable to a complaint) as the first pleading. These were followed by further written pleadings: conclusie van antwoord (counter-plea), conclusie van repliek (reply), and conclusie van dupliek (rejoinder) on successive audiences. These four pleadings could be augmented by other documents of all kinds after special petitions (rekest civiel) from the parties had obtained leave to do this. At a certain point there were no more documents to exchange and parties would enter a final pleidooi (closing argument) and ask for justice in a conclusie in rechte. If the parties contradicted each other on the facts the court could order an enqueste (evidentiary hearing) before a commissaris (one of the councillors appointed as commissioner). In such a hearing the parties and witnesses would be interrogated under oath. Finally, the case would be summed up in the rapport by another councillor, the rapporteur, for the full court to deliberate. The court decided by majority vote. Minority opinions were not published. In case the vote was a draw the complaint was rejected. The final verdict (dictum) was read at an audience (not before all fees were paid) and the written verdict with the opinion on which it was based were handed to the triumfant party. Besides the rolprocedure the Hof also used a number of special procedures, like the summary procedure (conducted before commissioners) and the communicatoire procedure (which was completely conducted in writing). =Criminal Jurisdiction= Though most criminal cases were handled by lower courts that had the privilege of high or low justice, the Hof had original jurisdiction over cases that fell into the Count's own high justice, like offenses against the state (treason, sedition, insurrection) under the Roman-law doctrine of laesa maiestas (Heresy, though originally an offense under canon law, tried by the Inquisition, was brought under this doctrine by count Philip III, so the Hof also was competent in such cases). Furthermore, the Hof would try capital cases of felonies, like murder, manslaughter, rape and piracy (though the latter would become a matter for admiralty courts after admiralty boards were formed in the 1590s), and offenses against the count's rights like poaching on his domains and counterfeiting. All such cases were handled in extra-ordinaris procedure (i.e. unlike the ordinaris procedure, followed in civil cases described above). This procedure was derived from Roman law. This implied that the procedure (mostly of the cognitio-extra-ordinem variety) had a more inquisitorial than adversarial character. The defendant had no right to representation and formal defense. Because Roman law required either the testimony of two witnesses or a confession of the suspect to obtain a conviction, torture was allowed if the magistrate was convinced of the guilt of the suspect, who refused to confess.A famous example is the case of Cornelis de Witt who in 1672 was put to the Rack on the orders of the Hof after being charged with treason by one witness. See e.g. Of a verdict in an extra-ordinaris procedure formally no appeal was possible, though in practice officers of the court could appeal if they thought the verdict unsafe. But the Hof also was competent in lesser cases like misdemeanors which could result in fines. Such cases were usually handled like civil (ordinaris) cases. In such criminal cases appeal was possible. =Appeal= In cases where the Hof did not have original jurisdiction (i.e. in the vast majority of cases), people had to apply for justice to all kinds of local jurisdictions like e.g. city schepenbanken or vierscharen, baljuw (a county official) courts, and Heerlijkheid courts (courts of feudal lords with the privilege of high or low justice). Indeed, first jurisdiction by a local court was felt as an important privilege: the Jus de non evocando. Originally, no appeal was possible from verdicts of such courts, even in ordinaris procedures. But this soon caused resistance from losing parties, especially in cases of severe misconduct of the court. The resistance took the form of protests to county officials, called valsschelden van vonnissen, or faussement de jugement (appeal to falsity of the verdict), on the ground that the judges had been corrupt, the law had been misinterpreted, or there had been mistakes in the procedure. Such appeals were formally lodged by county officials (in the interest of the law) and could result in a quashing of the verdict and a fine for the offending judge. Another important precursor of appeal was the procedure known as te hoofde gaan (literally: \\"go to the head\\") by lower courts. This was a request by the lower court itself for a preliminary ruling by a higher court in a matter in which the lower court was unsure of the correct interpretation of the law. In this case the higher court need not be the Hof, but could be a hierarchically higher court, like a baljuw court. Such precursors evolved into a formal privilege of appeal to higher courts from verdicts of lower courts and eventually to the Hof and the Great Council (before 1582) and the Hoge Raad (after 1582) with a special procedure. The development was different in Zeeland where people at first had a provincial appellate court in the form of the Hoge Vierschaar. As this court could only be convened by the Count himself, or his eldest son, and had to be presided over by the Count himself, this court only sat infrequently. The people from Zeeland in practice therefore had the ineluctable choice of appealing to the \\"Holland\\" Hof, or going directly to the \\"Great Council\\" (appeal omisso medio). The appeals procedure offered three remedies: appel, reformatie and reductie (the latter was reformatie of an arbitration award). Appel (comparable to interlocutory appeal) was an immediate review, even before the final verdict, from any kind of decree of a lower court. Such an appel had to be lodged within a short period after the decree was taken (usually forty days) and suspended the decree. Reformatie reviewed a case in which a final verdict by a lower court had been pronounced. It did not suspend that verdict (except in cases where the execution would do irreparable harm) and had to be lodged within a year of the final verdict in question. In a number of cases an appeal bypassing the Hof directly to the \\"Great Council\\" or Hoge Raad (i.e. an appeal omisso medio) was expressly prohibited. Appeals procedure To start an appeals procedure the appellant had to petition the Hof for a mandement van appel (writ of appeal, comparable to a writ of Certiorari) and to give a bond (in case the appel would be rejected and a boete van fol appel or \\"fine for false appeal\\" had to be paid). In case of reformatie no bond need be given. The procedure was in large respect the same as the rolprocedure in first instance, except for the following differences: firstly, not only the other party was summoned, but also the judges who had made the decree or verdict of which appeal (the reason for this was that the judges could be asked to explain their reasoning). The latter were called geintihimeerden, but this term was often also (incorrectly) used for the opposing party. Secondly, in most cases the appeals procedure before the Hof was based on the documents produced in the case before the lower court. Parties could, however, request to include new material. Only in case there had been an evidentiary hearing in the lower case the Hof also conducted a completely new trial. =Extrajudicial procedures and voluntary adjudication= Not all procedures before the Hof had an adversarial character. The Hof could act as arbiter in cases of voluntary arbitration at the request of parties. Also, in a number of cases there was just one party, without an adversary, who needed a particular judicial or executive action performed. Examples of the latter were the conveyancing of titles of real estate, both voluntary (in case of sale) and involuntary (in case of foreclosure). The Hof acted then as Notary. Another example was the remissiebrief of people who had received a pardon in criminal cases. This remissiebrief was the certificate stating the pardon and this had to be endorsed (interineerd) by the Hof (after a procedure in which the validity of the pardon was tested, and the victims in the crime were asked if they had been adequately indemnified by the pardoned criminal). Composition The Hof was constituted on 3 July 1428 with 9 raadsheren (councillors, justices). In this number was the governor (since 1448 the stadtholder) included. Usually the stadtholder presided over the Hof, except in the periods 1445‚Äì1448, 1474‚Äì1477, and 1510‚Äì1572, when a president-raadsheer presided. After 1572 (when the members of the Hof briefly fled to Utrecht, because of the start of the Dutch Revolt), the Prince of Orange as rebel-stadtholder formally took over the chairmanship. After 1578 the stadtholder was no longer a member of the Hof and the Hof was again presided over by a president-raadsheer. After 1578 the total number of members of the court was 12: three for Zeeland (for the cities of Middelburg, Veere and Vlissingen) and eight (plus the president) for Holland (of which two for the ridderschap).

The longer title under which it was originally published is Mere nature delineated: or, A body without a soul. Being observations upon the young forester lately brought to town from Germany. With suitable applications. Also, a brief dissertation upon the usefulness and necessity of fools, whether political or natural. The title and primary subject of the work is Peter the Wild Boy, a feral child who was brought to the court of George I in Great Britain in 1726. His uncivilized behaviour aroused considerable public interest, and Defoe was one of many writers who contributed to the debate about what the boy's condition meant for how the human subject should be considered. The pamphlet also broaches out to discuss the subject of 'fools' across Europe. Background The title and primary subject of the work is Peter the Wild Boy, a mentally handicapped child who was found in 1725 living feral in woods near Hamelin, in the Electorate of Hanover. In spring of the following year he was brought to the court of George I in Great Britain. His uncivilized behaviour and inability to speak a language aroused considerable public interest and he was for a brief time a minor celebrity. Defoe was one of many thinkers and writers who responded to the episode, describing Peter as being \\"in a state of Mere Nature ‚Ä¶ a ship without a Rudder\\". As is the case with some of his other works from this period, Defoe's authorship of the pamphlet has been questioned; however, it is now generally considered to have been written by him.Rogers 2012, p. 209. Contents The pamphlet is composed of five parts and a conclusion: Part I of the pamphlet discusses the origins of the boy. Defoe believes his recent history‚Äîhis discovery in Hamelin in the Electorate of Hanover‚Äîto be true, but raises doubts that it will ever be known how he came to be without speech or education.Defoe 1726, pp. 16‚Äì17. He then critiques the evidence‚Äî\\"That he can Think\\" and \\"That he can Laugh\\"‚Äî offered more widely for his having a Soul.Defoe 1726, pp. 16‚Äì17. Part II explores his current state of behaviour and the implications for how society can consider the human subject. Part III continues and expands on these considerations. Part IV, entitled \\"Of the Usefulness and Necessity of Fools in the present Age, and especially at the Courts of some Princes,\\" departs from the subject of Peter to consider fools in Europe. Such discussion is continued in Part V, entitled \\"Further Conclusions upon the extraordinary Agency of Fools lately seen in some Courts of Europe, and the usual Fate of the Instruments themselves.\\" The Conclusion returns to the subject of Peter and rebukes the suggestion that this is a \\"Jest upon the Youth\\".Defoe 1726, p. 116.

It is managed by Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. History The hospital has its origins in the accommodation provided for the treatment of infectious diseases for the Wirral Poor Law Union Workhouse in 1888. A purpose built infirmary block was erected in 1899. In 1930, with the end of the workhouse system, the site became the responsibility of Cheshire County Council who renamed the facility Clatterbridge General Hospital. With an increased catchment area expansion of the infirmary was ordered, including a new surgical block and an extension to the existing maternity block. After it joined the National Health Service in 1948, it became simply Clatterbridge Hospital. A Regional Radiotherapy Centre, now known as the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre, was established on the site and opened by Lord Cohen in 1958. Following the opening of Arrowe Park Hospital in 1982, many of the overlapping services closed at Clatterbridge in favour of the newer site, including accident and emergency and maternity. In 1992 the local health authorities were abolished and management of Clatterbridge Hospital passed to the newly founded Wirral Hospitals NHS Trust. Although the last of the old workhouse buildings were demolished in 1997, clinical services continue to be provided at the hospital.

The Letzi M√ºlenen is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. Name Letzi comes from Middle High German and means a hindrance, obstacle, bulwark or frontier fortifications. The Letzi M√ºlenen was built at M√ºlenen to protect and control access to the alpine pass into the Canton of Valais. History View of the Letzi M√ºlenen wall after it was excavated. M√ºlenen Castle was the second castle of the Freiherr von Kien in Reichenbach. It was first mentioned in 1269 as Mulinon. The first Letzi or wall was built in the 12th century on the northern end of the valley. A second wall was built over the first in the 13th century. In 1331 Konrad Justinger called it stetli M√ºlenen which implies that a settlement had grown up around the castle and wall. However, there are no other documents that mention the settlement. By 1290 the castle and settlement were acquired by the Freiherr von W√§denswil. It was inherited by the Lords of Turn, who were the heirs to the W√§denswil family. The W√§denswil and Turn families joined a coalition of nobles that attempted to fight against the growing power of the city of Bern. In 1294, they fought against a Bernese army at the Letzi. However, this and later attempts to fight Bern left the nobles deep in debt. They had to pawn the castle and fortifications. After passing through several owners, in 1352 Bern bought the castle and the rest of the Herrschaft of M√ºlenen. A Bernese castellan was appointed who managed the military and the high and low courts. However, by about 1400, the castellan moved to Frutigen and abandoned M√ºlenen. The castle and wall were demolished and used as a source of construction materials. Castle site The Letzi was rediscovered in 1990 during construction of a ring road around the village of M√ºlenen. It was excavated in 1990 to 1996 and conserved. The first wall was probably wooden. The second, from the 13th century, was stone. The stone wall was about wide and probably between tall, but only of the wall remains. The castle was located in the center of the wall and was built in four stages. It consisted of a rectangular tower surrounded by an unwalled square courtyard which was about on each side.

Cyrtostachys rendas name is derived from several words: the Greek prefix Œ∫œÖœÅœÑœå- (cyrto-) meaning bent or curved, the Greek word œÉœÑŒ±œáœÖœÇ (stachys) meaning \\"an ear of grain\\",Umberto Quattrocchi. 2000.

(set). and \\"renda\\" a Malayan Aboriginal word for palm, which happens to be homonymous to the Portuguese word \\"renda,\\" meaning income. Because of its bright red crownshafts and leaf sheaths, Cyrtostachys renda has become a popular ornamental plant exported to many tropical regions around the world. Although it is not the source of sealing wax, the red sealing wax palm got its name because its crownshafts and leaf sheaths have the same color as the wax used to seal letters close and later (from about the 16th century) envelopes.  Description  Also known as the red palm, rajah palm, and , Cyrtostachys renda is a slender multi-stemmed, slow-growing, clustering palm tree. It can grow to tall. It has a scarlet to bright red colored crownshaft and leaf sheath, making it distinct from all other species of Arecaceae. The plant's stipe grows up to in diameter. Its petioles grow up to long and have pinnate leaves have about 50 pairs of pinnae. The plant's fruits are ovoid, in diameter, green, turning to a dark bluish-black when ripe. Cyrtostachys renda displaying inflorescence = Heterotypic synonyms = The use of Crytostachys lakka (and Cyrtostachys lacca) as a synonym for Cyrtostachys renda was developed by Italian botanist Odoardo Beccari. The Italian word \\"lacca\\" means lacquer or varnish.The italian word \\"lacca\\" happens to be homonymous with the Finnish word \\"lakka\\" meaning varnish, cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) and the eponymous liqueur, Lakkalik√∂√∂ri, made from that fruit. The Finnish word has caused confusion among botanists regarding this synonym for Cyrtostachys renda because neither the cloudberry nor the liqueur bear any semblance to the Lipstick Palm (see Cyrtostachys renda Blume by Donald Simpson and page 8 of \\"Autecology and Conservation Management of a Rare Palm Species: The Case Study of Lipstick Palm Cyrtostachys renda Blume in Kerumutan Wildlife Sanctuary, Riau\\" by Didik Widyatmoko). *Pinanga rubricaulis Linden (1885)Linden, Cat.

Cultivation and uses  Ornamental Cyrtostachys renda in a garden in Suva, Fiji The lipstick palm is generally grown for its brightly colored and unusual foliage and it is considered as a plant in high demand for gardening and a landscaping projects. Because of difficulties propagating them and their striking color, the palm has been offered for sale at prices as high as $1000 USD to collectors and gardeners. It also has some limited traditional uses such as for flooring materials, roof thatching, and for making darts in Pahang and elsewhere in Malaysia. Some rural communities in Sumatra harvest the plant for palm hearts. Propagation can occur with fresh seeds, although they are slow to germinate, or through dividing out suckers. In the wild, the most suitable environment for growth occurs in areas of Southeast Asian lowland peat swamp forests with the following characteristics: good soil drainage, high sand content in the soil, a thin peat layer in the soil, a low carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) in the soil, low acid, and nutrient levels in the soil and water but relatively high organic substance levels. The palm grows well in full sun or shade but needs humid conditions and well-draining soil. However, it also tolerates flooding and can grow in standing water as its native habitat is peat swamp forests. It will not tolerate cold temperatures or periods of drought.

It was announced during the PlayStation 4 press conference on 20 February 2013, and, after several delays, was released worldwide in October 2014. Driveclub is a racing game in which players compete in racing events around the world in a variety of different fashions. Players can compete in clubs with other players, earning a reputation as one of the best clubs, and leveling up to unlock better items. Another game mode is tour, essentially a campaign mode. Players can compete in standard races, as well as time trials, by drifting events, and championship tournaments, which may take place in Norway, Canada, Scotland, India, Japan, and Chile. Players may customize their car, their club, or their driver, and may complete optional challenges during events. A weather system and day-night cycle is also included as downloadable content. Driveclub was released to a fairly mixed critical reception. Critics praised the photorealistic visuals, sound design, and the controls, but criticized the online playability, the inconsistent AI and a lack of gameplay variety. As of July 2015, the game has reached 2 million copies sold, becoming one of the best-selling PlayStation 4 video games. The online servers for Driveclub were shutdown on 31 March 2020.  Gameplay  Driveclub is a racing game in which players compete in races around the world in several different game modes. A major focus of the game is the club aspect. Players may join a club or create their own and will compete against other clubs to ultimately see whose club is the best. Clubs consist of up to six players. Players complete challenges together representing their club and earn fame and XP. The player earns fame by driving well and completing challenges. Fame determines the player's level as well as the club level. As the player levels up, they automatically unlock items, such as new vehicles, accolades, or colour schemes. Every team member's action contributes to the club's overall success. The game's tracks and environments are inspired by actual places in diverse regions throughout the globe, such as Norway and India. Driveclub features dynamic weather system such as rain and snowfall and a day-night cycle. Each rain drop has realistic behaviour.Linneman, John. (11 December 2014). \\"DriveClub revisited: is dynamic weather a game-changer?\\". Eurogamer. Retrieved 10 September 2015. There are three main game modes in Driveclub; tour, single event and multiplayer. Tour is a campaign mode where single-player events set in various locations can be played using the allocated cars. A set of objectives are present and can be tackled during the events. In the single event game mode, players choose what event they would like to play (drift, sprint, race or time trial) and have the freedom to select the location, weather and other options. The multiplayer game mode revolves around competition and co-operation with real life players. Players can complete challenges with social leaderboards, play with clubs, and play online races. There are a total of 50 cars available initially, as well as over 60 more cars that can be downloaded from the PlayStation Store for free or with a charge. The cars are split into five categories based on their in- game stats: hot hatch, sports, performance, super and hyper. Each car can be customized with paintjobs and stickers.Kato, Matthew (22 May 2014). \\"DriveClub: 12 New Things We Found Out About DriveClub\\". Game Informer. Retrieved 10 February 2016. Development Promotion at Gamescom 2014 On 18 October 2013, Sony Computer Entertainment announced that Driveclub would be delayed until early 2014. In a statement posted on the PlayStation Blog, the company wrote that, \\"SCE Worldwide Studios and the team at Evolution Studios have made the difficult decision to delay the release of Driveclub and Driveclub PlayStation Plus Edition until early 2014.\\" Sony Worldwide Studios boss Shuhei Yoshida stated: \\"Driveclub will be a truly innovative, socially connected racing game, but the team requires more time in order to deliver on their vision ‚Äì and I'm fully confident the game will surpass your expectations.\\" On 10 March 2014, PlayStation Software Product Development Head Scott Rohde mentioned that the title has met further delays with the following statement: \\"What I will say is that it all comes back to that fundamental principle, and that‚Äôs that we want to build great games, and we really don't want to release a game before it's ready.\\" Rohde or any other Sony representative could not at the time give a more specific release date but hinted that it might take a while referring to that the game has \\"gone back to the drawing board\\". Although Evolution Studios did experiment with Sony's Project Morpheus, the final game does not support virtual reality. In April 2014, game director Paul Rustchynsky stated that the delay was caused by the game's \\"dynamic menu\\". This menu allows players to quickly navigate from menu to menu, join clubs, race, and perform many other activities within the game. In early September 2014, Evolution Studios announced a downloadable content (DLC) Season Pass. The pass introduces 11 new courses, 23 new events, and a new car every month until June 2015 (later extended to July 2015). The DLC is both paid, and free. Cars in the game contain an average of 260,000 polygons. Before release, Evolution Studios had confirmed that Driveclub runs at resolution of 1080p and would be capped at 30 frames per second. =Post- release updates= Driveclub launched in North America on 7 October 2014, Europe on 8 October 2014, and the United Kingdom on 10 October 2014. However, the game suffered from severe online issues at launch. Evolution Studios had released the first premium DLC packs (Ignition Expansion Pack and Photo-Finish Tour Pack) for free to affected players in November. PlayStation UK executive Fergal Gara apologized for the marred launch of the game. On 8 December 2014, Sony released a weather patch which added dynamic weather to the game. The feature was delayed up to two months after launch to include all improvements to the weather that the developers wanted. In January 2015, Evolution Studios released a new patch that brought several new features to the game, with the most significant one being the introduction of Japan. A total of five tracks were added, including Lake Shoji and Nakasendo. On 1 April 2015, as a tribute to the MotorStorm racing game series, Evolution Studios released a free special DLC pack containing the Wombat Typhoon from the very game series. On 22 March 2016, Evolution released their final DLC pack for the game, \\"Finish Line\\", which includes events named \\"Clocking Off\\" and \\"The Long Goodbye\\". On the same day, Sony announced that Evolution would be shut down. Subsequent updates for the game would be created by other Sony studios. These updates were the game's first city circuit, Old Town in Scotland (along with six route variations), and Hardcore handling physics, available via Patch 1.26 on 11 February 2016, and five more city circuits (one in each country of location), all of which first appeared in Driveclub VR, added to the game via Patch 1.28 on 31 October 2016. Sony Interactive Entertainment announced that online services for Driveclub would be terminated on 31 March 2020, meaning that players can no longer access the online features from that date onwards. The game, along with its DLC packs and standalone expansions, was removed from the PlayStation Store on 29 August 2019. =PlayStation Plus Edition= Driveclub: PlayStation Plus Edition was a version of the game that was available for free to PlayStation Plus subscribers. It came with all the game modes and online capabilities of the paid version, but had a limited number of cars and locations available to the player. The PlayStation Plus Edition was originally set to be released on the same date as the full version of Driveclub, but was delayed to ease the load and traffic to the servers. On 31 October 2014, Sony announced that the PlayStation Plus Edition would be postponed until further notice. The Edition was released on 25 June 2015, but has since been removed as of 6 October 2015. =Driveclub Bikes= Driveclub Bikes is a standalone expansion for Driveclub and was released on 27 October 2015. The expansion focuses on \\"superbike racing\\", and features a new Tour, a new gameplay mode, new challenges and new events. Similar to the main game, the motorbike and the rider can be customized, and the player's result in each race changes the reputation of their club. The expansion initially contains 12 bikes, including the KTM 1190 RC8R, and Superbike World Championship winning bikes such as the Yamaha YZF-R1 and the Honda CBR1000RR. There are also 8 bikes available through free update or paid DLC packs. = Driveclub VR = Driveclub VR is a new virtual reality version of the original PS4 exclusive game, Driveclub. However, this edition is only compatible with the PlayStation 4's Virtual Reality headset, PlayStation VR. It contains almost all the assets from the full game, with a total of 80 cars and 84 tracks, reworked for VR, with full 360 view of the interior and all views, while introducing five new city circuits. It was released on 13 October 2016 as one of launch titles of PlayStation VR for Japan. This game is essentially a standalone expansion, with its own separate save file and stats, but does not feature online leaderboards. Soundtrack The official soundtrack for the game was composed and produced by Hybrid. The soundtrack was released on iTunes on 7 October 2014, and also includes remixes by Elite Force, The Qemists, Noisia, DJ Shadow, Black Sun Empire and Fred V & Grafix. The in-game music is turned off by default. This is done to place emphasis on the sound design of the cars.Whittaker, Matt (7 October 2014). \\"Review: Driveclub\\". Hardcore Gamer. Retrieved 10 February 2016.  Reception = Critical response = Driveclub received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The game gained a final overall score of 71 on the website. Justin Towell from GamesRadar gave the game an 8/10, praising its challenge system, accessible handling and beginner-friendly gameplay, saying \\"it's a big deal for a modern racing game to have enough faith in its core handling to eschew driving assists.\\" He criticized the weak damage and characterized crashes as unsatisfying. He also discouraged playing unconnected, adding \\"Never have I seen such a dull, lifeless and formulaic single-player mode transformed so spectacularly by online connectivity.\\" Dale North from Destructoid gave the game a 7.5/10, praising its responsive, satisfying control and impressive sounds, as well as highly detailed environments, while criticizing the lack of replay value, overly aggressive AI drivers in single-player, and visual bugs in the in-car views. He summarized the game as having \\"enough to offer over other new and upcoming racing alternatives out there.\\" Ludwig Kietzmann of Joystiq also praised the environments and sound design. However, he also criticized the repeated attacks by AI cars, opining that they ruin the single-player experience, and the lack of difficulty options. Luke Reilly of IGN gave the game a 7.9/10, describing it as \\"the best-looking racing game ever seen on a console\\", but also criticized the AI drivers, and the difficult drifting when compared to the accessible handling. He summarized the game as \\"a modest, conventional arcade racer rather than the sprawling, open-world types we commonly see today\\". John Robertson from Computer and Video Games gave the game an 8/10, also praising its graphics and the Clubs system, but criticizing the lack of variety in race types and challenges, as well as the arcade handling, stating it \\"sits at odds with the purity of available events\\". GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd gave the game a 5/10. While praising the graphics, in particular the cars and tracks on offer, he criticized the soundtrack and the overall presentation of the game. calling the environments and surroundings \\"as lifeless as postcards\\". Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann gave the game a 2/5, praising its leaderboards, lighting and graphics, but criticizing the confusing menu, overly mechanical AI drivers, weirdly grippy car handling and lack of fun element. He characterised the game as \\"a weird throwback to the old, dark days of console driving games\\". Post launch, Evolution Studios continued to support their game with 18 months of free content updates and an extensive DLC Season Pass and as a result GamesRadar re-reviewed the game, revising their score to 4.5/5. After the sudden closure of developer Evolution Studios on 22 March 2016, GamesRadar also published an article arguing that the studio was failed by 'public perception' after Driveclub's rocky launch, and lauded the game's current state, calling its post-release content updates \\"arguably the finest collection of post-release content gaming has ever seen,\\" in particular praising the game's photo mode, and new wet weather and heat haze effects. Following the game's final update on 31 October 2016, which added 15 new tracks and reversed variants from Driveclub VR, Eurogamer and VideoGamer.com published retrospectives on the game, hailing its quality improvements post- release. Eurogamer called it \\"the PS4 launch disaster that became a racing great\\" whilst VideoGamer called it \\"an exhilarating, gorgeous, feature rich, and addictive racer that will likely be looked back on as one of this generation's finest games\\". = Sales = Despite mixed reviews, Driveclub has sold over 2 million copies as of 31 July 2015.

Nodira is generally regarded as one of the most outstanding Uzbek poets. She wrote poetry in Uzbek, Persian, and Tajik. Nodira also used other pennames, such as Komila and Maknuna. Many of her diwans have survived and consist of more than 10,000 lines of poetry.  Biography  Nodira was the wife of Muhammad Umar Khan who ruled the Khanate of Kokand from c. 1810 until his death in 1822. Following her husband's death, Nodira became the de facto ruler of Kokand due to her son Muhammad Ali Khan being only a teenager when he was crowned Khan; she continued to serve as a regent and advisor to him throughout his reign. Despite her attempts to instill somewhat more socially liberal values into her son, Madali grew to employ expansionist policies that lead to a war with the rival Emirate of Bukhara. Her poetry and beauty were frowned upon by the ulama as \\"inappropriate\\", with her writing often bringing up taboo topics and bemoaning the suffering of women in Central Asia under Islam. She was hanged on the personal order of Emir Nasrullah Khan of Bukhara in April 1842 along with her sons during the Kokand-Bukhara wars. Nasrullah was reportedly furious that she refused to marry him and despised the fact that she led a very public life despite being a Muslim woman.  Legacy  Long after her unnatural death in 1842 Nodira was promoted in the Soviet era as a national heroine of the Uzbek SSR and enjoyed a similar status of other murdered women such as Nurkhon Yuldasheva. She remains viewed in the public eye as a martyr and national heroine, and 200 years after her birth, the first national postage stamp of newly independent Uzbekistan featured her portrait.

Harvard Art Museums/Fogg Museum, MA. Woman Bathing (or Woman at Her Toilet, sometimes Bathsheba at Her Toilet) is a lost panel painting by the Early Netherlandish artist Jan van Eyck. The work is today known through two copies which diverge in important aspects;Seidel, 38 one in Antwerp and a more successful but small c 1500 panel in Harvard University's Fogg Museum, which is in poor condition.Schabacker; Jones, 56 It is unique in van Eyck's known oeuvre for portraying a nude in secular setting,Harbison, 89 although there is mention in two 17th-century literary sources of other now lost but equally erotic van Eyck panels.Schabacker; Jones, 59 The attribution of either panel to an original by van Eyck is usually not contested; while it may be doubted whether either copy was completed until one or two generations after his early death c. 1441, it is accepted that neither is a forgery or wishful thinking. Art historians broadly consider it likely that both were copied from a single source, that is, one is not a copy of the other, and that both originate from roughly the same period. Van Eyck's original was atypically daring and unusually erotic for a painting of the 1420s ‚Äì early 1430s when it was presumably completed. Apart from its own qualities, it is interesting to art historians due to the many similarities of the Harvard panel to his famous 1434 London Arnolfini Portrait. Until the emergence of the Fogg copy around 1969, it was known mostly through its appearance in Willem van Haecht's expansive 1628 painting The Gallery of Cornelis van der Geest, a view of a collector's gallery which contains many other identifiable old masters. Art historians have sought in vain to attach to either a biblical or classical source; the rapes of Bathsheba or Susanna have been suggested, although Judith is sometimes seen a more likely source, but the clues apply only to the Antwerp panel,Schabacker; Jones, 65 traditionally known as \\"Judith Beautifying Herself\\".

A convex mirror hangs from a central bar in the shuttered window above the basin, and shows the reflection of both figures.Bohn, Saslow, 35 In the tradition of such scenes, the mirror symbolises virtue and purity, while the dog in the lower center at the woman's feet ‚Äì barely visible in the Fogg panel due to loss of paint, but more distinguishable in van der Geest's work ‚Äì represents her fidelity.Schabacker; Jones, 66 Her bedchamber is richly detailed; there is a wooden bed to the right, a tall folding chair against the back wall, and wooden beams running across the ceiling. An orange rests on the windowsill and there are discarded pattens on the floor in the lower left corner.Ridderbos et al, 68 Two other possible works by van Eyck of this style are known from descriptions only. In 1456, the Italian humanist Bartolomeo Facio described a panel in the collection of Ottaviano della Carda, a nephew of Federico da Montefeltro. In the panel, sometimes known as Bathing Woman, the woman is attended by an older clothed maid as she emerges from her bath in a veil of fine linen which leaves only her head and breasts exposed. Facio's description includes details of a dog, a burning lamp similar to the one in the Arnolfini Portrait,Campbell, 200 and a distant landscape visible through an open window. Facio mentions the innovative use of a mirror, which in the work is full length and reflects the entire back of the woman's body. Arnolfini portrait  Arnolfini Portrait, 1434. National Gallery, London. There are many similarities, especially with the Fogg panel, to van Eyck's famous London Arnolfini Portrait. While the former is much narrower and much smaller at 27.2 cm x 16.3 cm, it is around a third the size of the London portrait (without frame 82.6 cm x 60 cm).Campbell, 174Schabacker; Jones, 60 van Haecht's reproduction is thought closer to the actual scale than the Fogg panel, especially given that the other works in The Gallery of Cornelis van der Geest are in general very close to the originals that survived or had their dimensions recorded. Given that van Haecht did not give the work an especially prominent position in his own painting, it is unlikely that he was exaggerating its importance, so it might be reasonably deduced that it was not much smaller than this representation. Both the Fogg and London panels show an interior containing a bed and a small dog (probably an early form of the breed now known as the Brussels griffon), a mirror and its reflection, a chest of drawers and clogs on the floor, while the angle the attendant woman faces from, and her dress and the outline of her figure, are broadly similar. Art historian Linda Seidel speculates that it was created as an accompanying panel, and that the pair were intended as betrothal paintings. The London panel, she observes, may have been \\"painted for the wall of Giovanna Cenami's father's house where she would have seen it in the years between her betrothal and her marriage ... perhaps ... the erotic half may have been given to her future husband as guarantee of what he was promised\\". Seidel believes that the pattens at the lower left hand corner of the panel, as well as the fact that the mirror is angled towards the viewer's point of view, reinforce the idea that a future husband was the intended audience. She notes the work's unusually steep perspective, and concludes that the \\"panel's controlling gaze align[ed] it with the mirror's reflection of the woman's naked body\\". Although variants of this view have been long maintained, they are complicated by the fact that the similarities apply to the Harvard panel only. Lorne Campbell of the National Gallery is not convinced by the functional connection. While he acknowledges the similarities between the works, he points out that the Arnolfini has not conclusively been established as a wedding portrait, and that even if this was the case, it is more likely that the London panel was originally covered by wings rather than by a single panel. He reinforces his view with the fact the lost work differs in two important aspects; that the bed curtains are not red and that the mirror is not decorated. Campbell rejects the similarities as \\"coincidental\\",Campbell, 201 although it might be better argued that the lost work was a prototype or study. Julius S. Held believed that the Fogg panel was created as a cover for the London painting, an idea that held traction until rejected by Campbell in 1988, when he argued that such a painting was more likely to be covered by wings than a single piece, and that further the London panel in probability does not depict or commemorate either a marriage or betrothal.Ridderbos et al, 412 References Willem van Haecht - The Gallery of Cornelis van der Geest.

Journal of Computational Biology 18(7): 867‚Äì878 (2011)  Unique capabilities  BioBIKE is an integrated symbolic biocomputing and bioinformatics platform, built from the start as an entirely (what is now called) cloud-based architecture where all computing is done in remote servers, and all user access is accomplished through web browsers. BioBIKE has a built-in frame system in which all objects, data, and knowledge are represented. This enables code written either in the native Lisp, in the visual programming language, or systems of rules expressed in the SNARK theorem prover to access the whole of biological knowledge in an integrated manner. For its time (released in 2002) it was unique in permitting users to create fully functional biocomputing programs that run on the back-end servers entirely through the web browser UI. (In modern terms it was one of the first PaaS (Platform as a Service) systems, predating even Salesforce in this capability.) Initially this programming was carried out in raw Lisp, but Jeff Elhai's team at VCU, with NSF funding, created an entirely graphical programming environment on top of BioBIKE based upon the Boxer-style programming environments.

Being a multi-headed, multi-threaded, multi-user, multi-tenancy cloud-based system, BioBIKE users were able to directly work together through their web browsers, remotely sharing the same listener and memory space. This permitted a unique sort of collaboration, discussed in Shrager (2007).J Shrager (2007) The Evolution of BioBike: Community Adaptation of a Biocomputing Platform.

History  BioBIKE was originally called \\"BioLingua\\", and was developed by Jeff Shrager at The Carnegie Inst. of Washington Dept. of Plant Biology, and JP Massar with funding from NASA's Astrobiology Division. Shrager and Massar wanted to create a web-based, multi-user Lisp Machine, specialized for bioinformatics. Other early contributors to the project included Mike Travers, and Jeff Elhai of VCU. Elhai obtained continuing funding from the National Science Foundation for the project, which was renamed BioBIKE. Elhai and colleagues added BioBIKE's unique visual programming language.

It is also known in the industry as the MOM factor (monthly momentum). Momentum in a stock is described as the tendency for the stock price to continue rising if it is going up and to continue declining if it is going down. The MOM can be calculated by subtracting the equal weighted average of the lowest performing firms from the equal weighed average of the highest performing firms, lagged one month (Carhart, 1997). A stock is showing momentum if its prior 12-month average of returns is positive. Similar to the three factor model, momentum factor is defined by self-financing portfolio of (long positive momentum)+(short negative momentum). Momentum strategies continue to be popular in financial markets such that financial analysts incorporate the 52-week price high/low in their Buy/Sell recommendations. The four factor model is commonly used as an active management and mutual fund evaluation model. Notes on risk adjustment Three commonly used methods to adjust a mutual fund‚Äôs returns for risk are: 1\\\\. The market model: :EXR_t=\\\\alpha^J+ \\\\beta_{mkt}\\\\mathit{EXMKT}_t+\\\\epsilon_t The intercept in this model is referred to as the ‚ÄúJensen‚Äôs alpha‚Äù 2\\\\. The Fama-French three-factor model: :EXR_t=\\\\alpha^{FF}+ \\\\beta_{mkt}\\\\mathit{EXMKT}_t+ \\\\beta_{HML}\\\\mathit{HML}_t+ \\\\beta_{SMB}\\\\mathit{SMB}_t+\\\\epsilon_t The intercept in this model is referred to as the ‚Äúthree-factor alpha‚Äù 3\\\\. The Carhart four-factor model: :EXR_t=\\\\alpha^c+ \\\\beta_{mkt}\\\\mathit{EXMKT}_t+ \\\\beta_{HML}\\\\mathit{HML}_t+ \\\\beta_{SMB}\\\\mathit{SMB}_t+ \\\\beta_{UMD}\\\\mathit{UMD}_t+\\\\epsilon_t The intercept in this model is referred to as the ‚Äúfour-factor alpha‚Äù Where EXRt is the monthly return to the asset of concern in excess of the monthly t-bill rate. We typically use these three models to adjust for risk. In each case, we regress the excess returns of the asset on an intercept (the alpha) and some factors on the right hand side of the equation that attempt to control for market-wide risk factors. The right hand side risk factors are: the monthly return of the CRSP value-weighted index less the risk free rate (EXMKT), monthly premium of the book-to-market factor (HML) the monthly premium of the size factor (SMB), and the monthly premium on winners minus losers (UMD) from Fama-French (1993) and Carhart (1997). A fund manager shows forecasting ability when his fund has a positive and statistically significant alpha. SMB is a zero-investment portfolio that is long on small capitalization (cap) stocks and short on big cap stocks. Similarly, HML is a zero-investment portfolio that is long on high book-to-market (B/M) stocks and short on low B/M stocks, and UMD is a zero-cost portfolio that is long previous 12-month return winners and short previous 12-month loser stocks.

He is a barrister and a solicitor in Toronto, Canada, and is also a Canadian citizen. Dr. Miguna served as a senior adviser to former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga from 2009 to 2011. Dr. Miguna Miguna speaks multiple languages including Dholuo, Kiswahili, Canadian French, American English, British English, Ekegusii, Kikamba, Sheng' and Kikuyu. Early life and career Miguna was born in Magina Village, Kisumu County. He attended Apondo Primary School in Magina Village-Nyando before proceeding to the prestigious Njiri School in Murang'a for his High School and then the University of Nairobi, where he became a student leader in 1986 and 1987. He was detained by the Moi regime and expelled from the university in 1987 for championing multi- party democracy in Kenya. Upon his release, he fled to the neighbouring Tanzania on foot where he was granted asylum by the UNHCR, staying there briefly before being granted asylum in the Kingdom of Swaziland. Subsequently, he was granted permanent political asylum in Canada in 1988, where he continued to pursue his higher education. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts in political science and philosophy from the University of Toronto in 1990 and thereafter studied law at Osgoode Hall Law School of York University in Toronto, obtaining a Juris Doctor degree in 1993. He was admitted to the Ontario Bar in 1995. He obtained a Masters of Laws (LLM) from the Osgoode Hall Law School of York University in 2001. Miguna served as the Coordinator for the Committee for Democracy in Kenya (CDK) from 1988 to 1994. He articled at the civil rights law firm of Charles Roach (Roach, Schwartz and Associates) in Toronto setting up his law practice where he stayed until 2007 when he returned to Kenya. He was admitted to the Kenyan Bar in 2008. Political career Upon his return to Kenya, he contested in the primaries of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM)'s nomination for Nyando Constituency, but lost to Frederick Outa Otieno. He was part of the ODM's campaign team during the 2007 general election. In March 2009, he was appointed as Prime Minister Raila Odinga's senior adviser on coalition affairs and concurrently served alongside Kivutha Kibwana as the Joint-secretary to the Permanent Committee on the Management of the Grand Coalition Affairs. In August 2011, he was accused of gross misconduct and was thereby suspended without pay. The suspension was lifted on 29 December 2011 but Miguna rejected his reinstatement. In 2010, some members from the Party of National Unity side of the coalition accused him of being a foreigner for holding a Canadian passport, as Kenyan law didn't recognise dual citizenship at the time he acquired Canadian citizenship, although the Kenyan constitution was changed in 2010 to allow for it. They wrote, \\"While Mr. Miguna Miguna was born in Kenya, he has since become a citizen of Canada. Like all other expatriates working in the country, our laws require that Mr Miguna apply for and obtain the relevant permits to live and work in Kenya.\\" Miguna responded that he was a Kenyan citizen by birth and that he had never renounced his citizenship. However, he did acquire Canadian citizenship at some point while in exile. Miguna justified his actions by saying at the time, \\"When fleeing a dictatorial regime, one uses any means and even Mr. Odinga once used a Tanzanian passport.\\" River Nyando On 14 July 2012, he launched his first memoir titled Peeling Back the Mask: A Quest for Justice in Kenya. The book was very critical of Raila Odinga and purported to expose him as a charlatan. It sparked protests from Odinga's supporters in Ahero who burned Miguna's effigy and mock coffin and thereafter sprinkled its ashes into River Nyando. He was attacked whilst promoting his book at a hotel in Mombasa and had to be rescued by the police. In September 2012, he terminated his life membership from ODM and announced his candidacy for Governor of Nairobi County in the 2013 gubernatorial election as an independent candidate. He later on cancelled his candidacy. He launched a sequel to his memoir in February 2013 titled Kidneys for the King: Deforming the Status Quo in Kenya. Odinga, on his part, has declined to answer to the claims made in Miguna's books and did not sue Miguna for defamation, although since Odinga has been widely viewed in Kenya as a leading proponent of political reforms, his image could be badly sullied if the claims made in Miguna's book were accepted as true. In an act of rejection of his former political boss, Miguna endorsed Uhuru Kenyatta, Odinga's rival, in the 2013 presidential election. Kenyatta went on to win the poll, albeit amid accusations made by Odinga that the election was marred by poll fraud. In March 2016, Miguna declared that he would be vying for the position of Governor for Nairobi as an independent candidate. He unveiled a manifesto in August 2016. The manifesto promised visionary leadership based on integrity, clear and progressive transformative policies, programs and a commitment for service delivery, job creation and infrastructure development. Although he came in fourth in the 2017 Nairobi gubernatorial elections held on 8 August 2017, Miguna refused to concede defeat. In the August 2017 presidential election, Odinga and his supporters alleged that Kenyatta's election victory was a fraud. The Supreme Court of Kenya nullified the declaration of Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto as validly elected President and Deputy President, respectively. The Supreme Court also held that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) had committed numerous illegalities and irregularities and failed to conduct the 8 August 2017 presidential election in strict adherence to the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 and other applicable statues. The Court ordered the election repeated within sixty days. But it also ordered the IEBC to open its servers and KIEMS kits for a forensic audit before the repeat election. High Court of Kenya ruled that the election was not procedurally valid, and another election was held in October. Mr. Odinga boycotted that election, saying it would not be conducted fairly and credibly. Kenyatta was declared the winner with 98% of the vote, although the election was marred by irregularities, and people in some areas were not allowed to vote. In a dramatic reversal of stance, Miguna became one of Odinga's most outspoken advocates after the 2017 presidential election; he also emerged to become one of the sternest critics of the Kenyatta administration, accusing it of despotism and rigging itself into power. Miguna claims to be the leader of the National Resistance Movement, a group started by Raila Odinga declaration at Uhuru Park that was to engage in civil disobedience activities. On 30 January 2018, in a mock swearing in ceremony, Miguna administered an oath of office to Raila Odinga, where Odinga proclaimed himself \\"the people's president\\". The government reacted by shutting down all television and radio broadcasts and arresting Miguna and another lawyer (T J Kajwang') who had witnessed the ceremony (but did not arrest Odinga, since that would further inflame his supporters). Miguna was taken to court and charged with \\"being present and consenting to the administration of an oath to commit a capital offence, namely treason\\". The High Court ordered that Miguna be released on bail and that television broadcasts be permitted, but the government disobeyed the orders. Chief justice David Maraga criticised the actions of the officials, saying: \\"Disobeying court orders is inimical to the rule of law.\\" Miguna's Kenyan passport was seized and he was forced out of the country. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i said that the reason his passport had been seized is that it had been issued irregularly and fraudulently. Government officials said that Miguna did not disclose his Canadian citizenship when he applied for a Kenyan passport in 2009, so his application was not valid. Miguna countered that \\"The constitution is crystal clear: no one can invalidate or purport to cancel the citizenship of a Kenyan born citizen.\\" The government also declared the National Resistance Movement to be organised crime group. On 26 March 2018, Miguna tried to return to Kenya. He arrived at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi on a flight from Dubai, and he refused to cooperate with government authorities regarding the documentation they said was necessary for his entry to Kenya. On the day he arrived, officials pushed him through the airport and forced him onto a plane that was preparing to depart, but he loudly refused to cooperate with the boarding process. Video footage of the incident was circulated widely on the internet. He was detained at the airport and was forcibly returned to Dubai 2‚Äì3 days later. He had hidden his Canadian passport or temporarily given it to one of his associates and presented only his Kenyan national ID card when requesting entry to the country, which was refused as an improper document for use when entering the country from Dubai. He did not have a Kenyan passport because it had been seized by government officials when he was expelled from the country the previous month. He said his refusal to provide the Canadian document was \\"because I arrived in Kenya on March 26 as a Kenyan born citizen\\". One of his attorneys said in an affidavit that Miguna's Canadian passport had been seized by Kenyan officials, but Miguna and the Kenyan authorities both later contradicted that statement, and once Miguna was returned to Dubai he was able to proceed to Canada from there ‚Äì presumably by producing the Canadian passport. During his detention, a court order was issued to mandate his release and allow him to enter the country, but the officials holding him refused the order. They offered forms to Miguna to fill out to apply to \\"regularise\\" his Kenyan citizenship, but he refused to fill out the forms and tore them up, saying that he was a citizen by birth and should not need to apply for restoration of his citizenship. On 28 March 2018, Human Rights Watch issued a statement calling for Miguna's release. Otsieno Namwaya of Human Rights watch said \\"Kenyan authorities should urgently obey the numerous court orders to either release or produce Miguna in court. Holding him at the airport without any form of judicial review, in violation of court orders, is a blatant example of arbitrary detention.\\" On 28 March, just hours before Miguna was ejected from the country, High Court judge George Odunga declared the interior minister, the national police chief, and the head of immigration to be in contempt of court for their actions in defying a court order to release Miguna, and fined them US$2000 (UK¬£1,400) each. Miguna said that he had been beaten and forcibly drugged with an intravenous sedative before being put on the plane back to Dubai, and was unconscious on the journey. He released a photograph of an injury to his hand that he said had been inflicted by the injection of the sedative. A number of journalists covering the story said they had been assaulted by government officials. In a Facebook post, Miguna said \\"I was dragged, assaulted, drugged and forcefully flown to Dubai\\" and \\"I'm sick. My ribs and body is hurting all over. This is a travesty of justice.\\" On 29 March, Irungu Houghton, the Executive Director of Amnesty International for Kenya, released a statement calling for authorities to allow Miguna to enter the country to participate in judicial proceedings, saying \\"The way Miguna was treated showed blatant disregard for his human rights, after the High Court ordered that he be allowed to re-enter the country. The Kenyan government must also respect and protect the right to freedom of expression and allow journalists to freely report on the case without harassment, intimidation or attacks.\\" Amnesty said \\"The continuous disregard for court orders and attacks on the media is steadily eroding the rule of law and weakening human rights safeguards in the country,\\" and requested to \\"also launch a thorough, independent and impartial investigation into the unlawful use of force by the police to prevent journalists from doing their job\\". On 12 April 2018, former Kenyan Chief Justice Dr Willy Mutunga is reported to have called Miguna's treatment inhumane and unconstitutional in an interview with John Githongo, He is quoted as stating that \\"It is nauseating. It is very painful.\\" On 14 December 2018, the High court of Kenya released a landmark judgment in which it strongly indicted the state for having grossly violated Dr. Miguna's constitutional and fundamental rights such as his right to citizenship by birth which it ruled he did not lose and the state could not terminate. The Court also held that Miguna was a citizen entitled to a Kenyan Passport and ordered the State to issue him with a new and valid passport. The Court held that the destruction of Dr. Miguna's house, his arrest, incommunicado detention and forceful removal from Kenya were illegal and inhumane; that they constituted physical, emotional and psychological torture. Justice Enoch Chacha Mwita awarded Dr Miguna Miguna Sh7 million as damages for the violation of his rights during his rights and Kshs. 270,000 as special damages for the destruction of his house by the state. The court ordered the state officers who had been sued to pay the damages personally. In December 2019, Miguna Miguna made public his intention to return to Kenya through his Twitter account in what would be his third attempt. Citing protection from a court order issued in December 2018 to allow his return, he stated that his flight would land in Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on the morning of 11 January 2020. However, his return aborted when both Lufthansa and Air France airlines denied him admission to their flights citing red alerts that had been issued by the Kenyan government over his intended trip On 6 January 2020, Kenyan high court Judge Justice Weldon Korir ordered the government to facilitate the entry of Dr Miguna back to the country, and that the registrar should release Miguna‚Äôs Kenyan passport which is currently under custody. Kenyan Justice John Mativo summoned the Kenyan Attorney General Mr Paul Kihara Kariuki to appear in court on 13 January 2020, to explain why orders allowing lawyer Miguna Miguna's return to Kenya had not been obeyed. The Attorney General did not appear in court and instead sent a team of lawyers to appear in court on his behalf, prompting protest from Miguna Miguna‚Äôs lawyers, who said that the state was treating the matter casually.

The completed portion is in eastern Wake County, between Raleigh and Wendell; the majority of the completed route (approximately ) is known as the Knightdale Bypass, while the remaining follows the Raleigh Beltline (Interstate 440). It is planned to continue northeast through Rocky Mount, Williamston and Elizabeth City, ending in Norfolk, Virginia. It is signed as north-south, in keeping with the sign convention for most odd-numbered interstates, but the route goes primarily east-west, with the eastern direction aligning to the north designation. The entire route is concurrent with US 64, with portions also concurrent with I-440 and US 264. Route description I-87 is a six-lane interstate highway that connects I-40, in Raleigh, to Rolesville Road, in Wendell; it is entirely concurrent with US 64\\\\. The speed limit for majority of the route is . The southern terminus is at the interchange of I-40 and I-440 (Raleigh Beltline) in Southeast Raleigh, at I-40 exit 301/I-440 exit 16. I-87 north follows I-440 west for approximately before exiting the Beltline at exit 14 to follow the US 64/US 264 (former I-495) freeway, known locally as the Knightdale Bypass. Following the Bypass south of Knightdale, I-87 has interchanges with two local roads (New Hope Road and Hodge Road) before meeting the current eastern terminus of I-540. Two more local roads follow (Smithfield Road and Wendell Falls Parkway) before the I-87 designation ends at a complex interchange with US 64 Bus./Knightdale Boulevard/Wendell Boulevard and Rolesville Road. A portion of this freeway (from I-440 to I-540) was formerly designated I-495 from 2013 to 2017. I-495 signs were removed, and mileage markers and exit numbers were changed to reflect the redesignation in May 2019. Beyond Rolesville Road, the US 64 freeway from Wendell to Williamston is designated as Future I-87. It does not currently meet interstate highway standards and will need wider travel lanes, wider shoulders and crossover-prevention barriers added in the grass median. The remainder to the Virginia border is not built as a limited access freeway and require upgrading or building new roads parallel to existing US highways, including US 13, US 17 and US 158\\\\. History=Interstate 495= A portion of I-87, originally named I-495, was first designated as an Interstate Highway on February 20, 2013, when the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) submitted a request to AASHTO in order to establish Interstate 495 as a new auxiliary route of I-95. The proposed route would begin at I-440/US 64/US 64 Business in Raleigh and would end at I-95, in Rocky Mount, completely concurrent with US 64. On March 15, 2013, AASHTO received a modified request from NCDOT requesting the establishment of I-495 from I-440 to I-540 () and Future I-495 from I-540 to I-95 (). It was approved, though needed an additional approval from FHWA. On December 12, 2013, the proposed section was approved by the FHWA and was added to the interstate highway system. The freeway section, the part that was originally to be signed I-495 and continuing east to US 64 Business, was completed in 2006. From I-440 to Rolesville Road, the freeway was built to interstate standards; which is why the first official section of I-495 was able to connect between I-440 and I-540. East of Rolesville Road, the freeway was built in sections, since 1975. This older section of freeway will eventually be upgraded to interstate standards; which include road rehabilitation and wider lanes and shoulders. =Renumbering= \\"Future I-495\\" sign along US 64/US 264, near Knightdale. Signs like this were later replaced by \\"Future I-87\\" signs. Northern terminus of I-495, in Knightdale Southern terminus of I-495 & US 264, in Raleigh Long-term plans by the Raleigh-Durham area's Regional Transportation Alliance (RTA) called for extension of the interstate east of I-95 toward Elizabeth City, then northeastward to the Interstate 64/Interstate 464 interchange in the Norfolk‚ÄìVirginia Beach (Hampton Roads) metropolitan area. The NCDOT proposed the Interstate 44 designation for the Raleigh‚ÄìNorfolk High Priority Corridor consisting of portions of the I-495 and US 64 in North Carolina and US 17 in North Carolina and Virginia. The route would connect two of the largest US metro areas lacking an Interstate connection: the Research Triangle area around Raleigh and the Hampton Roads metro area around Norfolk. NCDOT requested the addition of the corridor to the Interstate Highway System as I-44 in November 2012. Congressman G. K. Butterfield introduced legislation in June 2014 to add the corridor to the Interstate Highway System through Congressional authority. An NCDOT policy paper said they were \\"seeking language in the reauthorization of surface transportation programs legislation to enhance the description of the Raleigh‚ÄìNorfolk Corridor to include the route via Rocky Mount‚ÄìElizabeth City for clarity, and to designate the entire route from Raleigh to Norfolk as a future part of the Interstate system as I-44 or I-50.\\" Had the I-44 designation been approved, it would have been discontinuous with the current I-44, which runs between Wichita Falls, Texas, and St. Louis, Missouri. The proposed corridor was officially designated as a future interstate with the passage of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) on December 14, 2015. Soon, several other route numbers were discussed and the RTA set their preference on two more-likely candidates: Interstate 56 if an east-west designation were chosen, or Interstate 89 if a north-south designation were chosen. I-56 is not in use, while I-89 exists in Vermont and New Hampshire, far north of this corridor. For the upcoming AASHTO Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering, NCDOT proposed I-89 for this route. On May 25, 2016, AASHTO instead approved I-87 as the number for the highway. The new I-87 would be non-contiguous with the route with the same number in New York State. The Interstate 87 designation pays tribute to several important dates in the history of both North Carolina and Virginia. The Roanoke Colony was founded in 1587; James Madison's Virginia Plan helped to develop U.S. Constitution in 1787; and North Carolina State University was created in 1887. On May 23, 2017, AASHTO approved the request by NCDOT to decommission existing I-495 and Future I-495; they were replaced by I-87 and Future I-87. I-87 signage were installed on September 5, 2017; in May 2019 mile markers and exit numbers were changed along the already completed segment from the I-440 junction to Rolesville Road. Exit numbers and mileage along the portion coincident with I-440 will retain I-440 mileage and exit numbers. I-87 will continue east along US 64 to I-95 after the road is upgraded to interstate standards. Future I-87 will extend from its current terminus at Rolesville Road to an undetermined location in Norfolk, Virginia. Current plans have the interstate running east along US 64 to Williamston. This section of US 64 is built as a freeway, but will need to be upgraded to Interstate highway standards. In Williamston, the interstate is planned to leave US 64 and begin following an alignment along present-day US 17. A feasibility study for the section between Williamston and the Virginia state line was completed in 2018. NCDOT maps show the interstate roughly following the US 17 corridor between Williamston and South Mills, North Carolina. There are several areas, where the Interstate may deviate from the current routing of US 17, and be placed on a new freeway. To the north of South Mill, NCDOT has laid out two plans on how the Interstate would proceed to Virginia. One plan shows I-87 running north along US 17 to the Virginia state line. In contrast, a second plan shows an interchange with I-87 and US 17 just north of modern-day McPherson Road and the Dismal Swamp Welcome Center. I-87 would then proceed to the east along new routing to NC 168/Virginia State Route 168 (SR 168). The interchange with Route 168 would take place just north of the North Carolina-Virginia state line. If NCDOT was to choose this alignment as the preferred route, I-87 would presumably follow SR 168 to Norfolk. NCDOT estimates that the section between Williamston and the Virginia state line could cost between $849.7 million and $945.2 million. Some of these upgrades are part of the DOT 10-year plan released in 2017, with upgrading of highways around Elizabeth City given a start date of 2023. As of July 24, 2019, Virginia does not have a timetable to complete their section of Interstate 87. US 17 is a four-lane expressway between the North Carolina state line and Norfolk. State Route 168 is a four- lane expressway for approximately 1.8 miles between the state line and Battlefield Boulevard. North of Battlefield Boulevard, SR 168 is a four lane toll limited access freeway known as the Chesapeake Expressway. Exit list Current exit numbers were signed in May 2019. Auxiliary routes I-87 in North Carolina will eventually have one spur route, I-587, that overlays US 264 to Greenville, North Carolina.

He won the Irish Champion Hurdle in 2008 before switching to chasing, where he has won six Grade 1s over fences.  Breeding  Sizing Europe is a bay gelding with a white star and white socks on his hind feet bred in Ireland by Angela Bracken. He was sired by Pistolet Bleu, winner of the Group 1 Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud and Group 1 Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. His best flat winner has been the Prix Hocquart and Prix Greffulhe winner Maille Pistol, but he is best known as a National Hunt sire, with his jumpers including Geos (Christmas Hurdle), Katarino (Triumph Hurdle) and the Grand National runner-up Cappa Bleu. Sizing Europe's dam is Jennie Dun, a mare by Mandalus. As a descendant of the broodmare Simone Vergnes, she was a distant relative of the 1943 Oaks Stakes winner, Why Hurry. Sizing Europe was offered for sale as a foal at the Tattersalls Ireland sale in November 2002 and was bought for ‚Ç¨9000 by the bloodstock agent Hugh Bleahen. He entered the ownership of Ann and Alan Potts and was sent into training with Henry de Bromhead in County Waterford.  Racing career = Early career = Sizing Europe made his racing debut as a four-year-old in a National Hunt Flat race at Leopardstown, where he was second to De Valira. He ran in a similar event at Limerick for a fifth-place finish before winning at Naas. With a victory under his belt, he was switched to hurdling. Sizing Europe made a winning debut over hurdles in the City Inn Maiden Hurdle at Newbury in November. Sent off at 8/1, he beat the 2/1 favourite Carlitos by three quarters of a length. The Queen's horse Barber Shop was fourteen lengths away in third. He then finished behind De Valira in two Grade 2 novice hurdles at Leopardstown and Fairyhouse, before beating future Champion Chase winner Big Zeb in a race at Punchestown. He was afterwards put away for the autumn. = 2007/2008 National Hunt Season: Hurdling = Sizing Europe's campaign got off to a rocky start when he fell at the second last flight in a Listed hurdle at Punchestown. He rebounded in the Greatwood Handicap Hurdle at Cheltenham where he beat the subsequent Champion Hurdle second Osana by four lengths. This display boosted his position in the Champion Hurdle market. Sizing Europe further boosted his Champion Hurdle claims with a win in the Grade 1 Irish Champion Hurdle at Leopardstown in January. In the race, he beat dual Champion Hurdler Hardy Eustace by eight lengths and was promoted to favourite for the big race in March. In the Champion Hurdle, Sizing Europe travelled well and seemed poised to challenge in the homestraight before weakening rapidly and being virtually pulled up by jockey Andrew McNamara. His trainer, Henry De Bromhead, later reported that the horse had injured his back. = 2008/2009 National Hunt Season: Hurdling = Sizing Europe returned in November in the Grade 1 Maplewood Developments Hurdle, where he finished second to Hardy Eustace. He then ran in the Grade 1 December Festival Hurdle at Punchestown and finished fifth behind 2007 Champion Hurdle winner Sublimity. Sizing Europe missed the 2009 Champion Hurdle due to injury and ran one last time over hurdles in the Punchestown Champion Hurdle, where he finished fourth behind multiple Grade 1 winner Solwhit and Champion Hurdler Punjabi. = 2009/2010 National Hunt Season: Novice chasing = Sizing Europe was then switched to fences for a novice chasing campaign. He first won a beginners chase at Punchestown in May before progressing to a win in the Grade 3 Buck House Novice Chase, where he beat Grade 1 hurdler Harchibald by seventeen lengths. Sizing Europe next won the Grade 2 Craddockstown Novice Chase at Punchestown, bringing his tally over fences to three out of three. The Grade 1 Bord Na Mona Novice Chase saw a clash between Sizing Europe (evens favourite), 2008 Supreme Novices' Hurdle winner Captain Cee Bee and former Champion Hurdle runner up Osana. Sizing Europe led turning into the straight, but Captain Cee Bee appeared to be travelling the better. However, that rival fell at the last, leaving Sizing Europe to win by over five lengths from Osana. Despite the result of the Bord Na Mona Novice Chase, Captain Cee Bee was sent off the 5/2 favourite in the Arkle Challenge Trophy at Cheltenham, with Sizing Europe rated a 6/1 shot. He raced prominently throughout, took the lead two out, and held off the late charge of Grade 1 winner Somersby. Sizing Europe ended his season by taking on more experienced chasers in the Grade 1 Punchestown Champion Chase, where he finished third behind Golden Silver and 2009 Arkle winner Forpadydeplasterer. = 2010/2011 National Hunt season: Chasing = Sizing Europe started off his second chasing season in the Grade 3 Star Chase over 2 miles 7 furlongs, with a view to stepping up to staying chases and perhaps a crack at the Cheltenham Gold Cup. However, he lost to China Rock by seven lengths. In his next race, he took on the dual Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Kauto Star in the Grade 1 JNwine.com Champion Chase over three miles. Kauto Star won by four lengths. The plan had been for Sizing Europe to tackle the prestigious King George VI Chase over three miles at Kempton on Boxing Day, but when that race was postponed due to frost, he was rerouted to the Grade 2 Tied Cottage Chase over two miles. He finished third behind Golden Silver and multiple Grade 1 winner Big Zeb. Sizing Europe was kept at two miles for his next start in the Grade 1 Queen Mother Champion Chase at the Cheltenham Festival in March. Amongst the opposition were dual Champion Chase winner Master Minded, 2010 winner Big Zeb, and Golden Silver. Tracking the leader throughout, Sizing Europe jumped to the front at the seventh fence and finished strongly to beat Big Zeb by five lengths. In a historic race, Irish horses occupied the first four places. In his final race of the season, Sizing Europe was beaten by Big Zeb in the Punchestown Champion Chase, losing by three quarters of a length after being overtaken at the final fence. = 2011/2012 National Hunt season: Chasing = Sizing Europe started off his campaign in the Grade 2 Gowran Park Champion Chase over 2 miles 4 furlongs. He held off Coolcashin to win by 1.75 lengths with Grade 1 winner Rubi Light far behind in third. He then tackled the JNwine.com Champion Chase for the second year in a row, but, on very soft ground, his stamina gave out in the final furlong and he was passed by the staying on Quito De La Roque. Sizing Europe rebounded with a win in the Grade 1 Tingle Creek Chase over two miles at Sandown. He defeated Kauto Star's half brother Kauto Stone by eight lengths as the 11/8 favourite. He then won the Grade 2 Tied Cottage Chase, gaining revenge on Big Zeb in a three-runner race and being cut to 6/4 for the Champion Chase. Sizing Europe was sent off the 4/5F in the Champion Chase and was beaten just over a length in a controversial running. Front runner Wishfull Thinking fell at the fourth fence (the last one the final circuit) and crashed through railings into a crowd of photographers. His jockey Richard Johnson was still lying prone by the time the field had races round the course, so officials made the decision to bypass the fence. However, the signs were unclear, so Andrew Lynch on Sizing Europe and Barry Geraghty on Finian's Rainbow were unsure of whether to jump it or not until very close to the fence. Both horses had to change course sharply, and some onlookers felt that Sizing Europe lost the most momentum, although Finian's Rainbow proved the result was no fluke with a win in the Grade 1 Melling Chase a few weeks later. Returning to Ireland, Sizing Europe won the Punchestown Champion Chase at the third attempt, holding off Grade 1 winner Realt Dubh by 2.25 lengths.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/feb/05/sizing-europe- punchestown-cheltenham = 2012/2013 National Hunt season: Chasing = Sizing Europe again ran in the Grade 2 Gowran Park Champion Chase, winning by over seven lengths from Forpadydeplasterer. He followed up in the Grade 2 Clonmel Oil Chase over the same distance, beating Magnaminity by twenty lengths. Sizing Europe dropped back to two miles for the Grade 1 Paddy Power Dial-A-Bet Chase at the Leopardstown Christmas Festival. He beat Rubi Light by two and a half lengths with Big Zeb back in fourth. He remained second favourite for the Champion Chase at 8/1. He prepped for Cheltenham with a second win in the Tied Cottage Chase, where he beat Foildubh by ten lengths. This was his fourth consecutive win of the season. Henry De Bromhead originally entered Sizing Europe in the Champion Chase, Ryanair Chase and Cheltenham Gold Cup. Although he was withdrawn from the Gold Cup on 12 February, he was not committed to either of the other two races. On 11 March, Henry De Bromhead confirmed that Sizing Europe would face Sprinter Sacre in the Queen Mother Champion Chase. At the Cheltenham Festival, Sizing Europe finished second to the undefeated chaser Sprinter Sacre in the Queen Mother Champion Chase. He took the lead at the ninth fence but was passed by the younger horse three fences from home. Sizing Europe stumbled rounding the turn for home but stayed on to finish a clear second, albeit nineteen lengths behind the winner. Sizing Europe's final run of the season came in the Grade 1 Punchestown Champion Chase, where he again faced Sprinter Sacre, who had won the Grade 1 Melling Chase at Aintree in the meantime. Although Sizing Europe pushed Sprinter Sacre, the latter was victorious by five and a half lengths. = 2013/2014 National Hunt season: Chasing = Sizing Europe made his seasonal debut in the Grade 2 Gowran Park Champion Chase, which he won for the third consecutive year, beating Arkle runner up Bailey Green by a length and a quarter. He then contested the Grade 1 JNWine. Com Champion Chase for the third time, but despite being sent off the 9/4 joint favourite, was beaten thirteen lengths by Roi Du Mee. Trainer Henry de Bromhead indicated that this would be the last time that Sizing Europe raced over three miles, and that the Dial-A-Bet Chase over two miles was his next target. In the Dial-A-Bet Chase, he started 11/4 second favourite, but after leading until the second last, he weakened in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Benefficient. On 12 March, Sizing Europe ran in his fourth consecutive Champion Chase at the Cheltenham Festival. At twelve years old, he was the oldest horse in the field and started at odds of 11/1. He was in contention throughout the race and finished fourth behind Sire de Grugy, Somersby and Module. Sizing Europe ended his season in the Boylesports.com Champion Chase at Punchestown on 29 April when he started 7/1 third choice in the betting behind Hidden Cyclone and Somersby. He took the lead at the ninth of the eleven fences before going clear approaching the last and won by five and a half lengths from Ballynagour. After the race, Alan Potts described the horse as being \\"back to his brilliant best\\". = 2014/2015 National Hunt season: Chasing = Once again, Sizing Europe began his season in the PWC Champion Chase at Gowran Park in October and started 9/4 second favourite behind the Galway Plate winner Road To Riches, to whom he was conceding four pounds. Ridden for the first time by Jonathan Burke, he raced just behind the leaders for most of the way before staying on strongly in the closing stages, overtaking Road To Riches in the final strides and winning by a head. After the race, de Bromhead said, \\"It was just incredible. It's like he's taking the Mickey, leaving it until the very end. He's still loving it and you can see there he's got the heart of a lion.\\" In December Sizing Europe attempted to repeat his 2012 success in the Clonmel Oil Chase. After briefly reaching second place he faded in the closing stages and finished sixth of the seven runners behind Champagne Fever. Sizing Europe ran in the Queen Mother Champion Chase for the fifth time on 11 March 2015, for which his opponents included Sprinter Sacre and Sire de Grugy.

The terms are used interchangeably. Pathophysiology PTCs originate from the mesothelium and are presumed to be remnants of the M√ºllerian duct and Wolffian duct. Diagnosis Most cysts are small and asymptomatic. Typical sizes reported are 1 to 8 cm in diameter. PTCs may be found at surgery or during an imaging examination that is performed for another reason. Larger lesions may reach 20 or more cm in diameter and become symptomatic exerting pressure and pain symptoms in the lower abdomen. Large cysts can lead to torsion of the adnexa inflicting acute pain. Prior to surgery, PTCs are usually seen on ultrasonography. However, because of the proximity of the ovary that may display follicle cysts, it may be a challenge to identify a cyst as paratubal or paraovarian. Malignancy PTCs are generally benign, but may, on rare occasions, give rise to borderline tumors and malignancies. Management Smaller lesions can be followed expectantly. Larger lesions, lesions that are growing or symptomatic, and lesions with sonographically suspicious findings (septation, papillations, fluid and solid components) are generally surgically explored and removed. Epidemiology PTCs have been reported in all female age groups and seem to be most common in the third to fifth decades of life. A study in Italy estimated their incidence to be about 3%, while an autopsy study of postmenopausal women detected them in about 4% of cases. These cysts constitute about 10% of adnexal masses. Hydatid cysts of Morgagni Hydatid cysts of Morgagni, also hydatids of Morgagni or Morgagni's cysts, are common and appear as pedunculated, often tiny, frequently multiple cysts connected to the fimbriae of the fallopian tubes. They thus appear to be a specific variant of paratubal cysts. They are named after Giovanni Battista Morgagni. While usually asymptomatic, it has been noted that these cysts tend to be more common in women with unexplained infertility (52.1% versus 25.6% in controls, p<0.001) and suggested that they may play a role in infertility. It has been proposed that these cysts interfere with tubal pick-up and function.

Almost every citizen has such stamp in internal Russian passport about registration at the place of residence (sometimes still called \\"propiska\\"). Registration in the Russian Federation is the system that records the residence and internal migration of Russian citizens. The present system was introduced on October 1, 1993, and replaced the prior repressive mandatory Soviet system of propiska. The word \\"propiska\\" is still widely used colloquially to refer to the registration program. According to a Russian Constitutional Court decision, registration or absence of registration cannot affect any rights of a citizen. Citizens exercise registration and deregistration on a voluntary basis. Under the current registration program, Russian citizens must register if they live in the same place for 90 days (for Belarusian citizens in Russia and vice versa, registration is required after 30 days). There are two types of registration: * Registration of citizens at the place of residence (so called \\"permanent registration\\" or sometimes \\"permanent propiska\\" / \\"propiska\\") * Registration of citizens at the place of temporary residence (so called \\"temporary registration\\" or sometimes \\"temporary propiska\\") A place of permanent registration is indicated on a stamp made in an internal passport, and a place of temporary registration is written on a separate paper. Living in a dwelling without a permanent or temporary registration is considered an administrative offence in Russia. Registration is used for economic, law enforcement and other purposes, such as accounting social benefits, housing and utility payments, taxes, conscription, and medical care. Many documents and rights may be obtained only at the place where a citizen has permanent registration, which causes problems, for example, when obtaining or changing passports, voting, or getting inquiry papers, which are often required in Russia. Registration determines the location where citizens receive pension payments and obtain internal and foreign Russian passports, and it affects the size and cost of housing and utilities services. Registration is also said to have a public safety significance. The registration service is managed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which also handles immigration control.  Registration and employment  In 2004 Supreme Court of Russia banned discrimination based on residential registration. Current Russian labour code contains direct prohibition to require local registration for hiring Russian citizens. Even though as for 2014 it still quite common practice to require local registration or even permanent local registration as necessary condition for hiring.  History  The institute of propiska was found unlawful by Committee of Constitutional Supervision of the USSR in 1991 and officially discontinued in Russia in 1993. In December 1993, the new Constitution of Russia came into force. The \\"Law on Russian citizens' right to freedom of movement...\\" regarding registration was adopted by Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation in June 1993. In 1996 and 1998, the Constitutional Court of Russia liberalized some provisions of the legislation and nullified some restrictive laws that had been enacted by local authorities. In 2005, the Government of Russia extended the registration-free period to 90 days for internal movements. Temporary registration is needed only for temporary residences of 91-days or longer.

The majority of French people settled in eastern Cuba.Archivo Cubano. Una identit√° en Movimiento (in spanish: Cuban filed: A identity in moving). Retrieved in March 01, 2013, to 0:20 pm.  History = First wave of migration = The first wave of French immigrants to arrive in Cuba were fleeing the Haitian Revolution and the new governmental administration of Haiti after independence was declared. This immigration reached its peak between 1800 and 1809, when more than twenty-seven thousand French of all social classes arrived in the eastern part of Cuba. Many of them emigrated to the city of Santiago de Cuba, which had neither sidewalks nor paved streets, and lacked drinking water, supplies and dwellings for the refugees. The newcomers soon recognized the favorable conditions the new land presented. Initially, they worked in the port, and traded with the Catalans who had settled in Santiago. Consequently, the port of Santiago de Cuba saw much more commercial activity. With the resultant increase of the white population of the city, for the first time it had a relative balance between the black and the white populations. An apothecary and shops selling imported comestibles were opened, new government buildings were built, and postal service was expanded. The Captaincy General of Cuba of the island approved the growing of coffee and many French-Haitian migrants were used for work in the coffee fields, especially those white French who were considered \\"solvent and reliable\\". By 1804 there were three thousand men cultivating the land, and agricultural lands were bought, sold and resold while Creole and French investors provided capital for new business ventures that became the economic engine of Santiago. In 1807, coffee shipped to the United States and Spain was the principal Cuban export. Sebasti√°n Kindel√°n y O‚ÄôRegan, governor of Santiago, reported five hundred thousand coffee plants being cultivated on the island; the crop's yield of ten million pounds that year would be quadrupled in 1810. The beginning of the Peninsular War (1807‚Äì1814) between France and Spain caused the Captaincy General of the island to expel Franco-Haitian and French residents, and only those French who were naturalized Spanish citizens and had assimilated into the Spanish culture were allowed to remain. The exact number of French persons expelled from Santiago de Cuba is unknown, most of them moved to the southern United States, especially Louisiana. = Second, third and fourth waves of migration = In 1814, when peace between France and Spain was restored, the French immigrants who had left Cuba were allowed to return to the island. They, together with new French immigrants, formed a second wave of French immigration to Santiago de Cuba. This second wave promoted an increase in economic activity in the city, and resulted in Santiago becoming a prime exporter of coffee. Sugarcane- raising expanded in the surrounding savannas, while new roads and aqueducts were built to encourage the settling of the Sierra Maestra. Between 1818 and 1835 a third wave of immigration to Santiago de Cuba occurred, prompted by a royal order from the Spanish Crown intended to increase the proportion of whites in the Cuban population. While only a quarter of the population were engaged in agriculture, commercial activities were much more robust than before. Since 1821, only a few years after a treaty was signed in 1817 between Spain and England to abolish the slave trade, this trade had nevertheless increased, and increased exports of sugar, honey, wax, coffee, tobacco and rum made the port of Santiago one of Cuba's busiest. With French investment in exploiting the mines in the area, mining had become a new and important sector in the city's economic development. With the general increase in mercantile activity, many new shops of all sorts were opened and tradesmen found a larger market for their products or labor. The fourth and final wave of French immigrants to Santiago de Cuba occurred between 1836 and 1868. In this period over 2200 French settlers emigrated, most of them coming from the Atlantic coast of France. The local economy was strengthened while the immigrants were absorbed into traditional occupations. In 1851, a French-owned steamship line was inaugurated to improve communications between Santiago de Cuba and New York City. The civil engineer Jules Sagebien, a French immigrant from Picardy, after making a trip to Europe to learn engineering techniques for the building of railroads, did some technically challenging work for the Santiago de Cuba Railroad, which traverses rugged mountainous terrain. In July 1844, he surveyed the Santiago-Cobre line built to transport ore from the island's only copper mine to the port of Santiago, a railway project for the Eastern Department, the first of its kind in the region, according to historian Laura Cruz R√≠os. Coffee remained the number one crop in the Santiago de Cuba region, exceeding the sugar cane crop in value, until it reached its highest production in the 1840s. Towards the end of this decade, however, coffee production began to decline with the bankruptcy of some of the large landowners; investors then began to direct their capital into copper mining and sugar production. The French still had a presence in diverse sectors of the Cuban economy throughout the 19th century, especially in commercial trade, but also in agriculture, marine shipping, and the professions, including medicine, engineering, law, and pedagogy.  Demography  The number of Cubans of French ancestry remains unknown. In some historical works, the number of French emigrants to Cuba is reported to be over 60,000 during the Haitian Revolution. In those days the total population of Cuba was less than 1,000,0000 and the proportion of whites to blacks was about 50% whites and 50% blacks. This meant that 10‚Äì12% of whites were French refugees. On 1 May 2012, the number of registered residents in the French Consulate record was 534, two thirds of them residing in Havana. They were primarily officials of the French Embassy, the Alliance Fran√ßaise and their families, and French expatriates working for French companies operating in Cuba and their families.

Founded in 1883 as to serve the needs of the area and the Pennsylvania Railroad, the hospital was known for most of its history simply as Altoona Hospital. It became part of the Altoona Regional Health System which was created in 2004 by the merger of Altoona Hospital with Bon Secours-Holy Family Hospital, previously Mercy Hospital of Altoona. Today as part of UPMC, it is an Adult Level II trauma center for a 20 county region in central Pennsylvania and is served by 300 physicians and 4,000 care givers that help it to provide a variety of medical services and specialties. History Prior to becoming part of the UPMC system, UPMC Altoona was known as the Altoona Regional Health System, of which Altoona Regional Hospital was the flagship facility and campus. That health system was the product of a 2004 merger between the city's two historic hospitals, Altoona Hospital and Mercy Hospital, the later of which became known as Bon Secours Holy Family Hospital in 1996. =Altoona Hospital= Altoona Hospital was founded as Altoona General Hospital in 1883 due to the needs for a medical facility for the growing population of Blair County and the Pennsylvania Rail Road (PRR), which had its primary repair shops located in the area. Altoona Hospital's earliest permanent home was a $16,645 ($ in dollars) wooden, two-story, 30-bed hospital that opened on January 1, 1886. The first medical staff, led by Dr. John Fay as chief, were appointed on November 11, 1885. The PRR donated the land for the hospital, located conveniently close to the rail lines between 6th and 7th streets along Howard Avenue. During this first year, the hospital saw 113 total patients and ambulance service was added in July 1886. From there the hospital grew rapidly in size, including the addition of two stories by 1893, and added greatly to its capabilities. In 1904, it opened a nursing school, a nurses residence in 1905, a dispensary in 1920, an intensive-care unit in 1957, and the area's first cardiac care unit in 1968. Altoona Hospital constructed its current 13-story main tower, designed by Hayes Large Architects of Altoona, in 1978 and in 1989 it performed the region's first open heart surgery. Between 1993-95, it constructed a major expansion with the addition of a 7-story outpatient center and a 5-story parking garage, also by Hayes Large Architects, with Robert E. Wedge, AIA, as Principle in Charge. =Mercy/Bon Secours hospital= Mercy Hospital, also in Altoona, was conceived under the name of Mountain City Hospital to serve as a second hospital for the city. Mercy was formally opened on July 14, 1910, with nine beds, 15 physicians and 6 nurses in what was originally the 1866 home of Thomas McCaulley which was located on the corner of Eighth Avenue and Twenty-sixth Street of Altoona. Mercy also operated a school of nursing and by 1927 the hospital had grown to 180 beds. In 1935, while facing financial difficulties and at the request of the hospital's board of directors, Mercy came to be managed by the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth of Pittsburgh. From that point the hospital experienced major expansions of its facilities, including a \\"B\\" wing that opened in 1962, a pavilion that opened in 1978, and another expansion 1991. Its school of nursing closed in 1985 and the hospital instead affiliated with a nursing program located at nearby Saint Francis College. In 1996, the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth sold the hospital to the Sisters of Bon Secours, at which point it became part of the multi-state Bon Secours Health System and changed its name to Bon Secours Holy Family Hospital. In 2003, the Sisters of the Bon Secours withdrew their sponsorship of the hospital (although the hospital remained as a part of Bon Secours Health System) as merger talks with Altoona Hospital began to take shape. UPMC The 2004 merger between Altoona Hospital and Bon Secours resulted in a two hospital campus system that included more than 20 affiliated companies. In 2010 and 2011, some outpatient services were moved to a new $16 million Station Medical Center and additional expansion of the Altoona Hospital campus was initiated by the purchase and $18 million renovation of the formerly state-owned Altoona Center at Howard Avenue and 4th Street. In 2011, with a decision having been made to close the Bon Secours campus and consolidate existing services at the Altoona Hospital, Bon Secours Health System withdrew as a partner of Altoona Regional Health System thereby ending 76 years of Catholic involvement in area hospital administration. The 7th Avenue Bons Secours campus officially closed on March 28, 2012. =UPMC= UPMC Altoona campus in 2014 In February 2013, after over a year-long investigation of affiliation options, Altoona Regional Health System signed a non-binding letter of intent to negotiate an affiliation with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). Altoona Regional is simultaneously exploring affiliation with 45-bed Nason Hospital in Roaring Spring, Pennsylvania in order to form a single, county-wide health system. In its final action on affiliation, on June 20, 2013, the boards of directors of Altoona Regional Health System and its parent company, Central Pennsylvania Health Services Corporation, voted unanimously to join with UPMC on July 1, 2013, as the renamed \\"UPMC Altoona\\", which will become a regional referral center of the UPMC health system. With the merger, UPMC will appoint one-third of the hospital's board members as well as commit $250 million over the next decade for capital improvement in the Altoona system, not including a $10 million donation to the hospital's charitable foundation. Services UPMC Altoona is a private, non-profit hospital that functions as a regional referral center and tertiary hub for UPMC. It serves as an Adult Level II trauma center for a 20 county region in central Pennsylvania. Altoona Regional is serviced by the STAT Medevac medical air transport service.

Hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of securities given the agencies highest‚Äîtriple-A ‚Äì rating were later downgraded to \\"junk\\" status,$300 billion collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) issued in 2005‚Äì2007 (over half of the CDOs by value during that time period) that rating agencies gave their highest \\"triple-A\\" rating to, were written down to \\"junk\\" by the end of 2009.

Critics have complained that the criteria to designate a rating agency as \\"a nationally recognized statistical rating organization‚Äù was written by a \\"yet-to-be-identified official of one of the big three ratings agencies\\" and is so difficult it has \\"prevented at least one potential competitor from winning approval and have dissuaded others from even applying\\". According to critics, the law has set \\"odd barriers that are very favorable to the incumbents,‚Äù made it ‚Äúexceptionally difficult for a younger player to qualify‚Äù as a SEC recognized agency, and ‚Äúabsolutely slammed the door on any new competition‚Äù in structured products ‚Äì ‚Äúthe most lucrative part of the ratings business‚Äù.

She captured two privateers before she was wrecked in February 1811 off the coast of Jutland. Career Henry Hume Spence received his promotion to commander on 28 May 1806, and commissioned Pandora in December. She then served in the North Sea and on the Downs station. On 28 August 1807, Pandora was in company when captured the Danish droit Emanuel. On 13 January 1808, Pandora captured the French privateer Entreprenant, of 16 guns and 58 men, six or seven miles SSE of Folkestone, with the assistance of the hired armed cutter Active. The chase lasted an hour and 40 minutes and the French vessel did not strike until small arms fire from Pandora had wounded Captain Bloudin and five or six other men. Entreprenant was three days out of Calais and had captured the brig Mary, of Sunderland. Pandora was among the many vessels present at the unsuccessful Walcheren Campaign and in the Scheldt in July-August 1809. She therefore shared in the subsequent prize money for the property the British army captured at that time. Spence received promotion to post captain on 24 August 1809,Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, pp.48-9. Commander Richard Gaire Janvrin, who had been in charge of the port of Flushing during the British withdrawal,Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, pp. 271-2. replaced him in October. On 12 October Pandora, under Janvrin, was among the vessels in sight when her sister ship captured the Danish brig Friheden. In October 1810 Commander John Macpherson Ferguson replaced Janvrin, who had been promoted to post captain on 21 October. On 31 December Pandora captured the French privateer cutter Chasseur, of 16 guns and 36 men. The privateer threw her guns overboard during the chase. Chasseur was two days out of the island of Fora but had made no captures. Fate Pandora wrecked on 13 February 1811 on the Scaw Reef off the coast of Jutland. She was in company with the frigate and both vessels were at anchor in poor weather. When the weather eased, they sighted a brig near shore and launched their boats to capture her. Venus ordered Pandora to approach the brig to provide support for the boats. However, when the boats reached the brig they saw that she was a wreck and they turned around to return to their ships. The weather worsened, but when it cleared Pandora was able to retrieve her boats. However, the weather again worsened and as Pandora attempted to locate Venus Pandora grounded. She lost her rudder, and shortly after she had cut away her masts and fired distress guns she capsized on her side. Pandoras boats were frozen to the deck and it was only on 15 February that the Danes were able to get boats to her and to rescue most of the crew; 27 of her crew of 121 had died of exposure and the rest became prisoners.Gossett (1986), p.78.

Run TMC was the high-scoring trio of basketball teammates consisting of Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond and Chris Mullin. Starting in 1989, they played together for two seasons with the Golden State Warriors in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Coached by Don Nelson, the Warriors played a fast-paced, run-and-gun style, and Run TMC was the league's highest-scoring trio in the 1990‚Äì91 season. Despite their short time together, the popularity of Run TMC endured. Their name was a play on the hip hop group Run-DMC, with the first name initials of each member forming \\"TMC\\". History Run TMC thrived under coach Don Nelson. Mullin joined the Warriors in 1985, Richmond was drafted by Golden State in 1988, and Hardaway was a rookie in 1989. They were the core of the Warriors' uptempo offense, known as \\"Nellie Ball\\" after their coach Don Nelson. Nelson was a Warriors vice president in 1987‚Äì88 before becoming their coach and general manager starting in 1988‚Äì89. The Warriors led the NBA in scoring in 1989‚Äì90 in Run TMC's first season. Early on, Hardaway was not as proficient a scorer as Mullin and Richmond. In a win over the Boston Celtics in the 38th game of the season, all three players surpassed 20 points in the same game for the first time. In their two seasons together, they accomplished the feat 48 times, going 30‚Äì18 in those games. The Warriors sold out every home game in 1990‚Äì91. In the season opener, they defeated the Denver Nuggets 162‚Äì158, the highest- scoring regulation game in NBA history. Despite their scoring prowess, the Warriors were limited defensively. On February 26, 1991, they lost 131‚Äì119 to the Orlando Magic despite the trio each scoring more than 30 points (the rest of the team totaled 21 points). Golden State finished the season 44‚Äì38, their best record in nine years, and finished second in the league in scoring (116.6). Mullin finishing eighth in scoring (25.7), Richmond 10th (23.9), and Hardaway 11th (22.9), averaging 72.5 points as the league's highest-scoring trio. Their combined scoring average was the second highest in NBA history for a 20-point trio, surpassed only by the 76.7 by Denver's Alex English (28.4), Kiki Vandeweghe (26.7), and Dan Issel (21.6) in 1982‚Äì83. The Warriors advanced to the playoffs, upsetting David Robinson and the San Antonio Spurs before losing to the Los Angeles Lakers. On November 1, 1991, Run TMC was broken up when Golden State traded Richmond and Les Jepsen to the Sacramento Kings for rookie Billy Owens, whose additional height compared to Richmond was the size that Nelson believed would complete the team. Nelson said he \\"was under pressure to get [the team] bigger\\" to improve the Warriors from a good team to a great one. In the trio's two seasons together, the Warriors had a cumulative record of 81‚Äì83, never finished higher than fourth place in the Pacific Division, and won one of two playoff series. \\"I‚Äôd never make that trade again,\\" Nelson lamented. Nickname Hardaway, Richmond, and Mullin began the 1990‚Äì91 season being called the \\"Big Three\\". Midway through the season, The San Francisco Examiner sponsored a \\"Name the Warriors Trio Contest.\\" The newspaper took the best suggestions to the players, who selected \\"Run TMC\\". The name was a reference to hip hop group Run‚ÄìD.M.C. \\"Run DMC was one of the first rap groups that most people really took notice of ... We definitely liked that nickname,\\" remembered Richmond. Former Laker Sam Perkins recalled that the Warriors even had Run‚ÄìDMC perform at one of the Warriors‚ÄìLakers playoff games that season. Aftermath Richmond was a six-time All-Star with Sacramento, and the Kings retired his number in 2003. Owens never provided his expected impact and played only three seasons with Golden State. They won 55 games and finished in 2nd place, two games behind the Portland Trail Blazers in 1992, but lost in the first round of the playoffs. In 1996, Hardaway was traded to the Miami Heat, and the Warriors dealt Mullin the following year to the Indiana Pacers. All three enjoyed successful careers after the breakup. Mullin and Hardaway came close to winning an NBA championship, while Richmond won one with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2002, albeit with limited playing time. Legacy Mullin was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011. He acknowledged that his career \\"took off\\" when Richmond and Hardaway arrived with Warriors. Nelson was inducted the following year. In 2014, Richmond was also voted in, while Hardaway was a finalist for the second consecutive year. Run TMC's short time together belied their enduring popularity. \\"It was only [a couple of] years, but it seemed longer,\\" Mullin said. The Boston Globe in 2007 wrote the trio had \\"probably the best nickname\\" ever. As of 2013, Run TMC T-shirts were still available for sale online. Online tributes are authored by bloggers who were too young to have seen them play, and YouTube is filled with their highlights. NBA.com in 2011 attributed Run TMC's popularity to \\"romanticism of a loyal fan base that hasn't had much to cheer about.\\" The New York Times opined that their enduring nature \\"will likely remain a mystery.\\" The Warriors gave away promotional Run TMC bobbleheads in 2012, with Mullin's likeness being handed out in conjunction with his number being retired by the Warriors. Mullin thought that Hardaway and Richmond should have had their numbers retired at the same time. \\"To me, it doesn‚Äôt always have to be about one person. I know I'd feel more comfortable. That would feel natural to me.\\" Mullin said. He called his time with Hardway and Richmond \\"the most fun I had playing basketball in my whole life.\\" NotesReferencesExternal links * Nicknamed groups of NBA players 1989‚Äì90 NBA season 1990‚Äì91 NBA season 1990s in California ","title":"Run TMC"},{"id":"38671590","text":"Savad Jan (, also Romanized as SavƒÅd JƒÅn; also known as SavƒÅr JƒÅn) is a village in Hureh Rural District, Saman County, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, Iran.

The line, which is operated by the S√ºdostbayernbahn (SOB) (part of Deutsche Bahn), runs from M√ºhldorf to Freilassing in the German state of Bavaria. Line to Freilassing (between Tittmoning-Wiesm√ºhl and Fridolfing) History The rail link between M√ºhldorf and Freilassing was opened on 1 December 1908 as one of the last sections opened by Royal Bavarian State Railways. The line, which was conceived as an approach line to the Tauern Railway and was designated therefore as the \\"Bavarian Tauern Railway\\" (bayerische Tauernbahn), was created by linking and upgrading existing local line segments: *M√ºhldorf‚ÄìT√º√üling, part of the M√ºhldorf‚ÄìBurghausen railway opened on 10 August 1897 *Freilassing-Wiesm√ºhl, part of the Freilassing‚ÄìTittmoning branch line, opened on 14 June 1890 (Freilassing‚ÄìLaufen) and 1 May 1894 (Laufen‚ÄìTittmoning). Two options were available: a route from Burgkirchen (on the M√ºhldorf‚ÄìBurghausen line) to Wiesm√ºhl (on the existing line to Tittmoning) and, on the other hand, the T√º√üling‚ÄìGarching‚ÄìWiesm√ºhl route. The latter, which was implemented, also had, apart from providing a railway connecting Kirchweidach and Garching, the advantage that the former branch line from Traunstein to Trostberg could be connected with the new line in Garching. In T√º√üling a change in the route of the line to Burghausen was made because it was originally planned to build the junction with the branch of the Tauern Railway in Ehring. T√º√üling would then have a station on each line, which would have made transfers much more difficult. Therefore, the stations at T√º√üling and Heiligenstatt were moved, a new section was built from the new T√º√üling station to the line to Burghausen and the old section was abandoned.Reinhard Wanka: 100 Jahre bayerische Tauernbahn The route was taken over by the Bavarian Group Administration (Gruppenverwaltung Bayern) of Deutsche Reichsbahn on 24 April 1920 and it is now operated by Deutsche Bahn. While the national significance of the line was always relatively small despite some long-distance services in the first half of the 20th century, it is still of major significance for local connections. Several smaller intermediate stations were abandoned in the second half of the 20th century. Kirchweidach station, which was abandoned on 29 May 1988, was reopened on 2 June 1996. Passenger services closed on 27 September 1969 on the Tittmoning- Wiesm√ºhl‚ÄìTittmoning section of the original Freilassing‚ÄìTittmoning line, which since 1908 had operated as a branch line. Freight were abandoned on the branch on 31 July 1981. The first completed project on the current upgrade of the M√ºhldorf‚ÄìSalzburg line was a 160-metre-long concrete bridge over the Inn just south of M√ºhldorf, which was opened in late September 2011. Operations Since 2003, almost all passenger trains running from M√ºhldorf continue via Freilassing to Salzburg. Moreover, since 2005, almost all of these trains continue over the Neumarkt-Sankt Veit ‚Äì Landshut railway to Landshut. Services operate at two-hour intervals each day on the whole line; from Monday to Friday additional services running between M√ºhldorf and Trostberg mean that there are hourly services between M√ºhldorf and Garching. In freight transport, on weekdays a pair of local trains operates on the M√ºhldorf‚ÄìFreilassing‚ÄìTraunstein route as block trains to and from firms in the ‚ÄúBavarian Chemical Triangle‚Äù (Bayerisches Chemiedreieck) in Gendorf and Burghausen. Freight trains also operate between M√ºhldorf and Garching, serving customers in Garching and on the Traunstein‚ÄìGarching railway. On the M√ºhldorf‚ÄìT√º√üling section of the \\"Bavarian Tauern Railway\\" there are also numerous passenger and freight trains serving the M√ºhldorf‚ÄìBurghausen line. Development planning  It has been decided to electrify the M√ºhldorf‚ÄìSalzburg line and to duplicate the Kirchweidach‚ÄìTittmoning-Wiesm√ºhl section. In addition, the electrification of the T√º√üling-Burghausen section is also proposed. The line speed will be upgraded to 160 km/h as far as possible using the existing line. The financing of the construction work, which was initially to be completed by 2012, has not been fully accounted for according to Deutsche Bahn. Funding is now secured for duplication of the M√ºhldorf‚ÄìT√º√üling section, including electrification, and the federal transport minister Peter Ramsauer indicated in September 2011 that it would be commissioned in 2016. The corresponding financial agreement for ‚Ç¨127.6 million was signed on 14 February 2013 by DB Netz AG and the Federal Ministry of Transport. After the two phases of the planning approval process are completed during 2013, the duplication is expected to be completed in 2017. In addition, a funding agreement has been reached to provide ‚Ç¨50 million for the upgrading of the Rosenheim‚ÄìSalzburg railway from Freilassing to the Austrian border to three tracks. The planned upgrade would also bring considerable relief on the Munich‚ÄìRosenheim route and therefore would make available additional capacity for freight traffic on the Brenner Railway.

It was released as the album's 4th single in February 2013, along with several remixes. A music video for the song was released on YouTube on 10 January 2013. Composition You (Ha Ha Ha) relies heavily on a sample of Gold Panda's single \\"You\\". The sample provides \\"psychedelic loops\\" to the track, that contains \\"maddening trance and haunted-house echoes\\" and \\"aural flourishes\\". The sound of the single has been described as a \\"combination of UK electro and saccharine vocals\\". It is set in the key of B Major. Critical reception In its list of the best songs of 2013, Pitchfork ranked \\"You (Ha Ha Ha)\\" at number 61. It praised the Gold Panda sample, saying that it \\"could even make Tumblr‚Äôs weird pop elite attempt a shimmy.\\" In its review of the album for the same magazine, Marc Hogan called the track \\"gorgeously bitter\\". The song was also said to be \\"vindictive and catchy\\" by AllMusic, who named it as a highlight of the album. Meanwhile, when reviewing True Romance, Art Ivan of Tiny Mix Tapes found the song to be \\"a relatively unremarkable, straight pop song that still pushes things along, especially after the self-sustaining 'Nuclear Seasons'.‚Äù When presenting the music video, Marc Hogan of Spin Magazine said that the new single \\"wonderfully emphasizes the pure-pop joy and street-cool swagger that lurks behind the hypnotic shadows on tracks by the likes of not only Panda, but also current Charli collaborator Clams Casino[...]\\" The track appeared in many year-end lists of the best songs of 2013. Spin Magazine included the single at number 31, comparing it to Charli's previous single \\"I Love It\\" as \\"subtler, sharper, sleeker [and] more vicious.\\" It was also ranked 33rd in similar lists by Consequence of Sound and 40th in the annual Village Voice's Pazz and Jop poll. Music video The video for \\"You (Ha Ha Ha)\\" was uploaded to her channel on YouTube on 10 January 2013. Pitchfork writer Carrie Battan said of the video that it \\"centers around a now very fashionable early-90s rave aesthetic and features lots of girls with platform shoes and candy-colored hair partying in a gun factory.\\" As of March 2019, the video has over 9,400,000 views. After the release of the video, Charli XCX shared a hand-written statement on Twitter defending her video and its firearm imagery, as it was released few weeks after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting: :\\"Myself, my friends + the director, Ryan Andrews shot the video in October, so I‚Äôve been waiting for a while to put it out, + now it‚Äôs out there.

It follows a southwest-to-northeast line, beginning at Westmoreland Circle in the south and ending at Oregon Avenue NW in the north. It is roughly in length. First proposed in 1893, it was constructed somewhat fitfully from about 1900 to 1931. Description Western Avenue passes through largely residential neighborhoods on its journey north until it reaches the retail-heavy Friendship Heights neighborhood, where it crosses Wisconsin Avenue NW. After a short distance north through more residential areas, it passes through Chevy Chase Circle, where it crosses Connecticut Avenue NW. Its remaining length is again residential, passing through Pinehurst Circle until it reached Oregon Avenue NW. For most of its length it is a two-lane street with curbside parking, although it widens to four lanes around the traffic-heavy Friendship Heights area. The street lies entirely within the District of Columbia and is itself not the boundary of the city, which \\"runs right through the front lawns of the houses on the Maryland side of Western Avenue.\\" John Kelly, \\"Clarifying the D.C.-Md. border,\\" Washington Post, September 15, 2012 Accessed 2013-09-23. History Originally, government officials did not foresee that the city of Washington would expand to fill the boundaries of the entire District of Columbia. The \\"Federal City\\", or City of Washington, originally lay within an area bounded by Boundary Street (northwest and northeast), 15th Street (east), East Capitol Street, the Anacostia River, the Potomac River, and Rock Creek.Hagner, Alexander. \\"Street Nomenclature of Washington City.\\" Records of the Columbia Historical Society. 7 (1904), pp. 237-261, 257; Hawkins, Don Alexander. \\"The Landscape of the Federal City: A 1792 Walking Tour.\\" Washington History. 3:1 (Spring/Summer 1991), p. 10-33, 16. \\"Boundary Street\\" was the original name for Florida Avenue, but the name was changed in 1890 as the city rapidly began expanding outward into the rural areas of what was then known as \\"Washington County\\".Williams, p. 9; Scott, p. 84. In January 1893, the Anthropological Society of Washington issued a report calling for a \\"grand avenue or boulevard to form the boundary of the District of Columbia on the three land sides\\".\\"Geographic Nomenclature of the District of Columbia: A Report.\\" American Anthropologist.

Accessed 2013-02-27. But 10 years later, in 1903, a real estate atlas of the area showed a \\"Columbia Boulevard\\" beginning just northeast of 48th Street NW and continuing northeastward along the D.C. border to approximately the nine-mile boundary stone (just short of Rock Creek itself). The street's name was \\"Columbia Boulevard\\" near the circle, but changed its name at about Chevy Chase Circle to \\"Boundary Avenue\\". Boundary Avenue resumed at the intersection of the D.C. border and what is now Parkside Drive NW, and continued uninterrupted to the North Corner Boundary Marker.Baist's Real Estate Atlas of Surveys of Washington, District of Columbia. Volume 3: West Washington and the County. Philadelphia: G.W. Baist, 1903, Plate 20, 22, and 23, accessed 2013-02-27. The existence of Boundary Avenue above Rock Creek appears unlikely, as there is no record of any road removal by the National Park Service. See: Bushong, William.

This road would have to cross Fenwick Branch, a tributary of Rock Creek. There is no record of a bridge over Fenwick Branch within the Rock Creek Park limits until 1926. See: Spratt, Zack. \\"Rock Creek's Bridges.\\" Records of the Columbia Historical Society. 53/56 (1953/1956), 101-134, 105. This street must have existed at least by early 1901, if not much earlier, as the Commissioners of the District of Columbia (the city's federally appointed government) ordered that Boundary Avenue's name be changed to \\"West Avenue\\" in August 1901.\\"Streets Named Anew.\\" Washington Post. August 15, 1901. Press reports made it clear, however, that Western Avenue did not exist along the entirety of its current full length and was not completely finished. In January 1905, local citizens asked that Western Avenue be created and macadamized from Westmoreland Circle to Chevy Chase Circle.\\"Hearing on Avenue Bill.\\" Washington Post. January 11, 1905. The United States Army Corps of Engineers, which had authority over public works in the city at the time, approved the request in August.\\"New Street Extensions.\\" Washington Post. August 19, 1905.

The Baist map continues to show a section of Western Avenue beginning at the border of Rock Creek Park, crossing Fenwick Branch, and connecting with Eastern Avenue NE at the northern tip of the District of Columbia. Grading had still not occurred all the way to Westmoreland Circle, and city officials asked that the Corps do so in October 1911.\\"Ask for Street Extension.\\" Washington Post. October 1, 1911. But the following year, Corps officials declined to condemn any more land between 41st Street NW south to the Receiving Reservoir (now known as Dalecarlia Reservoir) to complete the avenue.\\"Disapprove Street Opening.\\" Washington Post. December 17, 1912. By 1915, however, some extensions of Western Avenue had occurred.

Thus, only about 45 percent of the future avenue had been created. By 1918, portions of Western Avenue near Rock Creek Park were at least planned if not completed.

As more development occurred in the area, more segments of Western Avenue were finished. In May 1924, the Corps of Engineers announced that property owners along 75 percent of the Western Avenue route had willingly sold land for the street. The government had been forced to seek condemnation proceedings against the remaining landlords.\\"New Boulevard Nearer.\\" Washington Post. May 11, 1924.

Wolf-PAC argues that Congress is too corrupted by big money and special interests to adequately address campaign finance reform, citing sources ranging from personal experience to a well known Princeton study. The organization works nationwide with state legislators using the state initiated convention procedure in Article V of the Constitution to propose an amendment to fix the influence that big money and special interests have over the American government. Wolf-PAC asserts that applying for a convention will either directly result in the desired amendment or pressure Congress to act. Wolf-PAC was founded in October 2011 in response to the idea that big money interests had bought influence over American politics at the federal level and that this corrupt system had been entrenched by Supreme Court cases dating back decades that ruled many bipartisan campaign finance laws unconstitutional. The name was intended to be a strong response to the aggressive tactics of the special interests the group was fighting against, as explained by Wolf-PAC founder Cenk Uygur, \\"from now on, they're not coming for us, we're coming for them.\\" Wolf-PAC introduced its first convention call in Texas in 2013 and passed its first call in Vermont in 2014. , five states have passed Wolf-PAC's call for a convention to propose an amendment to reform the U.S. campaign finance system, and 24 more introduced the resolution for consideration in 2019. Wolf-PAC has an active chapter in every state in the U.S. and has a membership that includes more than 50,000 volunteer sign ups. The organization has four full-time staffers. Early history=Supreme Court cases= The catalyst behind much of the modern campaign finance reform effort is Citizens United v. FEC, which overturned the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) of 2003, commonly known as McCain-Feingold. Uygur, though, says he was motivated principally by the major precedents that lead to Citizens United, like Buckley v. Valeo (1976), which equated campaign spending with free speech and First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (1978), which allowed independent expenditures by corporations to influence elections. Wolf- PAC has also cited subsequent cases as further demonstrating the need for a Constitutional Amendment, such as American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock (2012) and McCutcheon v. FEC (2015). =Research into the Article V convention process= The inspiration for Wolf-PAC's plan comes from previous efforts to call for a limited Article V convention that ultimately pressured Congress to propose an Amendment to the U.S. Constitution themselves. The group frequently cites the Bill of Rights, which was proposed after New York and Virginia called for a convention and the Seventeenth Amendment, which was proposed after 29 states called for a convention for direct election of senators. Alt URL The Congressional Research Service refers to this as the \\"prodding effect.\\" In addition to three contemporary Congressional Research Service reports, Wolf-PAC also heavily relies on primary source reports from the Department of Justice and American Bar Association. These studies readily examined the Article V process as applied to the states, and found multiple, well-maintained safety nets to assure an amendment called by convention could stay focused and effective. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard professor and constitutional law scholar, provided input on the amendment process in the founding of Wolf-PAC. =Launch of Wolf-PAC= Uygur announced the formation and launch of Wolf-PAC on October 19, 2011, in New York City's Zuccotti Park in the midst of the Occupy Wall Street movement. He expressed that the frustration motivating the liberal Wall Street protest mirrored that which motivated the formation of the conservative Tea Party, saying \\"I think the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street have a lot of similarities. You know, on the fringes, and when you get to the issues they may have a lot of disagreements. I believe this on health care and I believe that on health care. But the core of both movements is, we're tired of our corrupt government.\\" Through Wolf- PAC, Uygur hoped to address what he believed to be the root-cause of this mutual anger: an errant campaign finance system. =Early organization= Following the announcement of its founding, the foundations for Wolf-PAC including its website and its messaging were laid out by a handful of volunteers. Among the first volunteers of Wolf-PAC was current National Director Michael Monetta, who signed up within hours of the announced launch. The first National Director, Christopher Campbell, was hired shortly after the official announcement. The unnamed organizer shown at 3:18 is Michael Monetta By 2013, a handful of states introduced resolutions for an Article V Convention to restore free and fair elections without being asked by Wolf-PAC, including Minnesota, Massachusetts, and California. Representative Burnam of Texas was the first to introduce Wolf-PAC's Free and Fair Elections resolution on February 21, 2013. That resolution included a \\"daisy chain,\\" listing other convention calls on the same subject matter in order to ensure there could be no question about which ones were intended to count as part of the same application.  Passed resolutions  Map showing states which have called for an Article V convention as advocated by Wolf PAC. As a national group, Wolf PAC is working in all 50 states and reports over 20,000 volunteers. Note that it is not uncommon for an introduced resolution to be left to a committee where it dies after the legislative session of that state ends without any voting or sufficient votes to move the motion forward (a death in committee). Such resolutions can simply be reintroduced in current legislative sessions until a vote is called. Only when bill(s) have passed in both legislative chambers would the state be listed as calling a limited convention of the states. =Vermont= On March 21, 2014, the Vermont Senate passed JRS 27, a Wolf PAC-backed resolution, in a bipartisan 25 to 2 vote. On May 2, 2014, the Vermont House passed the resolution by a vote of 95‚Äì43, making Vermont the first state in the nation to call for an Article V convention concerning campaign finance reform. The language of the resolution called for a convention \\"for the sole purpose of proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America that would limit the corrupting influence of money in our electoral process, including, inter alia, by overturning the Citizens United decision.\\" Sen Dick Sears, D-Bennington, was a key figure in passing the resolution. He received a call from a constituent and became convinced that the strategy made sense. \\"I think it's an important resolution,\\" Sears said. \\"Congress isn't going to act, and we've got to do something to get this country back under control.\\" When the resolution reached the House, an emotional plea from South Burlington farmer Benjamin Brown brought about a sense of urgency. \\"What am I going to tell my children, what am I going to be able to say to them about this democracy?\\" Brown asked the legislators. \\"Vermont has an opportunity to lead right now it's not left and right, it's an issue of democracy,\\" he said. Rep. Mike Yantachka, D-Charlotte, agreed. He described the resolution as, \\"an opportunity to kick-start a movement that I hope will spread throughout the country and let people become aware of the real problems we have with the influence of money on elections and on our public policy.\\"MORGAN TRUE, March 5, 2014, Brattleboro Reformer, Vermont first state to call for constitutional convention to get money out of politics, Accessed May 5, 2014, \\"...Vermont became the first state to call for a convention to amend the U.S. Constitution to reverse the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United decision ... Monetta is the organizing director for Wolf PAC... In contrast to these views, Senate Minority Leader Joe Benning, R-Caledonia, saw the resolution as a grave mistake. \\"I see it as an attack on free speech,\\" Benning said. \\"I did not want to give my vote to something that clearly restricts free speech, because I think the First Amendment is one of the most important amendments we have, if not the most important.\\" On May 15, 2014, following the passage of JRS 27, U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont scheduled a June 3 hearing for S.J Res 19, a proposed amendment by Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) to address the influence of money in US elections, in the Senate Judiciary committee. Senator Leahy cited his home state's application for a convention to propose an amendment as part of his motivation, stating: \\"It is time for Congress to follow the lead of the states and build support for amending the Constitution to ensure that all Americans can exercise their First Amendment rights‚Ä¶. Vermonters have been leading the nation on this issue, and many in our country took note that our Legislature was the first to call for a constitutional convention for the purpose of drafting a remedy.\\" \\"Not only have Vermonters urged me to advance a constitutional amendment in the Senate, but they have acted themselves on this vital issue by calling for a constitutional convention‚Ä¶. Vermont's call for a constitutional convention is a separate approach for amending the Constitution that can operate on a parallel track to the congressional approach that we are initiating today. It is my hope that the two efforts can work in tandem to create even more momentum on this critical issue.\\" =California= On March 20, 2012, resolution was introduced in the California State Assembly, but was voted down in the Judiciary Committee. On January 30, 2014, the California State Assembly became the second state lower chamber to pass a resolution calling for a constitutional convention. On June 23, 2014, California became the second state in the nation to pass a resolution. The language of the resolution called for a convention \\"for the sole purpose of proposing an amendment to the United States Constitution that would limit corporate personhood for purposes of campaign finance and political speech and would further declare that money does not constitute speech and may be legislatively limited.\\" The state Senate voted 23‚Äì11 to support the resolution. Assemblyman Mike Gatto, the author of the resolution, remarked, \\"I doubt our founding fathers had the free-speech rights of multinational and foreign corporations in mind when they drafted the First Amendment.\\" Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, D-Santa Barbara, recognized young people for their contribution to countering the Citizens United decision. \\"They have taken the lead in this effort,\\" she observed, \\"because they recognize that the future of democracy, that their futures, that the future of this nation...are very much at risk as a result of this decision. Money is not speech. Corporations are not people. And up until the Supreme Court decision that flipped that on its head, that was the standard in the United States of America.\\" High school teacher Alison Hartson served as the volunteer State Leader for California and would later become National Director of Wolf-PAC, before stepping down to run for United States Senate. She continues to work with the organization. =Illinois= On April 9, 2014, SJR 42 passed the Illinois Senate by a 37‚Äì15 vote. State Sen. Christine Radogno, R-Lemont, was the lone Republican state Senator to vote in favor of the resolution. On December 3, 2014, the Illinois House voted 74‚Äì40 in favor of the joint resolution, making Illinois the third state to pass such a resolution. The Illinois resolution called for a convention \\"in order to address concerns such as those raised by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and related cases and events, including those occurring long before or afterward, or for a substantially similar purpose, and desires that the convention should be so limited.\\" Prior to the House vote, Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig testified before a House committee, saying: \\"My ideal amendment is one that secures Congress the power to guarantee free and fair elections by making sure that we don't have a Congress that's dependent on raising millions...There are two things that have to change: the way we fund elections and the ability to eliminate entities like Super PACs from dominating the political arena.\\" John McGinnis, a Northwestern University professor of constitutional law, disagreed with his assessment. \\"I think it's a very bad idea,\\" he opined. \\"I think we should have more speech at the time of elections. This seems to me to make the United States system a less participatory system...I see this as an attempt by people like Professor Lessig and what I call the 'new class,' the media and academics, to restrict people who don't have opinions for a living from participating. If you look at the media and academics, they look a lot less diverse in their ideological views than rich people. Rich people are pretty divided between Republicans and Democrats.\\" =New Jersey= A resolution to call for a constitutional convention to overturn Citizens United was introduced on August 11, 2014. Testimony before the New Jersey Senate included speeches from Wolf PAC volunteers as well as an appearance from Americans for Prosperity. Wolf-PAC saw the attendance by the latter group as a sign of concern from moneyed interests at the progress that has been made to counter the undue influence of money in elections. On February 23, 2015, the New Jersey Assembly passed the resolution by a vote of 44‚Äì25, and New Jersey's became the fourth state legislature to adopt Wolf-PAC's amendment resolution. The resolution called for a convention for the purpose of \\"proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States that would limit the corrupting influence of money in our political system.\\" The resolution had previously been passed by the state Senate. \\"A constitutional convention is clearly needed to correct the disastrous impact of recent court decisions on the integrity of elections in New Jersey and throughout the nation,\\" declared Assemblyman Dan Benson, D-Hamilton Township. \\"Citizens United opened the door to unlimited spending by shadowy, well-funded groups with no transparency or accountability ‚Äì spending that drowns out the voice of the American voter and threatens the fundamental fairness of our democracy.\\" Benson found some agreement across the aisle as Assemblyman Declan O'Scanlon, R-Little Silver, supported certain campaign funding restrictions. \\"We restrict corporations but not unions. Perhaps a convention like this would come up with solutions,\\" O'Scanlon said. However, Assemblyman Michael Patrick Carroll, R-Morris Township, disagreed with the resolution. \\"America boosts a long and salutary tradition of robust forceful unrestrained political expression,\\" Carroll said. \\"The influence of money is grossly understated. It profoundly insults the American people to imply or insert that they are so stupid that they can't make informed political decision that they cannot assess the merits of political arguments before them.\\" =Rhode Island= Rhode Island adopted their resolution on June 17, 2016, the fifth state to do so. The resolution was introduced in the House by Representative Arthur Handy and in the Senate by Senator Joshua Miller. The language of the Rhode Island resolution called for a convention \\"in order to address concerns such as those raised by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and related cases and events, including those occurring long before or afterward, or for a substantially similar purpose, and desires that the convention should be so limited.\\" The resolution received a vote in the House on the second to last day of session and was adopted in the Senate on the final day. The Senators were so moved by the work of the dedicated volunteers that they took the time to give short speeches congratulating them for their work before the vote. While the Senators had instructed those watching that applause was forbidden in the gallery, after adopting the resolution unanimously in the Senate the Senators gave the Wolf-PAC volunteers a standing ovation.  \\"Runaway convention\\" theory, ongoing conflict with DNC and Common Cause  Because an Article V convention has never occurred (since historically, Congress has pre-emptively proposed the amendment itself on several occasions when the states have come close to calling for one), it is unclear how such a convention would function in practice. While the convention called for by Wolf-PAC is one that is limited in scope to the topic of campaign finance reform, there is disagreement over whether delegates to the convention are legally bound from going beyond the established topic. This ambiguity has led to concerns that an Article V convention could lead to a \\"runaway convention\\", in which rogue delegates might make proposals outside the permissible scope of the convention topic. Wolf-PAC has argued that even if an unintended runaway convention was to occur, it would not pose a threat to the Constitution because any amendment proposed by an Article V convention would still need to be ratified by a super-high majority (three-fourths) of the states. Other groups that have called for similar Article V conventions, such as U.S. Term Limits, are often faced with the idea of a runaway convention, and respond with the same argument. Cenk Uygur published a video on The Young Turk's YouTube channel on April 4, 2017, discussing Washington D.C.-based lobbying group Common Cause's efforts to lobby New Mexico's House of Representatives to not bring to a vote SJR12, which was passed in their upper chamber. In the video, Uygur outlines issues Wolf PAC has with Common Cause, such as using paid lobbyists to thwart efforts of Wolf-PAC volunteers, using an appearance as a progressive organization despite having centrist goals, opposing the use of an Article V convention to create an amendment, and their lobbyists' attempts to rescind the bill Wolf PAC helped to pass in Vermont. Uygur later published videos in May 2017 detailing claims that Democratic strategists at the national level have begun whisper campaigns in Hawaii and Maryland with lobbying groups such as Common Cause, which caused resolutions Wolf PAC supported in those states to be denied a vote, despite initially having heavy support.

Given the foundation of the university in the tradition of the Church of England, the chapel was intended to be an integral part of the campus.Heulin (1979), p. 1 This is reflected in its central location within the King's Building on the first floor above the Great Hall, accessible via a grand double staircase from the foyer. Although no pictures have survived, the original chapel was described as a low and broad room \\"fitted to the ecclesiological notions of George IV's reign.\\" However, by the mid-nineteenth century its style had fallen out of fashion and in 1859 a proposal by the college chaplain E. H. Plumptre that the original chapel should be reconstructed was approved by the college council, who agreed that its \\"meagreness and poverty\\" made it unworthy of King's. The college approached Sir George Gilbert Scott to make proposals. In his proposal of 22 December 1859, he suggested that, \\"There can be no doubt that, in a classic building, the best mode of giving ecclesiastical character is the adoption of the form and, in some degree, the character of an ancient basilica.\\" His proposals for a chapel modelled on the lines of a classical basilica were accepted and the reconstruction was completed in 1864 at a cost of just over ¬£7,000. = 19th and 20th century = Scott had to overcome several structural difficulties since the chapel was situated above the Great Hall in the 19th century. He used a lightweight construction system for the arcade and upper nave walls. In the 20th century, there were many developments that changed the design of the chapel. The original pitched roof designed by Scott was covered with canvas decorated in bays with large star motifs, but these were lost when the ceiling was substituted in the 1930s. The low level windows, which were embellished with stained glass, were damaged during the Second World War. The architect Stephen Dykes Bower was asked to produce proposals for the chapel in 1948 following war damage. Under his direction, the windows were glazed with tinted cathedral glass instead of stained glass. The arcade columns, original designs on the aisle and apse walls were repainted. = 21st century = It was desired by the chaplaincy team of the college to have a chapel that is \\"sensitive to the tradition and relevant to the contemporary culture\\". The chapel was planned to be restored and refurbished from 1996 but was not restored until 2001. Apse Apse roof, depicting Christ in Majesty surrounded by angels The semi-dome of the apse is a copy of one of Salviati's mosaics, depicting Christ in Majesty surrounded by angels. Either side of the arch are elaborately decorated vertical panels which include figures bearing scrolls inscribed with the motto of King's College, (With Holiness and Wisdom), and other Christian inscriptions. The spandrels of the arches on each side of the nave feature the painted heads Doctors of the Church, and four 16th- and 17th-century Anglican Divines. These appear to have been an afterthought, as they do not feature in the original Gilbert Scott drawings.Heulin (1979), p. 2 DeansOrganists The following is a list of organists of the chapel:Heulin (1979), p. 6 * 1835 - Henry Bevington * 1854 - William Henry Monk (Director of Choir from 1849) * 1889 - John Edward Wernham (joined the college staff in 1886) * 1916 - Vacancy (Organ played by students under supervision of Department of Theology). * 1937 - Robert Linton Shields (Officially appointed Lecturer in Music as were all subsequent organists until 1980) * 1941 - vacant * 1945 - Harold Last * 1953 - Ernest H.

History History of the park goes back to the Middle Ages. Positioned between the Sihl and Limmat rivers, it was originally used as a hunting and shooting ground in the 14th century, and by the end of the 18th century the park was also adorned with beautiful Baroque architecture.Platzpitz - City of Zurich official site (in German) During the 1980s, heroin users would frequently gather at the park, and attempts to disperse them merely resulted in them regrouping elsewhere. Thus in 1987 the authorities chose to allow illegal drug use and sales at the park, in an effort to contain Zurich's growing drug problem. Police were not allowed to enter the park or make arrests. Clean needles were given out to addicts as part of the Zurich Intervention Pilot Project, or ZIPP-AIDS program. However, lack of control over what went on in the park caused a multitude of problems. Drug dealers and users arrived from all over Europe, and crime became rampant as dealers fought for control and addicts (who numbered up to 1,000 ) stole to support their habit. The once-beautiful gardens had degraded into a mess of mud and used needles, and the emergency services were overwhelmed with the number of overdoses, which were almost nightly. Platzspitz, or Needle Park as it was then known, became a source of embarrassment to the Zurich municipal council and in 1992, police moved in to clear up the park.New York Times - Amid Growing Crime, Zurich Closes A Park It Reserved for Drug Addicts Today Platzspitz has been cleaned up and restored, and is presented by the authorities as a peaceful, family-friendly garden.

It is probably the world's second-oldest surviving steam engine. The engine was installed at Cannel Colliery at Fairbottom near Ashton-under-Lyne around 1760 or 1764. It became known locally as Fairbottom Bobs. The engine's origin is unclear. It was possibly first installed at Norbury Coal Works about 9 miles to the west from where the Manchester Mercury for 9 October 1764 carried an advertisement for a 'Fire Engine' for sale. Its cylinder dimensions matched the Fairbottom engine. The engine's design and construction have been described as \\"primitive\\". It had a power rating of 11 horsepower. Its cylinder has an bore and stroke, driving a water pump with a bore that could raise water from a depth of 240 ft at a rate of 14 strokes per minute. The timber beam consisted of single wooden king post with wrought iron straps and wooden arch heads at each end. Iron chains linked the beam to the piston rods. An auxiliary arch head drove the engine's air pump. The beam was supported on a pillar of dressed stone resembling a thick wall or narrow pyramid, rather than on the wall of an engine house, a feature found on other engines of this age but rare later. Although foundations and stone floors survive on its site, there is no evidence of an engine house or roof to protect the engine from the weather. As was common for mine drainage, pumping at one pit could drain water across a number of pits. The water produced was used to maintain water levels in the Ashton Canal by draining into the Fairbottom Branch Canal at Fennyfield Bridge, just south of the engine. In 1801 the canal company was approached to contribute to the costs of its refurbishment, work that may have been carried out by Bateman and Sherratt engine builders of Manchester. The original pit appears to have been worked out in the 1820s, although others nearby were working as 'Fairbottom Pits'. Draining the old mine workings and supplying water to the canal kept the engine working after the Cannel Colliery closed until the engine was abandoned in 1826 or 1827.  Preservation  Fairbottom Bobs is preserved at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. The engine and its site were considered antiquarian by the end of the 19th century. Photographs of the site taken in 1886 showed it in a reasonable state of preservation. When Henry Ford was collecting exhibits for his new museum in 1927 a major theme for the museum was 'Americana' but he also sought older industrial archaeological exhibits from Europe. His agent, Herbert F. Morton, found the engine although it had been derelict for a hundred years and was in poor condition. Its owner Lord Stamford gave the engine to be preserved in the museum. The engine and its masonry were dismantled and re-assembled in the museum. Its wooden beam was too rotten to be preserved and a replacement was made. Its wagon boiler was also acquired by the museum but the engine is now displayed with a haystack boiler from another engine, similar to one believed to have been used originally. Some features on the Fairbottom site remain in situ including the chimney base. Archaeological digs took place in 1982, 1990 & 2000 to investigate the remains.

GLFW stands for Graphics Library Framework. It provides programmers with the ability to create and manage windows and OpenGL contexts, as well as handle joystick, keyboard and mouse input. Software architecture GLFW is a small C library that allows the creation and management of windows with OpenGL contexts, making it also possible to use multiple monitors and video modes. It provides access to input from keyboard, mouse and joysticks. The API provides a thin, multi- platform abstraction layer, primarily for applications whose sole graphics output is through the OpenGL API. While GLFW is very useful when developing multi-platform OpenGL applications, single-platform developers can also benefit from avoiding having to deal with different platform-specific APIs. A possible reason that libraries like GLFW are needed is that OpenGL by itself does not provide any mechanisms for creating the necessary context, managing windows, user input, timing etc. There are several other libraries available for aiding OpenGL development. The most common ones are FreeGLUT (an Open Source implementation of GLUT) and SDL. However, FreeGLUT is mostly concerned with providing a stable clone of GLUT, while SDL is too large for some people and has never had OpenGL as its main focus. GLFW is predicated on the assumption that there is room for a lightweight, modern library for managing OpenGL contexts, windows and input. GLFW is by design not * a user interface library. It allows the programmer to create top-level windows with OpenGL contexts. No menus, no buttons. * a Windows-only library. Requests for features that cannot be portably implemented will be denied unless they are unobtrusive, like the Windows port looking for a GLFW_ICON resource at window creation. * a threading library. There are already good cross-platform threading libraries and threading has been added to both the C11 and C++11 standard libraries. * an image loading library. There are already good cross- platform image loading libraries. * capable of rendering text. There are already several libraries that render text with OpenGL and consistent cross- platform text rendering cannot depend on the platform‚Äôs text rendering facilities anyway. * capable of rendering anything at all.

It is administered according to the Sunni-Hanafi school of jurisprudence. It is part of a complex that houses a mausoleum, a cemetery, and a number of shops that are rented out to generate income for the running of the mosque. History In the early 80's, the old Mosque was torn down and re-built in the current form. The inauguration of the new mosque was held on Friday, 3 February 1989. Mosque Architecture The mosque follows the architecture of South Indian mosques that were built or re-built in the 20th century with some notable exceptions. Externally, the mosque is fronted by two minarets. Curiously there is no dome. To the right is the traditional pool used for Wudu and a side entrance to the graveyard. Internally, the mosque is two storeys high. The ground floor houses the inner prayer hall where the Congregational prayers are performed. It is surrounded by a cloister and an outer prayer hall where town meetings, religious discourses, wedding ceremonies, and dhikr gatherings are held. Another unique aspect of the mosque is the absence of a physical Minbar or pulpit. Instead, there is a hidden passageway from the Mihrab or prayer niche that leads to a balcony that extends out. The Khatib or prayer leader delivers the Khutba or sermon from here. The Mausoleum At the entrance of the mosque complex is the mausoleum of a celebrated Faqir, Sheikh Abdur Rahman Baksh (Arabic: ÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖŸÜ ÿ®ŸÉÿ¥ - Abdu-r Ra·∏•mƒÅn Baksh, Tamil: ‡ÆÆ‡Æ∏‡Øç‡Æ§‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Øç ‡Æö‡Ææ‡Æπ‡Æø‡Æ™‡Øç ‡Æµ‡Æ≤‡Æø‡ÆØ‡ØÅ‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Ææ - MastƒÅn ·π¢ƒÅ·∏•ib Waliyullah). His Urs or anniversary is celebrated with pomp and fanfare on the Islamic calendar date of 22 Rabi al-Awwal. His resting abode is taken as a source of immense blessings (Arabic: ÿ®ÿ±ŸÉÿ© - Barakah, Tamil: ‡Æ™‡Æ∞‡Æï‡Æ§‡Øç - Barakat) and where mercy (Arabic: ÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖÿ© - Rahmah, Tamil: ‡Æ∞‡Æπ‡Øç‡ÆÆ‡Æ§‡Øç - Rahmat) descends in abundance. Both Muslims and non-Muslims make vows (Arabic: ŸÜÿ∞ÿ± - nadhr, Tamil: ‡Æ®‡Øá‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æö‡Øç‡Æö‡Øà - Nerchchai) at his grave for conceiving children, success in business, education, and other worldly needs. The following anecdote, handed down from previous generations, is an example recounting his Karamat or miraculous exploits: During the re-development of the mosque in the 80's, plans were drawn to build a structure over the grave that linked to the adjacent Madrasa buildings. It came to a halt when a pious elder of the town had a dream in which Abdur Rahman Baksh admonished the villagers against building over his grave. Annual Mawlid Competition Between 1998 and 2001, the mosque hosted an annual Mawlid Recital Competition (Tamil: ‡ÆÆ‡ØÜ‡Æ≥‡Æ≤‡Æø‡Æ§‡ØÅ ‡Æ∑‡Æ∞‡ØÄ‡ÆÉ‡Æ™‡Øç ‡Æì‡Æ§‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Øã‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æø - Mawlid Shareef Othum Potti). It was held in the last weekend of the month of May to coincide with the school holidays. The competition drew young participants from neighbouring towns and villages who would recite the text known as \\"Subhana Mawlid\\" - a reverential text on the birth, life, and miracles of Prophet Muhammad. Prominent Tamil scholars were invited to deliver lectures. Gallery File:Prayer niche, muhyuddin andavar mosque.JPG|The inner prayer hall with the Mihrab or prayer niche.

East side of Detroit, bounded by Harper Avenue on the north, East Outer Drive on the west, Mack Avenue on the south, and Cadieux Road on the east. This neighborhood is full of charm. It is filled with unique homes that are full of character and distinctive brick work. Every home has unique solid architecture and was built with high-quality materials, which still today attracts residents who value the charm and character of these historic older homes. It was first developed in 1913 though most of the homes were built in the early 1930s through 1950. History=1800s= In 1800s, five ‚Äòribbon farms‚Äô extended from Harper to Detroit River In 1805, the territory of Michigan was created, with Detroit as the capital. Between 1808 and 1810, five ribbon farms were registered under the family names of Little, Rivard, Fournier and Tremble. These five farms were later subdivided into the area we now know as East English Village. In 1818, the farms became part of the new Hamtramck Township, and in 1848 the area was renamed Grosse Pointe Township. By the turn of the 20th century, the city boundaries of Detroit began to expand, and the area was transformed into an attractive residential community. =1910-20s= First subdivisions: from Grosse Pointe Manor to Scully's Voigt farmlands The first subdivision, once part of Moran Farms, was named Grosse Pointe Manor, was developed in 1913. This subdivision ran along Audubon, Whittier and Kensington streets between Mack and East Warren. Grosse Pointe Villa, another subdivision, was developed around 1915 and included the east side of Poupard (now called Yorkshire) from Mack to East Warren. Between 1926 and 1930, Yorkshire was developed between East Warren and Harper as Poupard Woodlands. Simultaneously, Bishop, between Mack and East Warren, was being developed as Poupard Estates. In 1924, the Eastern Heights Land Company began to develop land along both sides of Kensington between East Warren and Harper. Also in 1924, The Charles Dunn Trust, Paul Deronne and the Voigt family developed the Scully's Voigt farmlands on Harvard and Cadieux between Mack and Harper. Construction began to take off in 1928 By 1925, most of the area had been subdivided into residential parcels. The actual construction of the homes did not really begin to boom until 1928, with much of the building taking place in the early 1930s. The owners, not the developers, hired builders; this turned the new homeowners into designers and enabled them to custom order their homes. This accounts for the unique characteristics of each home. The people who came to build their homes in this area were mostly professionals. The area known as East English Village attracted police officers, civil servants, doctors, lawyers, businessmen - especially those from the auto industry. =1950s= In 1950, construction had ceased The number of families in the neighborhood settled to approximately 2100, and most homes only changed hands a few times.

Meetings are held monthly and community focusing on ways to maintain and improve the neighborhood. Monthly newsletters are passed out as well as a very active Facebook page and Neighborhood forum to keep everyone dialog open and everyone informed.

It was begun by several North Carolina investors, 4-6 individuals from each major North Carolina city. Together they purchased an initial 1,200 acres of rolling hills from 13 different land owners just south of the Village of Pinehurst and the notorious Pinehurst No. 2 golf course. Working with community planner William Byrd of Atlanta, Georgia, the group agreed on a master plan for the land they acquired, including a golf course, named Dogwood. The Cardinal Course would come later. Today, the club has a large membership base numbering close to 1,000 covering families across the state and around the world.

The conceptual master plan was approved by the board and was given permission to move to the next stage of development. The property was rezoned and the master plan was unanimously approved by the Pinehurst Village Council. After all barriers had been cleared, the board of directors voted to develop the site.
