Cellink was the first company to provide a standardized bio-ink product for sale over the internet. The company has ongoing collaborations with organizations including MedImmune, MIT and Takara Bio, and its printers are used for research at Harvard University, Merck, Novartis, the U.S. Army, Toyota, Johnson & Johnson and more. A stated goal of the company is to help address the existing global shortage of organs suitable for human transplantation. History Cellink was founded in 2016 by Erik Gatenholm, the company's chief executive, and Héctor Martinez. They developed and sold the world's first universally compatible bio-ink to simplify bioprinting for academics and pharmaceutical companies who were, at that time, mixing their own biomaterial in-house. The company released its first bioprinter to test the market in 2015, and continued designing additional bio-inks to support more specialized applications in bioprinting. Ten months after it was founded, Cellink was listed publicly on the Nasdaq exchange First North. At its IPO, shares were oversubscribed by 1070 percent. In 2017, the company was described as \\"a world leader in bioprinting\\". It established a United States headquarters in Boston the same year. The company's revenue totaled $4.88 million in 2018. As of February 2019, its products are used by more than 600 labs in more than 50 countries. Cellink acquired German biotechnology company Cytena in August 2019 for a purchase price of $33.8 million.  Products  The bio-ink produced by the company contains cellulose and alginate, locally sourced from trees in Sweden and seaweed from the Norwegian Sea, respectively. Cellink's bio-ink technology was developed at Chalmers University. , the company's bio-inks were priced in the range of US$9 and $299, while its bioprinters were priced in the US$10,000 to $40,000 range.

He is credited with creating the world's first universal bio-ink. Biography Gatenholm was raised mostly in Blacksburg, Virginia. He attended Blacksburg High School and studied Business Management at Virginia Tech University. He attended the Innovation and Industrial Management Master's program at the Gothenburg School of Business, Economics and Law, and received his Master's of Science in June 2016. Early work At age 18, Gatenholm started his first venture as a freshman at Virginia Tech. BC Genesis focused on developing surgical meshes for hernia repair and cartilage implants by commercializing Virginia Tech- owned intellectual property. Within three years of its founding, BC Genesis received two National Science Foundation grants for $600,000. The company also received a $700,000 grant from the Virginia Tobacco Indemnification and Community Revitalization Commission, and was slated to help revive Floyd County's economy through the introduction of more job opportunities in biotech. Gatenholm has had his own research published in line with his work. His abstract titled \\"Innovative bacterial nanocellulose medical devices: From incubator to human body\\" was published in 2013. Outside of the biotechnology sector, Gatenholm has also worked in music production. In 2014, Gatenholm wrote and produced \\"Finally\\" with vocalist Jalana. Gatenholm composed the track and played guitar for the recording, while Jalana contributed lyrics and vocals. The track was remixed several times, earning success across the electronic music scene and gaining radio airplay, chart positions and DJ support. Gatenholm was signed along with Jalana to Déepalma Records in 2015. Current work Gatenholm was introduced to 3D bioprinting in 2014. At that time, academics and pharmaceutical companies mixed their own bio-inks in- house, and Gatenholm recognized a gap in the market. He co-founded CELLINK in 2016 when he was 25 years old. CELLINK was listed on Nasdaq First North within ten months of its founding, and sales totaled $1 million in its first year.

In modern Russia the hairstyle is still widespread among girls and women, while the symbolism behind the Russian braid is no longer so strong in modern Russia. It also plays an important role in Russian folk dance and Russian folk song ensembles. In Rus it was uncommon for women to cut their hair, so they would grow it for a long period of time and braid their long hair. The Russian braid symbolized honor and pride and had several meanings in Old Russia. One large and long braid was worn by girls in active search for a groom, while two braids which were tied around the head meant the girl was in marriage. If a colourful ribbon was woven into a braid, it meant that the girl is for marriage, when two ribbons appeared, it meant that the official groom was found.

According to Heller, \\"It opened up a whole world of storytelling that we realized hadn't really been looked at before, which is the world before Batman -- the world of Gotham, young Bruce Wayne, and young James Gordon and the origin stories of the villains\\". In a September 2014 with Digital Spy, Heller said he was initially hesitant to do a superhero series because he did not know how to write about people with superpowers, adding \\"Human beings are diminished as soon as a superhero walks onto the screen. As soon as the superhero walks out of frame, you're waiting for them to come back.\\" But when Heller's son suggested that Gordon be the focus of the series, Heller developed the idea of Gordon investigating the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents. That idea \\"gave us a starting point and allowed us to tell the saga from a much earlier point than before\\". On September 24, 2013, Fox announced that it had bypassed the traditional pilot and placed an order for Gotham to be written by Heller, who was named as showrunner. Danny Cannon also worked as showrunner alongside Heller. Gotham received a series order from Fox on May 5, 2014, with the first season reported to consist of 16 episodes rather than the standard 13 or 22. On October 13, Fox ordered an additional six episodes for the show, bringing the first season order to a full 22 episodes. Fox's Chairman of Entertainment Kevin Reilly stated, \\"We were only contractually obligated to order 13, and we ordered 16, because we think that's the way that show, at least in its first iteration, will be very strong to arc to. Could we do more next season? We certainly could, but that's where we're starting with that one. That show is going to have a very strong, serialized element\\". Speaking of the project at the 2014 winter TCA press tour, Reilly described the series as \\"this operatic soap that has a slightly larger-than-life quality. This is not some adjunct companion series. This is the Batman franchise, just backing it up [in chronology]\\". He later added that the series is separate from any DC film universe.  Casting  In January 2014, rumors arose that Donal Logue would portray the series' version of Gordon. Logue denied these rumors, but was eventually cast as Gordon's partner Harvey Bullock. In February 2014, Ben McKenzie was cast as Gordon. McKenzie had previously shot a pilot with Heller for CBS titled The Advocates which was not picked up; this led to Heller writing his characterization of Gordon with McKenzie in mind. McKenzie described this version of Gordon as \\"a truly honest man. The last honest man in a city full of crooked people\\" and added, \\"He's not an anti-hero, he's a true hero – but he will have to compromise.\\" Casting Bruce Wayne was challenging in part because, as Heller put it \\"It's such an important casting and it would've been very dangerous to cast the wrong person\\", adding that the casting process for Wayne \\"took a lot of negotiation, a lot of back and forth so that everyone was happy and comfortable.\\" In early March 2014, David Mazouz was cast as Bruce Wayne while Camren Bicondova was cast as Selina Kyle. Others in the principal cast were Zabryna Guevara as Sarah Essen, Sean Pertwee as Alfred Pennyworth, Robin Lord Taylor as Oswald Cobblepot / Penguin, Erin Richards as Barbara Kean, Cory Michael Smith as Edward Nygma, Victoria Cartagena as Renee Montoya, Andrew Stewart-Jones as Crispus Allen, John Doman as Carmine Falcone, and Jada Pinkett Smith as Fish Mooney, an original creation for the series. Pinkett Smith drew inspiration from various different individuals for playing Mooney: the fictional character Norma Desmond from the 1950 film Sunset Boulevard; and Griselda Blanco, a real-life drug lord of the Medellín Cartel.  Filming  Production for the season began in New York City in March 2014, and ended a year later on the same month.  Release   Broadcast  The season was broadcast over two runs on Fox: the first 10 episodes aired from September to November 2014; and the other 12 episodes aired from February to May 2015. The season premiered on September 22, 2014, and concluded on May 4, 2015.  Home media  The first season was released on Blu-ray on September 8, 2015.  Reception   Ratings  Critical response The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the season a rating of 76% based on 91 reviews, with an average rating of 6.85/10. The site's consensus states, \\"High production values, a talented cast, and an appealingly stylized approach to the Batman mythos help Gotham overcome its occasionally familiar themes.\\" Another review aggregator Metacritic gives the season a score of 71 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". David Hinckley of New York Daily News praised the first episode for playing \\"like a 45-minute movie, with stunning visuals that never feel like a shrunken TV version of the Batman films against which it will inevitably be measured\\" and lauded Logue's Harvey Bullock as a scene-stealer. The San Jose Mercury News Chuck Barney called the pilot \\"a fun, dark, moody and well-paced first hour\\" and McKenzie's James Gordon a commanding lead, while saying Jada Pinkett Smith is \\"an absolute blast to watch.\\" Matt Brennan of Indiewire said that Gotham was \\"the perfect antidote to superhero fatigue\\", praising the \\"bright, pop-inflected aesthetic, with urban backdrops that appear as though cut out from the panels of a comic book.\\" Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly criticized the first half of season one along with the mid-season premiere. He found the personalities of the most characters \\"already nearly fully formed; all they can become is more or less than what they already are.\\" Jensen added that Gordon not being Gotham's redeemer hurt the premise of the show and heavily criticized what he saw as the under-use of Jada Pinkett Smith's character. In the end, he does not see Gotham \\"as a show for comic book fanboys\\" but rather as \\"a post-fanboy, or fanboy-irrelevant.\\" Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club lamented that \\"there have been dozens of interpretations of Batman and his city in the 75 years since their creation, and Gotham has trouble finding the right balance of influences\\".

Originally an infantry regiment, it was converted into artillery in 1861. Precursors The old county militia in Scotland was not re-established at the Restoration of 1660. After the Union in 1707, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the Parliament of Great Britain passed an Act in 1708 to re-arm the Scottish Militia. However, the Act was denied Royal assent because of fears that the new force would be disloyal (a Jacobite uprising in Scotland was expected to support the French invasion fleet that was then at sea). During the serious Jacobite rising of 1745, the government-supporting Major-General John Campbell of Mamore (later 4th Duke of Argyll) raised the irregular Campbell of Argyll Militia, which was present at the Battle of Falkirk Muir, the Skirmish of Keith, and the Battle of Culloden.Tomasson & Buist, pp. 99, 108, 118, 134, 152, 190–1. The Militia Act of 1757 passed during the Seven Years' War still did not apply to Scotland, but the Duke of Argyll was commissioned to raise the Argyle Fencibles (1759) for home defence. 'Fencibles' were soldiers recruited in the normal way under officers commissioned by the king, unlike militiamen who were raised by ballot and commanded by local officers appointed by the Lord-lieutenant. The Argyle Fencibles were disbanded in 1763, but fresh regiments were raised during the American War of Independence (the Argyle or Western Fencibles (1778)) and the French Revolutionary War (the Argyle Fencibles (1793), eventually of three battalions). Argyll & Bute Militia Fear of Jacobitism had been replaced by fear of Jacobinism by the 1790s, and the Militia Act of 1797 finally extended the county militia system to Scotland.Holmes, p. 97. The Argyllshire Militia was raised in 1798 with personnel from the disbanded 117th Regiment of Foot (originally raised on 22 August 1794 under the command of the Hon Frederick St John). The regiment was renamed the Argyll and Bute Militia in 1802, and the following year received the precedence of 43rd in the list of militia regiments.Frederick, pp. 982–5.Litchfield, pp. 44–7. The militia were disembodied at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, but the regiments remained in existence, theoretically being called out for occasional drills. The list of precedence was redrawn in 1833, when the Argyll & Bute Militia became 117th. In the 1840s its headquarters was listed as Campbeltown, and its Colonel since 1809 had been John Campbell, 7th Duke of Argyll; he was succeeded by John Campbell, 2nd Marquess of Breadalbane, the Lord Lieutenant of Argyllshire.Hart. The United Kingdom Militia was revived by the Militia Act of 1852, enacted during a period of international tension. As before, units were raised and administered on a county basis, and filled by voluntary enlistment (although conscription by means of the Militia Ballot might be used if the counties failed to meet their quotas). Training was for 56 days on enlistment, then for 21–28 days per year, during which the men received full army pay. Under the Act, Militia units could be embodied by Royal Proclamation for full-time home defence service in three circumstances:Litchfield, pp. 1–7.Dunlop, pp. 42–5.Grierson, pp. 27–8.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 91–2. * 1. 'Whenever a state of war exists between Her Majesty and any foreign power'. * 2. 'In all cases of invasion or upon imminent danger thereof'. * 3. 'In all cases of rebellion or insurrection'. Although many militia regiments were embodied during the Crimean War to release regular battalions for overseas service, the Argyll & Bute was not among them. However, in 1859 it gained the title of Argyll & Bute Rifles. Its uniform was red with black velvet facings. More officers began to be appointed to the regiment, including Colonel John Campbell, formerly of the 38th Foot, who was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant under the Marquess of Breadalbane's colonelcy. Argyll & Bute Artillery Militia ::Not to be confused with 1st Argyll and Bute Artillery Volunteers The 1852 Act introduced Artillery Militia units in addition to the traditional infantry regiments. Their role was to man coastal defences and fortifications, relieving the Royal Artillery (RA) for active service. In 1861 the Argyll and Bute Rifles was converted into the Argyll and Bute Artillery Militia (Rifles) (though the 'Rifles' subtitle was soon dropped). It had its HQ at Oban, moving back to Campbeltown in 1863. Smollett M. Eddington, a former Lieutenant in the 78th Highlanders, was appointed Lt-Col Commandant on 20 November 1861.Army List, various dates. Troops (including artillery) parading at Maryhill Barracks, Glasgow, in 1903. Following the Cardwell Reforms a mobilisation scheme began to appear in the Army List from December 1875. This assigned places in an order of battle of the 'Garrison Army' to Militia Artillery units: the Argyll & Bute Artillery's war station was in the Tilbury Division of the Thames and Medway Defences. The Artillery Militia was reorganised into 11 divisions of garrison artillery in 1882, and the Argyll & Bute became the 6th Brigade, Scottish Division, RA. When the Scottish Division was abolished in 1889 the title was altered to Argyll and Bute Artillery (Southern Division) RA.Spiers, Late Victorian Army, pp. 63–4. Colonel J. Younger, who had served with the Royal Horse Artillery in the 2nd Anglo-Afghan War, was appointed Lt-Col Commandant on 2 December 1893. West of Scotland Artillery By 1895 it had become difficult to obtain recruits in the sparsely populated counties of Argyll and Bute, so the recruiting area was expanded to include Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire, and on 7 November 1895 royal approval was given for the unit's title to be changed to The West of Scotland Artillery. Its HQ moved from Campbeltown to Maryhill Barracks, Glasgow, in 1897. The unit was embodied for home defence from 8 May to 3 October 1900 during the Second Boer War. Francis A. Walker-Jones was appointed Lt-Col on 28 November 1900. From 1902 most units of the Militia artillery formally became part of the Royal Garrison Artillery, the unit taking the title of West of Scotland RGA (M). Disbandment After the Boer War, the future of the Militia was called into question. There were moves to reform all the Auxiliary Forces (Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers) to take their place in the six Army corps proposed by St John Brodrick as Secretary of State for War. For this, some batteries of Militia Artillery were to be converted to field artillery. However, little of Brodrick's scheme was carried out.Dunlop, pp. 131–40, 158-62.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 243–2, 254. Under the more sweeping Haldane Reforms of 1908, the Militia was replaced by the Special Reserve, a semi-professional force whose role was to provide reinforcement drafts for Regular units serving overseas in wartime. Although the West of Scotland RGA (M) transferred to the Special Reserve Royal Field Artillery on 12 July 1908 (taking the title West of Scotland Royal Field Reserve Artillery), it was disbanded in March 1909.Dunlop, pp. 270–2.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 275–7.Litchfield, Appendix 8.

Music became more complicated as embellishments and variations were added, along with influences from secular music. Although vernacular leisen and vernacular or mixed-language Carol (music) were sung in the Middle Ages, more vernacular hymnody emerged during the Protestant Reformation, although ecclesiastical Latin continued to be used after the Reformation. Since then, developments have shifted between isorhythmic, homorhythmic, and more rounded musical forms with some lilting. Theological underpinnings influenced the narrative point of view used, with Pietism especially encouraging the use of the first person singular. In the last several centuries, many songs from Evangelicalism have been translated from English into German.  New Testament  The sources of Christian music are the Jewish tradition of psalm singing, and the music of Hellenistic late antiquity. Paul the Apostle mentions psalms, hymns and sacred songs (Ephesians 5:19 and Colossians 3:16) but only in connection with the Christian behavior of the Christians, not with regard to worship music. Among the earliest surviving Christian songs include those described in the New Testament traditional canticles as the Benedictus, the Magnificat and the Nunc dimittis.Gloria van Donge: Hymnology in the New Testament. Christ songs are hymns to Jesus of Nazareth as the Christ.Cf. about Martin Hengel: Das Christuslied im frühesten Gottesdienst' Published by St. Ottilien: 1987, S. 357–404.' Literary criticism makes it possible, on the basis of stylistic criteria, to elaborate Christ songs and liturgically used portions in the New Testament.Klaus Berger expresses himself critically: Form history of the New Testament.Criticism of Ralph Brucker: 'Christ hymns' or 'epideiktische passages'? In letters and texts some songs are quoted and mentioned, e.g. For example, the hymn to Christ in Philippians 2:6-11. It can be assumed that such texts were commonly known at the time and served to remind readers that its content was already general belief. Also, such texts may have been used for singing praises by the congregation. Criteria: * Often, phrases such as \\"we know...\\" introduce the beginning * The persons change in connection. While the text itself is formulated as a form of address or speaks of the author in the \\"first person\\", it suddenly changes to the third person, and then afterwards continues in the original language again. * In some places it is also explicitly pointed to a received tradition (what we have \\"received\\")  Early church  Probably the earliest evidence for liturgical hymns outside of the New Testament can be found in the letters of Ignatius of Antioch in his Epistle to the Ephesians (7, 2 and 19, 2f).Reinhard Deichgräber: Gotteshymnus und Christushymnus in der frühen Christenheit. Göttingen, 1967 In the fourth century, leading church fathers gave great prominence to parish singing: in the East, there were transformations of the liturgy under Basil of Caesarea. In the West, Bishop Ambrose of Milan made liturgical and musical reforms and the introduction of Ambrosian hymns still sung today. Ambrose introduced antiphons and composed new O Antiphons. The emergence of the Te Deum falls into this time. As part of the rapid spread of Christianity, the individual archbishoprics and monasteries gained relative independence from Rome. Thus, in addition to the Ambrosian various other liturgies such as the Roman Rite, the Mozarabic Rite, the Gallican Rite, the Celtic Rite, the Byzantine Rite, the East and West Syriac Rites and the Alexandrian Rite. Many of these liturgies developed their own singing traditions, some of which are still alive today. In the East, Romanos the Melodist was the most prominent hymnwriter of kontakion and the most prominent in the general akathist tradition, while Ephrem the Syrian was a notable Syriac hymnodist. An early musical notation was used in the Byzantine Empire for hymn writing.  Middle Ages   Gregorian chant  plainchants, written in adiastematic neumes At the end of the 6th century, Pope Gregory I carried out a reform of the Roman liturgy. Presumably in the context of these reforms began over several hundred years continued order, collection and standardization of the melodies and texts used in the liturgy. The songs were compulsory as Gregorian chant for the Roman church and largely replaced local vocal styles. In the style of the Gregorian chant emerged many new compositions that were increasingly melismatic. Their texts came from the Ordinary and the Proprium Missae, from antiphons for the worship service, and pieces from the Liturgy of the Hours.  Trope  In the Carolingian period, the officially sanctioned chorales developed various additions and modifications called tropes. They developed by the insertion or addition of new melismas or textual melody sections onto the existing tunes.  Sequence  The Rex caeli sequence from the Bamberg Manuscript of the treatise Musica enchiriadis, (2nd half of the 9th century, Germany) With the writing of the Alleluia final melismas ( classical sequence ), the history of the sequence begins around 850. Until the 12th century, the rhyme sequence, which is independent of the alleluia, emerges with the rhymes and rhythms. It leads to the large-scale stop rhythms of the 13th century (significant authors being Thomas of Celano and Thomas Aquinas). Rhyme sequences have the developed structure with multiple tropes, are metrically ordered, and rhyming. They were very popular in the late Middle Ages; there are about 5,000 rhyme sequences known. Although many were authored anonymously, notable sequence writers include Notker the Stammerer, Fulbert of Chartres, Hermann of Reichenau, and Adam of Saint Victor.  Leise, carols, and vernacular hymnody  The oldest known manuscript of a leise, \\"Unsar trothîn hât farsalt,\\" from the Petruslied The first evidence of vernacular hymns from the Middle Ages comes from the leisen. The oldest known leise dates to c. 860. They were vernacular language (Germanic or Scandinavian) responses by the congregation to sung elements of the Latin Mass, especially sequences sung on feast days and also used during processionals and on pilgrimages. Leisen often consist of single stanzas which ending in some form of the Kyrie eleison. Sometimes more than one stanza was used. As they were sung in the vernacular by the congregation, they were a precursor of Reformation-era church music. With all the musical wealth of the Gregorian chant, a community participation in the liturgical song was at best tolerated. The more casual vernacular songs are termed spiritual songs and the more formal ones are called hymns. They were used at high festivals, processions or spiritual games. Also, in the context of the Christmas games, carols using folk tunes or mixed-language reworking of Latin hymns and sequences like \\"In dulci jubilo\\" and the Quempas carol were sung.Attached: Historical Explanations and Directories - Overview of the History of Protestant Church Music; in Karl Gerok and Hans-Arnold Metzger (ed. Musically, these hymns move between Gregorian chant and folk song (three-tone melody, three-bar), so that sometimes they should be considered spiritual folk songs rather than hymns or church music properly speaking. Besides the vernacular songs based on ecclesiastical sources, the first uses of counterpoint were created, an example of the transmission of the development of music from secular songs into sacred music. Most of the time the melody was taken over and the text was reworked or rewritten. Another ninth century development was the rhythmical office, and it was around this time in the East that idiomelon (a type of sticheron) began to be written down with musical notation.  Reformation   Pre-Reformation  A depiction of Saint Cecilia playing a portative organ (cropped from the Bartholomäusaltar), painted around 1505 to 1510. The bellows can be seen to the right of the pipes. Some churches by this time had pipe organs, but these were expensive. Other churches used a portative organ, or no organ at all. The Hungarian duda, a traditional bagpipe, was also used. In the pre-Reformation period began to compile vernacular hymns in hymnals. One of the first hymnals appeared in 1501 with the Bohemian Brethren. It contained not only translations of Latin songs and contrafacts of Czech folk songs but also newly written songs. Even shortly before Luther's day people began to print hymnals. Since then, the history of the hymn has been closely linked to the history of hymnals.  Martin Luther and his environment  Among the Protestant Reformers, Martin Luther in particular attributed great importance to the vernacular hymn. He aimed at various effects of singing hymns together in vernacular language: * The songs promoted the spread of biblical content and reformatory ideas. * Catechetical songs could be instructive and treat specific theological themes such as creed or sacraments. * Formulated as a hymn that, with the help of a memorable melody, could easily be memorized, content was easier to memorize. * Singing together represented common ground and formed a community. * German songs enabled the hitherto essentially passive community to actively participate in the service.Attached: Historical Explanations and Directories - Overview of the History of Protestant Church Music ; in Karl Gerok and Hans-Arnold Metzger (ed. * The spiritual effect of music was described by Luther as medicine against evil and despondency. The title page to the First Lutheran hymnal, Wittenberg, 1523/24 Luther wrote over 30 hymns, including church year songs like \\"Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her\\" (From Heaven Above to Earth I Come)\\", catechism songs like \\"Mensch, willst du leben seliglich\\" (That Man a Godly Life Might Live)\\" and psalm songs like \\"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\\" (A Mighty Fortress Is Our God), as well as table songs in place of spoken prayers, songs for domestic use (morning blessing and evening blessings ) and liturgical songs. Many of these songs are in the second person plural and strengthen the early Reformation community. Some of his hymns, such as \\"Gott sei gelobet und gebenedeiet\\" (\\"O Lord, We Praise Thee\\"), \\"Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist\\" (\\"We Now Implore God the Holy Ghost\\"), \\"Christ ist erstanden\\" (\\"Christ the Lord is Risen Again\\"), and \\"Mitten wir im Leben sind\\" (\\"In Midst of Earthly Life\\") were based on a medieval leise, which Luther reworked and expanded. Luther also adopted several Gregorian chants and gave them new German texts. With new melodies the singularity always stood in the foreground; often the melodies move in familiar formulas - artistic originality of the melody was of little importance. New melodies were mostly written in collaboration with Johann Walter. Luther also asked other co-workers for support in creating new hymns. The songs of Luther and his environment were printed on leaflets. They spread widely and quickly became popular. They formed a pillar of the worship orders: In Lutheran worship, the hymn is an active participation of the church and also may correspond to the sermon as in the hymn of the day.  Reformed Church  1539 Psalter, published in Strasburg when Calvin was a minister there. Calvin's psalters were called \\"Genevan\\" due to later editions after Calvin moved to Geneva. John Calvin rejected all traditions that he did not see justified in the Bible. Unlike Luther, he was initially dismissive of church music. In Calvinist liturgies, the spoken word had priority. Although being very musical, Zwingli rejected music in worship for a long time. In the Reformed communities of Zurich, there were no songs in his time. Instrumental music was also excluded. Calvin, who took over the leadership of the Reformed Church after Zwingli's death, had encountered psalm singing in Strasbourg. He put communal singing again under strict musical and lyrical conditions, now called exclusive psalmody: * Only psalm texts were allowed to be sung. Versified psalms had to lean closely on the biblical text. * The singing had to be unanimous. * The tunes were not allowed to exceed the size of an octave. * Melismas were not allowed. * Only two basic values were allowed for the rhythm (one beat and two beats, quarter note and half note in today's notation). Rhythmic reassurance at the end of lines was desired. * Every line had to be paused. In this framework, a series of psalm songs emerged, with simple melodies that usually avoided jumps (example: get up in your power, God ). The central hymnbook of the Reformed Church was the Genevan Psalter, whose final (French) edition appeared in 1562. After Calvin's death, the four-part ballad was allowed, and with the simple four-part choral movements by Claude Goudimel, the Geneva Psalter reached a wide spread in the Reformed churches. Sigmund Hemmel set to music in the Württemberg Reformation, first around 1560 the entire Psalter for four voices in German psalm seals of various authors. The translation of Ambrosius Lobwasser soon became for over two hundred years the authoritative hymnbook of the Reformed communities in Germany. Hymn boards were used to help people keep track of which page to use in the hymnal, with the earliest documentation of them coming from 1550 in Geneva.  Anabaptists  Even Thomas Müntzer, who had introduced a reformatory German-language liturgy before Luther, wrote new hymns. Müntzer relied mainly on well-known Gregorian melodies, which he translated into German. Some of his songs, such as his translation of the Latin Conditor alme siderum can be found today in both Catholic and Protestant hymnals. In the context of the Reformation Baptist movement, new hymns were created. Particularly noteworthy is the first printed in 1564 Anabaptist hymn book Ausbund, which was used until the 19th century in southern German Mennonites and even today in the Amish in North America. The core of the hymn book was 51 songs whose authorship is unknown save that they were all written between 1535 and 1540 by Baptists in the dungeon of the Veste Oberhaus castle. They were mostly sung to folk melodies. Also popular was Das schön Gesangbüchlein from 1565, which contained 122 songs. Known Anabaptist songwriters include Felix Manz, one of the co-founders of the first Baptist church in 1525, as well as Michael Sattler, Hans Hut, Leonhard Schiemer and George Blaurock. Some churches of Anabaptist heritage today still practice the lining out of hymns. OHM - Darstellung Stadt Passau 4 Oberhaus.jpg|14th century painting of the Veste Oberhaus castle Veste_Oberhaus_1.jpg|Veste Oberhaus today Gesangbuch der Täufer Ausbund.jpgAusbund title page  Lutheran Orthodoxy and the Counter-Reformation  The time after the death of Luther ( 1546 ) was characterized by a period of theological controversies which were resolved in the 1577 Formula of Concord. This reconsolidation of theology was also reflected in the hymn texts. In addition to a regulation of figural music, the Council of Trent (1545-1563) also gave instructions for the Gregorian chant. Thus, only four of the sequences of the late Middle Ages were admitted in the official Roman liturgy. The Counter-Reformation also recognized the importance of the vernacular hymn. Catholic hymnbooks such as that of Nikolaus Beuttner (Graz, 1602) - a collection of mainly pre-Reformation religious folk songs and pilgrimage - and David Gregor Corner (Nuremberg, 1625) are early examples of the work of Catholic, Jesuit educated scholars in Reformation regions and the use of the Hymn as an instrument of re-catholization. In particular, the hymnal by Beuttner included the hymn \\"Unser lieben Frauen Traum\\" that is still played today. The 17th century brought a new vivacity and a new level of German poetry, which also included the hymn. Martin Opitz set up laws for German poetry in his Buch von der Deutschen Poeterey in 1624, which were widely adopted by German speaking hymn writers during following hundred years: * strict attention to metering, taking into account the natural word accent, * Prohibition of unclean rhymes, * Prohibition of word shortening and contractions, * Exclusion of foreign words. One important themes in hymns at the time of the Thirty Years' War was the juxtaposition of transience and eternity. Numerous passion, death, crucifixion and death songs were created which are still in use today. In contrast to earlier songs, the emphasis is not on the retelling of biblical content or the teaching of teachings, but on subjective considerations. For example, the hymn may discuss the passion or human life in general. The second person plural perspective of the Reformation shifts into a first person perspective. Some poets wrote edifying literature or were influenced by Christian mysticism. During this time, the regal organ began to replace the portative organ for use in worship. Organs were used to find pitch earlier on and as improved organs became available they were used to accompany hymns as well. Still, organ use varied by location and could be controversial. An important hymnal of this time was Praxis pietatis melica. The outstanding hymn writer of the time is Paul Gerhardt (1607-1676). His songs, to a large extent devotional in character, are still sung today in the services of various denominations and have been translated into numerous languages. In particular, his translation of \\"O Sacred Head, Now Wounded\\" made him the first Protestant to be included in a Catholic hymnal. Next to Paul Gerhardt are Johann Heermann (1585-1647), Martin Rinckart (1586-1649) who wrote \\"Nun danket alle Gott\\", Johann Rist (1607-1667), Paul Fleming (1609-1640) and Georg Neumark (1621-1681), who wrote \\"Wer nur den lieben Gott läßt walten.\\" In the musical field, with the transition to the baroque, the church modes are increasingly taking a back seat. The municipality song begins to assume a chordal accompaniment and becomes the basso song can. Thus new, freer melodic twists in the context of the major-minor tonality are possible. Other new elements included derivative harmonization, change notes, and leittöne. Scope and vocal demand of the songs grow, the distinction of the church song against the (spiritual) solo song blurs. There is a rich production of new song tunes. Gaudete.jpg|The first page of \\"Gaudete\\" (Latin for “rejoice”), a sacred Christmas carol published in Piae Cantiones (1582).

Pietism  From about 1670, Pietism became the dominant flow of German-language hymn literature. Pietism began as an intra-church reform movement, which wanted to break the rationalization of theology, perceived as paralyzed ( from the head to the heart ) and opposed it to a practice of faith based on personal conversion and emotional piety. Philipp Spener published his 1675 Pia desideria. After official rejection, Pietism quickly found its place in private homes, where the pietistic hymn was of central importance. The new songs were mostly subjective in emphasis, characterized by linguistic images in which descriptions of personal feelings stood foremost and in front of clear theological expression. Expressions of love from the believing soul to her bridegroom or the Lamb Jesus Christ, exaggerated expressions of feeling underlined by interjections such as \\"Oh\\" and the rejection of the world as a \\"vale of tears\\" were familiar contents. In addition, militant-missionary songs were created, which called for a new, conscious conversion. On the whole the literary quality sank as eventually these songs all started to sound the same. The most productive poet of pietistic hymns was Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf; he wrote about 3000 songs. The Reformed Joachim Neander (\\"Lobe den Herren, den mächtigen König der Ehren\\") and the Reformed mystic Gerhard Tersteegen (\\"Ich bete an die Macht der Liebe\\") wrote many hymns that are still popular today. The most important hymn book of Pietism was the Freylinghausen hymnal published in Halle in 1704, which contained about 1,500 songs in two volumes. Pietism was of great importance to hymn writing until the end of the eighteenth century. Musically, in the high and late Baroque many valuable, heartfelt hymn tunes were composed. The three-quarter clock gained in importance. At the same time stereotypical, undemanding melodies were created which seem overly utilitarian. The combined relationship between the text and tune of the hymn lost importance as melodies were increasingly used several times for different texts or texts associated with other melodies. As a result, the overall fit between text and tune could not be as precise. During this time, people started smoothing out the strictly metered rhythmic hymn tunes to produce to isorhythmic versions. These hymns had uniform note lengths.  Rationalism  From about 1730, the Age of Enlightenment, which understood critical reason as the supreme principle and rejected every belief in revelation and miracles, became decisive for the theology and practice of the official churches in German - speaking countries. The rationalism presented Biblical teachings often behind the rational interpretations back, and in the Protestant Enlightenment theology, reason finally was regarded as the highest judge in matters of faith. Central contents, such as the Lutheran doctrine of justification, were called into question. The liturgy was considered irrational, especially in the Protestant churches, which was accompanied by a decline of church music. The passage of the liturgy was filled by the sermon, according to the pedagogical concerns of the Enlightenment understood as a guide to a virtuous life. Core values such as tolerance, freedom of conscience and charity were central themes. God was portrayed as the loving Father and initial Creator whose world is now moving according to their own laws; Christ has been reduced to a role as a wise virtue teacher. The hymn should lead to such sermons during worship or underline their contents. So many existing songs were no longer acceptable due to their textual content and were revised according to rationalistic standards of value, sometimes profoundly changed. In addition, numerous new creations, mostly of a very instructive character, whose contents corresponded to the sermons. In front of the textual content, the poetic content became irrelevant - the songs contained only a few pictures and looked very sober. As of 2004 only some of these rationalistic church lyrics are sung in Germany, including the poetry of the Enlightenment theologian Christian Fürchtegott Gellert (1715-1769). The best known of his hymns is \\"Die Ehre Gottes aus der Natur.\\" The musical arrangement of the hymns also lost much importance. The number of popular melodies to which new and old texts were sung sank rapidly. These tunes were mostly Isorhythmically reshaped and sung by the community in increasingly long-stretched tones. The songs were interrupted by organ interludes at the end of the choral line. The design of new hymn tunes was no longer understood as artistically demanding; Thus, the newly created melodies have no rhythmic variety, and they often lack melodic momentum. Partly new melodies are in musical proximity to the classical music, for example with Franz Anton Hoffmeister (1754-1812), in his \\"Zu lernen bleibt noch unsern Seelen viel.\\" In rationalism appeared a number of new hymn books, for example, the Cramersches Gesangbuch. Due to the low number of melodies used, hymnbooks were now usually published without music. Matthias Jorissen's Neue Bereimung der Psalmen, published in 1798, replaced the psalm settings of Ambrosius Lobwasser in the German-speaking Reformed churches.  Mediating between Pietism and Rationalism  Some German-speaking hymn writers of the 18th and early 19th centuries attempted to mediate between the polarization of pietism and mysticism on the one hand and rationalism on the other. These include Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock (1724-1803), who wrote \\"Die ihr Christi Jünger seid\\" and \\"Herr, du wollst uns vorbereiten\\" and Matthias Claudius, writer of the poem \\"Wir pflügen und wir streuen\\" which was translated as the Thanksgiving hymn \\"We Plough the Fields and Scatter.\\" His popular poetry expressed a simple Biblical faith that was deeply rooted in God. Also during this time, some laity saved and used old hymnals from the orthodox period.  19th century   Text development  The development of the hymn text in the 19th century is characterized by counter-movements against rationalism. The determining currents include various revival movements and their revival theology and German Romanticism. Neo-Lutheranism and Confessional Lutheranism also influenced the hymn texts of the 19th century. Danish revivalist N. F. S. Grundtvig wrote or translated about 1,500 hymns, including \\"God's Word Is Our Great Heritage\\".  German revival movement  Today lyrics from the 19th century are to a great extent derived from Protestant theologians or clerics from the context of various German revivalist movements. These include the contributions of hymn writers Friedrich August Tholuck (1799-1877) who wrote \\"Das sei alle meine Tage\\", Philipp Spitta (1801-1859) who wrote \\"Bei dir, Jesus, will ich bleiben,\\" and the pastor's wife Marie Schmalenbach (1835-1924) who wrote \\"Brich herein, süßer Schein.\\" In addition, melodies were written by Michael Haydn, Johannes Kuhlo, Andreas Sulger, and Johann Georg Christian Störl. Christian Gottlob Barth (1799-1862) and Albert Knapp (1798-1864) were notable Wuerttemberg pietist writers. A Reformed hymn writer was Friedrich Adolf Krummacher (1767-1845).  Occasional works and other poets  Some outstanding German literary figures and publicists of the 19th century have written individual sacred texts, which represent only a small part of a much larger work. The songs of Ernst Moritz Arndt (1769-1860), Friedrich Rückert (1788-1866), and Eleonore Princess of Reuss (1835-1903) are examples.  Song melodies  New lyrics of the 19th century were often sung on choral melodies, which were already known to Germans, such as on the tune to \\"Wake, Awake, for Night Is Flying.\\" New song melodies of the 19th century come from * Hans Georg Nägeli (1773–1836) (\\"Lobt froh den Herrn\\") * Karl Friedrich Schulz (1784–1850) (Danket dem Herrn\\") * César Malan (1787–1864) (Harre, meine Seele\\", text by Johann Friedrich Räder) * Gottlob Siegert (1789–1868) (\\"Du lieber, heil'ger, frommer Christ\\") * Friedrich Silcher (1789–1860) (\\"So nimm denn meine Hände\\") * Franz Xaver Gruber (1787–1863) (\\"Stille Nacht\\") * Karl Friedrich Ellwanger (1796–1856) (\\"Ich will dich immer treuer lieben\\") * Julius Karl Hermann Grobe (1807–1877) (\\"Mit dem Herrn fang alles an\\") * Friedrich August Schulz (1810–1880) (\\"Wie ein Hirt, sein Volk zu weiden\\") * Friedrich Wilhelm Stade (1817–1902) (\\"Ach komm, füll unsre Seelen ganz\\") * Karl Kuhlo (1818–1909) (\\"Brich herein, süßer Schein\\", text by Marie Schmalenbach, \\"Sei uns tausendmal willkommen,\\" \\"Sieh, ich breite voll Verlangen\\") * Franz Abt (1819–1885) (\\"Freut euch, ihr Christen\\") * Jakob Heinrich Lützel (1823–1899) (\\"Zwei Hände wollen heute sich\\") * Karl Voigtländer (1827–1858) (\\"Vor meines Herzens König\\", \\"Laßt mich gehn\\") * John Baccus van Dykes (1832–1876) (\\"Weiß ich den Weg auch nicht\\") * Mina Koch (1845–1924) (\\"Stern, auf den ich schaue\\") * Friedrich Linde (1864–1933) (\\"Wann schlägt die Stunde\\") * Fritz Liebich (1873–1958) (\\"Reicht euch die Hände\\")  Translations from English into German  Organist at St. Sebaldus Church, Nuremberg, 2014 In addition more songs have been translated into German from English, especially gospel songs from the American revival movement and from Baptist or Methodist hymn writers. Hymn translators have often written their own lyrics. Translated lyrics inspired German-speaking authors to stylistically similar re-creations. German-speaking Baptists contributed to the spread of gospel songs in Europe. Important translators of hymns into German were: * Erhard Friedrich Wunderlich (1830-1895) (translated \\"Näher mein Gott zu dir\\" after \\"Nearer, my God, to Thee\\" by Sarah Flower Adams) * Ernst Heinrich Gebhardt (1832-1899) (translated \\"Herr hier bring ich mein alles\\" for a text by Mary Dagworthy James, \\"Herrliches, liebliches Zion\\" after a text by William Orcutt Cushing, \\"Ich brauch dich alle Zeit\\" after \\"I Need Thee Every Hour\\" by Annie Hawks, \\"Welch ein Freund ist unser Jesus\\" according to \\"What a Friend We Have in Jesus\\" by Joseph Medlicott Scriven ), also rewrote many songs and also composed melodies inspired by the gospel songs (\\"Herr dir bring ich mein alles\\", \\"Lasst die Herzen immer fröhlich\\") * Theodor Kübler (1832-1905), translated many English language revival songs by Philip Paul Bliss (\\"Zu des Heilands Füßen\\"), Horatius Bonar (\\"Frisch von dem Thron des Lammes\\") and Horatio Spafford (\\"Wenn Friede mit Gott\\"), also wrote his own songs (\\"Mir ward in bangen Sorgen ein Trostquell aufgetan\\") * Dora Rappard (1842-1923) (Translated from English, also composed and composed songs of her own like \\"Es harrt die Braut so lange schon\\") * Johanna Meyer (1851-1921) translated many English lyrics, for example by Edmond Louis Budry, Frances Ridley Havergal * Heinrich Rickers (1863-1928) (translated \\"Blessed Knowledge\\" into \\"Blessed Assurance\\" by Fanny Crosby) Baptist and Methodist hymn writers influential in German hymnody include Philip Bickel (1829-1914) (\\"Reicht euch die Hände, die Stunde zerrinnen,\\" melody by Fritz Liebig) and Hans Jakob Breiter (1845-1893) (\\"Daheim, o welch ein schönes Wort\\" and \\"Eine Botschaft voll Erbarmen\\").  Restoration of Gregorian chant   20th century  In the 20th century, Jochen Klepper and Dietrich Bonhoeffer shared their experiences of intellectual resistance to fascism. At the turn of the millennium, new sacred songs in the style of praise and worship have gained popularity.  Notes   References  Literature  * Albrecht, Christoph: Einführung in die Hymnologie.

Sasanian reinforcements failed to arrive in time and Petra fell after a lengthy siege. Its fortifications were also dismantled to ensure that this strategic stronghold was never going to be used by the Sasanians again. Background After the failure of Dagisthaeus in Petra against the Sasanians, Justinian I replaced him by Bessas as the magister militum per Armeniam, a decision that was criticized by the Byzantines due to the latter's old age and \\"inglorious\\" record during the sack of Rome in 546. Siege The ruins of Petra The Byzantines under Bessas, allied with Sabirs, numbering 6,000 in total, started a siege against Petra in 550. The Sasanian garrison, numbering 2,600, was reportedly \\"brave and resolute\\", lengthening the siege more than a year. The Sasanians used fire pots containing sulfur and bitumen. Mihr-Mihroe and his army of cavalry and eight elephants were on their way to yet again relieve the siege on Petra, but he was too late this time. Bessas finally managed to capture Petra in spring of 551. According to Procopius, he personally attacked the walls in an act of courage despite his old age. A small remaining Sasanian force in the acropolis refused his offer of surrender, and were burned alive there. A large amount of Sasanian supplies and equipment were captured, showing that the Sasanians intended to maintain the city in their hands. Bessas then dismantled the city walls, as ordered by Emperor Justinian I. Aftermath After Petra's fall, Mihr-Mihroe directed his force against the Byzantine forts in the area, capturing Sarapanis and Scanda. Allied with 4,000 Sabir Huns, he tried to capture the major stronghold of Archaeopolis, but, although the Dailamite fighters and the war elephants were tactically effective, the assault was eventually unsuccessful, as many of his forces died due to lack of supplies.

S. lanata is a fruit bearing tree that flowers in May. It can grow in loamy, sandy and clay soils. S. lanata can grow in complete sunlight or semi-shaded areas. It can withstand high wind speeds, but not much of other harsh conditions. The plant is sometimes grown as an ornamental plant in stone gardens, parks and yards.  Fruit  The fruit of the S. lanata has a tropical taste to it and grows in bunches. The fruit are pretty small. They are usually 1 to 3 centimeters in diameter. The seeds of this fruit contain trace amounts of hydrogen cyanide. This is not much of a problem because there is only a very small amount in the seeds. There are no known medicinal properties of the S. lanata and its fruit.  Distribution  S. lanata plants are found in the northern hemisphere. They grow in cooler areas.

It closed in 1864 due to a fall in student recruitment at the university. It was housed in an 18th century building on Palace Green which still carries its name. History  Edward Bradley  The building  Archdeacon's Inn was built around 1700, as a city residence for the Archdeacon of Northumberland, who administered the Northern part of the Diocese of Durham (which in 1882 would become the Diocese of Newcastle). In 1833, the building was given to the University of Durham as the home of University College and the residence of the university's first students. The first students took residence in Michaelmas Term 1833, under the supervision of the Bursar. A hall was created on the ground floor of the house, with student rooms above and below. The building subsequently became known as \\"University House\\". In 1837, Durham Castle was granted to the University and became the primary home of University College, with University House being retained as additional accommodation for the college.  Foundation of Bishop Cosin's Hall  In 1846, David Melville opened Bishop Hatfield's Hall, initiating the pioneering practice of letting rooms furnished and serving food communally at a fixed price. This was intended to make university attendance far more accessible to students of limited means, compared to University College and the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, where students were expected to furnish their own rooms and to engage servants to prepare their food. The high level of applications for admission to Hatfield Hall led the university to decide to establish a second hall to operate on the same basis, and in October 1851 Bishop Cosin's Hall was opened. Its name was in honour of John Cosin, Bishop of Durham 1660–72, and it is recorded as having used his heraldry. University House was transferred from University College to the new college as its home. The founding principal was Revd John Pedder, a Durham graduate who had previously been bursar at University College. In 1854 Pedder moved to become principal at Bishop Hatfield's Hall, and his place was taken by 28-year-old Revd James John Hornby, a fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford and a noted rower. From 1859, Hornby was also vice-master of University College.  Closure  A collapse in student numbers in the late 1850s and 1860s led to financial difficulties for the university. In 1860, Hornby wrote to Henry Montagu Villiers, the newly-appointed Bishop of Durham, requesting his aid in obtaining a royal commission to address the university's difficulties. The bishop replied expressing sympathy, but saying that he could not make any definite pledge of assistance. The commission took place in 1861-2 and made extensive recommendations, but did not have enough immediate effect to save Bishop Cosin's Hall, which was merged into University College at the start of Michaelmas Term 1864 due to falling student numbers.Whiting, C.E. (1932). The University of Durham. London: Sheldon Press. The students in residence were transferred partly to University College and partly to Bishop Hatfield's Hall, while Hornby returned to Brasenose, and would later become headmaster of Eton College from 1868 to 1884. The building has retained the name \\"Cosin's Hall\\".

She is a software engineer turned entrepreneur. She has been featured on the Europe's and World's Top 50 Women in Tech 2018 by Forbes lists. She has also been selected in Drapers 30 Under 30 and Forbes European list in the \\"Consumer Technology\\" category 2016.  Education  She graduated in Computer Science from the University of Bristol in 2009. Before graduating, she won the New Enterprise Competition at the university.  Career  After graduating, she worked as a project manager at a cyber-security firm while working in parallel on developing Snap Tech, a visual search engine (a technology that teaches computer how to see), and later turned it into Snap Fashion, an app and a website. She kept on working as a project manager until 2012 when she quit to take her business, Snap Fashion, live. Snap Fashion is an app and website that allows shoppers to find the clothes they like based on a picture, taken with a smartphone or from a magazine. The app searches for it, for matching outfit and compare prices from the database of retailers. In 2019, the database already counted with more than 110 retailers. On the other hand, the Snap Fashion InStore tool aimed at taking the visual search concept into the fitting rooms of High Street stores. The app would provide consumer advice regarding fashion, clothing and clothing accessories by asking a set of questions to someone trying clothes in the fitting room. From graduation, 2009, until 2012, she struggled to find attention and funding. Although fashion magazines liked it, most male-centric tech publication did not show interest. Jenny said “Technology wise, it was hard to get noticed, probably because we are a female-based product”. It changed when she won BIG, the British Innovation Gateway Award, an annual contest organized by CISCO offering money prize and marketing, public relations and legal support in addition to a year mentorship. In 2016, she was awarded a £1 million contract under Innovate UK's re-imagining the High Street' SBRI (Small Business Research Initiative) programme to create Snap Fashion InStore and raised £2 million in the company's Series A round of financing. Snap Fashion was Time Inc.’s first venture capital investment outside of the US, which is something Jenny Griffiths is very proud of. The app went on to win multiple awards or be in the final rounds of prestigious competitions such as * Winner, Re-imagining the High St - SBRI & TSB Funding Competition, 2014 * Winner, UK Mobile & App Design Awards - SBRI & TSB Funding Competition, 2014 * Creative Entrepreneur of the Year 2013 - British Council & The Guardian, 2013 * 23rd Most Influential Woman in UK IT 2013 - Computer Weekly, 2013 * Winner - Young Guns 5 to Watch - Young Guns / Growing Business, 2013 * Future 50 Entrepreneur - Ernst&Young; * Winner - Cisco British Innovation Gateway Awards - Cisco, 2012 * Winner - Decoded Fashion, 2012 - Decoded Fashion * Winner - Future 50 Competition - Red Bull and Real Business Magazine, 2011 * Winner - Tech City Launchpad Competition - Technology Strategy Board, 2011 * Winner - New Enterprise Competition - University of Bristol, 2009 Jenny Griffiths has been called an ambassador for women in tech and she truly thinks women who want to go into the tech industry, or just young people hoping to set up a business, need to see successful entrepreneurs who can also speak honestly about what it takes to set up a business.

Drinking Water Protection Zone is an official designation in the Canadian province of Ontario for areas that feed a well or municipal water supply. Road signs identify a “Drinking Water Protection Zone” with a graphic of a water glass. These signs are a standardized sign used across the province to indicate areas where a spill of toxic liquids including oil could impact a source of water for a municipal drinking water system. The signs are part of a large effort in Ontario known as Drinking Water Source Protection. There are approximately 800 signs installed across the province.  Criteria for location of road signs  The road signs indicate intake protection zones and wellhead protection areas around the municipal drinking water systems where a spill could be a significant drinking water threat. These zones were determined by calculating how quickly surface water and groundwater move toward municipal intakes and wells.  Purpose of the signs  The primary purpose of the signs is to remind first responders the locations where a spill could impact a municipal drinking water source. In the event of a spill in the drinking water protection zones it is important to notify the appropriate authorities including the Ontario government's Spills Action Centre and the operators of the municipal drinking systems that a spill has occurred. It may be necessary for the operator to shut down the system so that contaminants do not enter the system. A secondary purpose is to raise public awareness of the Source Protection Program. Many people do not know or consider where their water comes from and that human activities on the land can negatively impact the quality of the drinking water. It is therefore a key component of the overall education and outreach efforts of the Source Protection Committees across the province.

She was best known for producing, writing, and starring in her own revue, The Mollie Williams Show. Mollie Williams in 1916 Early life Mollie Hersh was born on March 18, 1884, in Manhattan, New York City. She was one of four children born to Adolph Hersh and Henrietta (Miers) Hersh. Both Adolph and Henrietta descended from German Jewish immigrants and the family lived in East Harlem. Career In 1905, Hersh appeared on stage at Miner's Bowery Theatre (originators of “get the hook”) using the name Mollie Williams. Williams was subsequently signed as a chorus girl in Al Reeve's Big Beauty Show on the Eastern Burlesque Wheel. In 1907, while performing in the chorus of The Behman Show, Williams persuaded the producer to stage her impersonation of Anna Held. Williams' imitation of Held was a hit, one that led to principal roles in shows produced by Jack Singer and Robert Manchester. During this time, Williams was known for her wisecracking comedy and risqué dramatic scenes, such as the Dance L’Enticement. With support from producer Max Spiegel, Williams became head of her own burlesque company in 1912. As director and star of The Mollie Williams Show, she succeeded in creating a “snappy musical show [that] when in perfect running order ought to be ranking right up among leaders of the Eastern Wheel.” The Mollie Williams Show featured a host of the Columbia Wheel's most talented comedians, soubrettes, and chorus girls. Williams herself appeared during the second act. She sang, danced, joked, and starred in dramatic playlets that she wrote. Williams kept the Dance L'Enticement in the show, but instead of performing it herself she gave it to the male comedians and played it for laughs. Citing Williams’ star power, Variety’s burlesque critic wrote, “burlesque boasts very few women of the Mollie Williams type. The lack of them is a prevailing weakness with most of the wheel shows...Mollie is a whole show in herself.” Williams began producing her own shows with her own company during the 1915–1916 season of The Mollie Williams Show. It was around this time that she first performed her best known acts, namely a letter carrier ragtime number and a fashion show “for the ladies.” Williams frequently touted her appeal with women. Early in her career, she told reporters that she tested new burlesque bits on her sisters. Later, Williams admitted that she would listen closely to women in the audience and rewrite scenes until they laughed. As a producer, Williams honed her image as a sympathetic boss, casting herself as a friend to the chorus girls because she had once been one herself. The Mollie Williams Show was a major financial success for the Columbia Wheel. Williams’ box office returns were second only to Jean Bedini, Columbia's top- performing male producer and performer. Postal Salary Readjustment Bill The 1923–1924 season of The Mollie Williams Show smashed house records for ticket sales in major cities along the Columbia Wheel route. The show's success that year was due to Williams' public support for Senate Bill 1898, the Postal Salary Readjustment Bill. On the advice of the assistant superintendent of the Brooklyn Post Office, Williams used her popular letter carrier dance number to champion improved wages for postal workers. She went so far as to meet in Washington with the bill's sponsor, Pennsylvania Congressman Melville Clyde Kelly. Postal workers in numerous cities organized parades and parties in Williams’ honor. They bought tickets to The Mollie Williams Show for themselves and their families. They \\"made it their business to mention that they had seen Miss Williams' show when delivering letters to households and that the show was a good one.\\" Personal life In 1901, Williams married Albert Thomas Thetford, an insurance agent from Brooklyn. Two years later they had a son, Edwin Thetford, who was Williams’ only child. Edwin attended the New York Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb. He died in 1941. In 1946, Williams married Hugh Dewart, President of Mohican Stores, Inc. Throughout her life, Williams dedicated herself to causes. In 1914, she turned down a leading role in Maurice Jacob's The Cherry Blossoms when the two failed to agree on a fair salary. Variety reported, “Miss Williams’ insistence upon a certain figure for her services has caused her to reject many offers that would have been decidedly alluring to almost any principal woman in burlesque.” During that same year, she sued a motion picture company for royalties after they staged and filmed a traffic stop to catch her off guard. As a producer, Williams staged overtly political material. For example, Williams' Wilson Show campaigned for the reelection of Woodrow Wilson during the Presidential Election of 1916. Williams was an active member of the Actors Fund of America. Mollie Williams died in New York on January 5, 1954. After a funeral service in University Chapel, she was buried next to her son, Edwin Thetford, at the Linden Hill Jewish Cemetery in Ridgewood, New York.

It derives from the traditional Shetland Pony of the Scottish Shetland Isles, but is principally influenced by the taller and more elegant American Shetland Pony.  History  From about 1965 breeders in Germany began to selectively breed the traditional Shetland Pony with the taller and more athletic American Shetland Pony, with the aim of creating a more elegant pony better suited to use for riding and driving. The 1961 American champion stallion Jiggs was imported, together with several mares. In the 1990s the Shetland Pony Stud-Book Society declined to register any pony with American bloodlines; the name \\"Deutsche Shetland Partbred\\" was proposed for these ponies, but some breeders did not accept it. They formed their own breed society, and the Deutsches Classic-Pony was officially recognised as a German breed in 2001. In 2007 the conservation status of the breed was listed by the FAO as \\"endangered\\". In 2017 there were 58 stallions and 337 breeding mares; the conservation status was listed by the as \\"not endangered\\".

It is native to shallow waters around Australia and in the South China Sea where it lives in a cavity it creates among seagrass roots and in empty oyster shells. Description The body of this peanut worm is divided into an unsegmented, bulbous trunk and a narrower, anterior section, called the \\"introvert\\". The tip of the introvert bears an elaborate \\"crown\\" of tentacles. The body wall is smooth and pale grey. When the worm is contracted, the body wall is slippery, possibly lubricated by secretions from glandular cells in the dermis and epidermis. Distribution Themiste cymodoceae is native to Australia where it inhabits the subtidal zone as well as the South China Sea. Ecology Themiste cymodoceae is unusual among peanut worms in that it lives among the tangled root masses of Amphibolis, a seagrass found in the shallow subtidal zone, and sometimes among the roots of Zostera. The worm gradually excavates a chamber with compacted walls in which it lives permanently, protruding its introvert to feed. It also lives in empty oyster shells. Unlike most peanut worms, which are deposit feeders, T. cymodoceae is a filter feeder, expanding its elaborate tentacular- crown to feed on floating particles such as detritus, faecal material, bacteria, algae and small invertebrates. T. cymodoceae is a tough and hardy species and has been used in research. The large surface area of the tentacles is probably used as a respiratory surface as it is in the related Themiste hennahi. T. cymodoceae seems capable of living for prolonged periods without oxygen, remaining alive for several days in boiled distilled water from which oxygen was excluded, although after this time, the oxygen stored in its blood cells was becoming depleted; it even survived in paraffin oil.

She was much loved by the theatre-going public, even when she was in a bad play: > \\"Personally, I appreciate this excellent actress, and for good reason. I do > not know of an equal in her role.

Biography After education at King's College School, Arthur Whitfield began his study medicine in 1887 at King's College Hospital and qualified from there LRCP MRCS in 1891 and graduated MB (Lond.) in 1892. He held successively several house appointments, including the Sambrooke Medical Registrarship, at King's College Hospital. In 1893 he qualified MRCP and graduated MD. From 1893 to 1896 he pursued postgraduate study at clinics in Vienna and Berlin. He was appointed in 1896 assistant physician to the West London Hospital and then at the Royal Northern Hospital. At King's College Hospital he was appointed in 1896 assistant physician, with charge of the skin department, and in 1906 full physician and professor of dermatology. There he was also dean of the medical school from 1904 to 1905, and during WWI he was a general physician in charge of outpatients. Whitfield held additional appointments as professor of dermatology at the Royal Army Medical College and dermatologist to St Dustan's. Whitfield's A Handbook of Skin Diseases and their Treatment (1907) had a revised second edition in 1921. A third edition was completed by Edmund Harold Molesworth, his Australian ex- pupil. Whitfield contributed articles on skin diseases to Encyclopædia Medica and to Allbutt's A System of Medicine, as well as numerous papers on skin diseases to medical journals. Whitfield was elected FRCP in 1905. He was the Lumleian Lecturer in 1921. He was president of the British Association of Dermatologists in 1926–1927. He was elected a corresponding member of the Société Française de Dermatologie.

The crew of the ATR 42 regional turboprop lost control of the aircraft's pitch and were both killed in the accident. The accident was investigated by the Brazilian Air Force's Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center ( (CENIPA)), with a final report issued in March 2007. Investigators concluded that the most likely cause of the accident was a pitch trim control system failure. Accident The flight took off from Sao Paulo at 04:52 local time and at 05:12:30 the crew asked for permission the climb to flight level (FL) 160. At 05:13:18 the co-pilot commented \\"Damn, it's the wiring harness.\\" The meaning of this statement remains undetermined. At 05:16:03 the aircraft was cleared to climb to FL180. At 05:29:14 the pilot informed the co-pilot he was going to change his clothes and removed himself for his cockpit seat. At 05:37:32 the \\"event\\" button located on the center console was pushed. Five seconds later the autopilot disengaged and the pitch trim control system began moving the trim tabs to a nose down attitude. As the airliner began descending, at 05:37:38 and 05:37:46 the pilot asked the co- pilot what was happening, and he responded that he did not know. Eight seconds later at 05:37:54 the co-pilot exclaimed that the pitch trim control system was running the trim nose down, then the sound of a seat belt buckling was recorded indicating the pilot had returned to his seat. Between 05:37:40 and 05:37:46 one of the crew members attempted to arrest the descent by pulling back on the control column. At 05:37:55 the pilot told the co-pilot to \\"Pull the trim\\" for the first time, meaning pull the circuit breaker (CB) that powers the pitch trim system. This CB is located in a panel behind the co- pilot and is not reachable by the pilot. The co-pilot did not initially understand the pilot's request and the pilot repeated it several times as the pitch trim continued to trim down, eventually reaching and staying at its full down stop of five degrees. At 05:38:05 the co-pilot stated \\"I pulled, I pulled\\" and a CB was deactivated. Flight 5561 was now at 16,000 feet and descending and had accelerated from its cruising speed of 180kn to 260kn. At 05:38:07 the over speed alarm sounded indicating the aircraft had exceeded the maximum operating limit speed (Vmo) and the crew reduced power from the cruise setting to 10%. From 05:38:29 until 05:38:49 the pilot requested of the co- pilot to pull the trim as he continued to pull the control column. The CVR recorded sounds of the aircraft continuing to accelerate, then at 05:39:10 the recording ended. The aircraft collided with the ground in a 30 degrees left bank angle, pitched down approximately 45 degrees at . The aircraft was completely destroyed and both crew members perished. Aircraft The aircraft was a 16-year-old ATR 42-300 twin turboprop aircraft with two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW120 engines. The manufacture serial number was 026 and it was registered PT-MTS. The aircraft had accumulated a total of 33,371 hours of flying time and had undergone 22,922 takeoff/landing cycles. Investigation On March 30, 2007 CENIPA released its final report on the accidents cause. At take off the aircraft had a gross take-off weight of 16,649 kg including kg 4,720 kg of cargo, 51 kg less than the maximum takeoff weight. The center of gravity was within allowable limits and weather was found not to have been a factor in the accident. Investigators determined from conversation on the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) that the pilot never left the cockpit area, but the fact that he left his seat and that communication between the crew was poor during the accident sequence cost the crew time to search for a solution and may have been a factor in the crash. The crew was not trained for a \\"runaway trim\\" scenario and no procedure for dealing with this were found in the manuals written by the aircraft manufacturer. This may have been a factor in the cause of the accident. The activation of the event button was most likely inadvertent because no abnormalities were found on the FDR and neither pilot mentioned pushing it. The stand by trim switch is located close to the event button and it is possible that it too was activated without the crews knowledge causing the autopilot to disengage. Activation of the stand by trim switch is not one of the parameters recorded by the FDR. Examination of the ATR 42's history shows several reports of trim control concerns that the Federal Aviation Administration issued Airworthiness Directive(s) (AD) for. An incident in 2001 led the Civil Aviation of France to issue an AD for ATR 42 type aircraft as well. The investigating bureau stated in part that problems involving system relays, switches, wires and connectors was \\"considered the most likely to have occurred, giving rise to the firing of the elevator compensator (pitch trim system)\\". Also stated in the report was that the \\"systems (pitch trim) normal and reserve (stand by) were not independent and the system had low error tolerance\\".

He was regarded as a prophet by some Catholics. He wrote in Ottoman Turkish a discourse on the rules of the Jelveti Sufi order, to which he belonged. He also wrote letters in which he criticized various kinds of wrongdoing that he regarded as widespread in the Ottoman Empire. His letters contain mystical-looking expressions that are difficult to understand. He is reputed to have predicted the defeat of Ottomans at the Battle of Vienna in 1683 and the subsequent loss of their territories north of the river Sava. According to a local Catholic source, an Ottoman soldier killed Gaibi in Stara Gradiška, at the left bank of the Sava, after he refused to escape with other Muslims across the river before the advancing Habsburg army; they captured Stara Gradiška in 1688. In 1954, his turbe was transferred across the Sava, to the town of Gradiška in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Life Very little is known about the life of Mustafa Gaibi. He was born around the turn of the 17th century, possibly in the Sanjak of Klis, a western part of the Eyalet of Bosnia, in the Ottoman Empire. He joined the Jelveti order of the mystical form of Islam known as Sufism, and he became a Sufi sheikh, i.e., the spiritual master of a group of dervishes. His sobriquet is derived from the Arabic adjective ghayb, meaning \\"hidden\\" or \\"mysterious\\"; he is referred to in Ottoman Turkish as Mustafā Efendi Ġā’ibī (). His sheikh was Mahmud Hudayi, who was a famous Sufi writer and the re-organizer of the Jelveti order. Hudayi was based in the Üsküdar district of Istanbul, where he died in 1628. Gaibi corresponded with men of high rank, criticizing various kinds of wrongdoing, such as violence, licentiousness, false piety, corruption and bribery, which he saw as widespread in the Ottoman Empire. In one of his letters, he signed himself as el-faqīr Ġā’ibī ser-i haydūdān-i Kūprez, meaning \\"Fakir (or poor) Gaibi, the leader of the hajduks from Kupres\\". This is quite unexpected for a dervish, as hajduks were mostly Christian brigands who defied Ottoman rule in the Balkans. There are records of some Muslim hajduks, but Gaibi's signature was probably a symbolic protest against wrongdoings by the ruling class. He had a son, who was also a dervish. A chronicle written in Latin by a Catholic priest in 1838, titled Liber memorabilium parochiae Vetero-Gradiscanae (Book of Remembrance of the Stara Gradiška Parish), contains a section titled \\"De sepulcro magni prophetae Gaibia\\", or \\"About the Grave of the Great Prophet Gaibia\\". According to this source, Gaibi lived in the fortress of Stara Gradiška when the Great Turkish War broke out in 1683. Located at the left bank of the Sava in the region of Slavonia, this fortress and the settlement within it were part of the town of Gradiška, which extended on both sides of the river. Gradiška was taken by the Ottomans in 1535, as part of their northward expansion into the lands of the Kingdom of Hungary after the Battle of Mohács. The conquest of Slavonia was completed by 1559, and Ottoman culture and Islam spread into this region, along with the influx of Muslim population from Bosnia. The presence of dervishes is well attested in Slavonia. Gaibi is the best known among the dervishes who lived in Slavonia. Liber, however, proposes that he might have been a Christian. It states that he made the sign of the cross on the doors of some houses during a plague epidemic, and that those households were spared from the disease. In 1683, the Grand Vizier Kara Mustafa Pasha led the Ottoman army to conquer Vienna. According to Liber, he sent a messenger to Gaibi to ask him how it would turn out. Gaibi predicted a bad outcome for the Ottomans and great losses of their troops, to whom he also spoke in that sense as they passed through Gradiška. After the defeat at Vienna, Kara Mustafa Pasha asked Gaibi again a similar question. Gaibi responded with the short statement, Sava međa i moja leđa, meaning \\"Sava border and my back\\" in Serbo-Croatian. The Austrian army took the Stara Gradiška fortress in 1688, and the Ottomans recaptured it in 1690, only to lose it finally in 1691. According to Liber, its Muslim inhabitants escaped across the Sava, but Gaibi wanted to stay there. Enraged by this, an Ottoman soldier killed Gaibi with an axe. The Austrians found his body and buried it at the river bank near a gate of the fortress. In the Treaty of Karlowitz, signed in 1699, the Sava was confirmed as a new border between the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires. Turbe After the peace was established, Muslims from neighbouring Bosnia and other parts of the Ottoman Empire began visiting and praying at Gaibi's grave. In Islamic tradition, such ritual visitations are based on the belief in \\"the workings of divine grace through specific saintly individuals for whom death has brought higher levels of spiritual authority and capacity for intercession thanks to their deeds and virtues in life\\". Leaving Gaibi's grave, the pilgrims would take some earth from it and keep it as a source of beneficial power. According to Liber, Muslims began venerating Gaibi after they realized that his prophecies had come true: they were defeated at Vienna with heavy losses, and the Sava became a border, while a mark of this border was Gaibi's back, i.e., his body buried at the river bank. In a legend collected in Gradiška and recorded in 1936 in the Serbian newspaper Politika, Gaibi is represented as a cephalophore walking on the surface of the river with his severed head under his arm. It was initially rather complicated for Muslims to visit Gaibi's grave, as persons entering Habsburg lands from the Ottoman Empire had to spend some time in quarantine first. Many Muslims thus prayed in Gradiška at the right bank of the Sava, opposite the grave. In the mid-18th century, Muslims requested of Habsburg authorities to transfer Gaibi's remains to Gradiška, also known then by its Turkish name Berbir. They were denied, but the authorities allowed for pilgrims to visit the grave without quarantine and constructed a picket fence around it. A plan of the Stara Gradiška fortress drawn in 1750 shows the grave of the \\"prophet Gaibia\\", as he is named in the plan's legend. In 1825, Emperor Francis I of Austria ordered building a little mausoleum around it; it was an open, three-wall structure with a roof. In 1832, General Haecht, the commander of the fortress, allowed Muslims to rebuild and arrange Gaibi's turbe as per their own design. Austrian press reported in August 1858 about Turkish pilgrims from Asia visiting the turbe. It was renovated in 1868, obtaining its final form. An iron fence was later constructed around it, and a flower garden was planted in its yard. It was the northernmost turbe in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, established in 1918. In 1954, after World War II and the establishment of socialist federal Yugoslavia, the People's Republic of Croatia requested that the turbe be moved to the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was thus rebuilt in Gradiška within the cemetery at a mosque, where it is also today. It is a square structure with a hip roof, of smaller dimensions than the previous turbe at Stara Gradiška. After 1954, the only turbe that remains in the former Ottoman lands north of the Sava is the turbe of Gül Baba, a 16th-century Turkish dervish, in Budapest. Writings folio 1v, the manuscript 426TF7 Gaibi wrote a discourse in Ottoman Turkish about the rules of the Jelveti order, titled Risāle-i tarīkatnāme, two copies of which are preserved in the University Library in Bratislava, Slovakia (the manuscripts 426TF7 and 427TG20). They are part of Bašagić's Collection of Islamic manuscripts, which is kept in the library. A Sharia judge from Gradiška donated in 1894 a booklet titled Risalei Šerife Šejh Mustafa-efendi Gaibi to the turbe at Stara Gradiška. It is a collection of seven writings by Gaibi in Ottoman Turkish, including a discourse on the Sufi piety, a dirge for Bosnia, a testament to his son, and four letters. Three more letters by Gaibi are found in Kadić's Collection, kept in the Gazi Husrev-beg Library in Sarajevo. They were copied from a lost chronicle written by Husejn-efendija Muzaferija (1646–1721), an Islamic scholar from Sarajevo. There is a poem referred to as Kasida Gaibija, but its authorship is a matter of debate. As is common In Sufi writings, Gaibi often uses allusion and allegory. His discourses, his testament, and his letter to his son are of a didactic character, while his other writings contain shathiyyat, i.e., strange expressions of a Sufi mystic in ecstasy. Many statements in his letters are difficult to understand. The first work in Risalei Šerife is his letter to a dervish in Sarajevo, in which he signed himself as Topuz Baba, meaning \\"Father Mace\\". Here Gaibi states, \\"I walk on the earth and give light to the stars. I am at the third stage. But the light also falls on roses and sheep droppings. I need none of that.\\" In his letter to Mehmed-čelebija of Jajce, Gaibi reproaches him, \\"A Turk fell in love with an Italian woman.\\" In the dirge, Gaibi laments over Bosnia that is pressed by enemies on all sides, and he adds hopefully, \\"When appear the first, second and third mīm (م), conquests arise. And when emerge jīm and kāf (ج and ك), Islam will be fine.\\" Gaibi, like other Sufis, ascribes some mystical meaning to Arabic letters. Gaibi's letter to Sultan Mehmed IV has an introduction composed by someone else. Gaibi, who lived in Banja Luka, was invited to visit the sultan in Belgrade, but he sent the letter instead. It was so enigmatic that a scholar was engaged to interpret it. It consisted of twelve points; e.g., the eighth point stated, \\"There are many skins, but one is missing.\\" This was interpreted to mean that the sultan's realm abounded in violence, lies, licentiousness, corruption, and other vices, all of which was the wrong way, while the right way was missing, as no one held on to it. Another manuscript collection contains a copy of this letter, and in it he is signed as \\"Fakir Gaibi, the leader of the hajduks from Kupres\\". Two letters by Gaibi to the Grand Vizier Suleiman Pasha in Belgrade, dated to 1686, are found in Kadić's Collection. The first of them resembles the letter to the sultan and has the same signature as in that copy of it. In his second letter to Suleiman Pasha, Gaibi states, \\"In the Ottoman Empire, there is no religion that is not full of violence. Regarding bribery, you [all] have made it so public and only through it one can get things done.\\" In the end, Gaibi blesses him. In his letter to Davud-efendija, the Kadi of Banja Luka, Gaibi dares him to ravage Banja Luka as he did in Užice.

He was also Rector of the University of Tartu in 1940–41 and in 1944.  Early life and education  Kruus was born on 22 October 1891 in Tartu,Jaan Toomla, Valitud ja Valitsenud: Eesti parlamentaarsete ja muude esinduskogude ning valitsuste isikkoosseis aastail 1917–1999 (National Library of Estonia, 1999), pp. 276. to Hans Kruus (1847–1929), a woodworker in a table factory, caretaker and housekeeper, and his wife Anu Matsi (1846–1929), the daughter of a tenant farmer.Rektor Hans Kruus (University of Tartu, 2017), pp. 8–9. In 1900, he moved with his family to a farm his father had purchased. Educated at Tartu Teachers College between 1907 and 1911, Kruus worked as a teacher until he joined the History Faculty at the University of Tartu in 1914. He served in the First World War in the Estonian Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army from 1916, and first became involved with politics in this time.\\"Kruus, Hans\\", in Toivo Miljan, Historical Dictionary of Estonia (Lanham, Maryland: Rowman and Littlefield, 2015), pp. 260–262.  Career   Early politics and return to academia  Kruus was elected to the Estonian Provincial Assembly which governed the newly formed Autonomous Governorate of Estonia in July 1917, but also sat on the Estonian Soldiers' Supreme Soviet. He was a founding member of the pro-independence, nationalist Estonian Socialist Revolutionary Party, which he led from September 1917 to 1921. When Estonia gained independence following the end of the Estonian War of Independence, he was elected to sit on the Constituent Assembly and became chairman of the central committee of his party, reformed as the Independent Socialist Workers Party. He also sat as a member of the first legislature of the Riigikogu (1920–23), but resigned on 3 October 1922 to focus on academia; he was replaced by Jaan Kalla. He completed an undergraduate degree in 1923 and eventually received at doctorate nine years later from the University of Tartu. He became a professor of history there, and in 1934 became Professor of Nordic History and Pro-Rector of the University (holding the latter post until 1937).Toomla, p. 36.\\"Hans Kruus is dead at 84; leading Estonian historian\\", New York Times, 5 July 1976, p. 24.  Soviet politics, academic legacy and later life  Kruus was in favour of the Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940, served as Deputy Prime Minister 21 June 1940 to 25 August 1940 and was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR as a member of the Communist Party. He based himself in the USSR during the German occupation (1941–44) and then resumed his interest in Estonian politics when the Soviets reoccupied the territory; he continued to serve in the second Supreme Soviet, which sat from 1947 to 1951 and was Foreign Minister between 28 October 1944 and 8 June 1950. However, he was removed from these offices and his academic positions in 1950 and imprisoned for adhering to \\"bourgeois nationalism\\". Released in 1954, he worked at the History Institute at the USSR Academy of Sciences for four years, when he returned to Estonia as senior librarian in the History Institute of the Academy of Sciences. Kruus's academic career had also included spells as Rector of the University of Tartu (1940–41, 1944)Miljan, p. 261, appears to state that he was rector in 1940 and between 1944 and 1948, but a biography by the University of Tartu clearly states he was rector in 1940–41 and briefly in 1944 (Rektor Hans Kruus (University of Tartu, 2017), p. 5). and as President of the Estonian SSR's Academy of Sciences (1946–50). Estonian historians have been critical of his politics and his role played in the Soviet occupation,Rektor Hans Kruus (University of Tartu, 2017), p. 5. but he was a major influence on the formation of historical scholarship in Estonia and \\"despite his variegated political career, Kruus is honoured among Estonian historians as one of the founders of the professional scholarly study of history in Estonia\\". His books included Linn ja Kula Eestis (1920), Eesti Ajaloo Lugemik (1924–29) and Vene-Liivi soda (1924). He was editor of Ajaloo Ajakiri between 1932 and 1936.

Her work includes the poetry collection Bone Confetti, which won the 2015 Noemi Press Book Award. She has received multiple writing fellowships, and her work was nominated for a Pushcart Prize. Her forthcoming second book, Imagine Us, The Swarm, received the Nightboat’s Poetry Prize.  Early life  Leung grew up in Richmond Hills, New York. Her first language is Cantonese. She learned English in elementary school. On her mother's side, she has family members who were garment workers on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Her father emigrated to the United States from Hong Kong under refugee status, and went on to own a restaurant. She received her undergraduate degree from Sarah Lawrence College.  Career  While working on her MFA at Louisiana State University, Leung completed her poetry collection Bone Confetti, which won the 2015 Noemi Press Book Award. Noemi Press published Bone Confetti the following year. The collection, which is divided into four sections, contemplates grief, loss, trauma and queerness. The book discusses the death of Leung's father, who died of stage 4 pancreatic cancer. The book also plays with the Orpheus and Eurydice myth. A review about the book in Hyperallergic states, \\"The poems can be grisly, gothic, and obsessed, not to mention quirky and disturbing. As much as you may suspect that Leung is possessed, you also feel that she is in control of every word she places on the page. The poems can be cool and feverish. They can be funny, odd, opaque. We cannot see through them to her, and why should we?\\" Also in 2016, Fairy Tale Review nominated her poem \\"How to Fall in Love in a Time of Unnamable Disaster\\" for a Pushcart Prize. In a review of her poem \\"I was a house / I was a witch \\" for the Ploughshares blog, John Rufo said that the poem \\"functions to present intermingling transformations that perform whatever an opposite of distillation forecloses\\". Leung's work often addresses identity. She is a co-host of the Blood-Jet Writing Hour poetry podcast along with American Book Award winner Rachelle Cruz. Leung received fellowships from Kundiman and Voices of Our Nation Arts Foundation. She is a co-editor at Apogee Journal and a contributing editor at Bettering American Poetry. She served as Assistant Editor of New Delta Review. About her forthcoming collection, Imagine Us, The Swarm, Kazim Ali wrote: “Muriel Leung’s Imagine Us, The Swarm offers seven powerful texts that form a constellation of voices, forms, and approaches to confront loneliness, silence, and death. In a varied range of physical and poetic shapes and typography, Leung creates a lyric informed by theory, autobiography, and essay. One finds in the margins of this book deep dimensional portals of thought that resonate wildly. Wise and inventive, this book leads one deep into psychic regions oft unplumbed. Its rigors are complex and yet a reader feels nothing so much as invited in, and the rewards are plentiful and profound.”  Personal life  Leung identifies as \\"a queer Asian-American woman\\". She is a doctoral student in Creative Writing at USC and resides in Los Angeles.

His research lies inside the domain of public finance, in particular questions of tax policy. He combines economic theory and empirical evidence, e.g. in deriving microdata-based estimates of elasticities of taxable income.  Career  Kleven obtained his MS in economics from the University of Copenhagen in 2001 and received his Ph.D. in economics from the same department in 2003. His thesis adviser was Professor Peter Birch Sørensen, and the title of his thesis was Taxation, Time Allocation, and Economic Efficiency. He worked as an Assistant Professor (2002–03) and an Associate Professor (2003–07) at University of Copenhagen , as an Assistant Professor (2007–10) and an Associate Professor (2010–13) at London School of Economics before becoming a Full Professor at LSE 2013-17. From July 2017, he is a Professor at the Department of Economics and Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University.Vita. Curriculum Vitae at Kleven's homepage, retrieved on 26 February 2019.  Research  Kleven's research combines empirical evidence and economic theory to show ways of designing more effective public policies. He has authored or co-authored numerous scientific contributions, including articles in the journals Econometrica, American Economic Review, Journal of Political Economy, Quarterly Journal of Economics and Economic Journal. Among his co-authors are the Danish public finance economists Peter Birch Sørensen and Claus Thustrup Kreiner as well as Gabriel Zucman, Emmanuel Saez, Wojciech Kopczuk, Camille Landais and Joel Slemrod. A number of Kleven's contributions have been studies based on microdata from Danish administrative registers who yield plenty of opportunity for empirical analyses of the behaviour of individual agents. This is true for several studies of the Danish elasticity of taxable income - a central term in modern economic tax theory, measuring how tax payers' behaviour is affected by tax changes. The paper \\"Estimating Taxable Income Responses Using Danish Tax Reforms\\", published in American Economic Journal: Economic Policy in 2014 presents elasticities of taxable labour income of 0.05 for wage earners and 0.1 for self-employed business people, whereas the elasticity of taxable capital income is approximately 2-3 times larger than for labour income. The results are based on estimated effects of four Danish income tax reforms from 1987 to 2005.Kleven, Henrik Jacobsen and Esben Anton Schultz (2014): \\"Estimating Taxable Income Responses Using Danish Tax Reforms.\\" American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, 6(4): 271-301. DOI: 10.1257/pol.6.4.271 One of Kleven's more easily accessible contributions is \\"How can Scandinavians tax so much?\\", published in Journal of Economic Perspectives in 2014. Here he attempts to answer a question often asked by American and other foreign researchers visiting Denmark and the other Scandinavian countries: How can the Scandinavian countries present societies with relatively high levels of prosperity and economic efficiency and yet at the same time maintain tax rates which are quite high in an international context? Kleven points to three facts that make the distortions in e.g. the Danish tax system relatively small: the wide-spread use of third-party information reporting, ensuring a low level of tax evasion, broad tax bases, ensuring a low level of tax avoidance, and strong subsidization of goods that are complementary to working, ensuring a high level of labor force participation. He also hypothesizes that social and cultural norms may play a role, in so far as a high general level of trust and social coherence in Scandinavia may be connected with the acceptance of a high tax level.Kleven, Henrik Jacobsen (2014): \\"How Can Scandinavians Tax So Much?\\" Journal of Economic Perspectives, 28(4): 77-98. DOI: 10.1257/jep.28.4.77  Other professional activities  From May 2018, Kleven is a Co-Editor of the American Economic Review. 2014-17 he was Chief Editor of the Journal of Public Economics. In 2016, he received the Excellence in Refereeing Award from the American Economic Review.

Barrowman also served as the personal physician to the Sultan of Selangor. Early life Barrowman was born on 10 March 1896 in the Kelvin area of Glasgow, Scotland. He was the youngest child of John Barrowman (1844-1900), a lime merchant and Helen Agnew (1854-?). After graduating from Glasgow University, Barrowman joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, serving in World War I as a surgeon. After the war, he returned home to Glasgow, where he worked as a general practitioner. In 1928 Barrowman married Marguerite Emily Burn (born 18 January 1901), the daughter of Sir Joseph Burn and wife Lady Emily H Burn. Service in Malaya After earning a Diploma of Tropical Medicine and Tropical Hygiene from the University of Liverpool, Barrowman moved to British Malaya. After working for several years in Sir Malcolm Watson's estate practice at Klang, Barrowman took over the practice. In 1937, Barrowman was appointed Personal Physician to the Sultan of Selangor, who gave him the title \\"Dato'Semboh Di Raja of Selangor, Malaya\\". Working as a malariologist, Barrowman made advances in the treatment and prevention of malaria, writing several articles on the subject. He also worked to improve conditions for the local labour force and ran instructional courses. Barrowman served as President of the BMA Malayan Branch and was appointed a Justice of the Peace by the Sultan's successor. After the Japanese invasion of Malaya in World War II, Barrowman fled Malaya. He served in the Royal Army, achieving he rank of Colonel. He advised the Australian Military Forces, then the Malayan Planning Unit of the War Office in London. At the end of the war, Barrowman returned to Malaya as a Lieutenant-Colonel, serving with the Military Administration as Advisor in Malariology. Later years In 1947, Barrowman retired due to ill health. A new highway to Port Swettenham, Malaya was named Barrowman Road after his retirement. Barrowman died on 31 January 1978 in Elstree and Potters Bar Registration District leaving a Will which was probated on 19 April 1978 in Winchester.

Ephorus, according to Stephanus of Byzantium, wrote Bybasstum or Bybasston (Βύβασστον) and Bybastium or Bybastion (Βυβάστιον); and Diodorus means the same place, when he calls it Bubastus of the Chersonesus. Pliny the Elder has a \\"regio Bubassus;\\" and he adds, \\"there was a town Acanthus, otherwise called Dulopolis.\\" He places the \\"regio Bubassus\\" next to Triopia, the district of Triopium. Finally, Pomponius Mela mentions a Bubassius Sinus. The Bubassia Chersonesus is mentioned by Herodotus. Herodotus tells a story of the Cnidians attempting to cut a canal through a narrow neck of land for the purpose of insulating their peninsula, and protecting themselves against the Persians; they were at the work while Harpagus was conquering Ionia. The isthmus where they made the attempt was five stadia wide, and rocky. This place cannot be the isthmus which connects the mainland with the high peninsula, once called Cape Krio (now Cape Deveboynu, for it is sandy, and Strabo says that Cape Krio was once an island, but in his time was connected with the land by a causeway. Besides this, the chief part of the city of Cnidus was on the mainland; though we cannot be sure that this was so in the time of Harpagus. The passage in Herodotus is somewhat obscure, but mainly because it is ill pointed. His description is in his usually diffuse, hardly grammatical, form. Herodotus says, \\"Both other Hellenes inhabit this country (Caria) and Lacedaemonian colonists, Cnidians, their territory being turned to the sea (the name is Triopium), and commencing from the Chersonesus Bubassiae, and all the Cnidia being surrounded by the sea, except a small part (for on the north it is bounded by the Gulf Ceramicus, and on the south by the sea in the direction of Syme and Rhodus; now at this small part, being about five stadia, the Cnidians were working to dig a canal.\\" It is clear, then, that he means a narrow neck some distance east of the town of Cnidus. Modern scholars identify the Bubassius Sinus with Hisarönü Bay, and Bubassus in the district of Hisarönü. At least on scholar places the site of the town in the neighborhood of Bozburun in the town of Hisarönü,Index Anatolicus others treat the site of the town as unlocated.

The number of Indians in Africa increased greatly with the settlement of Indians in Africa as indentured servants during colonization, and has continued to increase into the 21st century.  Indian-African history   Trade migrations: precolonial Indo-African relations  India and Africa have over a three thousand-year history of cultural and commercial relations. Sources from India show evidence of trade and contact between the Dravidians and Babylonians dating back to the 7th century B.C. This evidence has been interpreted to understand Indian merchants and sailors having visited Southern Arabia, situated on the Eastern part of the Horn of Africa also known as the Somali peninsula. Additionally, Indian coastal communities developed profitable ties with East Africa, East Asia, and Central Asia in pre-colonial times. The ‘trade diaspora’ was unique as it consisted largely of ‘temporary’ and ‘circular’ migration. Men were sent to look for trade elsewhere but expected to eventually return to their motherland. Traders linked other cultures to their own. Only in the nineteenth century did a considerable amount of South Asian trading communities settle abroad.  Indentured labor: forced migration into Africa  The second wave of migration into Africa by Indians came as a result of colonization. Major clusters of Indians were taken as indentured labors across colonial empires in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Indentured Indian laborers replaced freed slaves in plantation economies. The stark contrast between the first trade wave was that migration during colonial rule was forced, not voluntary. It is worth noting that some Indians migrated as clerks and teachers to serve colonial governments overseas. This expanded colonial rule. Estimates during the period of 1829-1924 suggest that about 769,427 Indians migrated out of India into Mauritius, South Africa, Seychelles, and the East African region. In the midst of colonization, the sub-continent India and large masses of Africa were incorporated into the British Empire such as Sierra Leone and the most common example, South Africa. Indentured labor came as the result of bondage of debt. Through this, European imperialists facilitated the transport of over 3.5 million Indians into the African continent where they served as labor for plantations. A majority of these plantations grew sugar. Unlike indentured laborers before 1830, most indentured laborers post-1830 did not return into free labor markets. They were forced to renew contracts. Even as numerous sources account for the inhumane conditions of laborers, populations only grew. In Mauritius 1871, the Indian population doubled from 33% in 1846 to 66% of the total population within the state. Migration remained predominantly male until the mid-nineteenth century. States then started to encourage the forced migration of women, to meet growing demands for domestic, urban and plantation labor, and create a consistent population of indentured slaves directly into their economy. With the rise of nationalism, the conversation around overseas Indians mobilized into the realization of discrimination across the colonies. The issue of Indentured labor festered the fight against British imperialism. At the same time, many Indians, including Mahadev Govind Ranad, the head of the ruling party in India (the Indian National Congress), believed that there was significant benefit in foreign Indian emigration as a solution to the multiplying population within India. Foreign in this thought, Indian emigration should be understood as synonymous with indentured servitude, which some argued ensured territorial expansion and provided opportunity for India's poor. Mohandas Gandhi, of South Africa, worked to abolish indentured servitude starting with his meeting with Gopal Krishna Gokhale. See more; Mohandas Gandhi, South African Indian Diaspora  Post- independent India and African diaspora  Since the rise of the west, many Indian immigrants have gravitated towards the Middle East, Northern America, and Western Europe at higher rates than African migration. Still, the opportunities in Africa have attracted Indian migrants. Many new migrants go to Africa on temporary work permits and do not seek permanent citizenship. Since the late 1990s, there has been a trend of Indian migrants migrating to Africa in pursuit of going further west.Shukla, Sandhya (2001) ‘Locations for South Asian diasporas’, Annual Review of Anthropology, vol. 30: 551-572. There are a significant number of Indians who reach the African continent without legal documents. As a Kenyan magazine, The Analyst, reported, “While official figures show only 1918 work permits issued from the Asian subcontinent in a three year period – 1995 (731), 1996 (703), and 1997 (484) – unconfirmed reports state that between 30,000 to 40,000 immigrant workers from the Asian subcontinent have entered Kenya in the last four years”Phyu, U. (2001) ‘Indians in Myanmar (Burma)’, CSID Lectures, University of Hyderabad, 26 Feb. Official records of the Government of India note the increasing presence of Indian communities in the African continent. In 2001, a released report by the High Level Committee on Indian Diaspora estimated the total Indian Diaspora in Africa to be 2,063,178 (including 1,969,708 people of Indian origins, 89,405 non-resident Indians, and 3,500 stateless people.(2000b) ‘Religion and diaspora’ Presented at the conference on ‘New Landscapes of Reli- gion in the West’.

The most recent estimates on overseas Indians indicate the strength on the Indian Diaspora on the continent to have risen to 2,710,6545. Members of the Indian diaspora reside in 46 countries of Africa. Indians in Africa account for 12.37% of the total diaspora in India over time. The concentration of Indian diaspora populations varies substantially across the continent. In Mauritius, 70% of the total population are members of the Indian diaspora.Brubaker, Roger (2005) ‘The “diaspora” diaspora.’ Ethnic and Racial Studies, vol. 28 no. 1, 1- 19. 800,000 Indians live in Nigeria, where 100,000 Indian businesses can be found.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-24835058  Present effects  The large populations of Indians within Africa could be the cause of the political support Africa is seeing from India now. The previous Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, recognized Africa as the growth pole of the world in 2011. Since this acknowledgement, India has shown their faith in Africa through the expansion of trade. In 2015, India's trade to Africa doubled from 24.98 billion (period of 2006-2007) to $72 billion. In return, Africa has backed the politics of India and allowed for new export markets from the nation. African diaspora in India  Along with Indians being displaced to Africa, many Africans also were displaced to India. There is a long- established history of the African Diaspora in India. As Indians were being brought to Africa as indentured laborers, the same was true inversely. Africans were brought as forced labor to India.

She was the secretary general and spokesperson of the French sex work union STRASS from 2011 to 2016. Biography Merteuil holds a Master's degree in Humanities from the University of Grenoble. While studying she held several jobs including childcare, cleaning, newspaper distribution and posing for erotic pictures. In 2009, while working as a bar hostess, Merteuil realized that she could become a sex worker to finance her studies, and decided to become an escort. She claimed this was a \\"constrained\\" choice in an article in Le Monde (25 November 2011), preferring \\"to be an escort rather than working in the factory for 40 hours a week\\", adding that \\"people who have extremely difficult days on work sites or in the catering industry would no doubt also say that they also made a forced choice.\\" After encountering abolitionist moves against prostitution, Merteuil joined the sex work union STRASS. In June 2011, she became their secretary general and spokesperson. STRASS actively opposes \\"whorephobia\\" and campaigned against the proposed 2016 law to criminalize the clients of prostitution, denouncing the law for \\"promoting insecurity and rape.\\" It argued that the effect of the law would be that \\"those who can afford to will go and work in neighboring countries, others will seek intermediaries who will play the role of pimps\\", and that the law would favor procuring. Under Merteuil's leadership, STRASS developed links with other unions. In 2012, Merteuil published an essay entitled Libérez le féminisme!, in which she accused media feminist associations such as Ni Putes Ni Soumises, Osez le féminisme! and Les Chiennes de garde of being \\"gentrified\\", and castigated these \\"ambassadors of liberty\\" for imposing their \\"own conception of dignity\\" on others. In July 2012, she was invited to appear on Le Grand Journal on Canal+ to discuss this with Thalia Breton from Osez le Feminisme. As co-founder of 8 mars pour toutTEs, Merteuil organized a demonstration to defend prostitution in March 2014. In February 2015, during the Affaire du Carlton de Lille trial, she expressed regret that the case was not centered \\"on the seriousness of the violence in certain actions.\\" In April 2016, Merteuil claimed that 15% of prostitutes in France are of foreign origin. Merteuil stepped down from being spokesperson for STRASS in June 2016. Published Works   Documentary * Putain, c’est pas simple! d’Emmanuelle Nobécourt, 2014, 80 min.

History Early history Kattrup was in the Middle Ages a manor located in a village by the same name. In 1339, Queen Margrethe I gave it to Sorø Abbey. In 1444 , Sorø Abbey ceded it to the Diocese of Roskilde in exchange for other property. The estate was confiscated by the Crown after the Reformation, In 1561,it was ceded to Laurits Iversen Serlin in exchange for other property. In the late 16th century, Kattrup was acquired by Rasmus Skade through his marriage to the previous owner's daughter Kirsten. After his death in 1602 it was passed on to his son Christoffer Skade. His heirs sold Kattrup to Axel Juul of Volstrup. In 1664,Kattrup was acquired by Treasurer Henrik Müller, He would later become one of the largest landowners in the country. In the 1680s, he passed Kattrup on to his son Christian Müller who in 1689 ceded it to his brother Frantz Müller. Frantz Müller died in 1705. Kattrup was then sold at auction to Christian Paludan. It was later sold first to Bolle Luxdorph Rose and then in 1718 to Hans Philip Bochenhoffer. Bochenhoffer was in debt to Marie Juul of Kragerupgaard and he ended up ceding the ownership of the estate to her. In 1742, she ceded the estate to her son-in-law Anton Günther Ellbrecht. In 1751, Kattrup was acquired by district judge Peder Kraft. His widow sold it to Jørgen v. Hjelmcrone. He ran into economic difficulties and had to sell the estate in 1775. The new owner was Major H. Focken. The Mylius family Johan Caspar Mylius In 1800, Kattrup was acquired by Johan Caspar Mylius. He left Kattrup in the hands of his mother, Ulrika Cathrine de Mylius, after having purchased Estruplund and a number of other estates. She was also the owner of Rønninge Søgård on Funen. Mylius reacquired Kattrup after her death in 1831. He sold the estate to J.F. Adeler in 1835 but reacquired it when Adeler went bankrupt the following year. After Mylius' death in 1852, Kattrup was passed on to his son-in-law, Frederik Emil Herman Bernstorff. He was succeeded by his son Ulrich Bernstorff-Mylius. He demolished the old main building in 1896 and constructed a new one in 1925. After his death in 1930, Kattrup was passed on to his son Andreas Peter Bernstorff-Mylius. The Møller family Arnold Peter Møller, the founder of A.P. Møller - Mærsk, purchased Kattrup in 1949. After his death, Kattrup went to his daughter Sally Mc-Kinney Møller. Architecture The Neoclassical main building is from 1925 and was designed byJens Ingwersen. It is a white-washed building with two corner risalits. The roof is a hipped red tile roof. The building is located on the south side of a large courtyard. The courtyard is flanked by older farm buildings from the 19th century. To the south of the main building is a large park with three pends. Today The estate is today owned by Peter Anders Møller. It covers 1,023 hectares. Komtesseboligen is rented out for meetings, exhibitions and other events.

Background Below are the circumstances at the time of the accident, which include the trains themselves, the location of the crash and the crew members. The trains On the day of the accident, the Shawnee train (operating number 392) from Carbondale, IL to Chicago, IL, was made up of Amtrak GE P30CH unit number 715 and 5 Superliner cars. The day before the accident (11 October), these passenger cars were unveiled to the public at the Union Station in Chicago, after which they were taken on a trip towards Lisle, Illinois before returning to Chicago. Locomotive 715 was one of Amtrak's more recent-built units at the time of the accident, having entered service in September 1975. The Superliners were less than a year old at the time of the accident, leaving the Pullman-Standard factories for Amtrak between December 1978 and July 1979. The Illinois Central (Gulf) freight train (operating number 51) consisted of three EMD GP40 units, which entered service sometime between 1966 and 1971, and 40 freight cars, along with a caboose at the end of the train. Harvey railroad yard The railroad yard at Harvey is situated on the Metra Electric District (at the time operated by RTA, or Regional Transportation Authority). The RTA-operated line ended at University Park, IL, but the other tracks used by the ICG led to Carbondale, and onwards to New Orleans. Eight tracks were located at the site of the crash, numbered west to east with their roles as follows: *1 - Southwards, Suburban - RTA commuter service towards University Park *2 - Northwards, Suburban - RTA commuter service towards Union Station *3 - Southwards - Passenger and freight towards Bourbonnais, IL *4 - Northwards - Passenger and freight towards Chicago *5 - Southwards - Freight, sidings *6 - Northwards - Freight, sidings *7 - Transfer train tracks *8 - Private industrial spur tracks Seven crossovers permitted trains to leave and/or enter Harvey yard, going across all tracks. Switches for tracks number 3 and 4 were equipped with electrically-operated actuators before 1971, but an accident on 23 January 1971 when an experienced switch- tender misaligned a switch which led to a collision that made the ICG (Illinois Central Gulf) introduce timetable special instructions, and also instruct trains passing tracks 3 and 4 to approach the switches at a reduced speed, however this speed was never prescribed. The ICG rule also stated that the trains were to be prepared to stop short of the switch (or any other obstacles), but this could only be done if the train was moving at \\"walking speed\\". Switch-tenders at the time were equipped with Motorola MT500 walkie- talkies, to ease the communications between the ICG staff. :::-- ICG instructions for Harvey Yard, issued on 23 June 1975. Crew members There were 10 crew members in total, 4 on the ICG train and 6 on the Amtrak train. ICG crew (train number 51) *Conductor Benjamin L. Gardner, aged 37, was employed as a brakeman on 2 May 1963 by the ICG, being later promoted to conductor on 13 May 1969. He was not restricted in any way. *Engineer Harold Ross Coghlan, aged 55, was employed as a fireman on 5 June 1974 by the ICG, being later promoted to engineer on 21 May 1975. He was not restricted in any way. † *Head Brakeman Richard O. Kingery, aged 21, was employed as a trackman on 14 June 1977 by the ICG, transferring to the Car Department on 8 January 1979 and later at the Transportation Department as a brakeman on 9 October 1979. He was not restricted in any way. † *Rear Brakeman Thomas Parker Brown, aged 20, was employed as a trackman on 9 May 1978 by the ICG, transferring to the Transportation Department as a brakeman/switchman on 10 January 1979. He was not restricted in any way. Amtrak crew (train number 392) *Conductor James Lowell Garrison, aged 47, was employed as a brakeman by the ICG on 1 August 1950, being promoted to conductor on 15 December 1958. The only restriction he had was to wear glasses all the time when he was on duty. *Engineer John Joseph Taksas, aged 65, was employed as a fireman by the ICG on 21 January 1940, being promoted to engineer on 27 January 1949. The only restriction he had was to wear glasses all the time when he was on duty. *Fireman James Alexander Murray, aged 29, was employed as a fireman by the ICG on 8 June 1973, entering engineer training on 28 June 1978, completing it on 26 April 1979. He was not restricted in any way. *Baggageman Donald Eugene Schwieger, aged 30, was employed as a brakeman by the ICG on 8 December 1967, being promoted to conductor on 6 October 1972. He was not restricted in any way. *Flagman John Clarence Washington, aged 48, was employed as a laborer in the Car Department by the ICG on 19 May 1953, working on various positions (including car inspector) up to 26 August 1968, when he transferred to the Transportation Department, being promoted to conductor on 3 March 1973. He was not restricted in any way. Railway supervising crew *Train director Norville J. Gapen, aged 49, was employed as an agent-operator by the GM&O; on 7 February 1949, and was promoted to train director on 28 October 1974. He was not restricted in any way. *Yardmaster James Alton Avant, aged 50, was employed as a switchman by the ICG on 26 November 1952, and was promoted to engine foreman on 13 June 1953, then to yardmaster around 1967. He was not restricted in any way. *Switchman Gregory Harris, aged 18, had been employed as a switchman/brakeman on 10 August 1979, two months prior to the crash. The only restriction he had was to wear glasses at all times when he was on duty. Events At 8:45 PM local time, ICG train number 51 stopped 20 feet (6 meters) before the crossover on track 3, due to a train ahead dealing with a crew change. The crew of train 51 was then instructed to wait until Amtrak train 392 had passed them, after which the train was to overtake the stopped train on track 3, before moving back to track 4. During this time, the lights of train 51 were switched off. The train director from nearby Kensington telephoned the yardmaster to relay a set of instructions for moving trains 51 and 392 to the switch-tender. The yardmaster proceeded to radio the switch- tender, but because the switch-tender complained that his connection was breaking up, he was telephoned and instructed to switch the crossovers for train 51 after a passenger train was to go past it, and also align a switch on track 6. The yardmaster did not remember if he said train 392 or passenger train, but he did not specify the locomotive's number or the track where it would operate. The switch-tender went to track 6 for a local transfer train, but as he was leaving for the crossover on track 4, he was called back by the conductor of that train to realign an improperly aligned switch. After correcting this mistake, he left the area back towards track 4. RTA commuter train 160 departed Homewood station at 8:52 PM towards Chicago, and it was noticed by the switch-tender arriving at 9 PM at the platforms of the nearby Harvey station. Assuming that this was the passenger train mentioned in the telephone communication, he proceeded to the switch and unlocked it. At the same time, Amtrak train 392 departed Homewood, IL on its last leg towards Union Station. The crew of the train reportedly heard the following transmission on the radio \\"After 392 goes by, let 51 down him cross onto 4\\", followed by \\"Your radio is breaking up, I can't understand it\\". The Amtrak train accelerated to 65 mph, but approaching Harvey, the engineer slowed the train down to 58 mph. As the train passed under signal 2056, the brakes were still applied, despite the signal showing a \\"proceed\\" aspect. At this point, both the engineer and fireman saw the targets on the switch show green, meaning continuing to go on a straight path. Once the fireman shouted \\"lined\\", the brakes were released, meaning that the train was to proceed as normally. The switch-tender saw a headlight coming from the south and believed that it was a slow-moving freight train. Unable to determine what track it was from, he proceeded to align the switch on track 4 to change the path of the oncoming train onto heading into the parked freight train. The crew of the Amtrak train did not see anyone on the ground but the fireman reported seeing the switch targets turn red, just before the switch. He shouted a warning to the engineer, who applied the emergency brakes and blasted a long, continuous horn, which was heard by the switch-tender. Realizing that the collision was imminent, he ran away from the switch. At the same time, the crew of train 51 noticed the oncoming train and said twice \\"Don't line that switch, you are going to line him in on top of us\\". He attempted to reach for the radio and to tell the other engineer to stop, but it was too late. The train entered the crossover at 56.5 mph (58 mph on the speedometer) and the Amtrak train struck the parked ICG train at 9:05 PM. The impact was fatal for the crew of train 51, the first locomotive was pushed against the second locomotive, which mounted the first locomotive of the train, along with the Amtrak locomotive, completely destroying it, killing its crew members. Only the chassis of the first locomotive was left. This also resulted in damage to the OHLE equipment, and the second locomotive received significant damage, whilst the rest of the train was intact. The Amtrak locomotive and first car overturned after they collided with ICG GP40 #3029, the force of impact being so great, that the P30CH's engine mounts were torn off and the engine separated from the locomotive. Other damages included ruptured fuel tanks and the crushed cab in the fireman's position. The first Superliner coach was only moderately damaged, as one of the switch targets penetrated one of its walls 12 inches (30 centimeters) deep, below an upper level window, protruding 3 inches (7 centimeters) into one of the seats. The next two cars were only slightly damaged and remained upright. The fourth car suffered no external damage, but moist (and improper) wood furnishings pulled loose the snackbar from the anchor bolts, collapsing inside the car. The last car of the Shawnee stayed on the tracks, undamaged. Aftermath and NTSB report The fire department and police were quick to respond, in three minutes, due to the proximity of the fire and police station to the site of the accident. Damage was estimated at $1,685,000 after the accident. The ICG crew members' bodies were located not far from the debris of the accident. It is unknown if they made any efforts to leave the cab, but it is likely that they did not, considering the lack of time and that the engineer tried to radio the engineer of the other train. The crew members of the Amtrak locomotive made no efforts to leave the engine room, and Fireman Murray sat on the floor at the time of the accident, facing forward with his feet against the front wall. His actions minimized his injuries, which would have been worse as the locomotive cab was crushed inwards towards the seat, however he still had a concussion and injuries to his cervical spine. Engineer Taksas had no recollection from the moment of the accident, but it is likely he struck the radio controls during the impact and subsequent rollover of the locomotive, as this equipment was found damaged. His injuries included internal injuries, a possible concussion, a fractured hip and right ribs with hematoma. The only other serious injury was located in the fourth car, where the snackbar counter collapsed, injuring and trapping the attendant. Five passengers were hospitalized for more than 48 hours, whilst another 33 left the accident with cuts, bruises, sprains and concussions. When initially interrogated, switch-tender Harris said that he knew he was doing a poor job on that day, but not only on the day of the crash, but also on other days. The day of the crash was also his second day working as a switch-tender, the previous times he worked as a brakeman. Before this, investigators found out that a number of trains were missing from his logbook. The signals and braking systems on the Amtrak train were tested, and were operating correctly. NTSB Report The NTSB report was finalized on 3 April 1980 and released on 20 May 1980. The report stated that, if the electrically locked switches had not been removed in 1971, then the train would have passed the signal and kept going straight to Chicago, without the interference of the switch-tender, going on to explain how even an experienced switch-tender would make the same mistake. Removal of these switches, thus resulted in removing the only \\"positive safety feature to prevent switches being operated immediately in front of an approaching train\\". Aside from the removal of the switches, the ICG was criticized for the lack of proper training given to switch-tenders. It was considered that \\"at no time is the new employee provided with adequate information on the switch-tender's position, nor does he receive student training before taking up this job\\". Train crews in and out of Harvey yard at the time reported improperly aligned switches, including the train that left track 6. It was determined that one of the factors into this crash was the short period of instruction, which could not allow him to become familiar with the physical layout of the switches, tracks, etc. The period of two months between his assignments did not help either. Another factor was the communication done from the train director to the switch-tender, through the yardmaster. This resulted due to the weak signal that resulted from the Motorola radio units, which were smaller than the original ones used by ICG at Harvey yard. This meant that the train director had to instruct the switch-tender indirectly, through the yardmaster, even for mainline instructions, which was against ICG rules. The instructions for the train leaving Harvey yard and trains 392 and 51 were also relayed together, had the yardmaster relayed only the instructions to prepare the switch only for the train leaving the yard, he would have ignored the passing Amtrak train and would have also avoided the accident. Also during communications, the yardmaster mentioned a passenger train, but since the switch-tender could not tell the difference between a commuter train and intercity train, he misunderstood the information given to him. Even giving out the locomotive number would have, at least, helped the switch-tender. Finally, the switch-tender most likely did not switch onto channel 1 of the radio, which made him not hear the crew of train 51 shouting for help (channel 1 was used for mainline traffic, channel 2 was used for yard traffic). Findings and conclusion * Electrically locked switches would have prevented the switch-tender from operating the switch immediately in front of train 392. * Neither the hand thrown switches, nor the ICG rules prevent switches being operated immediately in front of an oncoming train, therefore, adequate protection does not exist at the Harvey crossovers area. * Even if signal 2056 showed green, it did not prevent the switch being changed after the train went past it. Same goes for switch targets. * Except for signal 2056 and the switch targets, there is no other indicator available for the engineer to determine the position of the switches. The \\"safe speed\\" of passing through the area is also not specified, and the ICG relied on the discretion of the engineer when passing through this area. * The train director at Kensington was forced to relay to the switch-tender through the yardmaster at Harvey, against ICC regulations, due to poor capabilities of the mobile radio units they were issued. * The switch-tender at Harvey was not supervised, so he was supposed to be given out information and tasks through the radio, assuming he had gained enough knowledge for his tasks. The training program failed to train him sufficiently for this task. * The Amtrak personnel were not used, nor instructed in the new features of the Amtrak cars, making the evacuation slightly difficult. The NTSB determines that the probable cause of the accident was the switch-tender's manual misalignment of a switch, immediately in advance of a train, which caused train 392 to be directed into a crossover and collide with a standing freight train on the adjacent track. The misalignment was possible due to a lack of interlock or other positive means to prevent this movement. Contributing to the accident was the lack of training and limited experience of the employee assigned as switch-tender, and an inadequate communications system to give directions to the switch-tender. Recommendations The first recommendations were issued on 18 December 1979 and it contained the following: * Provide at the Harvey Yard location an interlocking system or other positive means to prevent the inadvertent misalignment of switches in advance of a train operating within the signal block. * Until positive safeguards can be provided for the operation of switches, restrict speeds through the area of the Harvey crossover so that trains can be stopped short of a switch which is improperly aligned, but not exceeding 20 mph. * Immediately qualify all switchmen/brakemen who function as switch-tenders by providing sufficient training in the specific rules that apply to switch-tenders, in the physical layout of tracks and switches, and in train operations in the area of their responsibility Later another set of recommendations were made: * Installation of a system that will ensure that the switch-tender at Harvey and train director can have direct communication when necessary for the movement of trains in the Harvey area * When radios with multiple channels are used in train operations by employees who must use several channels, issue instructions that identify the channel the employee must monitor for receiving instructions * Instruct supervisors to monitor the activities of the employees performing the switch-tender duties at Harvey for fitness and ability to perform those duties of the assignment * The NPRC (Amtrak) must ensure that all crew members on Amtrak passenger trains are trained to identify and operate all pertinent features of the equipment. After the report After the report, the crossovers that connected tracks 3 and 4 were removed. The leading GP40 of the ICG and the P30CH of Amtrak were scrapped, being damaged beyond repair. GP40 3029 of the ICG was repaired, but after another accident later in 1984, it was cannibalized for spare parts. There is no memorial plaque at the site of the accident, as this accident was almost forgotten among many people, but it showed grave deficiencies in railroad operations in the US in the late 1970s.

Career After briefly working as a model for porn magazines, Natacha Jaitt emigrated to Spain. She chose the country randomly, and arrived with just ten dollars. She sought to be in the Gran Hermano competition, the Spanish incarnation of the Big Brother franchise. She was accepted as a reserved housemate for the sixth season, as she had not finished the immigration procedures yet. Mercedes left the program on the first day, which allowed Jaitt to enter the house. She stayed in the program until the final voting, and ended in the third position, with 15% of the vote. She was both the first foreign contestant and the first reserve to get that far into the program. After the end of the program, she worked as a panelist at Crónicas marcianas, with journalist Javier Sardà. She also became the host of Sexual office, a program on the Playboy TV network. She hosted the radio program Esclava de tu agujero (\\"Slave of Your Hole\\") on 99.1 Loca FM. She posed for the magazines Interviú, Playboy, Hombre and Paparazzi. She returned to Argentina in 2007. She sponsored the International Festival of Erotic Cinema of Buenos Aires, alongside Dunia Montenegro, Sonia Baby and Nacho Vidal. She also hosted the TV program Sexo seguro (\\"Safe Sex\\"), again on Playboy TV. She was interviewed by journalist Chiche Gelblung, and had an orgasm on live television. She made her first theater play in 2008, Caliente (\\"Hot\\"), at the Lorange. It was produced by Gerardo Sofovich. She joined the Bailando por un Sueño tournament, hosted by Marcelo Tinelli, and lost in the first round. In 2009, she hosted Natacha enciende tus sentidos (\\"Natacha Ignites Your Senses\\") on América TV. She had a relationship with the actor Adrián Yospe and had a son, Valentino, with him. She also had a daughter, Antonella. Legal issues Diego Latorre extortion case Jaitt was accused in 2017 with extortion charges, as she allegedly blackmailed sports journalist and former football player Diego Latorre for $350,000. The alleged blackmail was about material of Latorre having sex with other people. During the ensuing controversy, it was revealed that Latorre, who was married, had an extramarital affair with Jaitt herself. Complaints about sexual abuse of minors There was an investigation about sexual abuse of minors at the Club Atlético Independiente in 2018. One of the players denounced four phone numbers that were allegedly used to pay children to have sex with adults. Jaitt said while as guest on the program La noche de Mirtha that those numbers belonged to journalists and politicians. Journalist Mercedes Ninci and sports author Gustavo Grabia, also on the program, criticized her for making unsubstantiated allegations on television. The program's host Mirtha Legrand apologized later for having invited Jaitt to the program, saying that she initially refused to accept her but accepted by network request, and that she did not ask her to leave the program in mid-air, because she supports free expression. Jaitt testified to the prosecutor of the Office of Avellaneda, which led to seven people being detained. Leonardo Cohen Arazi and Martín Bustos were acquitted on the grounds that there was no abuse, but promotion of prostitution. Rape report Natacha Jaitt said in 2019 that director Pablo Yotich and Maximiliano Giusto drugged and raped her. She attended a judicial hearing in the related case, which would be her last public appearance. Death On 5 April 2018, Jaitt had made a post on her personal Twitter account, warning her followers that she was not intending to commit suicide, writing \\"NOTICE: I am not going to kill myself, I am not going to be bought off or drown in a bath tub, I am not going to shoot myself in the head, so if that happens, I DIDN'T DO IT. Save this tweet.\\" Natacha Jaitt was found dead on 23 February 2019, naked in a bed at a party hall in Benavídez, Tigre, on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. The initial police reports stated that there seemed to be no signs of violence against her, but her lawyer detected inconsistencies in the report and said that Jaitt was murdered. Jaitt's remains were buried in the Jewish Cemetery of La Tablada. On 27 February 2019, Argentinian businessman and producer Raúl Velaztiqui was arrested for false testimony regarding Natacha Jaitt's death, having lied about the circumstances of her death.

History  The Little Native Hockey League was founded by Earl Abotossaway, former Chief Jim McGregor, the late James D. Debassiage, the late Reverend Leonard Self and the late Norman Debassiage in 1971. The tournament was established based on four pillars: education, citizenship, sportsmanship and respect. The very first tournament took place during Christmas break of 1971, with 17 teams and 200 players on Manitoulin Island in the town of Little Current. Most recently, the 2018 tournament was held during the March break in Mississauga, Ontario, with 209 teams and about 3000 players from across the province. The current president is Marian Jacko, a member of the Wilkwemkoong Unceded Territory. The tournament has become a major draw, increasing in size every year such that the host city needs to ensure it has the resources to accommodate the week-long event. Recently, Sudbury put in a bid to host the 46th tournament, but Mississauga was awarded it instead. Ontario Regional Chief Isadore Day elaborated that Mississauga is really the only place with the size needed to hold the Little NHL because the tournament draws such a larger number of teams from around the province. Smaller cities formerly did host this event, such as Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie, but they can no longer meet the demands. First Nation communities also act as hosts for the tournament; the City of Mississauga will remain the host until the 50th anniversary in 2021.  About   Team Categories  Teams participating in the tournament are divided into categories by age, gender and level of competition. Boys Division: * Tyke - ages 5 & 6 * Novice - ages 7 & 8 (Competitive and Recreational) * Atom - ages 9 & 10 (Competitive and Recreational) * Peewee - ages 11 & 12 (Competitive and Recreational) * Bantam - ages 13 &14 (Competitive and Recreational) * Midget - ages 15-17 (Competitive and Recreational) Girls Division: * Novice - ages 7 & 8 * Atom - ages 9 & 10 * Peewee - ages 11 & 12 * Bantam - ages 13 & 14 * Midget - ages 15-17 Girls are permitted to play in the male division, but boys are not permitted to play in any female division. All ages play full ice games except for the Tyke division, which only plays half-ice game.  Eligibility  All teams must represent an Ontario First Nation in order to enter. Every player is expected to compete for his/her First Nation community as indicated on his/her status card with the exception of those players who have used the residency option or have been released from his/her First Nation. For players to be eligible, they must have one parent of native birth, and a federal band number. Players without these qualify by presenting a legal affidavit that proves native descent.  Hall of Fame  The Little NHL has a hall of fame to honour the alumni, builders, and friends of the tournament..  Notable Alumni   Hall of Fame Alumni of the Little NHL  The Little NHL Hall of Fame has inducted ten former players who “have advanced to play hockey at a higher calibre” and who “have been instrumental in advocating hockey development in their communities and continue to support participation in the Little NHL Tournament,” designating them “Alumni of the Little NHL.” 35th Anniversary, 2006 * Barry Hawk Tabobondung * Gerard Peltier * Ted Nolan 40th Anniversary, 2011 * Kathryn Corbiere * Dave Avery * Jonathan Cheechoo 45th Anniversary, 2016 * Maryanne Menefee * Kelly Babstock * Mervin Cheechoo * Chris Simon  Other Alumni  Many other former participants have gone on to various levels of hockey with Junior B, Junior A/Tier II, major junior (OHL, etc.), collegiate (NCAA, U Sports, etc.), and professional (AHL, NHL NWHL, etc.). *Reggie Leach *Brandon Montour *Jordan Nolan *Jason Simon References External links * Category:Indigenous culture in Canada Category:1971 establishments in Canada Category:Sports organizations of Canada Category:First Nations sportspeople Category:Ice hockey tournaments in Canada ","title":"Little Native Hockey League"},{"id":"60082041","title":"Wake Up (Eliot song)"},{"id":"60082048","text":"Flight to Forever is a science fiction novella by American writer Poul Anderson, first published in serial form in Super Science Stories in November 1950, and then published again in paperback in 1955. This is one of many science fiction works written during the 1950s that involved time travel.  Plot summary  In 1973, physicist Martin Saunders test drives a time machine that Saunders, his girlfriend Eve, and his colleague McPherson have constructed. Martin and his friend Sam Hull set the time machine to the year 2073. Arriving in the year 2073, Martin finds his house in ruins and the nearby village completely gone. The men attempt to return to 1973, only to find that the time machine does not have the energy required to move backwards in time further than 20 years. In desperation, they begin to go forward in time in the hope of finding technology that can help them travel back in time. Arriving in the year 2500, the men visit a futuristic village. They are confronted by a militia that murders Sam and chases Martin back to the time machine. Martin travels to the year 3000, where he meets a tavern keeper named Belgotai, who confirms he must travel forward to a more advanced civilization to find the technology he needs. In exchange for this information, Martin agrees to take Belgotai with him in the time machine. The men make several stops in various centuries trying to find a backwards time machine. The time machine, which is unable to materialize inside solid matter, gets stuck inside a massive stone pyramid for 20,000 years. The time machine finally materializes in the year 25,296, and the men find that the Earth has been annexed as part of a vast multi-galactic empire. The two men arrive in the year 50,000 and are granted asylum at a nearby castle. Here they meet Empress Taurey, the last remaining monarch of the empire, and Vargor, a prince and head of the Empress's bodyguard. She explains that the empire has crumbled to the point where the Earth is the only planet remaining. Martin is convinced to help the Empress in her war to reconquer the galaxy. He is able to modify her largest warship to jump through time and surprise the enemy. After the battle, Martin spends a year helping to build a second galactic empire and getting closer to Taurey. He is later drugged by a jealous Vargor, and placed back in the time machine as it is sent forward through time. For four million years, the time machine is covered by a vast ocean, and when it recedes, Martin appears in an impossible city with godlike beings. They modify his time machine, and send him forward in time. He makes several more stops before finally reaching the end of the universe. Eventually, after several billion years, the universe begins to reform around the time machine. Martin sees the formation of the universe, the Earth and the Moon and realizes that the universe is cylindrical. He eventually is able to pilot forward in time 1973, where the time machine self-destructs after Martin exits.  Characters  Martin Saunders: The main character of the novella. He is a physicist who is stuck in a time machine that can only go forward. Despite only wanting to travel 100 years into the future, he ends up traveling throughout the whole of time until the end of the Universe. Along the way, he helps to found the second galactic empire, and falls in love with Taurey. Belgotai: A bartender and mercenary that Martin travels with after the year 3000. He is enlisted as a soldier in the galactic army. He is abandoned when Martin leaves the year 50,000. Sam Hull: The initial partner that Martin sets out from 1973 with.

One of its early products was Trixo the climbing monkey. In later years, Strauss would be known as \\"The Founder of the Mechanical Toy Industry in America\\". Strauss came to the United States from a German region of Alsace. At first, he imported the various toys that he sold from his New York shop. In 1912, Ferdinand Strauss hired future toy magnate Louis Marx. By 1914, he had four toy shops in New York. As a pioneer in the friction power tin toy industry, the company would soon produce various clockwork or wind-up toys that were distributed by the Strauss Stores and other contemporaneous merchants. Strauss began manufacturing his own toys in 1918. He employed 50 workers at the East Rutherford, New Jersey factory. Tin lithographed operating cars, trucks, buses, boats and wagons were all part of the line. Mechanical dancers, musicians, and windup toys filled the Strauss shelves. In 1917, Ferdinand Strauss also hired Henry Katz, future toy designer and friend of Louis Marx. Although Katz spent much time in the production process, he preferred the sales end of the toy business. He was active with the company until its demise, after which he started his own business, Katz and Company. Although Marx was managing Strauss' New Jersey plant, he was voted out by Strauss' board of directors over sales disagreements. He would go on to form the Louis Marx and Company. Strauss also sold stand-alone tin train-related items, such as Twin trolleys, Railway Express, All-aboard Limited and an operating boxcar. It was called The TravelChiks. When wound, chickens on top of the boxcar would peck in a tin food pan. Although Strauss was able to capture much of the mechanical tin toy craze of the early 1920s, tin toys from other manufacturers introduced during the same era did take market share away from Strauss, who had similar toys. Strauss Company's eventual fate is unclear but the company appears to have disappeared by 1927, with solid evidence of Marx leasing the old Strauss building and picking up the line and incorporating them into his own.

It focuses on the care of individuals with brain, spine and nervous system disorders. Neuroscience nurses work in a wide range of settings from academic medical centers to skilled nursing facilities, rehabilitation units to epilepsy monitoring units. Neuroscience nurses can be found in virtually any setting that nurses practice.Clement, I., (2015). Textbook on Neurological & Neurosurgical Nursing. London: JP Medical.  History   19th century  The first reports of nurses providing direct care to patients with neurological diseases came out of France and England in the late 19th century. Nurses observed Sir Victor Horsley's first operation at the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic in London.Hartshorn JC: Aspects of the historical development of neuroscience nursing. J Neurosci Nurs 18:45-48, 1986 To have the skills necessary to care for the complex patient population nurses at the time knew they needed specialized training. At the time training there was no formal training and to gain specialized knowledge nurses at the time only had informal training that was provided by physicians sharing their knowledge. Around the same time, neuroscience nursing started to emerge in the United States as a nursing specialty. The emergence of neuroscience nursing is due in part to Dr. Charles Karsner Mills, a physician at Philadelphia General Hospital. He held lectures for nurses on the care of patients with neurological diseases. In 1889 the content of these lectures was collected and The Nursing and Care of the Nervous and the Insane was published, thought to be the first textbook on neuroscience nursing.Collins J: Nursing in nervous diseases: The teaching in neurological hospital. AJN 11:434, 1911  20th century  In 1910, Amy Hilliard became the first superintendent of the nurses at the New York Neurological Institute. She went on to organize the first post-graduate courses that focused on neuroscience nursing. These courses continued to be led by physicians. It was not until the 1960s that neuroscience nursing courses were taught by specialty trained nurses, with the University of California School of Nursing in San Francisco and the New York Medical College in New York leading the way in training neuroscience nurses.  Professional organization   American Association of Neuroscience Nursing  In 1968 the American Association of Neurosurgical Nurses (AANN) was founded. The creation of AANN was a collaboration between Barbara Therrien, a nurse instructor at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis Missouri and Dr. Henry Schwartz, the president of the American Association of Neuroscience Surgeons. A colleague of Dr. Henry presented the idea to Agnes M. Marshall. The inaugural AANN education conference was held in Chicago in 1968, with over 100 nurses in attendance.Spokes, M., (2008). American Association of Neuroscience Nurses. Retrieved from https://www.nursing.virginia.edu/nursing- history/collections-cnhi/organizations/aann-collection/ In 1970 AANN applied for membership into the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies and was the first nursing organization accepted. Since the founding of AANN it has been the leading authority in neuroscience nursing. Today AANN has over 5,200 members worldwide.Bader, M.K., Littlejohns, L.R, and Olson, D. M., (2016). AANN Core Curriculum for Neuroscience Nursing. Chicago: American Association of Neuroscience Nurses In 1977 AANN published its first textbook dedicated to educating nurses on the specialty field of neuroscience nursing. It published updates in 1984, 1990, 2004, and 2010. The current version, released in 2016, continues to expand the field of neuroscience nursing by educating new and experienced nurses in this distinct field that requires a combination of knowledge and meticulous assessment skills.  American Board of Neuroscience Nursing  The American Board of Neuroscience Nursing (ABNN) was created under the supervision of the AANN. It was created to develop certification specifically for neuroscience nursing. The first certification offered by ABNN was the Certified Neuroscience Registered Nurse (CNRN). This certification was developed and initially offered to nurses in 1978. In 2013, ABNN, again in collaboration with AANN, developed and offered a certification as Stroke Certified Registered Nurse (SCRN).Our History. (n.d.) Retrieved from http://abnncertification.org/abnn/about  Journals  Journal of Neuroscience Nursing (JNN) is the official journal of AANN. It contains original articles specific to the nursing care and techniques for the specialty population of neurology and neurosurgery.

During her career, she published eight novels and had numerous stories adapted into silent films. She was especially known for writing film stories for silent film star Shirley Mason.  Early life  Pearl E. Doles was born to George W. Doles and Lettie Doles in St. Joseph, Missouri, on April 2, 1883.\\"United States Census, 1900,\\" database with images, FamilySearch (5 August 2014), Missouri > Buchanan > ED 49 Washington Township St. Joseph city Ward 2 > image 8 of 19; citing NARA microfilm publication T623 (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.). At the age of 12, Doles \\"went upon the stage as an elocutionist,\\" according to the Exhibitors Herald, touring the country. She began her writing career at age 12 or 13, publishing poems in a St. Joseph newspaper. Her poems were soon reprinted in newspapers around the country. Doles married George Humphrey Bell, a former Chicago businessman, on March 9, 1910 in Chicago, and added his last name to her own. The Bells lived in Brooklyn, where Pearl decorated their apartment with hand-painted frescoes, refashioned furniture, hand-embroidered hangings, and a garden. The couple traveled once a year to Florida on a yacht named \\"The Bells,\\" where Pearl honed her skills as \\"an expert swimmer, a crack shot with a rifle, an expert canoeist, [and] a hardy hiker.\\" On Monday, November 24, 1913, she made the front page of the New York Times for her \\"daring feat\\" of diving with sharks in Key West.  Writing career  Pearl Doles Bell, photographed by David Berns, c. 1924 Bell incorporated her knowledge of boats and sailing into her first novel, Gloria Gray, Love Pirate, published in 1914. She also contributed an illustration for the frontispiece. Bell served as the editor of Fashionable Dress, a fashion magazine, from about 1919 to 1922. To research her third novel, Her Elephant Man: A Story of the Sawdust Ring, Bell traveled for six weeks with Ringling Brothers Circus. She sold the film rights to the novel to the Fox Film Corporation. In December 1919, the Exhibitors Herald announced that the film would be made starring new Fox star Shirley Mason. Her Elephant Man was released in 1920, followed in the same year by Love's Harvest, adapted from Bell's 1915 novel His Harvest, and also starring Shirley Mason. In December, 1920, Moving Picture World announced that Mason was beginning production on her third Bell adaptation, Wing Toy. The film was based on Bell's unpublished short story \\"The Little Pagan\\", which she wrote specifically for Mason. Sources also reported that Bell was at work on an original scenario or series of screen stories for Mason to helm. Bell traveled to Los Angeles, along with her pet turtle Mike, in 1920 to meet Mason and discuss these original stories. However, Mason did not star in Bell's next two adapted films, For Another Woman and Sandra, both released in 1924. Motion Picture News reported in 1925 that Bell had sold the rights to her fourth novel, The Autocrat. The film was set to be made by Pinellas Films in St. Petersburg, Florida, with Raoul Everria producing. Bell's sixth novel, The Love Link, about a flapper who saves her parents' rocky marriage with her antics, was listed as a \\"popular copyright\\" by the American News Trade Journal in 1926. First National Pictures had announced in a July 1925 advertisement in The Moving Picture World that they would adapt the novel, as well as a Bell short story titled \\"The Man She Bought\\" set to star Constance Talmadge. The latter film was set to go into production on February 13, 1925, directed by Sidney Franklin, and be released on November 29, 1925. Subsequent information about these projects is lacking. Variety reported that Bell had instructed her lawyers to sue Famous Players-Lasky in October 1925, asserting that their film The Pony Express used her story without the rights. Bell collaborated with dancer Billie Shaw to write the screen story \\"Little Lady, Inc.\\"; the two sold the rights for the story to David Hartford Productions for $5000. According to the Exhibitors Herald, \\"Little Lady, Inc.\\" was adapted for the screen by Sylvia Frances Seid under the title Rose of the Bowery. David Hartford Productions began camera work on the film in 1926, with Bertram Bracken directing; however, by the time the film was released in 1927, Bell, Shaw, and Seid's names were all absent from the credits.  Later life and death  Pearl Doles Bell married Havana distiller and art collector Gilbert E. Rubens on October 12, 1927, in Brooklyn, New York. Rubens died in 1960, leaving Bell a widow for the final years of her life. Bell died on Monday, March 11, 1968, in St. Luke's Hospital.

Players control a local handyman who investigates a mysterious viral outbreak in his town.  Gameplay  Harper Pendrel, a handyman, learns that a mysterious virus is killing citizens in Yelltown. Aided by a local academic and a reporter, Pendrel attempts to uncover who has unleashed the virus and why. Players control Pendrel as he performs his investigation. Rock, Paper, Shotgun described the puzzles as \\"extremely traditional\\" for an adventure game but said they differ from the usual implementation by having solutions in which the protagonist is not manipulative toward people who are supposedly his friends. For example, solutions may involve helping a friend to address a personal problem rather than exploiting it. As a handyman, Pendrel also solves some puzzles through the use of his tools. Items may be picked up and used to solve inventory-based puzzles, but some items are red herrings that do not have any in-game use.  Development and release  The English-language dialogue is not a straight translation of the German dialogue. Instead, British comedian Alasdair Beckett-King contributed original dialogue.

The report also highlights the practice as a human rights violation. In World Vision's \\"Before She's Ready: 15 Places Girls Marry by 15,\\" the organization highlights the socioeconomic consequences of child marriage on girls, noting that many girls are forced to stop their schooling as a result of their marriages. With the denial of education, girl brides are often not able to make income as adults or become politically active citizens. Sierra Leone's major child marriage legislation is the 2007 Child Rights Act, which states that the minimum age of betrothal/marriage is eighteen years old. The act also commits the country to the elimination of the forced marriage of girls. It rejects the customary practices of betrothal and marriage for minors, and orders that such practices may not be forced upon minors. According to Sierra Leonean customary law, a marriage is not considered a valid customary marriage unless both parties are at least 18 years old, with the Customary Marriage and Divorce Act dictating this in 2007. However, in the case that a minor's parents are able to give consent to the union, a legal marriage is able to take place. If the consent of the parents is not able to be achieved, \\"a Magistrate or Local Government Chief Administrator of the locality in which the marriage is to take place\\" is able to provide their consent to verify the marriage. In accordance with customary tradition, child marriages are often the result of unions arranged by the parents of the young bride. As stated by UNICEF's The State of the World's Children 2013 report, 18% of Sierra Leonean women are married by the age of 15, while 44% of them are married by the age of 18. As of 2017, Sierra Leone was ranked by UNICEF as the 19th nation for the highest rates of child marriage.  Prevalence by Geographic Region  In terms of prevalence based on geographic location, the practice varies, but it child marriage is most common in \\"the northern and eastern districts of Sierra Leone, lower in the south, and lowest in the capital, Freetown.\\" The institution of child marriage continues to be an acceptable practice in the rural cities and towns of Sierra Leone.  Impacts of the Sierra Leonean Civil War on Child Marriages  With Sierra Leone's civil war, many young girls were conscripted into being child soldiers. Organization Girls Not Brides contends that due to the presence of female child soldiers in Sierra Leone, it may have aided in cultural perceptions of young girls as being mentally capable of marriage, with the justification being that since they were capable to physically engage in armed conflict, they could handle being married. The Sierra Leonean Civil War left girls subject to sexual harassment and abuse. The African Child Policy Forum cites that throughout the civil war and at multiple war zones, \\"more than 70 per cent of the reported sexual violence were girls under 18, and more than 20 per cent of those were girls under 11.\\"ACPF (2014). The African Report on Violence Against Children. Addis Ababa: The African Child Policy Forum (ACPF). Young girls that forced into the rebel forces, especially, were raped by their male soldier counterparts, resulting in a marginalized group of young women during the post-civil war period with children born out of rape. In post-civil war Sierra Leone, the ramifications of wartime sexual abuse have manifested in the difficulty of girl mothers acquiring spouses. Culturally, prior to marriage, girls are expected to be virgins, but with the sexual abuse that was present during wartime, now-girl mothers are finding issues with finding husbands that will marry them despite no longer being virgins. Girl mothers in the post-civil war era have also experienced difficulty acquiring partners not only due to cultural perceptions of purity, but due to civil war political alignment. Though many girls were forced into the rebel forces, either as wives or soldiers, after the war, these girls experience difficulty in acquiring partners due to their previous association with the Revolutionary United Front. These social and political stigmas create problems for girl mothers in Sierra Leone that may seek marriage as a means of acquiring economic resources and stability from their partners.  Governmental Commitments Against Child Marriage  Due to the country's civil war, many government branches and agencies have been left with insufficient funding and human capital needed to address many of the systemic issues that the country faces, including child marriage. In order to establish what the African Child Policy Forum identifies as a \\"formal child protection system,\\" the Sierra Leonean government, with its 2007 Child Rights Act, initiated Child Welfare Committees which authorized the government the ability to enforce state protection of children.ACPF (2014). The African Report on Violence Against Children. Addis Ababa: The African Child Policy Forum (ACPF). Despite the enactment of the 2007 Child Rights Act, along with its Child Welfare Committees, the government of Sierra Leone has been condemned for not actively targeting the institution of child marriage in rural communities. Scholar Allard K. Lowenstein of the International Human Rights Clinic of Yale Law School has argued that socioeconomic conditions brought about by the systemic poverty in Sierra Leone further exacerbate the prevalence of child marriage. In 2013, during the twenty-fourth session of the United Nations Human Rights Council General Assembly, Sierra Leone formally committed itself to \\"preventing\\" and \\"eliminating\\" child marriage in the country to the international community. In 2016, Sierra Leone's Ministry of Finance and Economic Development in its United Nations Sustainable Development Goals report, committed itself to eliminating all forms of child marriage by the year 2030.  Non-Governmental Organizations' Commitments Against Child Marriage  Because Sierra Leone is one of the most high-risk countries for child marriage, a number of different non-governmental organizations have dedicated programming in Sierra Leone to combat child marriage. International NGOs UNFPA and UNICEF, in 2016, first announced their joint 'Global Programme to End Child Marriage.' In the program, both organizations have committed themselves to stop child marriages in what they deem as the 12 highest risk nations for child marriage, including Sierra Leone. Tactics utilized in the program include emphasizing the importance of education to local young women, as well as advocacy for legal prohibition of child marriage in the countries that the program takes place. The program is also publicly supported by a number of nations and organizations, including \\"the Governments of Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom and the European Union, as well as Zonta International.\\" This particular campaign targets the lack of awareness of women's legal rights in rural areas of Sierra Leone. Because of the lack of funding of Sierra Leone's justice system, a viable presence of formal laws often does not extend into the country's most rural areas.

Early life  Mekonnen was born in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, to a Christian mother and a half- Jewish father. She is one of six siblings. When she was two, her mother left to the United States, and her father subsequently immigrated to Israel, when she was about four years old. In 1994, at the age of six, she and her sister Bitania joined him, and converted to Judaism. Her father was very successful in Ethiopia, and well-regarded professionally. This was far from the case in Israel. After three years as a single parent, he, too, left for the United States, hoping to find his wife there, and to make a new life as a journalist. Mekonnen, now in the third grade, found herself in a \\"pnimia\\" – a type of boarding school for at-risk youth, or thse from broken families. Mekonnen next saw her mother when she was 18. Growing up without family, as an immigrant, and as a black-skinned minority, made Mekonnen question her identity – an issue that became central to her as an artist. She is outspoken about the racism in Israeli society and how it affects her and other actors of Ethiopian origin, and has been supportive of the Ethiopian-Israeli protest movement for social justice. While serving in the Israel Defense Forces, in the military theater troupe, Mekonnen produced and performed in an autobiographical play called \\"Netsanet\\". The play continued to run for over a decade. The meaning of her name in Amharic is \\"freedom\\". After the army, Mekonnen studied dance at the Nadine Bommer Academy and at the Broadway Dance Center in New York, specializing in ballroom and latin dance. She completed her Bachelor's degree in theater at the Kibbutzim College of Education, Technology and the Arts. Mekonnen is a polyglot: In addition to Hebrew and Amharic, she speaks English, Spanish and Portuguese. She studied at the College of Nutrition, and is a frutarian.

Approximately 50 of the names of the battery appear to be of Irish nationality.

In the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, artillery units are most often referred to by the name of their battery commander. After Capt Clarkson, the Helena Light Artillery was commanded by Capt John H. Calvert and Capt Thomas J. Key. The battery would retain a close association with Patrick Cleburne throughout the war. 1st Lieut Calvert, who would assume command of the battery after the battle of Shiloh, had been a Sergeant in the United States Army prior to the war and had been a drill instructor for Cleburne's militia company before secession.Irving Ashby Buck, Thomas Robson Hay, \\"Cleburne and his command\\", McCowat-Mercer Press, 1959, page 81 Service By 7 May 1862, the battery, along with the companies that would eventually comprise Col Patrick Cleburne's 1st Regiment, Arkansas State Troops (Later re-designated as the 15th Arkansas Infantry Regiment was encamped at \\"Camp Rector\\" near Memphis.)

Cunningham, p. 290, can account for 51. Daniel, p. 229, argues for 53. Eicher, p. 228 and Sword, Wiley. Shiloh: Bloody April. Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1992. . First published 1974 by Morrow. p. 326, report the traditional count of 62, which was originally established by battlefield historian D.W. Reed. Some controversy exists as to who exactly gave the order to concentrate artillery at this point. It has gone down in history as \\"Ruggle's Battery\\" but Major Shoup also claimed the credit. Other sources indicate that Brig. Genl. James Trudeau began the concentration after orders from Beauregard. National Park Service tablets at the Shiloh National Military Park use the \\"Ruggle's Battery\\" designation. This concentration originated about 3:00 pm when General Beauregard was informed of the death of General Albert S. Johnston thereby making Beauregard the army commander. He immediately moved to push the stalled rebel attack by assigning General Braxton Bragg to command in the eastern sector of the battlefield and General Ruggles to command in the center of the battlefield, the Duncan field sector. Ruggles issued orders to gather the artillery into a group which historians now believe totaled 55 guns. Major Francis Shoup also claims a portion of the credit for this grouping. There were actually two groups of guns in Ruggle's Grand Battery, a northern group and a southern group. The northern group contained the batteries located by aides of General Ruggles and brought to the field and this group was the group formed by Ruggles. The northern group, commanded by Captain Bankhead included a section of Ketchum's Alabama battery 2 guns, Hodgson's Louisiana battery 6 guns, Bankhead's Tennessee battery 6 guns, Stanford's Mississippi battery 6 guns, Robertson's Alabama battery, 4 guns for a total of 30 guns. The southern group was commanded by Major Shoup and contained a group of batteries which had been under Shoup\\"s supervision and had been resting following the morning fight near the main Corinth Road. The southern group of guns, commanded by Major Shoup included Roberts Arkansas battery 4 guns, Triggs Arkansas battery 4 guns, Sweet's Mississippi battery 6 guns, a section of Hubbard's Arkansas battery (Lt Thrall commanding) 2 guns, Brynes Kentucky battery, 7 guns and a section of Cobb's Kentucky Battery, 2 guns, for a total of 25 guns. The guns of these two groups came from different areas of the battlefield. It appears that Shoup was not initially aware of the presence of the northern group of guns or Ruggles' orders to gather the guns. The resulting artillery concentration of 55 guns was, up to that time, the largest concentration of artillery ever on the North American continent and was itself a historical event. This status did not last long as it was quickly surpassed by even larger artillery concentrations in the Eastern Theater of the war. The grand battery enabled Confederates to surround the position, and the Hornet's Nest fell after holding out for seven hours.Nevin, David, and the Editors of Time- Life Books.

The town was a strategic point at the junction of two vital railroad lines, the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and the Memphis and Charleston Railroad. Following the Union Army victory at the Battle of Shiloh, Maj. Gen. Henry Halleck amassed three Union armies—the Army of the Tennessee, the Army of the Ohio, and the Army of the Mississippi—for an advance on the vital rail center of Corinth, Mississippi. Made cautious by the staggering losses at Shiloh, Halleck embarked on a tedious campaign of offensive entrenchment, fortifying after each advance. By May 25, 1862, after moving five miles in three weeks, Halleck was in position to lay siege to the town. Confederate morale was low and Beauregard, heavily outnumbered, and with a Typhoid epidemic raging in his ranks, held a council of war. After conferring with his officers, Beauregard concluded that he could not hold the railroad crossover. The siege ended as the Confederates withdrew.\\"Determining the facts: The Siege of Corinth\\", National Park Service When Lieutenant General Braxton Bragg issued his organization of the Confederate Army of the Mississippi, on June 30, 1862, Calvert's Battery was assigned to Brigadier General Patrick R.

Stones River Campaign The Battle of Stones River or the Battle of Murfreesboro as it was known in the South was fought from December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863, in Middle Tennessee, as the culmination of the Stones River Campaign. During the battle of Stones River, the Helena Arkansas Artillery, now under the command of Lieutenant Thomas J. Key, was assigned to Brigadier General Lucius E.

Hardee's Corps of the Confederate Army of Tennessee.Official Records, Series I, Volume XX, Part 1, pages 658-661 Lieutenant Key, commanding Calvert's battery, filed his report of the report of the roll of his battery in the battle from the Artillery Camp at Tullahoma, Tenn., January 23, 1863: Capt Calvert was accused of drunkenness during the battle. This was no doubt a difficult situation for General Cleburne, now commanding the division, since Calvert had served as the drill instructor for Cleburne's old militia company prior to the war. This relationship had apparently given Cleburne reason to save Calvert's career following a previous bout of drunkenness in Nashville earlier in the war. That time Calvert had vowed to remain sober and retained command. This time Calvert was forced to resign on 6 February 1863. Lieutenant Thomas J. Key, a former newspaper editor from Helena Arkansas became the battery commander following Calvert's resignation.Major Joseph M. Lance III USMC,\\"Patrick R. Cleburne And The Tactical Employment Of His Division At The Battle Of Chickamauga\\", Pickle Partners Publishing, Nov 6, 2015 The battery would continued to be known as Calvert's Arkansas Artillery in official reports, until the Atlanta Campaign in 1864. After the defeat at the Battle of Murfreesboro, General Braxton Bragg had his army occupy strong defensive positions around Tullahoma, Tennessee. Union General Rosecrans spent five and a half months reinforcing Murfreesboro and building earthworks. The next major operation, the Tullahoma Campaign, did not come until June 1863, when Rosecrans finally moved his army against Bragg.Welcher, p. 832; Eicher, p. 496; \\"Fortress Rosecrans\\" in the Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture. Tullahoma Campaign The Tullahoma Campaign was fought between June 24 and July 3, 1863, during the American Civil War. The Union Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans, outmaneuvered the Confederate Army of Tennessee, commanded by General Braxton Bragg, from a strong defensive position, driving the Confederates from Middle Tennessee and threatening Chattanooga.

On October 6, 1863, Lieutenant Key provided a report on the battery's roll in the battle: Chattanooga Campaign Repulse of Sherman's Attack on Missionary Ridge by Cleburne's Divion with Calvert's BatteryThe Chattanooga CampaignThe National Park Service's Civil War Sites Advisory Commission classifies two campaigns for this period: Reopening the Tennessee River (Battle of Wauhatchie) and Chattanooga-Ringgold (the Third Battle of Chattanooga, frequently known as the Battles for Chattanooga, and the Battle of Ringgold Gap). was a series of maneuvers and battles in October and November 1863, during the American Civil War. Following the defeat of Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans' Union Army of the Cumberland at the Battle of Chickamauga in September, the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Gen. Braxton Bragg besieged Rosecrans and his men by occupying key high terrain around Chattanooga, Tennessee. Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was given command of Union forces in the West and significant reinforcements began to arrive with him in Chattanooga from Mississippi and the Eastern Theater. The Union Army of the Tennessee under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman maneuvered to launch a surprise attack against Bragg's right flank on Missionary Ridge. On November 25, Sherman's attack on Bragg's right flank at Tunnel Hill on the east end of Missionary Ridge, which was defended by Cleburne's Division, with Calvert's Arkansas Battery. Lieutenant Key and the battery were praised in Cleburne's report of the battle. Hoping to distract Bragg's attention, Grant authorized Thomas's army to advance in the center of his line to the base of Missionary Ridge. A combination of misunderstood orders and the pressure of the tactical situation caused Thomas's men to surge to the top of Missionary Ridge, routing the Army of Tennessee, which retreated to Dalton, Georgia, fighting off the Union pursuit successfully at the Battle of Ringgold Gap. Bragg's defeat eliminated the last Confederate control of Tennessee and opened the door to an invasion of the Deep South, leading to Sherman's Atlanta Campaign of 1864. Atlanta Campaign During the Atlanta Campaign, Key's Battery was assigned to Hochkiss's Battalion, usually part of Major General Patrick Cleburne's Division. The battalion also included Goldthwaite's Alabama Battery and Sweet's Mississippi Battery. On December 14, 1863, the battery was reported 93 assigned, with 71 present for duty, 60 of which were listed as effective. The remaining 22 were listed as absent. The battery's armament at the time was listed as two 12 pound howitzers and two 6-pounder guns.United States. War Dept.

According to the report of Major T.R. Hotchkiss, Key's battery was the first battery to fire on a Union Brigade involved in the demonstration against Dalton Georgia on February 25, 1864. The battery engaged at a range of approximately 700 yards and fired approximately nine rounds per gun.United States. War Dept.

Key had command of the battalion through much of the campaign. During the Battle of Pickett's Mill on May 27, 1864, Key's Arkansas Battery occupied a position with Major General Cleburne's Division. As Brigadier General William B. Hazen's brigade attacked Cleburne's line, Key and some of his men rolled two of his guns from their original position on a ridgeline, to the far right of the line.United States. War Dept.

Another Brigade under Colonel William H. Gibson took its place and receive equally rough treatment. Finally, Colonel Frederick Knefler attempted to help extract Gibson's brigade and were also driven away by Key's guns. Key's two guns fired a total of 187 rounds of canister and spherical case shot during the Union assault.McKay, John. Brave Men in Desperate Times: The Lives of Civil War Soldiers. Guilford, Conn: TwoDot, 2007, page 37-61. The battle of Battle of Peachtree Creek on July 20, 1864, was the first major engagement after John Bell Hood replaced Joe Johnston as commander of the Army of Tennessee. Key's Arkansas Battery supported the attack of Brigadier General Daniel C. Govan's brigade of Cleuburne's Division.Spence, Alexander E., Thomas F. Spence, and Mark K. Christ.

Only 12 men excepted capture with the battery. Due to a special cartel between Union General Sherman and Confederate General John B. Hood, the unit was quickly paroled and exchanged for Union prisoners held at Andersonville Prison. The battery re-entered service approximately a month later. The battery and Govan's Brigade were released and exchanged just in time to participate in General John B. Hood's disastrous Franklin-Nashville Campaign. Franklin-Nashville Campaign After the fall of Atlanta, Key's Battery moved north with General John B. Hood into Tennessee and participated in the Battle of Nashville. The battery was not present for the fatal Battle of Franklin, in which General Cleburne and so much of his division were killed. The battery had been detailed along with James A. Smith's Brigade of Cleburne's Division to guard the wagontrain. The battery joined the remainder of Hood's army in front of Nashville on December 6, 1864.Joslyn, M. (2000).

Battle flag right One battle flag from Key's Arkansas Battery has survived. Like the other units in Cleburne's Arkansas Division the unit was issued a Hardee pattern flag. The flag is cotton with dark green, black and red paint. It measures 30 × 36 inches and has the War Department Capture Number 231 painted on the flag. Key's Battery was captured with most of the rest of Daniel Govan's Arkansas brigade in the fighting at Jonesboro, Georgia, on 1 September 1864. The flag is consistent with the last two flags of the 1864 issue, and as a group they reinforce the observation that decorating was done at the brigade level at this point in the war. The crossed cannon are unusual on an artillery flag, as they generally honor capture of enemy guns by infantry. The honor may have been extended for silencing enemy guns in an exchange, but is unknown before 1864. The flag is currently in the collection of the Old State House Museum, Little Rock, Arkansas.Dedmondt, Glenn \\"The Flags Of Civil War Arkansas\\", (Pelican Publishing Co., 2009). Surrender Capt Key and the remnants of his battery spent the winter 1865 in Macon, Georgia. The unit had been left behind to recruit and look for horses when the defeated remnants of the Army of the Tennessee were making their way back from the disastrous Nashville Campaign, and then moved to its ultimate surrender in North Carolina. Capt Key and his men participated in efforts to defend Macon from a raid by Major General James Harrison Wilson in the closing days of the war and were still engaged in this effort when they learned of the armistice between Confederate General Joseph E. Johnson and Union General William T. Sherman. Capt Key and a portion of the battery surrendered to General Wilson's troops on April 20, 1865 at Macon, Georgia.Cate, Wirt Armistead, Robert J.

MBF is the current owner and operator of the Dow Diamond – a baseball stadium located in downtown Midland. Profits from the operation of the Dow Diamond are donated to youth groups and to initiatives that seek to improve life in Midland and its surrounding areas. History MBF began in 2005, when William S. Stavropoulos, then Chairman of the Dow Chemical Company, which is headquartered in Midland, came up with the idea that minor league baseball could help to vitalize the hometown of Dow Chemical. He had observed how the introduction of minor league baseball had rejuvenated several communities in the United States, and he felt it could similarly trigger a renaissance in Midland. Eric Gilbertson [“Bill Stavropoulos: he made professional baseball―the Great Lakes Loons―a reality for his hometown”] ‘’Business’’ 1, 2017, pg. 20-21 With the backing of Dow Chemical he turned to citizens of the town for their support. Ultimately, five additional Midland-based organizations (Dow Corning Corporation, the Charles J. Strosacker Foundation, the Rollin M. Gerstacker Foundation, the Herbert H. and Grace A. Dow Foundation, and the Bill and Linda Stavropoulos Foundation) joined Dow in backing the effort to bring a minor league baseball team to the community. MBF was formed and Stavropoulos was asked to serve as its CEO and Chairman. In the beginning MBF’s founders expected the new organization to serve as the owner of both a future minor league team and a baseball stadium. They envisioned that MBF would function as a social enterprise ― a tax free non-profit that invests its earnings in charitable activities. In 2005 MBF hired Tom Dickson, owner of the Lansing Lugnuts minor league team, as a consultant, and through him in September 2005 MBF negotiated the purchase of the Southwest Michigan Devil Rays of nearby Battle Creek, Michigan. As MBF awaited approval of the sale by the Midwest League, it sought to register with the federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. The IRS was unwilling to grant a professional baseball team a tax-free status. As a result, MBF’s founders created the Michigan Baseball Operation (MBO) – a separate, independent taxable non-profit – and MBO became the owner of the Devil Rays in early 2006, when the purchase of the team was finalized. During the 2006 baseball season, the Devil Rays continued to play in Battle Creek, while a stadium was being built for them in Midland. At the end of the season the team’s name was changed to the Great Lakes Loons. ‘’Dayton Daily News’’ (Ohio) 5 April 2017 Meanwhile rapid progress was made in constructing a ballpark in Midland. On 11 April 2006 MBF started construction of the stadium on land in downtown Midland that had been donated by Dow Chemical. Dow also paid for the naming rights to the new ballpark, which became known as the Dow Diamond. Construction ended in early 2007, in time so that the Great Lakes Loons could take the field for their first home game on 13 April. Construction of the Dow Diamond cost $34 million, more than the average for a minor league stadium. However, the Dow Diamond is fitted out with many attributes and amenities not generally associated with minor league baseball, e.g., a solar panel powered scoreboard, water bottle fill-up stations, a concourse that can be enclosed for events, and free wi-fi available everywhere. In 2007 Ballpark Digest recognized the Dow Diamond as the best ballpark of the year. Stadium Journey has consistently given it high ratings. Current activities Today MBF is earning revenues from the operation of the Dow Diamond as both a baseball stadium and as a venue for many different private events, such as wedding receptions, concerts, and meetings. MBF donates profits from the Dow Diamond to support such youth organizations as a girls softball league, the local 4-H association, and the Midland soccer club. 2016 Form 990 for the Michigan Baseball Foundation In addition, it provides funding for economic development and community improvement. For example, it is a key supporter of Momentum Midland, a group of projects presently underway that aim to improve Midland’s downtown area. Within the framework of Momentum Midland public recreational facilities are being built along the Tittabawassee River; pedestrian and bike access is being created to downtown Midland, and business activity is being encouraged in the downtown area.

It is a shrub with simple, papery leaves and bright pink flowers, usually arranged singly in the leaf axils. Description Boronia chartacea is a shrub that grows to a height of with young branches that are hairy. The leaves are papery, elliptic to oblong, long and wide on a petiole long. The leaves are covered with warty glands and the edges are turned downwards or rolled under. The flowers are bright pink and are arranged singly or in groups of up to three in leaf axils, each flower on a stalk long. The four sepals are egg-shaped, long, wide and hairy on the lower side. The four petals are long. Flowering occurs from August to October and the fruit is a smooth capsule. Taxonomy and naming Boronia chartacea was first formally described in 1990 by Peter H. Weston and the description was published in Telopea from a specimen collected near Urunga. The specific epithet (chartacea) is a Latin word meaning \\"of paper\\", referring to the leaves that are papery and brittle when dried.

Benning is a biogeochemist studying mineral-fluid-microbe interface processes. She is a Professor of Interface Geochemistry at the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam, Germany. Her team studies various processes that shape the Earth Surface with a special focus on two aspects: the nucleation, growth and crystallisation of mineral phases from solution and the role, effects and interplay between microbes and minerals in extreme environments. She is also interested in the characterisation of these systems, developing in situ and time resolved high resolution imaging and spectroscopic techniques to follow microbe-mineral reactions as they occur.  Education  She studied geology and petrology at the University of Kiel, completing her Vordiplom (~ BSc) in 1987. She moved to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich for her graduate studies, earning a Diplom (~ MSc) in Petrology / Geochemistry in 1900 and a PhD in aqueous geochemistry in 1995. Her PhD, supervised by Terry Seward, was in experimental aqueous geochemistry with a focus on the solubility of gold in aqueous sulfide solutions. She joined Hu Barnes at Pennsylvania State University as a postdoctoral researcher in 1996, holding a Swiss National Science Foundation international fellowship.  Research and career  She moved to the University of Leeds as a University Research Fellow in 1999. During her tenure at Leeds, she carried out low to hydrothermal geochemical and biogeochemical studies, with a special focus on laboratory experimental research. She always also did field studies with a special focus on elucidating how life adapts to extremely hot or cold environments. She designed, tested and deployed instrumentation that will look for life in these environments, like on the surface of Mars. She analysed the microbes found within samples collected in the arctic, extracting their genetic information. She became a Professor in Leeds in 2007 and has since investigated a number of fundamental environmental challenges. In 2009 she won a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award. She has been involved with the development of synchrotron techniques, establishing the mechanisms of mineral interactions in situ. She and her team worked on the nucleation of iron sulphides, which regulate and control geochemical iron and sulphur in the environment. In 2014 Liane G. Benning was appointed Head of Interface Geochemistry at the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences and became a professor at the Free University of Berlin in April 2016. At the GFZ she leads the Potsdam Imaging and Spectral Analysis Facility (PISA). In 2016 she was awarded the Mineralogical Society Schlumberger Medal and the Geological Society Bigsby Medal. She and her team have studied the Greenland ice sheet, investigating how the albedo varies due to interactions of microbes and particulates. She is one of the PI's on a large Natural Environment Research Council project that aims to understand how dark (black) particles and microbial processes (bloom) impact ice sheet melting. Whilst it was assumed that the low albedo on glaciers, which is typically attributed to soot or dust, is actually due to microbial populations, the Black and Bloom team identified that the darkest areas on the surfaces of the ice sheet are home to the highest number of microorganisms. Furthermore, Benning looks to investigate the growth and spread of microorganisms in a warming climate. She has studied the succession of microbes from ice to vegetated soils. Her research combines geochemical, mineralogical and molecular microbiological analysis and produces data that is than used in computational models, allowing researches to model the growth of microbial populations in response to soil temperature and sunlight. In 2017 she was elected to the European Academy of Sciences, Academia Europea, and in 2018 to the German National Academy of Sciences, Leopoldina. She serves on the editorial board of the European Association of Geochemistry journal Geochemical Perspectives Letters. She has collaborated on projects with the NASA Astrobiology Institute.

Early life Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and Delano's sister, Sara Delano Roosevelt in Newburgh, New York, in 1905. Delano was born at Algonac, the family estate in Balmville near Newburgh, New York in 1852. He was a member of the Delano family as a son of prominent opium trader, Warren Delano Jr. (1809–1898), and Catherine Robbins (née Lyman) Delano (1825–1896). Among his siblings were younger sister Sara Ann Delano (the mother of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt) and younger brother Frederic Adrian Delano, a railroad president. His paternal grandfather was Captain Warren Delano Sr., who was involved in the New England sea trade, and his maternal grandfather was Judge Joseph Lyman of Massachusetts. His paternal uncle, Franklin Hughes Delano, was married to Laura Astor, a daughter of William Backhouse Astor Sr. and sister of John Jacob Astor III and William Backhouse Astor Jr. (husband of the Mrs. Astor). Reportedly, Laura was the favorite granddaughter of John Jacob Astor, the founding family patriarch who was America's first millionaire. In his youth, he was reportedly barred from his best friend Dick Aldrich's home, Rokeby, for spiking the punch at one of Aldrich's mother's parties (Margaret Aldrich, the wife of Richard Aldrich). Delano attended and graduated from Harvard University in 1874, where his future wife attended private art classes. Career Delano served as the president of the Delano Coal Company, one of the largest coal operations in Pennsylvania. Delano was known as a subsidiary of the Lackawanna Steel Company. Delano Coal owned the Buena Vista Furnace, a hot blast iron furnace built in 1847, that by the time it was acquired in 1901, consisted of of coal land in Indiana and Cambria counties. He also served as vice president of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. In 1901, Delano founded Wehrum, Pennsylvania, a non-union company town for the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company, which contained 230 houses, a hotel, company store, jail, bank, post office, school, and two churches. Wehrum was the largest town of what is now a series of ghost towns along the \\"Ghost Town Trail\\" that were abandoned when the mines declined and closed in the 1930s (the mines were eventually sold to the Bethlehem Mines Corporation in 1922). He also founded Vintondale, Pennsylvania in Cambria County, and served as the President of Vinton Colliery Company and mayor of the town. As of his death in 1920, Delano was a director of the Union Mining Company, served as president of the Delano Coal Company, and was chairman of the board of the Vinton Colliery Company. Personal life In 1876, Delano was married to Jean \\"Jennie\\" Walters (1853–1922), much to her father's disappointment and discouragement as Jennie was his only daughter and companion following her mother's untimely death while abroad in 1862. Jennie was the daughter of William Thompson Walters, a merchant and art collector, and the sister of Henry Walters, who formed the Walters Art Museum from their father's collection. Together, they lived in Orange, New Jersey, then New York City, before moving to Rhinebeck-on-Hudson, and were the parents of seven children, five of whom survived to adulthood, one son and four daughters: * Warren Delano V (1877–1882), who died young. * Lyman Delano (1883–1944), who married Leila Chapin Burnett (1886–1936) in 1908. * Ellen Walters Delano (1884–1976), who married philanthropist Frederick Baldwin Adams (1878–1961). * Jean Walters Delano (1889–1953), who married George Harold Edgell (1887–1954), a director of the Boston Fine Arts Museum, in 1914. * Laura Franklin Delano (1885–1972), who did not marry and was a close friend of Helen Huntington, the first wife of Vincent Astor. Laura was also the inspiration for the character of Madge Telfair in Thomas Wolfe's novel, Of Time and the River. * William Walters Delano (1892–1892), who died in infancy. * Sara Delano (1894–1983), who married Roland Livingston Redmond (1892–1982). On September 9, 1920, Delano was killed when the horse he was riding frightened by an approaching New York Central train, dashed onto the tracks at Barrytown, killing him instantly. His widow died two years later in 1922. His funeral was held at Steen Valetje in Barrytown and was attended by his nephew Franklin, then the Democratic vice presidential candidate. Steen Valetje residence In 1875, Delano inherited Steen Valetje (which means \\"little stone valley\\" in Dutch), the estate built in 1851 for his uncle, Franklin Hughes Delano, as a wedding gift using land from the Astor's nearby Rokeby estate, who died childless. In 1881, Delano hired New York architect Thomas Stent to expand the property. At Steen Valetje, Delano moved his family and devoted himself to breeding horses. At the time of his death, he had a stable of 65 horses, including saddle and driving horses and heavy draft horses, and was an officer of the Springbrook Driving Park Association. His son Lyman inherited Steen Valetje and his family kept the home until 1966 when it was sold outside of the family.

Others say his conviction has nothing to do with proselytizing for a cult, saying he has had “illegitimate” sexual relations with women and has comitted “sodomy”. Taheri was interrogated again in the summer of 2014 on charges of corruption on earth, and was eventually sentenced to death in court in May 2015. The UN high commissioner for Human Rights called this death sentence an “absolute outrage”. Support for the death penalty came from a vote by some scholars: Makarem Shirazi, Safi Golpayegani and Alavi Gorgani considered Taheri an apostate. The reasons for this apostasy included considering imams as fallible, ridiculing the Mahdism, promoting incarnation theory and touching a female patient's hand during treatment. Taheri's admirers and students engaged in many activities for his freedom and the sentence has been changed to five years' imprisonment and a 900 million Toman fine. United Nation Human Rights condemned Taheri's imprisonment many times in its reports during his arrest period. He was due to be released on February 7, 2016, after serving a full five-year sentence and paying the fine, when he was prevented from being released on new charges being brought. Branch 26 of the Revolutionary Court, presided over by Judge Ahmadzadeh, convicted Taheri on charges of corruption on earth on February 27, 2017; this conviction was overturned by Branch 33 of the Supreme Court for the second time. He was charged with corruption on earth for the third time in August 2018 by Judge Abolqasim Salavati in Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court on a charge of five years' imprisonment; this charge should have been re-examined by the appeals court, but this never took place. In September 2018 Taheri was charged again with apostasy, false propaganda and association and collusion against national security.

The place was the very southern tip of Manhattan island in the time of the Dutch Colonization of what became New Amsterdam there. The people were a band of the Wappinger native to southwest Westchester County known as the Weckquaesgeek, who controlled the upper three- quarters of the island as a hunting grounds. As was common practice early in the days of European settlement of North America, a people came to be associated with a place, with its name displacing theirs among the settlers and those associated with them, such as explorers, mapmakers, trading company superiors who sponsored many of the early settlements, and officials in the settlers' mother country in Europe. Because of this early conflation there is enduring confusion over whether \\"Manhattoe/Manhattoes\\" were a people or a place. There is certainty it was a place, at the very tip of Manhattan Island, so referred to by the Dutch,Letter from Stephen Goodyear to Peter Stuyvesant, 19 July, 1652, addressed to him at \\"The Manhattoes\\", Correspondence 1647-1653, Charles Gehring, The New Netherlands Institute, p. 189The Standards of the Manhattoes, Pavonia, and Hell-Gate, David B. Martucci, 2011, p. 786 who evidently inherited the Native American name for the spot they chose to place their settlement (rather than named it after a people already living there, as the island was not permanently inhabited at the time of their 1609 arrival nor Peter Minuit's subsequent purchase of it from the Canarse Indians for $24 in 1639). Period accounts maintain that Manhattan island was used as a hunting ground by two tribes, the Canarse (Canarsee, or Canarsie) of today's Brooklyn at its southern one-quarter and the Weckquaesgeek the rest, each having no more than temporary camps for hunting parties. Manhattoes/Manhattans (place) The \\"earliest depiction of Manhattan\\" (c.1630) shows Fort Amsterdam on what it calls the \\"Manhatans\\" on the very southern tip of today's Manhattan island Manhattoes was the name of a Dutch settlement in New Netherlands in the early decades of their settlement there in the 1600s. Located at the very southern tip of today's Manhattan Island, it was known by the native term by both the Dutch and the English who wished to displace them.Peter Stuyvesant, the Last Dutch Governor of New Amsterdam, John S. C. Abbott, 2004. \\"The next morning, which was Saturday, Colonel Nicholls sent a delegation of four men up to Fort Amsterdam, with a summons for the surrender of \\"the town situated on the island commonly known by the name of Manhattoes, with all the forts thereunto belonging.\\" Fort Nieuw Amsterdam was built in 1627, but the common name held fast. Eventually, by the time of the incorporation of the settlement, the fort's name displaced the original, and \\"Manhattoes\\" became Nieuw Amsterdam in 1653. The terms Manhattans and Manhatans were also used for the Manhattoes by some Dutch, giving rise to Manhattan island's contemporary name and conflation with a people (the Wecquaeskgeek) who neither occupied that part of the island nor went by that name. Manhattoe/Manhattan (people) thumb|300px |This 1685 revision of a 1656 map erroneously indicates \\"Wickquaskeck\\" in Westchester County above Manhattan island and \\"Manhattans\\" on it Manhattoe, also Manhattan, was a name erroneously given to a Native American people of the lower Hudson River, the Weckquaesgeek, a Wappinger band which occupied the southwestern part of today's Westchester County. \\"He sits by his fireside in the ancient city of the Manhattoes...,\\" Wolfert's Roost and Miscellanies, Washington Irving, p. 19 In the early days of Dutch settlement they utilized the upper three-quarters of Manhattan IslandMoby Dick, Herman Melville, Chapter 1, reprinted in \\"Melville Depicted City of ‘Manhattoes’ Lured by the Sea,\\", New York Times, July 5, 1976, p. 13\\"Brooks, ponds, swamps, and marshes characterized other portions of the island of the 'Manhattoes',\\" The Memorial History of the City of New York, James Grant Wilson, New York, 1892 as a hunting grounds.

It was released on February 16, 2018 under Easy Eye Records. The album was partially inspired by, and pays tribute to, the 2016 Oakland Ghost Ship warehouse fire. Production The album was recorded over a ten day period in January 2017 at producer Dan Auerbach's Easy Eye Sound Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Release Shannon and the Clams announced the release of their fifth studio album on December 7, 2017. Music videos On December 8, 2017, the music video to \\"The Boy\\" was released. Directed by Ryan Daniel Brown, it features vocalist Cody Blanchard travelling along a country road. Andrea Domanick from Vice said the song is \\"a sparkling, hook-laden track that immediately gets under your skin with its wall-of-sound chorus, rife with crisp guitar strums, cascading riffs, and raw harmonies led by vocalist-guitarist Cody Blanchard.\\" On February 1, 2018, the second music video \\"Backstreets\\" was released. Blanchard explained the song: \\"It was one of the last things we wrote for the record. It had a completely different hook at first and nobody liked it except our keyboard player Will [Sprott] and we tabled it, but Will saw promise there and really wanted it to make the album. At the final rehearsals before leaving for Nashville, he suggested we just keep the verses and mash the song together with this other glammy hook I had written (the half-time ‘takin’ the backstreets…’ part) that needed verses to go with it and we all loved the weird combo.\\" Critical reception Onion was met with \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 81 based on 8 reviews. Aggregator Album of the Year gave the release a 71 out of 100 based on a critical consensus of 7 reviews. Mark Deming of AllMusic said of the release: \\"Onion is mature and contemplative compared to Shannon & the Clams' earlier efforts, but it's music that comes from a place of celebration and love, and these songs will make you dance and sing along\\". Hal Horowitz from American Songwriter gave the album four out of five stars, explaining \\"The 13 tracks sprint to a conservative 42-minute finish and the styles, although clearly retro, are varied enough to make the set seem even shorter.

C. Baramki, (1909, Jerusalem - 1984, California, United States) was a Palestinian archaeologist who served as chief archaeologist at the Department of Antiquities of the Government of Mandatory Palestine from 1938 to 1948. From 1952 until his retirement, he was the curator of the Archaeological Museum at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, where he served as a professor of archaeology. Biography Dimitri Baramki was born in Jerusalem, then in the Ottoman Empire's Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, to a Palestinian Christian family. He studied at St. George's School, Jerusalem. He was appointed Student Inspector, Special Grade, in the Department of Antiquities of the British Mandate government from September 1927.Official Gazette of the Government of Palestine, No. 202, January 1, 1928, p. 30. At the beginning of 1929 he was promoted to Inspector.Official Gazette of the Government of Palestine, No. 244, October 1, 1929, p. 1008. In 1934, he completed his academic studies at the University of London. From 1938 to 1948 he served as chief antiquities inspector in place of Robert Hamilton, who was appointed director of the department. During his years in Palestine, Baramki published many articles, mainly in the Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine (QDAP) journal, on various sites - from the Bronze Age tombs to Byzantine churches. In 1937, Baramki was the first person to identify the in situ Ayyubid text in the village mosque of Farkha, dating to 606/1210.Sharon, 2004, pp. 188 -200Sharon, 2005, pp. 127–140 From 1934 to 1948 he conducted excavations and investigations at Hisham's Palace in Jericho. Baramki found the graffiti that mentions Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik and accordingly dated the construction of the palace (a statement that was later rejected) to the years of his rule (724-743), contemporary to Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi in Syria. Baramki's doctoral thesis, submitted in 1953 to the University of London, dealt with Umayyad architecture and relied on the findings of his excavations at Hisham's Palace. As part of his work in the Jericho area, Baramki discovered the Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue in 1936. At the end of the British Mandate in May 1948, Dimitri Baramki led Jerusalem's Rockefeller Museum for a short time. Spoke about his appointment as head of the Department of Antiquities of the West Bank on behalf of the Jordanian government, but he found his place at the American School of Oriental Studies in Jerusalem as a consultant and librarian. In 1950 and 1951 he continued his excavations in the Jericho area on the mission of the American James Leon Kelso. In 1952, Baramki was invited to serve as curator of the Archaeological Museum at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, where he taught until his retirement in 1975.

Early life and education Cade was born on January 10, 1928 in San Angelo, Texas, to parents Ernest and Ethel née Bomar Cade. Ernest was a lawyer, while Ethel was a homemaker. As a child, Cade read a 1937 National Geographic article \\"Adventures with Birds of Prey\\", written by Frank and John Craighead, that piqued his interest in falconry. Cade served in the Army in 1946 and 1947 before attending university. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in biology from the University of Alaska in 1951. He then attended the University of California, Los Angeles, where he graduated with his master's degree in 1955 and his PhD in 1957. Career Cade was hired to a faculty position at Syracuse University after he finished his education. There, he experimented with breeding raptors such as the peregrine falcon and American kestrel, convincing the administration to build a breeding facility especially for the falcons. When offered a job at Cornell University, he accepted on the condition that it, too, would build a breeding facility. In 1967 Cade became the director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology; the \\"Hawk Barn\\" was completed in 1970. The peregrine falcon was severely affected by exposure to DDT, leading to its extirpation from the East Coast of the United States. Cade worked with various stakeholders including universities, falconers, conservationists, and businesses to begin a captive breeding and reintroduction program. The program was relatively novel, as few other falconers had succeeded in breeding the falcons in captivity: Renz Waller twice in the 1940s, Frank Beebe in 1967 (disputed), and Larry Schram in 1968. The difficulty stemmed from the falcon's courtship ritual, which involves an aerial display, usually over of sky. Cade's Hawk Barn was described as a \\"virtual Peregrine Falcon factory\\" for its role in captive breeding success. He also was a founder of The Peregrine Fund, a nonprofit credited as \\"the world’s most important raptor conservation organization\\". Efforts of The Peregrine Fund and other conservation groups resulted in more than 6,000 captive-bred falcons released into the wild from 1975 to 1995. The falcons were released into 37 US states and most of the Canadian provinces. To ensure that the captive-born birds were able to adapt to conditions in the wild, they used soft releases: the young falcons would be placed in artificial nests in the wild and fed by humans until they were able to hunt successfully. In 1980, captive-born birds successfully reproduced in the wild for the first time. The species's North American population steadily increased at 5–10% annually, allowing for population recovery. The peregrine falcon was removed from the US Endangered Species List in August 1999, and Cade was recognized as a \\"savior\\" of the species. He later worked at Boise State University, from which he retired in 1993. Personal life and death In 1952, Cade married Renetta Mae Bennewater. Together, they had five children. Cade died on February 6, 2019 at the age of 91 in Boise, Idaho. Awards and honors In 1998, Audubon magazine included Cade in their list of 100 \\"Champions of Conservation\\". After Cade's death, the Idaho House of Representatives introduced a resolution to honor him, calling him \\"one of the world's most visionary conservationists and widely respected scientists\\".

Summary  Tomb of Annihilation centers around the Deathcurse, a wasting disease that slowly kills anyone who’s ever been raised from the dead and prevents anyone who has died from being raised, and the Soulmonger artifact that caused the disease. \\"The narrative of the campaign begins with the group being hired by Syndra Silvane, a wealthy former adventurer who is afflicted with the Deathcurse. Her sources have tracked the Soulmonger to the ancient jungles of Chult. [...] At its core, Tomb of Annihilation follows a classic quest structure. The party has an objective, a deadline—Silvane is slowly dying, so each day the party spends exploring brings her closer to permanent death—and a sprawling expanse of dangerous wilderness stands in their way\\". This adventure module is designed to take player characters from 1st level to 11th level. The table of contents lists the follow sections: * Dramatis Personae * Introduction * Chapter 1: Port Nyanzaru * Chapter 2: The Land of Chult * Chapter 3: Dwellers of the Forbidden City * Chapter 4: Fane of the Night Serpent * Chapter 5: Tomb of the Nine Gods * Appendix A: Character Backgrounds * Appendix B: Random Encounters * Appendix C: Discoveries * Appendix D: Monsters and NPCs * Appendix E: Player Handouts * Appendix F: Trickster Gods of Omu * Stat Blocks  Publication history  The new module was announced in June 2017 during the Stream of Annihilation livestreamed event on the Wizards of the Coast's Twitch site. Tomb of Annihilation was released on September 8, 2017 as a 256-page hardcover book. It was also released as a digital product through the following Wizards of the Coast licensees: D&D; Beyond, Fantasy Grounds, and Roll20. Tomb of Annihilation was inspired by the classic adventure module Tomb of Horrors, \\"a lethal dungeon made by D&D; co-creator Gary Gygax himself\\". Polygon reported that \\"Wizards of the Coast enlisted more playtesters to try the Dungeons & Dragons Tomb of Annihilation module than any adventure it has released before. Why? Because they were afraid no one would survive it\\". The module's setting of Chult in the Forgotten Realms was last explored in the 2nd edition of Dungeons & Dragons. In October 2017, Kotaku reported that Chris Perkins \\"said that no black writers or consultants worked on Tomb of Annihilation\\". On the book's design, Perkins said “We didn’t want to create a city that felt backward...It’s a tale of Chultans reclaiming their own city and land and redefining who they are and moving way from the idea of warring tribes to a more business-minded culture. [...] The land that they live in is a savage land. That’s just part of what Chult is. It’s a place of monsters. It was our intention to show the Chultans have not only survived it, but have risen above it—that they have dispelled the warring tribal nature that previously defined them and are now actually thriving\\". On June 17, 2020, in the wake of the George Floyd protests, Wizards of the Coast announced: \\"When every D&D; book is reprinted, we have an opportunity to correct errors that we or the broader D&D; community discovered in that book. Each year, we use those opportunities to fix a variety of things, including errors in judgment. In recent reprintings of Tomb of Annihilation and Curse of Strahd, for example, we changed text that was racially insensitive. Those reprints have already been printed and will be available in the months ahead. We will continue this process, reviewing each book as it comes up for a reprint and fixing such errors where they are present\\".  Related products  The 7th season of D&D; Adventurers League was themed around the Tomb of Annihilation storyline. It includes an adventure module that acts as a hook to lead into the book, \\"Tier 1 and 2 adventures [that] expand on Tomb of Annihilation’s story and set the stage for Tier 3 and 4 play, which pick up right after the characters complete the hardcover adventure\\". The 14th expansion of the Neverwinter video game aligned the free-to-play massively multiplayer online role-playing game with the Tomb of Annihilation storyline including a new campaign, a new dungeon and two new zones. WizKids, a Wizards of the Coast licensee, released 44 pre- painted miniatures that correspond with the adventure including the lich Acererak. In October 2017, WizKids released a Tomb of Annihilation themed board game which can be played as a standalone game or can be combined \\"with the other D&D; Adventure System Cooperative Play Board Games\\".  Reception  In Publishers Weekly's \\"Best-selling Books Week Ending October 2, 2017\\", Tomb of Annihilation was #14 in \\"Hardcover Nonfiction\\" and sold 7,152 units. Alex Springer, for SLUG Magazine, reported that the \\"Tomb of Annihilation is the type of campaign that can bring out the best—or worst—in a dungeon master\\" and highlighted mechanics such as new character backgrounds, exploration checks, the jungle themed creature appendix, and the lingering threat of permadeath due to the Soulmonger artifact. Springer wrote \\"When stacked up against Storm King’s Thunder, Tomb of Annihilation feels blessedly streamlined and adventure-focused. There are no politics to navigate, no sieges to weather—it’s just a deep dive into an unforgiving wilderness to destroy an artifact that can’t be destroyed\\". Cameron Kunzelman, for Paste, highlighted that the adventure is unique compared to previous modules and that the jungles of Chult are designed to try and kill you. Kunzelman wrote \\"However, it is important to note that the jungles and dangers also have a slight feel of 'darkest Africa' to them, and the Chultan people are dark-skinned. The narrative beats in Tomb pull heavily from familiar sources like Edgar Rice Burroughs or Jules Verne, and those works have a long racialized history that is not often grappled with. [...] While the literary and visual content Tomb borrows from makes for interesting design and visuals, I think Wizards could have done more to interrogate those texts that they borrowed from and how they have a complicated past with general representations of 'Africa' writ large\\". Cecilia D'Anastasio, for Kotaku, highlighted that the adventure uses \\"dated stereotypes of African cultures\\" and themes of colonialism which date back to the creation of the Chult setting. D'Anastasio wrote \\"Here’s the rub: While many players I talked to enjoyed how the history and political structures of Chult were expanded in Tomb of Annihilation (and enjoyed the adventure’s plot generally), they were still unimpressed by its execution. Its setting is an amalgamation of African cultures, a trope frequent in 20th century media that flattens the dimensionality of human experiences on the continent, which contains hundreds of ethnic groups\\".

It was established by the 4,000-member Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI) in 1993. The festival is typically a five-day session for songwriters including nights of \\"songwriter in the round\\" shows held at 10 or so venues around the city, usually Nashville's top singer/songwriter hotspots. The festival is not about country music per se — it includes all genres of music, and features both professional and amateur composers in the U.S. and abroad. The name was derived from Tin Pan Alley, a district of Manhattan near West 28th Street, where music publishers flourished as far back as 1885. As of 2019, Tin Pan South is \\"the world's largest songwriter festival\\" according to the Nashville Convention & Visitors Corporation. Seminars Tin Pan South songwriters seminar in Nashville, Tennessee – March, 2019 The Tin Pan South Songwriting Seminar is usually held during the Monday and Tuesday of the festival and includes keynote speakers, songwriter panels of successful composers, publisher breakout sessions and networking opportunities. Topics such as \\"effective co- writing\\" are typical, as is \\"dealing with rejection\\". Each venue has two shows per night. At a symposium, writers can get critiques of their songs. Attendees entrance fees cover most of the nightly shows, which are open to the public, but performances by top songwriters or performers at larger venues, like the Ryman Auditorium are extra. In 2018, the keynote speakers were Kacey Musgraves and Shane McAnally. Previous speakers have been Gordon Lightfoot (\\"Sundown\\"), Merle Kilgore (\\"Ring of Fire\\") and Donna Summer (\\"Dim All the Lights\\"). The 2001 festival, for example, featured Ray Parker Jr. (\\"Ghostbusters\\") and Andrew Gold (\\"Thank You for Being a Friend\\", the theme from the NBC sitcom The Golden Girls ). The festival goers are well aware of the millions of dollars that songs may earn. Speaking about the festival in 2001, BMI's Charlie Feldman said, \\"Songs like \\"This Kiss\\" (Faith Hill) or \\"I Swear\\" (John Michael Montgomery and All-4-One)... could generate in a year and a half or two years upward of a half-million dollars\\". Some of the former attendees who have gone on to writes successful songs include: Jon Vezner (Where've You Been – Kathy Mattea); Tia Sillers (I Hope You Dance – LeAnn Womack); Barry Dean (Pontoon – Little Big Town); and Lance Carpenter (Love Me Like You Mean It – Kelsea Ballerini). Festival sponsors Sponsors of the event have included American Songwriter Magazine, Folk Alliance International, corporate donors and performing-rights organizations such as BMI, SESAC and ASCAP. NSAI Senior Director of Operations Jennifer Turnbow said, \\"We offer artistic reinforcement while presenting the truth about the music industry\\". Turnbow stated, \\"...one thing that has never seemed to change over the years, though, is that a well- written song is a well-written song, so I think the relevance of learning the art and craft of songwriting is timeless.” The Nashville Songwriters Association International The NSAI is a non-profit songwriters trade association including both professional and amateur songwriters and all genres of music. The organization raises money, in part to support lobbying efforts in Washington to be advocates for fair reimbursement for songwriters, but this is not their main goal, according to Bart Herbison, former executive director. \\"We don't raise vast amounts of money with this [festival]\\", he said, \\"because there are a lot of costs involved...we do it to showcase the art form and the artists\\". In 2008, NSAI took ownership of The Bluebird Cafe, Nashville's landmark music-listening venue founded by Amy Kurland in 1982.

She was particularly active in organizations devoted to young people and to education, and was the first African American woman on the board of trustees at Eastern Washington University, where she was instrumental in securing EWU's admission as a member of the Big Sky Conference in 1987.Board of Trustees Minutes, February 21, 1992. Board of Trustees Records, University Archives & Special Collections, Eastern Washington University, Cheney, WA. http://dc.ewu.edu/trustees_minutes/174 She also served on the board of trustees at Whitworth College. Early life Eleanor's grandfather, Peter Barnabas Barrow, was born a slave in Virginia.Interview with James and Eleanor (Barrow) Chase, November 2, 1972, Black Oral History Interviews, 1972–1974, Washington State University Libraries' Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections (MASC) He fled to freedom and \\"fought for the Union army as they marched through the South.\\" He served in the state legislature representing Vicksburg, Mississippi during Reconstruction for two terms. An old friend named Fred Wilson had come to Spokane in 1886 and started a farm in Deer Lake, so Peter decided to follow him in 1889 or 1890, the year of or the year after the Great Spokane Fire. Upon moving to Spokane, he became a minister and helped establish Calvary Baptist Church, Spokane's first black church. Her grandmother's name was Julia Barrow, and they had six sons and one daughter. Peter died in a streetcar accident in Tacoma where he had gone for a church gathering; he died before Eleanor was born. Eleanor's father, Charles, was thirteen or fourteen at the time of the move. He got a job for The Spokesman- Review as a boy as a \\"printer's devil\\", or helper. He became a printer and editor and learned his trade at the Old Spokane Business College. He owned the Quality Printing Company and started a newspaper, the Spokane Citizen, which he edited from 1908 to 1913. Although the Citizen ceased publication in 1913, the printing company continued until Charles Barrow's death in 1950. Eleanor Elizabeth Barrow was born December 21, 1918, in Spokane, Washington. She attended Edison Grade School, and graduated as valedictorian at Libby Junior High, where she also ran track. She attended Lewis and Clark High School, where she ranked very high academically and was also a guest soloist for the Honor Society and a member of the school's glee club, the high school girl reserves, and the Phyllis Wheatley Club. She served as president of the Young People's Fellowship of St. Thomas, where she was also an organist. Barrow graduated with honors from Lewis and Clark High School in 1937. Barrow began her college education at Washington State College and graduated in 1941 from Whitworth College, where she received a bachelor's degree in Music (Voice and Piano), graduating magna cum laude.Chase Family Papers, Ms 159, Box 5, File 10, Eastern WA State Historical Society, Spokane, WA Professional career Although her talent as a singer was sufficient that she had envisioned pursuing it as her career, after her marriage to James Everett Chase in 1942 and the birth of their son, Roland, the following year, she elected to remain a homemaker while the boy was young. Once Roland reached middle school, Chase entered the workforce, working as a social worker for the Spokane office of the State Department of Public Assistance from 1954–1970, and as an adoption and juvenile court officer for dependent children at Spokane Juvenile Court from 1970–1979. She was praised for her advocacy: one of the judges who presided over cases in which she testified later commented that \\"Eleanor has always been very pro-children and an advocate of good parenting skills. I never knew a client who was less than impressed with her.\\" Her contributions in this line of work led to the naming of the Eleanor Chase House, a work release program for women in Spokane. Service as a trustee at Eastern Washington University and Whitworth College Eleanor Chase was appointed to Eastern Washington University's Board of Trustees on March 19, 1979, and her initial appointment lasted until March 12, 1985. She served a second term, which ended in 1992. Chase was the first woman of color on the board of trustees, replacing Jerome Page, who had been Eastern's first black trustee. During one of her two terms as the Chair of Eastern Washington University's Board of Trustees, the university acquired what would come to be known as the Spokane Center, which housed Master's programs in Public Administration, Computer Science, and Communication Studies. In a report given by Trustees Chair Jean Beschel, Chase was also credited as being instrumental in Eastern Washington University's acceptance into the Big Sky Conference. Previous to her appointment to the board at Eastern, she served on the Board of Trustees for Whitworth College, her alma mater. Civic involvement Chase was very active in Spokane municipal and community organizations, serving as a member (and often a board member) of a range of organizations that included the local YWCA, the Spokane Zoological Society, the Altrusa Club, the North Spokane Business and Professional Women, the Race Relations Council, and the local chapter of the NAACP. She served on Deaconess Medical Center's ethics committee, was director of the Spokane Centennial Committee, and was the Grand Worthy Matron of the Prince Hall Grand Chapter, Order of Eastern Star. In the spring of 1988, she received an award from Spokane's Optimist Club as a \\"Friend of Youth\\". In a 1991 magazine profile, Chase reflected on her many service projects, and noted that she was \\"proudest of ... her involvement with the K-12 Education Strategies program of Momentum 91. Her committee is concentrating on early childhood development and has just formed an early childhood information and coordination center to help businesses identify resources for employees with children.\\" Personal and family life When Barrow was 15, she met Jim Chase (who later became Spokane's first African American mayor). After graduating from Whitworth College, the two were married in 1942 at Holy Trinity Episcopal Church in Spokane's West Central neighborhood. Their son, Roland, was born a year later. It was well known locally that Chase was a talented singer in her youth and throughout her time as a music student at Whitworth.

Her topics have ranged from financial inclusion lifting poverty, mobile money implementation, the link between financial inclusion and economic growth, gender and income discrepancies, to the digital revolution and female labour force participation.  Research and academic work  Klapper's primary research fields include: Behavioral economics, consumer finance, digital payments, entrepreneurial finance, financial inclusion, risk management, and supply chain finance. Much of Klapper's work explores the relationship between an economy's involvement in the financial system and how this effects income, growth, and wellbeing. She explores an economy's financial involvement in many different ways ranging from what being an active member in the formal financial system signals to an employer, to how financial inclusion disproportionately grows and affects people across gender, geography, and wealth. Her research has been cited in 18,205 published and working papers, as well as being cited in press such as The New York Times, The Economist, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, and Forbes. Klapper's most prolific works include The Global Findex Database 2017: Measuring Financial Inclusion and the Fintech Revolution and Entrepreneurship Snapshots 2010: Measuring the Impact of the Financial Crisis on New Business, both of which were published with the World Bank. Klapper has also contributed chapters to many different books on topics ranging from banking and financial inclusion in developing economies to entrepreneurship and its effect on firm formation. Her current working papers include examining how civil conflict affects firm performance, the effectiveness of government delivery of goods and services, and benefits from illiquid savings products.  Select scholarship  \\"The Global Findex Database 2017: Measuring Financial Inclusion and the Fintech Revolution\\" Under the supervision of Asli Demirgüç-Kunt, Klapper oversaw a team of Dorothe Singer, Saniya Ansar, and Jake Hess to create a database and report that summarizes global financial inclusion as a result of the financial technology revolution. The report documents account ownership by economy, areas lacking banking infrastructure, how different economies make payments, how accounts are used, the amount of saving, credit, and financial resilience, and the opportunities that are arising for promoting financial inclusion due to the rise of the digital era. The Global Findex Database has had over 40,000 press citations since being founded by Klapper in 2011. The report was compiled using surveys of more than 150,000 adults over the age of 15 in over 140 economies, giving detailed results of how adults in these economies access accounts, make payments, borrow, and manage risk. The authors note that this data is important since it has been found that access to financial technology like mobile money services can increase income earning potential, and that these benefits are even more pronounced for women. This access to mobile money services in Kenya enabled women to increase their savings and investments by more than one-fifth and reduce extreme poverty in women-led households by 22%. The report found that the global share of adults that own a bank account is 69%, which is up from 62% in 2014 and 58% in 2011. This equates into 515 million adults worldwide who have gained access to financial tools to help grow the economy. Klapper and the report note that this gain was most prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa where 21% of adults now have a mobile money account, almost double what the 2014 report showed. It was also found that the financial technology improvements have led to 52% of adults having sent digital payments, 10 percentage points higher than the 2014 value, with significant gains in China where 57% now use financial technology to pay bills, double the 2014 value. Importantly, the report notes that women lag significantly behind men globally in their financial inclusion gains; 65% of women have opened accounts, compared to 72% of men. Klapper also points out that there is a disparity in financial inclusion across income levels. Financial participation was 13 percentage points higher in the wealthiest 60% of household incomes, evident in the 200 million rural people in China outside of the formal financial system. \\"Entrepreneurship Snapshots 2010: Measuring the Impact of the Financial Crisis on New Business\\" Leora Klapper along with Inessa Love led a team of Elena Cirmizi, Caroline Giraud, and Douglas Randall to create a report documenting new business sector growth from 2004–2009 to give insight into factors that spur private sector growth across different economies. Like the Global Findex Database, this database was founded by Leora Klapper in 2004. The report measures entrepreneurial activity in 112 developing and high income economies to answer the following 4 questions: 1\\\\. How does firm creation vary around the world with the level of economic and financial development? 2. What is the relationship between entrepreneurship and business development? 3. How did the financial crisis affect entrepreneurial activity in the formal sector? and 4. What factors determined how severely the crisis affected new firm creation? This is based on Klapper, Laeven, & Rajan's 2004 study which shows that a high entry rate of new businesses equates to higher competition in the economy as well as higher economic growth. The paper's main data collected is the density of new business entry, measured by the number of newly registered limited liability firms per 1,000 people of working age (15-64), collected directly from the registrar. The paper notes that this is an effective measure but is only able to capture the formal financial sector even though much of the production in some economies lies in the informal financial sector. The paper finds a discrepancy across income levels of countries, namely that high-income countries had more than 4 new business registered per 1000 people, while low- medium and low income countries had less than 1 per 1000 people. The paper discusses that this largely could be due to the factors that come with being a high income country. Specifically, the paper notes that there is more dynamic business creation when there is also stable legal and regulatory regimes, efficient business registration systems, flexible employment regulations, and low corporate tax rates. The paper also determines that due to a sharp increase in the scarcity of credit and an uncertain future economic outlook following the 2008 financial crisis there was a sharp drop in registration rates in countries affected by such - namely countries with strong formal financial sectors. \\"Financial Inclusion and Inclusive Growth: A Review of Recent Empirical Evidence\\" Asli Demirgüç-Kunt, Leora Klapper, and Dorothe singer review the evidence presented in their Global Findex Database (2014; 2017) to explore some of the conclusions made and resulting challenges to reaching greater financial inclusion and future direction for the field. The authors propose that financial inclusion can reduce poverty by helping people invest in their future towards education and new businesses, smooth their consumption by having more efficient and safer transactions, as well as educating and helping people manage their financial risks involving loss of employment or the death of a breadwinner, hopefully making it so fewer people fall into poverty initially as well. The paper documents the transition in economic theory worldwide over the past decade from a focus on microcredit loans in developing countries to a focus on account ownership, savings, payment methods, and insurance in these countries. The paper points to the findings from the Global Findex Database (2014; 2017) that show account ownership worldwide is 69%, however this paper notes discrepancies across economies in that high-income OECD countries have account ownership of 94% while developing countries only have 54%. It is also found that while in high- income OECD countries there is no discrepancy across gender, in developing countries there remains a 9 percentage-point difference. The authors go further to note that among these developing regions there are enormous disparities; account penetration is only 14% in the Middle East, while in East Asia and the Pacific account penetration is 69%. The importance of a mobile money account is also explored in this paper and the authors report that while, of global account owners, 60% only have an account at a financial institution, 1% have a financial account and a mobile money account, and 1% only have a mobile money account. Interestingly, this stat is much different in Sub-Saharan Africa and Kenya where 23% and 58% of adults have a mobile money account respectively. When discussing the benefits of financial inclusion and digital payment later it is reported that this relatively high prevalence of mobile money accounts should help in promoting potential economic benefits. The paper dedicates a section towards discussing the benefits of financial inclusion in developing countries and why this can largely explain the shift in economic thinking away from micro-loans towards financial inclusion. Many of the benefits are borne out of replacing cash payments for digital payments through accounts, whether this be payments from or to governments or banks, it is reported there are benefits for all sides. Based on the findings in the Global Findex Database (2014; 2017), high-income OECD countries make 95% of payments using digital methods while in the developing world 90% of utility payments are still made in cash, as well as other non-utility payments still being made majority in cash. The paper reveals that shifting from cash payments to digital payments reduces the cost of making and receiving payments. This cost saving was revealed to be large enough in developing countries to feed an agricultural-based family of 5 for a day. The authors also point to a Niger study which showed that the government switching to digital payments reduced total costs of making and receiving payments by 20% annually. In South Africa this switch reduced payment costs by two thirds of the original level, and in Mexico this equated to an annual saving of 1.3 billion dollars (USD). The benefits are not only borne in cost saving but also in increasing the security of payments made. Klapper et al. argue that the opportunity for crime on digital payments is less and therefore the incidence has also been reduced, as seen in the US as overall crime has reduced by 10% from 1995-2015 as social payments became digital rather than cash. Corruption is also reduced through digital payments as there is less opportunity for illegal kickbacks, as reported in Argentina when kickbacks to illegal benefactors were reduced from 4% to 0.03%, and in India they fell by 47%. It is also reported that creating a trail of payment history through digital account payments helps someone have better availability to credit and make large payments later on. \\"Financial Inclusion Through Savings: Commitment Devices, Mobile Money, and the Role of Trust\\" This paper by Emily Breza, Martin Kanz, and Leora Klapper explores the dynamic between employer and employee and the role that an employee investing in savings and financial accounts linked with the firm has with their likelihood to receive investment or promotion. The paper suggests that by investing in a financial option put forward by the company an employee can signal that they are responsible, willing to accept advice, and committed to the firm for a long- term career. The authors create a study to examine this by offering a presentation of a financial savings account linked with the firm to all employees who demonstrate a willingness to save, and then give managers of the firm different profiles of employees regarding information including their decision to invest or not. The study takes place in Bangladesh at a large manufacturing firm due to the high turnover and transitory characteristics of employees. The financial product offered is a simple commitment savings product with a 1-5 year commitment horizon with payments being automatically taken out of your payroll bi-weekly and the highest value being reached with the longest (5-year) term and penalties for terminating the contract early. There were several different versions of the presentation given to employees who had plans to save. The first presentation was only the basic presentation containing only information about the savings product. The second presentation included a stipulation that the savings product was endorsed by the employer. The third presentation included a stipulation that an employee's decision would be shared with the employer, and the final presentation contained all 3 pieces of information. It was found that the information that the employer endorsed the product had no effect on the probability of an employee choosing to sign up or not. This piece of information was only effective when it was combined with the fact that the employee's decision would be shared with the employer, increasing the probability an employee would sign up for a commitment to the savings product. It was also found that the commitment length an employee would sign up for is consistent with the same influencing pieces of information, leading the researchers to believe that workers were choosing a length based on signalling commitment and not just based on learning of the savings product benefits. In terms of the effect on management decisions, the researchers used 56 floor managers to review 16 employee profiles each and choose one for promotion or choose employees to invest extra training in. On each employee profile there was a mix of information shown on the form, whether that be no financial decision, some financial decision, or full information of length and choice of commitment. It was found that showing that an employee chose to sign up for the commitment did not make being chosen for a promotion more likely. However, this choice to sign up for the commitment made it more likely that they were chosen to receive managerial investment in extra training, specifically 8 percentage points more likely to receive investment (64% increase over baseline probability). There was also a large difference found between the likelihood of receiving training between those who chose a 5-year commitment and those that chose a 1-year commitment. Specifically, those who chose a 5-year commitment were 14.7 percentage points more likely to receive the investment (118% over baseline), with the difference between long and short commitments being statistically significant at the 5% level. \\"Salary Delays and Overdrafts in Rural Ghana\\" This paper explores two common costly forms of payments that are especially widespread in developing economies: payday loans and overdrafts. Developing economies are likely to have these common forms of payment due to increased uncertain of payment schedules from employers to employees. The authors note that this is a problem since employees end up shouldering the cost of employers' inefficiency in making payments. To determine the effect of these inefficient payment schedules the authors gathered data from the North Volta Rural Bank in Ghana. Ghana is a good study area since developing economies are more severely affected and just over 500,000 public sector employees receive digital payments from the government, many of which are late according to the paper. In 2017 it was determined that there was US$167 million in outstanding late payments that have yet to be paid in Ghana. The paper's analysis covered 320 salaried workers (90% public sector) with the North Volta Rural Bank. Overdrafting was charged a flat rate of GH₵ 5 and 18% of the over drafted amount in Ghana. It was found that the year before the study 58% of the people in question had taken out an overdraft, equating to a rate on average of US$104, or 42% of the average monthly salary. It was also found that people who take out overdrafts are more likely to be men, be more educated, less likely to live with seniors in their home, and are more likely to be in low- paying public sector jobs. The authors find that if the last salary payment was late, it was 3 percentage points more likely to overdraft that month, with more than a 10% increase in the average overdraft rate. The discrepancy across public and private sectors was high with 40% of worker months having a late salary for public sector workers, and only 13% of working months for private sector employees. The authors conclude that in Ghana public sector employees have to bear the majority of the late salary costs associated with increased delays in payments. \\"Incentivizing Calculated Risk-Taking: Evidence from an Experiment with Commercial Bank Loan Officers\\" Shawn Cole, Martin Kanz, and Leora Klapper (2012) explore how risk taking and effort can be incentivized in commercial loan officers in order to determine optimal incentive schemes in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis which saw an incredible amount of sub- prime loans defaulted on. In order to do such, the authors recruited loan officers from leading Indian commercial banks who would come in after-hours to review 14,000 actual credit applications. The loan officers evaluate the applications, fill out a risk-evaluation form, and then make a recommendation on whether the loan should be granted or not - which is later compared to the actual performance outcomes of the loans. The loans are composed of small business working capital loans with a value less than US$10,000. Four main problems arise in this environment which spurred the questions regarding this paper; First, effort of loan officers is difficult to quantify and observe by bank executives. Second, loan officers are protected by limited liability of loan performance. Third, loan officers have a different time horizon and higher discount rates then firm executives. Finally, the loan environment is high risk and there is a disconnect between the loan officer and the return from the loan, all of which lead to high information asymmetry and high opportunity for moral hazard problems. Three main incentive schemes are evaluated in this paper: volume-based incentive schemes that reward origination, low-powered incentive schemes that reward origination and are conditional on performance, and high-powered incentive schemes that reward performance but penalize loan officers on defaults. Deferred payment schedules were also evaluated given the asymmetry in time horizon and discount rates between officer and firm. Volume-based incentives that reward origination were found to generate more loans but with lower average quality, measured by returns and default rate. Performance-based incentive schemes were found to result in a greater screening effort by the loan officer, reduced exposure to loans with higher credit risk, and significantly more profitable loan decisions with only slightly less quantity of loans given out. When comparing low-powered incentives with high-powered incentives it was found that high- powered incentives increased the probability of detecting a 'bad' loan and increased profits per loan by up to 3.5% of the median loan size. Compared to the same standard, volume-based incentive schemes were found to reduce profits per loan by up to 5% of the median loan size, as expected. Given the increased effort exerted under performance-based incentive schemes, it is found that risk assessment is inflated by as much as 0.3 standard deviations, regardless of the actual asset quality. It was also found that loan officers under these schemes were more likely to inflate all features, even those hard to quantify like the applicant's character based on their brief background and business overview. Differed compensation was found to reduce effectiveness of incentive schemes pointed at making loan officers exert more effort. It was found that a 3-month delay on the incentive pay reduced the screening effort by 5-14% and there was a corresponding decrease in quality of loan performance. Differed compensation, however, was found to moderate the negative effect of volume- based incentive schemes by reducing the officer's incentive to short-sightedly give out many loans. This problem could also be corrected by relaxing the limited liability constraint, which has a similar effect as giving officers equity in the loan, resulting in more conservative loans being awarded.

She conceived the idea of the Woman's Home Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and as its corresponding secretary for nearly twenty years, she helped to shape its policies. Rust is remembered as a woman of vision. Early years and education Elizabeth Lownes was born in Baltimore, Maryland, 1835. She was of Scotch and Welsh ancestry. Her parents, Josiah B. and Anna Burdsal Lownes, were Quakers. For several generations her ancestors were members of the society of Friends. Among those ancestors were several teachers and preachers. After leaving Maryland, the family removed to Montgomery County, Ohio, and settled on a farm near Centerville, Ohio. Elizabeth's siblings included William S., Miriam, Rebecca, and Susan. Rust graduated from Cooper Seminary in Dayton, Ohio in 1853. Later, she studied art. Career Elizabeth Lownes Rust During the Civil War, she was president of a branch of the United States Sanitary Commission. She developed a strong taste for art, and for several years was engaged as Instructor in Art in the Cincinnati Wesleyan Female College during its earlier history. She gained some recognition as an amateur artist and portrait painter, and in 1871, went abroad for further study. In Paris and Rome, she enjoyed special opportunities under the guidance of Madam Marjoli, the sculptor, and Jules Richomme, the painter. In Paris, she had friendly relations with the families of Edmond de Pressensé and Nicholas Sylvester Bercier, the Protestant divines. On her return to the United States, her future was bright. Richard Sutton Rust In 1875, she married Rev. Richard Sutton Rust. D. D., LL. D. and henceforth, she became actively identified with the Methodist Episcopal Church, of which her husband had long been a minister. He was for several years the Corresponding Secretary of the Freedmen's Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Her marriage gave her unusual opportunities and incitements in humanitarian work. With him, she provided philanthropic work among the recently emancipated slaves, and traveled through the South. Rust College is named after Rev. Rust. In 1876, Rust organized a philanthropic movement for the African Americans of Cincinnati, which continued its usefulness for several years. In 1877, she took an active part in the charitable work of the city, proposing plans to aid the poor and control vagrancy. From these early years, she was connected with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, anxious to cast her influence on the side of temperance and purity movements. She became identified with many local philanthropies, securing the employment of matrons at police stations, and women to take charge of the female wards of prisons. Because of this latter interest, she was appointed by the mayor one of the managers of the female department of the City Workhouse. She urged for the admission of industries into the regular course of the public schools, which was put into action. Rust was a co-founder, in 1880, of the Woman's Home Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. It promoted the welfare of the Freedmen, through teaching, providing provisions, and imparting to them the knowledge of good housekeeping and self-care. Rust aided in organizing this Society, and for many years served as its Corresponding Secretary. Correspondence often kept her busy until the early hours of the morning. Leaflets and letters were constantly being created to broadcast the needs of the cause and the suggestive remedies. Visiting nearly every field where the society was laboring, her reports were full of interesting facts. Rust Hall The Lucy Webb Hayes National Training School for Missionaries and Deaconesses, located at Washington, D.C., was the most important enterprise of the society. The location of the school on North Capitol Street afforded ample space for enlargement, and this occurred with the erection of Rust Hall, located near the place where she was born. For three years, while she was sick, suffering from weakness and difficulty in breathing, her sickroom became the center of her work. She dictated hundreds of letters pertaining to the welfare of the society. In 1895, Rust founded the Civic League. A veteran organizer, she held conferences with circles of ladies, and the board of officers was carefully chosen. Rust died of cancer in Cincinnati, October 3, 1899, after a long and painful illness, and was buried at that city's Spring Grove Cemetery.

He is a conservative and favors funding for building new schools, is against tax increases, and wants to expand county roads. Dolezal has also been noted for his altruism. In February 2019, Georgia Senate majority whip Steve Gooch named Dolezal as deputy whip; Dolezal stated he was \\"humbled by the trust that Senator Gooch has placed in me.\\" Dolezal also is Vice Chair of the Science and Technology Committee and a member of the Education and Youth Committee, the Health and Human Services Committee, the Government Oversight Committee, and the Reapportionment and Redistricting Committee. Dolezal is a founder and partner at Forsyth County-based technology company Renewed Vision, which was founded in 2000 and makes live production software called ProPresenter used by megachurches, the International Olympic Committee, Chick- fil-A, and Mercedes-Benz. He is also an owner and board member of Catalyst Nutraceuticals and a founder of Passion City Church. Elections Primary and general elections, 2018 In 2018, Dolezal faced two opponents in the Republican primary elections for Georgia State Senate district 27; the other challengers were Bill Fielder and Brian Tam. On May 22, Dolezal won the primary with 59% of the vote. In the general election in November, Dolezal was challenged by Democratic candidate Steve Smith for Michael Williams' seat, but Dolezal ultimately defeated Smith with over 70% of ballots cast. Personal life Greg Dolezal lives in Forsyth County with his wife and four children.

Education  Jones-Rogers attended Rutgers University, earning a BA in Psychology in 2003, and a Masters in 2007. She was awarded a PhD in History in 2012. Her doctoral thesis was \\"Nobody couldn't sell'em but her\\" slaveowning women, mastery, and the gendered politics of the antebellum slave market. Her PhD was supervised by Deborah Gray White and examined by Thavolia Glymph. In 2013 her doctoral research won the Lerner- Scott Prize, which is given annually by the Organization of American Historians for the best doctoral dissertation in U.S. women’s history.  Career  Jones-Rogers began her career at the University of Iowa as Assistant Professor in the departments of History and Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. She was a Post-doctoral Fellow in Law and Society at Tulane University, 2013–14. She held the Harrington Faculty Fellowship in the History Department at the University of Texas-Austin, 2018–19.

Her first book was published in 2019 by Yale University Press. They Were Her Property challenges previous depictions of white antebellum women as only minimally involved in the institution of slavery, onlookers to male relatives' active practice of enslaving African-Americans. Jones-Rogers draws on court records and oral histories to show the active role white women play in enslavement, both on a day-to-day basis and in the buying and selling of slaves, for their personal economic gain. Jones-Rogers demonstrates that white women exercised extraordinary control over the enslaved people in their households and had a deep economic investment in slavery. The book was described as 'scrupulous', 'focused', and 'crisp'.  Awards and honors  They Were Her Property was one of five finalists for the L.A. Times Book Prize in History, 2020. It won the award, announced on 17 April 2020. Jones-Rogers was the first African American and the third woman to receive the Prize in History. The book was also shortlisted for the 2020 Lincoln Prize in February 2020, with seven other books chosen out of 110 submissions.

It is the sequel to Skyward and second in a planned series of four books. It was published by Delacorte Press on November 26, 2019. Plot summary Spensa and the DDF have pushed the Krell war into space; Spensa's cytonic \\"defect\\" has been a key advantage in the war. Cobb, now the DDF admiral, is worried that humans will lose unless they manage to steal a Krell hyperdrive, as the Superiority is sending increasing numbers of warships into battle. Rodge and the engineers discover footage showing a creature known as a 'Delver' consuming and destroying the first inhabitants of Detritus - Spensa recognizes it as the eyes that she sees in the Nowhere when using her cytonic powers. A cytonic alien named Alanik crash lands on Detritus and cytonically implants her destination into Spensa's mind. Spensa learns that Alanik was traveling from her own backwater world to a Superiority space station called Starsight to train as a pilot. Using M-Bot's holographic technology, Spensa disguises herself as Alanik and, using Alanik's coordinates, teleports herself, M-Bot, and Doomslug to Starsight. Spensa poses as Alanik in order to infiltrate the pilot program and steal a hyperdrive. Spensa quickly finds herself caught in a political game between Cuna, a dione government minister, and Winzik, head of the department that is battling Spensa and her people. Spensa is put into a training flight consisting of the misfit dione Morriumur, Captain Hesho and his crew of tiny kitsen, the figment Vapor, and a rare Superiority human, Brade. The pilots are being trained specifically to fight delvers, which can be drawn into this realm by overuse of cytonics. The humans summoned delvers which destroyed numerous planets during a past war, and while these delvers are long since gone, there is suspicion that they may soon reappear. Spensa befriends all her flightmates except the stand-offish Brade, and she and the group frequently run training exercises on a fake delver maze (the delver's core). Back on Detritus, Jorgen begins manifesting cytonic powers. Spensa builds a small drone with M-Bot's help and sneaks it into a battleship engine room. She recovers the drone and learns that the Superiority hyperdrives (which don't attract delvers) are powered by slugs like Doomslug. Spensa is caught by Cuna, but Spensa realizes that Cuna is actually pushing for species integration and peace with the humans in the government. Spensa reveals her true self to Cuna, and the two agree to potential peace talks. Winzik mobilizes the pilots against the Detritus humans in a bold political move. Spensa reveals herself to Brade, trying to earn Brade's trust, but Brade ousts Spensa, and she is forced to flee to her home planet, abandoning M-Bot. The Superiority arrives and a battle commences; Spensa realizes that Winzik and Brade are plotting to summon a delver and frame the humans for it. As the battle rages, Spensa enlists Vapor and Hesho's crew to stop Brade from summoning the delver. However, Brade kills Hesho in a dogfight and they are too late to stop her from summoning the monstrous creature. A desperate Spensa cytonically redirects it to Starsight instead. Realizing what she has done, Spensa teleports herself, Vapor, and the surviving kitsen to Starsight, where they are joined by Morriumur. Morriumur is able to guide Spensa to the heart of the delver maze, where she is able to send the delver back to its own realm before it destroys the station. On Detritus, Jorgen uses his cytonic ability to discover a hidden cavern filled with hyperdrive slugs. Spensa is cared for on Starsight, where she and Cuna are optimistic for successful peace talks. However, Winzik throws a coup and frames Spensa for multiple murders. Spensa helps Cuna to safety, and recovers Doomslug and M-Bot, who has transferred his consciousness to the drone as Winzik's forces dismantled him. With Winzik's forces closing in, Spensa and her companions escape into the Nowhere.

Recent years have indicated both regional and club rugby in Wales is in financial crisis, with sides such as Neath RFC closely defeating a liquidation order and Ospreys at risk of losing key players in 2019 and the 2019/20 season ahead. A number of proposals are reportedly being mooted by the Union to reestablish Welsh rugby union as a competitor for nearby rivals such as the Irish Rugby Football Union and English Rugby Football Union whose sides have seen financial growth and test match success. The Professional Rugby Board is reported to have concluded that the Ospreys and Scarlets should merge to form a west Wales super team in the pro 14, making room for a north Wales team affiliated to RGC 1404.  Background  Rugby union in Wales is the national sportFields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881-1981, David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) pp41 and is considered a large part of national culture. The sport is today managed by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) which formed in 1881. The main domestic competition in Wales is the Pro14, in which Wales have four regional sides in the competition: Ospreys, Cardiff Blues, Scarlets and Dragons. The sides also compete in the Europe-wide European Rugby Champions Cup, European Rugby Challenge Cup, and Anglo-Welsh Cup. Since the regionalisation of professional Rugby Union in Wales, the national team has undoubtedly experienced great success, with some attributing this to the regional concept. The regions have been reasonably successful in the Pro12 (renamed Pro14 from 2017–18 forward), with Welsh teams winning on six occasions. The Ospreys are one of the most successful team in the history of the league with four titles (just short of the record five titles held by Leinster as of 2018). However, the Welsh sides have made little impact in the European Cup, with no team getting further than the semi-finals. A desire for success in Europe had been one of the principal reasons for setting up the regions in the first place.  2013 dispute  The regions currently operate on a 2009 Participation Agreement which expires in 2019. The regions in 2013 protested against a new agreement, as they felt it did not offer any funding commitments or clarity regarding competitions such as the Heineken Cup. The Union retorted that funding would increase but that regions would need to commit to the framework or risk losing their revenue streams.  2018 rumoured solutions  In 2018 the WRU launched Project Reset to review regional arrangements. Faced with the financial dominance of French Top 14 and English Premiership Rugby sides, the WRU have in recent years increased salaries to bring Welsh international players such as Taulupe Faletau, Dan Biggar, Ross Moriarty, and Rhys Webb back into the Welsh league system. Yet the Union now feel the salary arrangements are unsustainable. The WRU has established a Professional Rugby Board, composed of representatives from both the WRU and the regions, to discuss the proposed changes.  Proposal 1 - Merge Scarlets/Ospreys and Blues/Dragons  Under one proposal, the region system would decrease from four sides to two. Ospreys and the Scarlets would merge, as would Cardiff Blues and Dragons. Such proposals face widespread opposition from sections of supporters whose local loyalties would prevent them from travelling to traditionally 'rival' grounds to follow their team, standing in the terraces with their bitter rivals. Yet opponents of the proposal have pointed to the struggles of the Scottish rugby union team in test fixtures since switching to a two-region model dominated by Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors.  Proposal 2 - End the Dragons franchise or move it to North Wales  As the poorest performing franchise, the WRU have reportedly discussed moving the Dragons franchise to North Wales, or closing it altogether. This would be challenging given the side's contractual commitments, and its guarantees to ground share at Rodney Parade with Newport RFC and EFL League Two side Newport County A.F.C. until 2021. The WRU have proposed the resulting space then be filled by a North Wales side taking the place of Conwy-based, semi professional RGC 1404. In recent years Dragons have improved their attendances however, so such a move is considered highly controversial and financially ineffective. The WRU nonetheless own both the team and the ground, so have strong control over the franchise's future. A regional rugby franchise, originally known as Rygbi Gogledd Cymru (Welsh language for \\"Rugby North Wales\\") and later known as RGC 1404, was established in North Wales; plans called for the side to enter the Welsh Premier Division as early as 2010–11 and eventually the Celtic League/Pro12, but the venture was unsuccessful and was liquidated in 2011. The team, however, continues to play as part of Wales' national rugby academy. RGC 1404 also had a partnership with Rugby Canada by which the franchise would have a secondary role of developing players for the Canada national rugby union team, at least until enough local players were developed to fill a complete competitive squad.  Proposal 3 - Merge Cardiff Blues and Ospreys  As the most successful side in Pro14 (previously Celtic League) history, Ospreys now face significant issues, with reports of debts and stalled contract negotiations threatening their claim to players such as Alun Wyn Jones and head coach Allen Clarke. Managing director Andrew Millward had described the struggle, involving year long budget cuts and structural flaws in the Welsh rugby system, as leaving Wales unable to compete with rivals IRFU and FRR. Facing a merger with Cardiff Blues however, Ospreys supporters have pushed back, arguing that the removal of the Ospreys franchise from the Swansea region would leave one of Wales' rugby heartlands without a local region side, instead forced to travel to their rivals ground at Cardiff Arms Park. Blues supporters also point to the fierce battle their side won to remain in their traditional Cardiff RFC colours and name back in 2003, and are unwilling to adopt a new identity.  Proposal 4 - Merge Ospreys and Scarlets  More recent discussions have punted merging western sides Scarlets and Ospreys, with the Llanelli and Swansea teams either sharing grounds or moving fully. Scarlets opposed such a merger with Ospreys back in 2003, with the late Stuart Gallacher famously opposed to any arrangement which would have ended the Scarlets name. A report by the BBC indicated that the Professional Rugby Board concluded the Ospreys and Scarlets should merge, to play as early as next season (2019-20). The Irish Times report that it was agreed that current players contracts will be honoured, with Scarlets head coach Brad Mooar and Ospreys boss Allen Clarke serving in coaching roles at the new side. Venues would be split, with Guinness Pro 14 fixtures played at Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli, European games at Swansea’s Liberty Stadium, and the Ospreys Llandarcy training ground as the chosen training site. Formation of a north Wales Pro 14 side would then be possible.  Result  As of 6 March, a statement by Scarlets indicated that the talks to merge with Ospreys had broken down, with the Llanelli side no longer interested in the deal. As a result, the PRB will continue its discussions of all options.

RoessinghHartmans, Banning Early career Banning had not been politically active before the outbreak of the First World War, but that event motivated him and his future wife to start studying the works of Karl Marx and Karl Kautsky, as he blamed \\"capitalism' for the war. He also became a member of the SDAP in 1914. In 1917 (still a student at Leiden) he was appointed predikant (minister) of the congregation of the Dutch Reformed Church in Borculo. In 1920 he became the minister of the Sneek congregation as successor of the Christian-socialist G. Horreüs de Haas. Meanwhile, in 1916 he and his wife had come in contact with a Dutch group of alumni of the Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre. This group formed the Arbeidsgemeenschap der Woodbrookers (Labor community of Woodbrooke alumni) in 1919 of which Banning became chairman. The main aim of the Woodbrookers was to form a link between Socialism and Christianity. Because of his contacts in both the SDAP and the world of Christian socialists Banning soon became the main spokesman of the latter group within the SDAP. In 1928 he resigned his position as minister and took up his theological studies again. In 1929 he received his Doctorandus degree in theology from Leiden University and started work on a dissertation. In 1931 he published that dissertation about the philosophy of the French Socialist Jean Jaures, entitled Jaures als denker (Jaures as thinker). Political career In 1929 Banning had been appointed executive director of the Woodbrookers society. He also organised a Congress of Christian socialists in this period that attracted 600 participants. The leadership of the SDAP was keen to encourage this development and Banning was elected a member of the party's governing body in 1931, and of its executive committee in 1935. In this period he was instrumental in developing a constitutional programme of the SDAP, published in 1935 under the title Het staatkundig stelsel der sociaal-democratie (The constitutional system of social-democracy), and of a new political manifest of the party that was adopted at the 1937 Congress. However, he resigned from the executive committee in protest of the decision to formally abolish the party's pacifist stance in 1937, in reaction to the rise of Nazism as a force that threatened Dutch democracy.Banning was a principled pacifist who rejected the Nazi ideology, but could not in good conscience support a re-armament policy; Hartmans, Banning He remained a member of the governing body until 1939 when he became editor of the party's ideological publication Socialisme en Democratie (Socialism and Democracy). After the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940 the German occupation authorities soon made his work impossible, also because he published a number of anti-German pamphlets. In 1942 he was arrested and interned as a hostage in the Gymnasium Beekvliet in Sint-Michielsgestel, together with a number of other prominent Dutchmen. This group of anti-Nazi politicians used their internment to plan a political reform of the Dutch party system for the post-war period. The pre-war system was characterised as a system of Pillarisation that fragmented the Dutch political landscape. The internees resolved to bring an end to this fragmentation. Immediately after Liberation in 1945 Banning, together with a number of other politicians of different parties, such as Willem Schermerhorn, Piet Lieftinck, Jan de Quay, E.M.J.A. Sassen, and Hendrik Brugmans, formed the Nederlandse Volksbeweging as a movement to bring about what was called the Doorbraak (Breakthrough) of the Pillarisation system. This movement was a main force in bringing about the fusion of the SDAP with two other pre-war political parties, the Free-thinking Democratic League and the Christian Democratic Union, to form the Partij van de Arbeid (PvdA). Banning was chairman of the founding Congress of this party on 9 February 1946, and he also gave the main address. Though the hoped for doorbraak did not take place, the PvdA played a major role in the post-war part of Dutch 20th-century political history, and Banning for a while became its \\"house ideologue\\" as editor of Socialisme en Democratie. He coordinated the formulation of several of the PvdA's political manifests in 1947 and 1959, and drafted the official reaction of the party to the Dutch bishops' 1954 advice to Dutch Roman Catholics to vote for the Catholic People's Party. Academic career Already during his internment in the Second World War Banning, under the influence of his fellow hostage Brugmans, had become interested in the philosophy of Personalism, as developed by the circle around the French literary periodical Esprit. He wrote a book that he published after the war under the title De dag van morgen. Schets van een personalistisch socialisme, richtpunt voor de vernieuwing van ons volksleven (The day of tomorrow. Design of a personalistic socialism, target for the renewal of our popular life) in which his own version of this philosophy was expounded. He also took the initiative to the foundation of an institute for the promotion of the renewal of the Dutch Reformed Church that received the name Kerk en Wereld (Church and World); he became its director for many years. He also was appointed in a chair for Sociology of Religion at Leiden University. Declining health forced him to resign many of his functions after 1958. The last ten years of his life he drifted into an isolated position. He died on 6 January 1971 in Driebergen.

In the following, f(t) is a rational expression in \\\\sin t and \\\\cos t. In order to calculate \\\\int f(t)\\\\,dt, consider the integrand \\\\omega(t)=f(t)\\\\,dt. We consider the behavior of this entire integrand, including the <math display=\\"inline> dt, under translation and reflections of the t axis. The translations and reflections are ones that correspond to the symmetries and periodicities of the basic trigonometric functions. Bioche's rules state that: # If \\\\omega(-t)=\\\\omega(t), a good change of variables is u=\\\\cos t. # If \\\\omega(\\\\pi-t)=\\\\omega(t), a good change of variables is u=\\\\sin t. # If \\\\omega(\\\\pi+t)=\\\\omega(t), a good change of variables is u=\\\\tan t. # If two of the preceding relations both hold, a good change of variables is u=\\\\cos 2t. # In all other cases, use u=\\\\tan(t/2). Because rules 1 and 2 involve flipping the t axis, they flip the sign of dt, and therefore the behavior of ω under these transformations differs from that of ƒ by a sign. Although the rules could be stated in terms of ƒ, stating them in terms of ω has a mnemonic advantage, which is that we choose the change of variables u(t) that has the same symmetry as ω. Examples Example 1 As a trivial example, consider ::\\\\int \\\\sin t \\\\,dt. Then f(t)=\\\\sin t is an odd function, but under a reflection of the t axis about the origin, ω stays the same. That is, ω acts like an even function. This is the same as the symmetry of the cosine, which is an even function, so the mnemonic tells us to use the substitution u=\\\\cos t (rule 1). Under this substitution, the integral becomes -\\\\int du. The integrand involving transcendental functions has been reduced to one involving a rational function (a constant). The result is -u+c=-\\\\cos t+c, which is of course elementary and could have been done without Bioche's rules. Example 2 The integrand in ::\\\\int \\\\frac{dt}{\\\\sin t} has the same symmetries as the one in example 1, so we use the same substitution u=\\\\cos t. So ::\\\\frac{dt}{\\\\sin t} = \\\\- \\\\frac{du}{\\\\sin^2 t} = \\\\- \\\\frac{du}{\\\\ 1-cos^2 t} . This transforms the integral into ::\\\\int - \\\\frac{du}{1 - u^2}, which can be integrated using partial fractions, since \\\\frac {1}{1-u^2} = \\\\frac {1}{2}(\\\\frac{1}{1+u}+\\\\frac{1}{1-u}). The result is that ::\\\\int \\\\frac{dt}{\\\\sin t}=-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ln\\\\frac{1+\\\\cos t}{1-\\\\cos t}+c. Example 3 Consider ::\\\\int \\\\frac{dt}{1+\\\\beta\\\\cos t}, where \\\\beta^2<1. Although the function f is even, the integrand as a whole ω is odd, so it does not fall under rule 1. It also lacks the symmetries described in rules 2 and 3, so we fall back to the last- resort substitution u=\\\\tan(t/2). Using \\\\cos t=\\\\frac{1-\\\\tan^2(t/2)}{1+\\\\tan^2(t/2)}, and a second substitution v=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1-\\\\beta}{1+\\\\beta}}u, this leads to the result ::\\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}t}{1+\\\\beta\\\\cos t} = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\beta^2}}\\\\arctan\\\\left[\\\\frac{(1-\\\\beta)\\\\sin t}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\beta^2}(1+\\\\cos t)}\\\\right] + c.

It is located at a distance of circa 60 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 2964 is about 60,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on December 7, 1785.NGC 2964 cseligman.com There is evidence that the galaxy has a weak bar running across the minor axis of the galaxy. The galaxy has four spiral arms, two emerging from ansae at each end of the bar and the others emerging near the centre of the bar, with the arms emerging from the ends of the bar being of higher surface brightness. All but the west arm have knotty appearance. The outer parts of the galaxy present twisted stellar kinematics, but otherwise the rotation is quite regular. Spiral dust lanes have been observed running towards the centre, where star formation possibly takes place. A circumnuclear ring observed in [OIII]/H-beta could be the site of active star formation. Another indication of a nuclear star forming ring is the detection of double peaked carbon monoxide emission lines. The central region of the galaxy has a stellar population of young-intermediate age, probably created by constant starburst activity that lasted for about 5 billion years. The total star formation rate of NGC 2964 is estimated to be about 4 per year. The nucleus of NGC 2964 appears to feature HII region activity. The spectrographic study of the nucleus revealed double peaked emission lines, which can be attributed to an ionisation cone created by an active galactic nucleus. In the centre of NGC 2964 is believed to lie a supermassive black hole whose upper mass limit is estimated to be between 1.4 and 24 million . NGC 2964 is the brightest galaxy in a galaxy group known as the NGC 2964 group. Other members of the group include NGC 2968, NGC 2970, NGC 3003, NGC 3011, NGC 3021. Other nearby galaxies include NGC 3118, NGC 3067, NGC 3032, NGC 3026, and their galaxy groups. NGC 2964 forms a non-interacting pair with NGC 2968, which lies 5.8 arcminutes away. A hydrogen bridge has been found to connect the two galaxies, while a tail extends towards NGC 2970.

So far, the method has been demonstrated to work with only a few proteins per cell. As such, it provides an additional layer of information for the same cell by combining both proteomics and transcriptomics data. For phenotyping, this method has been shown to be as accurate as flow cytometry (a gold standard) by the groups that developed it. It is currently one of the main methods, along with REAP-Seq, to evaluate both gene expression and protein levels simultaneously in different species. The method was established by the New York Genome Center in collaboration with the Satija lab.  Applications  Concurrent measurement of both protein and transcript levels opens up opportunities to use CITE-Seq in various biological areas, some of which were touched upon by the developers. For instance, it may be used to characterize tumor heterogeneity in different cancers, a major research field. It also permits identifying rare subpopulations of cells as a high-throughput single-cell method and thus detect information otherwise lost with bulk methods. It also may aid in tumor classification - for example, identification of novel subtypes. All of the above are possible due to single- cell output of both protein and transcript data at the same time, also leading to novel information on protein-RNA correlation. It also has potential in an immunology. For example, it can be utilized for immune cells characterization–a recent research on T-cells has investigated the ability of T cells to maintain an effector state. Another study by one of CITE-Seq coauthors suggested CITE-Seq as a methods to look at the mechanisms of host- pathogen interactions.  Workflow  CITE-seq, like any other sequencing technique, has a wet lab portion, where the actual antibodies are prepared, cells stained, cDNA synthesized and RNA libraries are prepared that are further sequenced, and a dry lab portion for analysis of the sequencing data obtained. The most crucial part in the wet lab experiments is designing the antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates and titrating the amount of each conjugate that needs to be present in the pool to achieve a desired read-out and quantification. 627x627px  Wet lab workflow  The first step involves preparation of the antibody-oligo conjugates also known as _A_ ntibody- _D_ erived _T_ ags (ADTs). ADT preparation involves labeling an antibody directed against a cell surface protein of interest with oligonucleotides for barcoding the antibody. Once you have the ADTs, the next step is to bind the cells with the desired ADT pool. The scRNA-seq libraries can be prepared using Drop-seq, 10X Genomics or ddSeq methods. In brief, ADT labelled cells are encapsulated within a droplet as single cells with DNA-barcoded microbeads. Within a droplet, the cells are next lysed to release both bound ADTs as well as mRNA. These then are converted to cDNA. Each DNA sequence on a microbead has a unique barcode thus indexing cDNA with cell barcodes. cDNA is prepared from both ADTs and cellular mRNAs. In the next step, based on the developer's guidelines, cDNA is PCR-amplified and ADT cDNA and mRNA cDNA are separated based on size (generally, ADT-derived cDNAs are < 180bp and mRNA-derived cDNAs are > 300bp). Each of the separated cDNA molecules is independently amplified and purified to prepare sequencing libraries. Finally, the independent libraries are pooled together and sequenced. Thus, proteomics and transcriptomics data can be obtained from a single sequencing run. 627x627px  Dry lab workflow  Analysis of single-cell sequencing presents many challenges, such as determining the best way to normalize the data. Due to a new level of complications that arise from sequencing of both proteins and transcripts at a single-cell level, the developers of CITE-Seq and their collaborators are maintaining several tools to help with data analysis. scRNA- Seq data analysis based on the developer's guidelines: The initial analysis steps are the same as in a standard scRNA-Seq experiment. Firstly, reads need to be aligned to a reference genome of a species of interest and cells with very low number of transcripts mapped to the reference are removed. Finally, a normalized count matrix with gene expression values is obtained. ADT data analysis (based on the developer's guidelines): CITE-seq-Count is a Python package from CITE-Seq developers that can be used to obtain raw counts. Seurat package from Satija lab further allows combining of the protein and RNA counts and performing clustering on both measurements, as well as doing differential expression analysis between cell clusters of interest. ADT quantification needs to take into account the differences between the antibodies. Additionally, filtering may be required to reduce noise, similarly to scRNA- Seq analysis. But in contrast to RNA data, due to higher amounts of protein in a cell, there is less dropout. The analyses may result in identification of novel cell clusters through such methods as PCA or tSNE, crucial genes responsible for a specific cell function and other new knowledge specific to a question of interest. In general, the results obtained with ADT counts substantially increase the amount of information obtained through single cell transcriptomics.  Adaptations of the technique  627x627px The applications of antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates have expanded beyond CITE-seq, and can be adapted for sample multiplexing as well as CRISPR screens. Cell Hashing: New York Genome Center further adapted the use of their antibody- oligonucleotide conjugates to enable sample multiplexing for scRNA-seq. This technique called, Cell Hashing, uses oligonucleotide-labelled antibodies against ubiquitously expressed cell surface proteins from a particular tissue sample. In this case, an oligonucleotide sequence contains a unique barcode which would be specific to cells from distinct samples. This sample-specific cell tagging allows pooling of the sequencing libraries prepared from different samples on a sequencing platform. Sequencing the antibody tags along with the cellular transcriptome helps identify a sample of origin for each analyzed cell. A unique barcode sequence used on the cell hashing antibody can be designed to be different from an antibody barcode present on the ADTs used in CITE-seq. This makes it possible to couple cell hashing with CITE-seq on a single sequencing run. Cell hashing allows super-loading of the scRNA-seq platform, resulting in a lower cost of sequencing. It also enables detection of artifactual signals from multiplets, a major challenge in scRNA-seq. The cell hashing method has further been used by Gaublomme et al. to multiplex single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) by performing nucleus hashing. ECCITE-seq: _E_ xpanded _C_ RISPR-compatible _C_ ellular _I_ ndexing of _T_ ranscriptomes and _E_ pitopes by sequencing or ECCITE-seq was developed to apply the use of CITE-seq to characterize multiple modalities from a single cell. By modifying the basic CITE-seq protocol to a 5’ tag-based scRNA-seq assay, it can detect transcriptome, immune receptor clonotypes, surface markers, sample identity and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) from each single cell. The ability of ECCITE- seq to detect sgRNA molecules and measure their effect on gene expression levels opens a prospect of applying this technique in CRISPR screens.  Advantages and Limitations of CITE-seq  Advantages: CITE-seq enables simultaneous analysis of the transcriptome as well as the proteome of single cells. Previous efforts of coupling index-sorting measurements from single cell sorts with scRNA-seq were limited to running a small sample size and were not compatible with multiplexing and massive parallel high-throughput sequencing. CITE-seq has been shown to be compatible with high-throughput microfluidic platforms like 10X Genomics and Drop-seq. It is also adaptable to micro/nano-well platforms. Coupling it with cell hashing enables the application of CITE-seq on bulk samples and sample multiplexing. These techniques work to reduce an overall cost of high-throughput sequencing on multiple samples. Lastly, CITE-seq can be adapted to detect small molecules, RNA interference, CRISPR, and other gene editing techniques. Limitations: One of the limitations of CITE-Seq is a loss of location information. Due to the way the cells are treated, the spatial distribution of cells within a sample, as well as proteins within a cell is not known. In addition, this method shares the challenges of scRNA-Seq, such as high amount of noise and possible challenges in detecting lowly expressed genes. In terms of phenotyping, optimization of the assay and antibodies also presents a potential problem if proteins of interest are not included in the currently available panels. Moreover, right now CITE-Seq is not able to detect intracellular proteins. With the current protocol, there are many challenges that would arise during the permeabilization step, thus limiting the technique to surface markers.  Alternative methods  * REAP-seq: Peterson et al. from Merck developed a technique similar to CITE-seq called RNA Expression and Protein Sequencing assay (REAP-seq). While REAP-seq, similarly to CITE-seq, measures levels of both transcripts and proteins in a single cell, the difference between the two techniques is how the antibody is conjugated to the oligonucleotides. CITE-seq typically links the oligonucleotide to the antibody non-covalently, via streptavidin conjugation to the antibody and biotin conjugation to the oligonucleotide. REAP-seq covalently links the antibody and an aminated DNA barcode * PLAYR: PLAYR or Proximal Ligation Assay for RNA makes use of mass spectrometry to simultaneously analyse the transcriptome and protein levels in single cells. In this technique both the proteins and RNA transcripts are labelled with isotope-conjugated antibodies and isotope-labelled probes, respectively, enabling their detection on a mass spectrometer  References  Category:RNA sequencing ","title":"CITE-Seq"},{"id":"60084644","text":"Hebei Township () is a township under the administration of Keshan County, in western Heilongjiang, China. , it has 9 villages under its administration.

The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Price Mountain wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Oriskany and Salisbury. Natural history The area is within the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the Northern Ridge and Valley Section in the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. Yellow poplar, northern red oak, white oak, basswood, cucumber tree, white ash, eastern hemlock and red maple are found in colluvial drainages, toeslopes and along flood plains of small to medium-sized streams. White oak, northern red oak, and hickory dominate on the north and west, while chestnut oak, scarlet oak and yellow pine are found on ridgetops and exposed sites. The area includes the Patterson Creek Barren special biological area as well as part of the County Line Barrens special biological area near the junction of Little Patterson Creek and Craig Creek. The Virginia white-haired leatherflower has been found in the area. A non-native species, the Tree of Heaven, found along sections of Kelley Road, has been targeted for herbicide treatment. There are about 335 acres of old growth forest in the area. Topography The area is distinguished by ridges that trend northeast/southwest. The ridges, composed of sandstone or shale, have parallel drainages flowing into broad limestone valleys. Price Mountain is typical with small steep sideslope drainages. From a 2720-foot peak along the crest of Price Mountain, the elevation dips to 1091 feet at the northern tip of the area. Silurian-aged sandstone underlays about 75 percent of the area, with the remaining area underlain by Brallier and Martinsburg shale. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Price Mountain was inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore protected from possible road construction and timber sales. A road providing access to a private inholding near the top of Kelly Hollow Creek ran close to Kelly Hollow Creek creating an erosion hazard. In 2007 the Forest Service decided to decommission the road and replace it with a shorter, parallel road. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. Most of the area is designated “Backcountry—Non-Motorized”. The northeast part of Patterson Creek is designated “Mix of Successional Habitats”, and there is a section on the southern side designated “Dispersed Recreation Area-Suitable for Timber Production”. Cultural history A 1998 survey of 327 acres of the area found five transient camps.

Career In 1967 he joined the Dow Chemical Company as a researcher and was first assigned to Dow's pharmaceutical research labs in Indianapolis, Indiana. Stavropoulos, however, soon had the opportunity to become more involved in the business aspect of the company. He left the research lab and in 1973 became research manager of Dow's diagnostics products business. In 1977, he was promoted to business manager of Dow's polyolefins division, and over the next decade, he moved up the corporate ranks, assuming increasingly more responsible managerial and executive positions, including serving as president of Dow Latin America (1984-1985), and eventually rose to the position of president and chief operating office of Dow corporate in 1993.William S.

Reisch, “Patience and Persistence: Dow’s Stavropoulos, Palladium Medal winner, recounts his career and goals for the future\\", Chemical & Engineering News, 14 May 2001, pg. 22-25 At the start of the 1990s, Dow's executive leadership concluded that the company needed to undergo a radical transformation if it were to take advantage of the opportunities and face the challenges being created by the emergence of an integrated global economy. In 1995 Stavropoulos was tapped by Dow's Board of Directors to become the company's CEO, effective 1 November, and to lead the global makeover of the firm. As president of Dow USA since 1990, he had already been changing Dow's United States operations, and his performance was a prelude to the changes to the company he would implement worldwide. Transforming Dow Chemical Company During Stavropoulos's tenure as CEO, Dow Chemical Company underwent a major transformation,Bill Stavropoulos Global Broadcasts: October 17, 1995 \\"A New Level of Performance for Dow’s 2nd Century: The structure for setting the competitive standard business by business December 5, 1995\\" The Strategic Blueprint: a global update, published by Dow Chemical Company the centerpiece of which was a total restructuring of the company. Dow’s division into largely autonomous geographic units was replaced by an organizational structure based on fifteen global businesses and ten global functional units. Hand in hand with this, Dow introduced a new performance review system that aimed to encourage accountability, and it greatly expanded its capacity in information technology ― most notably, a global company-wide intranet was established to which all employees were given access.

Tyner, “Dow’s William Stavropoulos―Attention to High Tech, Customers Renewed His Company” Investor’s Business Daily, 17 February 2000; pg. 4 As part of its transformation strategy, Dow divested itself of ventures that were no longer competitive or did not fit well with the company's strengths, e.g., its consumer products operation (DowBrands). At the same time, it invested $18 billion to acquire businesses. These acquisitions either expanded Dow's base in specialty chemicals and industrial biotech, or they positioned Dow in new geographies.Robert Koenig, “Dow Nears Deal to Buy E.

He remained Chairman of the company until March 2006. Michigan Baseball Foundation In 2005, Stavropoulos took the lead in bringing minor league baseball to Midland, Michigan,Eric Gilbertson, \\"Bill Stavropoulos: he made professional baseball—the Great Lakes Loons—a reality for his hometown\\" Business, VI, 2017, pg. 20-21 which is where Dow is headquartered. Together with the heads of several Midland foundations and companies, he established the Michigan Baseball Foundation (MBF)—a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization. In December 2005, MBF purchased a minor league baseball team (the Devil Rays of Battle Creek, Michigan. In 2006, the founders of MBF established Michigan Baseball Operations—a taxable non-profit—to which they transferred ownership of the ball club. The Devil Rays became the Great Lakes Loons of Midland, Michigan in 2007. From 2006 to 2007, MBF built a baseball stadium in downtown Midland (the Dow Diamond), which serves as the home field of the Great Lakes Loons. Both MBF and MBO operate as 'social enterprises' that invest their earnings back into the community, in the form of donations to non-profits, as seed money for ventures that improve the community, or to catalyze local entrepreneurship. Stavropoulos serves as chairman of both entities.

In 1948, Grunander took over as chairman of Djurgårdens IF Hockey and in his first year with the team helped them qualify for the then-highest league, Allsvenskan. From the 1948 season onwards, Djurgården won nine Swedish championships between 1950 and 1963. As Grunander saw his team dominating the league, he was one of the first instigators that argued for a new elite series of Swedish hockey. Although the proposal was first shot down, by 1974 the Swedish Hockey Association eventually decided to create the Swedish Elite League. At Djurgården's 75th anniversary, Grunander was awarded a merit award from Djurgårdens IF, the overarching sports club of all departments. Later in his career, Grunander helped recruit players from IK Göta to play for Djurgården, including Ove Malmberg who described him as a charismatic leader and hockey expert.

In 1905, he edited \\"Lektorat für Pflanzenkrankheiten\\" (\\"Diseases of plants\\") at the University of Halle, and worked there until 1930. He promoted the development of plant pathology, notably through his \\"Handbook of Chemicals for the Control of Plant Diseases\\" (first edition 1898) and his \\"Annual Reports on Innovations and Benefits in the Field of Plant Diseases\\" (1898-1913). Hollrung was head of the first research center in the field of crop protection and the first full-time university teacher for this field in Germany. As a researcher, he played a significant role in the examination of copper salts as a plant protection product, in the study of diseases of grapevine and potato. Throughout his life he looked for ways to practise preventive crop protection, especially with arable and organic farming. Many of his attempts to develop biological plant protection measures were acknowledged only after his death. Honours Some species named for him *(Arecaceae) Calyptrocalyx hollrungii (Becc.)

Many new applications for robots require them to work alongside people as capable members of human-robot teams. These include robots for homes, hospitals, and offices, space exploration and manufacturing. Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) is an interdisciplinary research area comprising classical robotics, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, design, cognitive sciences and psychology. Industrial applications of human-robot collaboration involve Collaborative Robots, or cobots, that physically interact with humans in a shared workspace to complete tasks such as collaborative manipulation or object handovers.  Collaborative Activity  Collaboration is defined as a special type of coordinated activity, one in which two or more agents work jointly with each other, together performing a task or carrying out the activities needed to satisfy a shared goal. The process typically involves shared plans, shared norms and mutually beneficial interactions. Although collaboration and cooperation are often used interchangeably, collaboration differs from cooperation as it involves a shared goal and joint action where the success of both parties depend on each other.Hord, S. M. (1981). Working Together: Cooperation or Collaboration? Communications Services, Research and Development Center for Teacher Education, Education Annex 3.203, University of Texas, Austin, TX 78712-1288 For effective human-robot collaboration, it is imperative that the robot is capable of understanding and interpreting several communication mechanisms similar to the mechanisms involved in human-human interaction. The robot must also communicate its own set of intents and goals to establish and maintain a set of shared beliefs and to coordinate its actions to execute the shared plan. In addition, all team members demonstrate commitment to doing their own part, to the others doing theirs, and to the success of the overall task.  Theories Informing Human-Robot Collaboration  Human-human collaborative activities are studied in depth in order to identify the characteristics that enable humans to successfully work together. These activity models usually aim to understand how people work together in teams, how they form intentions and achieve a joint goal. Theories on collaboration inform human-robot collaboration research to develop efficient and fluent collaborative agents. Belief Desire Intention Model The belief-desire-intention (BDI) model is a model of human practical reasoning that was originally developed by Michael Bratman.Bratman, Michael (1987). Intention, Plans, and Practical Reason. Center for the Study of Language and Information. The approach is used in intelligent agents research to describe and model intelligent agents. The BDI model is characterized by the implementation of an agent's beliefs (the knowledge of the world, state of the world), desires (the objective to accomplish, desired end state) and intentions (the course of actions currently under execution to achieve the desire of the agent) in order to deliberate their decision-making processes.Mascardi, V., Demergasso, D., & Ancona, D. (2005). Languages for Programming BDI-style Agents: an Overview. WOA. BDI agents are able to deliberate about plans, select plans and execute plans. Shared Cooperative Activity Shared Cooperative Activity defines certain prerequisites for an activity to be considered shared and cooperative: mutual responsiveness, commitment to the joint activity and commitment to mutual support. An example case to illustrate these concepts would be a collaborative activity where agents are moving a table out the door, mutual responsiveness ensures that movements of the agents are synchronized; a commitment to the joint activity reassures each team member that the other will not at some point drop his side; and a commitment to mutual support deals with possible breakdowns due to one team member’s inability to perform part of the plan. Joint Intention Theory Joint Intention Theory proposes that for joint action to emerge, team members must communicate to maintain a set of shared beliefs and to coordinate their actions towards the shared plan. In collaborative work, agents should be able to count on the commitment of other members, therefore each agent should inform the others when they reach the conclusion that a goal is achievable, impossible, or irrelevant.  Approaches to Human-Robot Collaboration  The approaches to human-robot collaboration include human emulation (HE) and human complementary (HC) approaches. Although these approaches have differences, there are research efforts to develop a unified approach stemming from potential convergences such as Collaborative Control. Human Emulation The human emulation approach aims to enable computers to act like humans or have human-like abilities in order to collaborate with humans. It focuses on developing formal models of human-human collaboration and applying these models to human-computer collaboration. In this approach, humans are viewed as rational agents who form and execute plans for achieving their goals and infer other people's plans. Agents are required to infer the goals and plans of other agents, and collaborative behavior consists of helping other agents to achieve their goals. Human Complementary The human complementary approach seeks to improve human-computer interaction by making the computer a more intelligent partner that complements and collaborates with humans. The premise is that the computer and humans have fundamentally asymmetric abilities. Therefore, researchers invent interaction paradigms that divide responsibility between human users and computer systems by assigning distinct roles that exploit the strengths and overcome the weaknesses of both partners.  Key Aspects  Specialization of Roles: Based on the level of autonomy and intervention, there are several human-robot relationships including master-slave, supervisor–subordinate, partner–partner, teacher–learner and fully autonomous robot. In addition to these roles, homotopy (a weighting function that allows a continuous change between leader and follower behaviors) was introduced as a flexible role distribution. Establishing shared goal(s): Through direct discussion about goals or inference from statements and actions, agents must determine the shared goals they are trying to achieve. Allocation of Responsibility and Coordination: Agents must decide how to achieve their goals, determine what actions will be done by each agent, and how to coordinate the actions of individual agents and integrate their results. Shared context: Agents must be able to track progress toward their goals. They must keep track of what has been achieved and what remains to be done. They must evaluate the effects of actions and determine whether an acceptable solution has been achieved. Communication: Any collaboration requires communication to define goals, negotiate over how to proceed and who will do what, and evaluate progress and results. Adaptation and learning: Collaboration over time require partners to adapt themselves to each other and learn from one's partner both directly or indirectly. Time and space: The time-space taxonomy divides human-robot interaction into four categories based on whether the humans and robots are using computing systems at the same time (synchronous) or different times (asynchronous) and while in the same place (collocated) or in different places (non-collocated).

The official climate designation for the Tarkhanhut area is Humid continental climate - hot summer sub-type (Köppen climate classification Dfa), with large seasonal temperature differentials and a hot summer (at least four months averaging over , at least one of which is over . Park management claims 2,350 hours of sunshine per year. Summer runs from late May to mid-September, with 316 mm of average annual precipitation. Flora and fauna The area is notable for preserving some of the last primeval coastal steppes, particularly in the gullies of the Castel sectors, where 50 plant species are found that are not generally found in the greater coastal steppes, and over 400 species of vascular plants have been recorded on site. Overall, the park includes coastal steppe, shrub- steppe, and shrub habitats. Public use As a national park, NNP Charming Harbor is divided into four zones, providing for a protected area, a regulated recreation zone, a local recreation area, and an 'economic zone'. There are recreational facilities in each of the main sections, with heated cabins available for rent, boats, fishing, and campsites.

The Hollywood Reporter, July 17, 2016.  Synopsis  Jasmine (Brittani Nichols) and Penn (Lindsay Hicks), a couple who have been dating for a month, go to a dinner party hosted by their friends Billie (Jasika Nicole) and Jordan (Brianna Baker), who have been married for five years. When they arrive, they find that Billie and Jordan are having frequent disagreements and seem to be in the middle of some sort of conflict. At one point during dinner, Jasmine and Penn leave the room under the guise of using the bathroom and go into their hosts' bedroom to have sex. There they inadvertently find a note that seems to indicate that the writer is going to commit suicide. Jasmine and Penn are unsure of what to do and argue about how to handle the situation; they then return to the dinner table. The meal is later interrupted by the next door neighbor, Xo (Hayley Huntley) with whom Jordan had a brief affair, coming over to confront her. It comes to light that the neighbor wrote the note.  Cast  * Brittani Nichols as Jasmine * Lindsay Hicks as Penn * Hayley Huntley as Xo * Jasika Nicole as Billie * Brianna Baker as Jordan  Development  Nichols wrote the script for Suicide Kale, which was her first screenplay for a feature-length film. She and the film's director and editor, Usdin, had no budget for the film and had to use equipment that they owned. It was filmed over the course of a few days using natural light in co-star Brianna Baker's house. Robin Roemer, Usdin's wife, was the cinematographer and executive producer. Co-star Jasika Nicole was also an executive producer. The entire production team were queer women.  Release  Suicide Kale premiered at the Queer Hippo International LGBT Film Festival on April 3, 2016.  Critical reception  The film received positive critical reviews. Writing for SBS, Glenn Dunks wrote, \\"Its characters are the kind that are rarely seen on screen, interacting in ways that more mainstream (and, let’s face it, straight) filmmakers wouldn’t ever allow. Its central mystery is resolved in a way that makes sense for this little world they’ve made and there is even a blooper reel at the end.\\" Daniela Costa wrote in a review for AfterEllen.com, \\"It helps that all four characters have unique and interesting personalities that stand up on their own. You believe them as people and, in spite of their very obvious flaws, you like them.\\"  Accolades  The film was screened at Outfest on July 15, 2016, where Usdin won the Audience Award for Best First U.S. Dramatic Feature. The film won the award for Best Women's Film at the inaugural Queer North Film Festival,\\"Queer North Film Festival winners announced\\".

That said, he's also a classically trained artist with a wide-ranging and eclectic taste in music. He brings all of these influences to bear on his nuanced and enveloping 2018 trio date, Kaleidoscope ... Here, Chestnut has chosen a handful of his favorite classical compositions, including tracks by Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, and Maurice Ravel, which he reworks in his own inimitable jazz style, alongside other standards and his own originals. What's particularly compelling about his choices is just how well the classical songs fit into the jazz trio concept\\". In JazzTimes, David Whiteis stated \\"This is serious play at its most elegant and satisfying. Cyrus Chestnut takes on fare ranging from original compositions through the works of Mozart, Ravel, and Satie, along with a hymn, a classic from the Great American Songbook, and most audaciously, a scrap from the heavy metal slag heap, enriching it all with zest, good humor, and unflagging craftsmanship.

Jonathan Alden Sr. ( - ), the son of Mayflower immigrants, was a military officer and farm owner in Plymouth Colony. The home he built in the late 1600s is now a National Historic Landmark in Duxbury, Massachusetts. Early life Jonathan Alden was born in the seaside town of Duxbury in Plymouth Colony. He was the fifth of ten children born to John Alden (-1687) and Priscilla Mullins (-), who both arrived on the historic 1620 voyage of the Mayflower. John Alden, a cooper by trade, was a member of the Mayflower's crew and Priscilla Mullins was a passenger. In 1627, about five years before Jonathan Alden's birth, John Alden was granted 169 acres on the south side of the Bluefish River in Duxbury, where he built a home near Eagletree Pond. John and Priscilla Alden raised all their children on their Duxbury farm. Civic and military service Jonathan Alden was made a freeman in 1657. He was asked to survey land and provide a report to the court about routes for a highway in 1685. In 1689, he was elected a selectman for the town of Duxbury. Alden had a long career in Plymouth Colony's military force. In 1658, at the age of 26, he was made an ensign in the Duxbury company. In the same year, the colony's forces were placed under the command of Major Josiah Winslow. About 17 years later, Alden fought under Winslow in King Philip's War (1675-1678). In 1681, Alden was made a lieutenant and, in 1689, he was made a captain of the Duxbury company. Alden house Alden House in Duxbury, Massachusetts The Alden family built two homes on the original 1627 grant in Duxbury. The first home—the childhood home of Jonathan Alden and his siblings—was built in 1632 at Eagletree Pond and demolished sometime before 1687. Its foundation was discovered in 1960 by archeologist Roland W. Robbins. The second Alden home was constructed 100 yards away and is now a museum at the Alden House Historic Site. The older, east side of the present home, which includes the great room and master chamber, was built by Jonathan Alden in the late 1600s. Recent research suggests it was constructed about the time of Alden's marriage in 1672, while tradition asserts it was built in 1653. Timbers in the west side of the home were erected in the early 1700s when it was owned by his son John Alden (-1739). Family Jonathan Alden's brother John Alden Jr. (–1702) was convicted and imprisoned for witchcraft in the Salem witch trials in 1692. His sister Elisabeth Alden (1623–1717) allegedly was the first child of European parents to be born in New England. At the age of 40, Jonathan Alden married Abigail Hallett (-1725), daughter of Andrew Hallett, on . They had six children in Duxbury: Elizabeth, Anna, Sarah, John, Andrew, and Jonathan Jr. Death and tribute Gravestone of Jonathan Alden in Duxbury, MAJonathan Alden died on , in Duxbury where he was given a military funeral and \\"buried under arms.\\" He was interred near his parents in Myles Standish Burial Ground, the oldest maintained cemetery in the United States. The funeral sermon was delivered by Rev. Ichabod Wiswall: In the early 1800s, Ezra Weston, who restored tombstones in the Myles Standish Burial Ground, found the broken tombstone of Jonathan Alden and took it home where it remained for thirty years. In 1880, it came into the possession of Lucia Alden Bradford. Her nephew, Lawrence Bradford, searched the burial ground and found the original broken base that matched the bottom edge of the tombstone. The original tombstone—the oldest extant carved gravestone in the cemetery—is now preserved in a marble frame on that spot.

In innovation helical framework theory, first developed by Henry Etzkowitz and Loet Leydesdorff and used in innovation economics and theories of knowledge, such as the knowledge society and the knowledge economy, each sector is represented by a circle (helix), with overlapping showing interactions. The quadruple and quintuple innovation helix framework was co- developed by Elias G. Carayannis and David F.J. Campbell, with the quadruple helix being described in 2009 and the quintuple helix in 2010. Various authors were exploring the concept of a quadruple helix extension to the triple helix model of innovation around the same time. The Carayannis and Campbell quadruple helix model incorporates the public via the concept of a 'media- based democracy', which emphasizes that when the political system (government) is developing innovation policy to develop the economy, it must adequately communicate its innovation policy with the public and civil society via the media to obtain public support for new strategies or policies. In the case of industry involved in R&D;, the framework emphasizes that companies' public relations strategies have to negotiate ‘reality construction’ by the media. The quadruple and quintuple helix framework can be described in terms of the models of knowledge that it extends and by five subsystems (helices) that it incorporates; in a quintuple helix-driven model, knowledge and know-how are created and transformed, and circulate as inputs and outputs in a way that affects the natural environment. Socio-ecological interactions via the quadruple and quintuple helices can be utilized to define opportunities for the knowledge society and knowledge economy, such as innovation to address sustainable development, including climate change.  Conceptual interrelationship of models of knowledge  The framework involves the extension of previous models of knowledge, specifically mode 1, mode 2, the triple helix, and mode 3, by adding the public and the environment: Figure 1: Evolution of the Models of Knowledge Creation in the Quintuple Helix Mode 1. Mode 1 was theorized by Michael Gibbons and is an elderly linear model of fundamental university research where success is defined as \\"a quality or excellence that is approved by hierarchically established peers” and does not necessarily contribute to industry or the knowledge economy. Mode 2. Mode 2 was also theorized by Michael Gibbons and is context-driven, problem-focused and interdisciplinary research characterized by the following five principles: (1) knowledge produced in the context of application; (2) transdisciplinarity; (3) heterogeneity and organizational diversity; (4) social accountability and reflexivity; (5) and quality control. The Triple Helix model of innovation. The triple helix was first suggested by Henry Etzkowitz and Loet Leydesdorff in 1995 and emphasizes trilateral networks and hybrid organizations of university-industry-government relations to provide the infrastructure necessary for innovation and economic development; it provides a structural explanation for the historical evolution of mode 2 in relation to mode 1. Mode 3. Mode 3 was developed by Elias G. Carayannis and David F.J. Campbell in 2006. Mode 3 emphasizes the coexistence and co-development of diverse knowledge and innovation modes, together with mutual cross-learning between knowledge modes and interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary knowledge. Quadruple helix. The quadruple helix adds as fourth helix the public, specifically defined as the culture- and media-based public and civil society. This fourth helix includes, for example, sociological concepts like art, the creative industries, culture, lifestyles, media, and values. Quintuple helix. The quintuple helix adds as fifth helix the natural environment, more specifically socio-ecological interactions, meaning it can be applied in an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary way to sustainable development.  The five helices  Figure 2: Five Helices of the Quintuple Helix The main constituent element of the helical system is knowledge, which, through a circulation between societal subsystems, changes to innovation and know-how in a society (knowledge society) and for the economy (knowledge economy). The quintuple helix visualizes the collective interaction and exchange of this knowledge in a state by means of five subsystems (helices): (1) education system, (2) economic system, (3) natural environment, (4) media-based and culture-based public (also ‘civil society’), (5) and the political system. Each of the five helices has an asset at its disposal, with a societal and scientific relevance, i.e., human capital, economic capital, natural capital, social capital and capital of information capital, and political capital and legal capital, respectively. Figure 3: Effects of Investment in Education on Sustainable Development in Quintuple Helix  Quadruple and quintuple helix and policy making  The quadruple helix has been applied to European Union- sponsored projects and policies, including the EU-MACS (EUropean MArket for Climate Services) project, a follow-up project of the European Research and Innovation Roadmap for Climate Services, and the European Commission's Open Innovation 2.0 (OI2) policy for a digital single market that supports open innovation.  Quadruple and quintuple helix in academic research  The quadruple helix has implications for smart co-evolution of regional innovation and institutional arrangements, i.e., regional innovation systems. The quintuple helix has been applied to the quality of democracy, including in innovation systems; international cooperation; forest-based bioeconomies; the Russian Arctic zone energy shelf; regional ecosystems; smart specialization and living labs; climate change, and sustainable development, as well as to innovation diplomacy, a quintuple-helix based extension of science diplomacy.  Criticism of the concept  How to define the new sectors of the public and the environment with regard to the standard triple helix model of innovation has been debated, and some researchers see them as additional sectors while others see them as different types of overarching sectors which contain the previous sectors.

On the contrary, while he is adept at swinging acoustic jazz, one of his most formative experiences was as a member of vocalist Betty Carter's trio. A genre-bending maverick, Carter purportedly encouraged Chestnut to try new things and approach even the most well-known standard in an unexpected way. That expectation defying aesthetic fits nicely into Chestnut's work here with Williams and White, who come from a generation of jazz musicians who grew up playing electrified fusion, funk, and highly progressive post-bop influenced by the avant-garde. While the music here is more stripped down to the jazz essentials, they nonetheless tackle even the most well-known standard, like \\"It Could Happen to You,\\" with a creative ebullience and in-the-moment spontaneity that grab your attention throughout.

She is a member of Chicago City Council, serving as alderman for the city's 49th ward. She won election to that office after defeating 28-year incumbent Joe Moore in the 2019 aldermanic elections. The 49th ward includes most of Rogers Park and portions of West Ridge. While Hadden is affiliated with the Democratic Party, she has promised to be an independent alderman. She is a member of the Progressive Caucus, Black Caucus, and LGBT Caucus in City Council.  Early life and education  Hadden was born in Columbus, Ohio in 1981. She earned her bachelor's degree in International Peace and Conflict Studies from the Ohio State University, and subsequently moved to Waukegan, Illinois to begin a job with the AmeriCorps VISTA program in 2003. She moved to Chicago in 2004. She later earned a master's degree in International Public Service Management from DePaul University.  Early activist and political career  Hadden was a founding board member of the Participatory Budgeting Project, where she worked from 2010 to 2018 to bring participatory budgeting to cities in the Midwest and the South. She later served as the executive director of the non-profit Our City Our Voice. She also served on the boards of directors of the non- profit Voqal and of Black Youth Project 100. She has been an active member of Network 49, an independent political organization based in Rogers Park, and of United Working Families.alt=On January 20, 2018, Hadden announced her campaign to run for alderman in the 49th ward, which covers most of Rogers Park and portions of West Ridge. After the submission and processing of ballot petitions, Hadden and incumbent Joe Moore were the only candidates to make it on the ballot for the February 2019 election. Hadden's campaign emphasized development without displacement, funding local public schools, and supporting a strong local economy as key issues in the race. She received several endorsements from progressive activist groups, labor unions, and local politicians such Chuy García and David Orr. Although both candidates self- identified as progressives, observers and media outlets generally characterized Hadden as challenging Moore from the left. Hadden won the election on February 26, 2019, with 63% of the vote. She won a majority of the vote in 32 out of 33 precincts in the ward. With her win, Hadden is the first queer woman of color to be elected to Chicago City Council. After her election, Hadden said that in her first few months in office, she will pursue a full assessment of infrastructure and services in the ward and set up an advisory committee for community engagement. On April 10, 2019, Hadden joined six other newly-elected members of the City Council in protesting against the approval of tax increment financing for the Lincoln Yards and The 78 real estate developments.  Chicago City Council (2019–present)  Hadden was sworn in as a member of Chicago City Council on May 20, 2019.  City-wide issues   City budget  Hadden was one of 11 aldermen who voted against Mayor Lori Lightfoot's proposed 2020 budget, alongside 8 other members of the Progressive Caucus. In a statement about her vote, Hadden stated, \\"I’m optimistic about the increased investments in housing, mental health care, homelessness prevention and concrete investments in the South and West sides of our city, but remain concerned that we haven’t exhausted all prospects of progressive revenue in order to take greater strides towards a budget that starts to repair decades of harm and inequity.\\" Prior to the vote, Hadden spoke with constituents about the budget at multiple town hall meetings.  Public health  Hadden sponsored a \\"Senior Safety\\" ordinance, in collaboration with the Jane Addams Senior Caucus, that was passed in July 2020. The ordinance requires building managers in senior housing to conduct regular wellness checks on residents.  Environmental issues  Hadden was an early co-sponsor of legislation to ban single-use plastics and styrofoam in most restaurants.  Ward-level issues   Public health  During the COVID-19 pandemic, Hadden coordinated with State Rep. Kelly Cassidy and local community groups to create the Rogers Park Community Response Team. The Team's stated goal is to help Rogers Park residents stay informed and access resources needed amid the social distancing and shelter- in-place measures in place during the crisis. They have offered informational resources online, set up a hotline for residents to request advice, and volunteers trained to safely deliver groceries and prescriptions.  Committees  During the 2019–23 term, Hadden is a member of eight standing committees in the City Council: Economic, Capital, and Technology Development; Ethics and Government Oversight; Environmental Protection and Energy; Housing and Real Estate; Human Relations and Health; Special Events, Cultural Affairs, and Recreation; Zoning, Landmarks, and Building Standards; and Committees and Rules.  Alliances and relationships  After winning her seat in the first round of the 2019 elections, Hadden endorsed several candidates vying for City Council seats in the run-off elections: Andre Vasquez, who defeated Patrick J. O'Connor (40th ward); Jessica Gutierrez, who challenged Ariel Reboyras (30th ward); and two candidates ran in open races: Matt Martin (47th ward) and Robert Murphy (39th ward). She also announced support for other candidates in run-off elections who, like her, had been endorsed by United Working Families: Rossana Rodríguez Sanchez (33rd ward), Rafa Yañez (15th ward), and Jeanette Taylor (20th ward). She declined to make an endorsement in the 2019 mayoral election, citing her goal of being an independent alderman as well as strong support received by both run-off candidates in the 49th ward in the first round. At the start of the 2019–23 term, Hadden joined the City Council's Progressive Reform Caucus, LGBT Caucus, and Black Caucus. She was selected as the treasurer for the Progressive Caucus. She has also pledged to join the council's women's caucus.  Personal life  Hadden's longtime partner and spouse is Natalia Vera. Vera was elected as a member of the local school council for Joyce Kilmer Elementary School in Rogers Park in April 2018.

History Wainwright was born in London, the son of schoolmaster Edward Harley Wainwright BSc ( – 26 April 1919), and his wife Maria Wainwright, née Brooks.. In 1879 they left for Adelaide where E. H. Wainwright had accepted a position as Third Master of Prince Alfred College. :In 1883 he left \\"Princes\\" for rival St Peter's College as a replacement for Science master A. H. Highton. His decision to change schools may have been related to his religion: Wainwright was an Anglican. He served at St Peter's for 22 years, resigning in 1906. Wainwright was educated by private tuition and was successful in the 1888 University examinations. He enrolled with the School of Mines in 1890, achieving excellent grades in the first year but missing a continuing scholarship through a change in criteria relating to technical drawing. He graduated with an Associate Diploma in 1892; with Charles John Whillas (1874–1945) the second and third to gain this recognition (Wainwright's was in Metallurgy; Whillas and L. W. Grayson's being in Mining). In 1894 his paper on mining theory was given a pass mark by examiner Captain H. R. Hancock of Kadina giving him that second Diploma. That same year Wainwright was appointed assistant manager of the Ivanhoe gold mine, Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, where he was in charge of the battery, which he held for two years before taking a similar position at the newly established Queen Margaret mine, Coolgardie. In 1898 he joined the Broken Hill South company and was put in charge of the metallurgical department in 1900, and effected an immediate increase in the percentage of valuable metal extracted. He had been appointed surface manager only a few months when a serious rockfall below the 500ft level killed six men and left others trapped. With the resignation of underground manager Samuel Mayne (c. 1855–1933) in 1903, Wainwright was made general manager of the mine and of the company in 1918. In July 1920 Wainwright was transferred to the Company's head office in Melbourne, and retired on 30 June 1937. Andrew Fairweather (1882–1962) succeeded him on both occasions. He died at his home in Caulfield, Victoria and his remains were cremated. Other activities *Wainwright was hon. secretary.

It features a 300-metre-long horizontal skybridge called \\"Crystal\\" that connects the top of four of the skycrapers. The skybridge will be the second highest in the world after the Kingdom Centre. The entire project comprises eight towers with a total of 817,000 square metres of floor space. It was designed by Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie. It is one of the most expensive buildings being built in China. Timeline Construction began around 2013 and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019. As of February 2019, the structures had been completed and the interior was being finished. Overview Raffles City Chongqing consists of eight skyscrapers situated on a site covering 9.2 hectares, in Yuzhong District, at the tip of the peninsula where the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers meet. Atop four of the 250-metre-tall towers is an enclosed skyway, called the Crystal. Two 350-metre-tall towers connect to them, each via a cantilever bridge. Two other 250-metre-tall towers are adjacent to these six. The project will contain 1.12 million square metres of space, 817,000 square metres of which will be floor space and will include 150,000m² of offices and 1,400 residences, a hotel, a 235,000m² shopping mall, and landscaped grounds. The buildings are reinforced concrete with concrete-encased steel columns and steel floor spanning. The height to tip is 354.5 metres with 79 above-ground floors and 3 below. The Crystal The Crystal is an enclosed 300-metre-long horizontal skyway that sits atop four of the buildings. It is 32.5m wide and 26.5m high. The Crystal will set a record for being the highest in the world linking the highest number of towers. The exterior consists of approximately 3,000 glass panels and nearly 5,000 aluminum panels. The Crystal was constructed in nine parts. Four were constructed on the top of the towers and the three middle parts were prefabricated and raised from the ground and installed.

He was one of the many Serbian disciples (Ostoja Mrkojević, Radul Lazarević, Kozma Damjanović, Rafailo Dimitrijević, Rafailo Miloradović, Silvester Popović, Maksim Tujković, Stanoje Popović, Georgije Stojanović, Nedeljko Popović Serban, and Georgije Ranite) of the 17th-century Russian master painters of Moscow. His work in iconography demonstrates influences of Baroque painting.http://fmks.gov.ba/stara/download/zzs/1957/11-1957.pdf Biography The identity of Sava Krabulević was discovered in the main archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow by Serbian art researcher and priest Lazar Bogdanović (1861-1932)and first published in 1900 in Srpski Sion, an Art magazine. For the next hundred and more years Krabulević was known only through archival evidence and the iconostasis in the Serbian Orthodox Monastery of Orahovica in today's Slavonia. Little information survives about his life; even the year of Sava Krabulević's birth is unknown. What is known is how Krabulević found himself in Moscow (1688-1694). Sava's father moved from Old Serbia to the Austrian-controlled territories of Serbia across the Sava and Danube rivers, probably in the 1670s and then became a cavalry officer in the Military Frontier. He died fighting the Turks at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. After his father's death, Sava, who was still a young man then, settled at Komárom on the Danube. But in the ensuing skirmishes and battles with Ottomans and their Tatar vassals, Sava was captured and taken to the Crimean Khanate. Four years later, Sava managed somehow to escape and arrive in Moscow. There, he told the Russian authorities that his vocation before being captured, was masterstvo— meaning creative, artistic work. From the document we could freely postulate that he worked as an assistant to the painters employed by Posolsky Prikaz and the Kremlin Armoury for the next six years (in fact, from 1688 to 1694). It is evident from Krabulević's icons produced for Orahovica Monastery that he acquired his knowledge and honed his skill with the best masters in Imperial Russia of that period.Their surviving works, created in the period preceding the reforms of co-rulers Ivan V of Russia and Peter the Great, show influences of modern realistic painting introduced in Russia and later in Serbia in the late 17th and early 18th century by native-born painters themselves. In Krabulević's inscription on the Orahovica iconostasis, he used Russian words that were foreign to contemporary speakers of the Serbian language at the time. Also, when he wrote the year that he completed the icons, he used a special abbreviation only common among Russians. That's why for years it was thought that the Orahovica work was completed on 9 June 1607 when in fact it was in 1697; in addition, Krabulević used dark olive and pink colors, which were not found in the palette of Serbian painters. All traces of him disappear until an archival document found in the main archive of Budapest which unraveled the whereabouts of the painter after 1697. A copy of a letter, dated 21 May 1708, signed by Metropolitan Isaija Đaković asking Serbs to join Jovan Tekelija's militia against Francis II Rákóczi who was threatening the Archduchy of Austria with his so-called Rákóczi's War of Independence.That letter was copied multiple times by Sava Krabulević who was then an assistant to Metropolitan Isaija and his secretary in some administrative capacity at the Metropolitanate of Karlovci. It is also possible that Isaija Đaković invited and even sponsored Krabulević from Russia in the first place. There is ample evidence that Isaija who built Serbian schools wrote to at least one of the Russian co-rulers asking for teachers in literacy and the sciences and arts.

The temple had been existed since 1848 which dedicated for Hokkien child deity Kong Teck Choon Ong. According to its early history, the first Rajah of Sarawak, James Brooke saw a little boy playing with water next to the temple grand stage when he passed the area and began asking the temple worshippers who had just moved to the area from mainland China about the boy, only to be told that there is no children playing in the area. The temple worshippers then said the boy is a manifestation of Kong Teck Choon Ong, which is a boy deity and adding that the emperors of many Chinese dynasties in China had honoured the deity with the name. Amused by the story, the Rajah then instructed the temple worshippers to build a water hydrant to give respect to the deity and wishing that the town of Kuching will be prospered in the future as well requesting his subjects to completing the temple building and seek his assistance if they faced any problems. During the Great Fire of Kuching in 1884, the locals saw the child deity appeared on buildings rooftops in Ewe Hai Street to give warning to nearby people and summoning rain to put out the fire. In 1993, the temple was declared as one of the historical building under the Sarawak Cultural Heritage Ordinance.

Quote: \\"Pakistan has denied involvement in the attack, in which at least 40 Indian soldiers were killed Thursday when a driver slammed an explosives-packed vehicle into a paramilitary convoy.\\" Some twelve days later, India and Pakistan conducted airstrikes against targets in each other's territory. Quote: The two days of tit-for-tat airstrikes ... the first since 1971, were triggered by a Feb. 14 terrorist bombing in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 40 Indian security personnel.\\" The first airstrike was conducted by India in the early morning hours of February 26 in the vicinity of the town of Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan, several kilometres inside the province's boundary with Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Quote: \\"Pakistan, ... said the war planes made it up to inside its territory\\" Pakistan's military, the first to announce the airstrike on February 26 morning, Quote: \\"Pakistan, which was the first to announce the incursion, ...\\" described the Indian planes as dropping their payload in an uninhabited wooded hilltop area near Balakot. Quote: \\"A spokesman for Pakistan’s armed forces, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, on Tuesday posted on Twitter four images of a forested area pockmarked with small craters and debris, which he said was the site of Indian airstrikes.\\" India, confirming the airstrike later the same day, characterised it to be a preemptive strike directed against a terrorist training camp, and causing the deaths of a \\"large number\\" of terrorists. The second airstrike, a retaliatory one, Quote: \\"A day after India’s strike, Pakistan retaliated, sending planes to attack military installations in India.\\" was conducted during daytime on February 27 by Pakistan in a region of Indian-administered Kashmir. A dogfight during this airstrike caused an Indian MiG-21 Bison warplane to be shot down and its pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, to be taken prisoner by the Pakistani military before being returned on March 1.

Quote: \\" Open-source satellite imagery suggests India did not hit any targets of consequence in the airstrikes it conducted after the terrorist attack on the paramilitaries.

It compared satellite images from the days before and after India’s strike and concluded there were only impacts in the wooded areas with no damage visible to surrounding structures.\\" On April 10, 2019, some international journalists, who were taken to the Jaba hilltop in a tightly controlled trip arranged by Pakistani government, although unable to make a knowledgeable evaluation, Quote: \\"The expectation among some of the visitors was that it might help to settle a number of mysteries about the attack. In particular, whether, as India had said, it was a huge success and took out a major militant training camp or whether - as Pakistan says - India’s warplanes missed the madrasa compound completely and hit surrounding hills instead. The difference - as many as 300 dead militants or no fatalities at all. There was also the question about whether the madrasa, one of more than 30,000 across Pakistan where children of all ages are taught to memorize and recite the Koran, was a cover for the Islamist group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which was allegedly using the site to train fighters to infiltrate Indian-controlled Kashmir. ...But the journalists and diplomats, most of whom spent well over an hour climbing steep slopes to get to the madrasa in the Jaba village area near the town of Balakot, didn't get enough time to make any kind of informed assessment. They were mostly restricted to looking around the madrasa’s main building. They were hurried away by the army, which organized the trip, after less than half an hour.\\" found the largest building of the site to show no evidence of damage or recent rebuilding. Quote: \\"Those visiting the site on Wednesday didn't see any signs that there had been significant building work to either clear structures or erect new ones.

More than a month after India launched airstrikes inside Pakistan in retaliation for a militant attack that killed 40 paramilitary troops in Kashmir, foreign media have been allowed to see the areas hit.\\" On 22 March, Pakistan and India accepted a peace offer.  Background  India and Pakistan have long been at odds with each other, having engaged in several wars, conflicts, and military standoffs. The roots of the continued tension are complex, but have centered mainly around the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. After the 1947 Partition of India, the newly-formed independent states of Pakistan and India squabbled over it, which led to the Indo- Pakistani War of 1947–1948 and a subsequent sharing of the state. The settlement was non-agreeable to both the parties and since then, this had become an ongoing intractable issue leading to a war in 1965. The nations also partook in another war in 1971 which led to the formation of Bangladesh. Both countries developed nuclear weapons in the 1990s and this had a sobering effect on the next major conflict the 1999 Kargil War. As of now, the Line of Control demarcates the areas of administration: Pakistan administers the territory to the northwest of the line; India administers the territory to the southeast. Since 1989, a militant-fueled insurgency has raged in Indian- administered Kashmir, driven by a desire for either independence or union with Pakistan.Conflict Encyclopedia – India: Kashmir , Uppsala Conflict Data Program, 29 May 1977, retrieved 2013-05-29, The United Nations has stated Pakistan was providing material support to the militants and stated India was committing human-rights violations.Why the Kashmir conflict is not just an India-Pakistan border dispute , PBS, March 9, 2019.

Military events Pulwama attack The 2019 Indo-Pakistan military standoff is a result of a militant attack in February 2019, when a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy carrying security personnel on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway was attacked by a vehicle-borne suicide bomber at Lethpora in the Pulwama district, Jammu and Kashmir, India. Over 40 CRPF personnel and the perpetrator were killed in the attack, which Jaish-e-Mohammed took responsibility for. The attacker was identified as Adil Ahmad Dar, a militant from Jammu and Kashmir, and a member of Jaish-e-Mohammed.Pulwama Attack 2019, everything about J&K; terror attack on CRPF by terrorist Adil Ahmed Dar, Jaish-eMohammad , India Today, 16 February 2019. This was the deadliest attack on Indian forces in Kashmir since 1989. Balakot airstrike On 26 February 2019, the Indian Air Force conducted airstrikes at Balakot in Pakistan. The strikes were subsequently stated to be \\"non-military\\" and \\"preemptive\\" in nature; targeting a Jaish-e-Mohammed facility within Pakistan. The Indian government stated that the airstrike was in retaliation to the Pulwama attack and that \\"a very large number of JeM terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and groups of jihadis\\" were eliminated who were preparing for launching another suicide attack targeting Indian assets. Indian media reported to have confirmed from official sources that twelve Mirage 2000 jets were involved in the operation and that they struck multiple militant camps in Balakot, Chakothi and Muzaffarabad operated by Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen, killing about 350 militants. The exact figures varied across media-houses. Pakistani officials acknowledged the intrusion of Indian aircraft into the country's airspace but rejected the statements about the results. They stated that the Indian jets were intercepted and that the payloads were dropped in unpopulated areas and resulted in no casualties or infrastructural damage. Pervez Khattak, the Pakistani Defence Minister, stated that the Pakistani Air Force did not retaliate at that time because \\"they could not gauge the extent of the damage\\". Business Today India stated that the area around Balakot had been cordoned off by the Pakistan Army and evidences such as the dead bodies were being cleared from the area. Praveen Swami writing for Firstpost said that Indian intelligence estimated a figure of about 20 casualties and that there were five confirmed kills per burial records. He also said there was a JeM rally in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa on 28 February, wherein Masood Azhar's brother, Abdul Rauf Rasheed Alvi mentioned India's attack of their headquarters and vowed revenge. In another piece he stated that RAW analysts estimated 90 casualties including three Pakistani Army trainers, based on intercepted communications. Swami also said there was a lack of witness testimony to independently assess the validity of above statements. This airstrike was the first time since the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 that aerial attacks had been carried out across the Line of Control. Villagers from the area said that four bombs struck a nearby forest and a field resulting in damage to a building and injuring a local man around 3:00 AM. A team from Al Jazeera visited the site two days after the strikes and said \\"splintered pine trees and rocks\\" which were strewn across the four blast craters. Local hospital officials and residents said that they did not come across any casualty or wounded people. The reporters located the facility, a school run by Jaish-e-Mohammed, at around a kilometre to the east of one of the bomb craters, atop a steep ridge, but were unable to access it. Reporters from Reuters were denied access to the madrassa by the military but they reported the structure and its vicinity to be intact from the rear. Some diplomats and analysts have raised doubts about the efficacy of the strike, stating that the terrorist groups along the border would have vacated the area, after the Indian Prime Minister vowed to retaliate against the Pulwama attack. The local people varied as to the purpose of the facility. Whilst some stated it being an active Jaish training camp, others stated it to have been a mere school for the local kids and that such militant camps had used to exist far earlier. Satellite-data analysis by Nathan Ruser, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said there was an absence of any apparent evidence to verify Indian statements. Michael Sheldon, a digital forensics analyst at the Atlantic Council, did an independent investigation on the issue, in which he said that no damage was caused to any infrastructure around the target site. He concluded that \\"something appears to have gone wrong in the targeting process\\", which was mysterious in light of the autonomous nature of the missiles reportedly used. In contrast, Indian officials said that synthetic aperture radar showed that four buildings had been destroyed; however, they did not release those images. Vice-Marshal RGK Kapoor of the Indian Air Force said on 28 February 2019 that though it was \\"premature\\" to provide details about the casualties, they had \\"fairly credible evidence\\" of the damage inflicted on the camp by the air strikes. Border skirmishes Heavy skirmishes between Pakistani and Indian forces occurred along the Line of Control on 26 February, with small arms and mortar fire being exchanged. Pakistani officials reported that at least four civilians were killed, and eleven were wounded. A 55-year-old woman and her two children were killed in the Nakyal sector. In the Khuiratta sector, a 40-year-old woman was killed. Throughout 27 February, heavy exchanges of fire between Indian and Pakistani forces continued along the Line of Control. Ten Indian soldiers were injured along with two residential houses being destroyed in the skirmishes. The Pakistani Army stated that on March 1, two of its soldiers were killed by firing from the Indian Army at the Line of Control. Shelling across the Line of Control killed a Kashmiri woman and her two sons after a shell landed on their home, with another civilian being critically wounded. On 6 and 7 March, Pakistani and Indian forces exchanged heavy artillery fire along the line of control, with Pakistani forces using 130 mm and 105 mm artillery and 120 mm mortars. In response to the Pakistani artillery fire, the Indian army began utilizing 155mm FH77B Bofors cannons against Pakistani positions. Retaliatory airstrikes, capture and release of pilot On 27 February, Pakistani military officials announced that Pakistan had carried out an airstrike against multiple targets in Jammu and Kashmir. A military spokesman said that the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) was able to lock onto Indian military installations, but opted to drop weapons into open areas instead, \\"to avoid human loss and collateral damage.\\" Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said that the airstrikes only aimed to \\"send a message\\" and appealed for negotiations to avoid a full-blown war.\\"Pakistan PM Imran Khan appeals for talks with India to avoid war \\", The Guardian The spokesman further said that the Pakistan Air Force had shot down two Indian aircraft after they encroached on Pakistan's airspace, one of which fell in Pakistan administered Kashmir while the other fell in Indian administered Kashmir. It was also stated that Pakistan Army had captured two Indian pilots, one of whom was said to be injured and taken to the Combined Military Hospital. But a subsequent statement revised the count down to one–Abhinandan Varthaman, a Wing Commander. India rejected this version of events and stated to have \\"successfully foiled\\" Pakistan's attempt to \\"target military installations\\". An Indian Air Force (IAF) official statement hours after the airstrike stated that bombs had been dropped on Indian army formation compounds, but there was no damage to military installations. The Indian military later stated that three Pakistan Air Force jets had crossed the Line of Control (LoC) from Nowshera, Jammu and Kashmir and had dropped bombs over Nadian, Laam Jhangar, Kerri in Rajouri District and Hamirpur area of Bhimber Galli in Poonch, before being pushed back by six Indian airforce jets. There were no damage or casualties. Raveesh Kumar from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs also stated that a Pakistani aircraft of the sortie was shot down by the Indian Air Force in the process. Indian defence sources initially contradicted Pakistan's statement of capturing a pilotM. Ilyas Khan, Abhinandan: Villagers recount dramatic capture of pilot , BBC Newshttps://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-pakistan-says-it- has-shot-down-two-iaf-jets-inside-its-territory-captured-one-indian- pilot/326198 but subsequently the Indian Ministry of External Affairs confirmed that an Indian pilot was missing in action after a MiG-21 Bison fighter plane was lost while engaging with Pakistani jets. The retaliatory air strikes coupled with the capture of the Indian pilot led to a heightened state of military alert. Tanks were deployed to the border in the Pakistani side whilst several Kashmiri residents reportedly fled their homes and painted their homes with red-cross signs to avert air-strikes. Pakistan released the captured pilot on 1 March, describing the move as a gesture of peace. The Indian Air Force though stated that the pilot's release was an obligation under the Geneva Conventions. The Indian media also criticized Pakistan's release of his photographs and interrogation videos to be against the protocols of the convention. A video published by the state just prior to his release that showed him praising Pakistani Army and condemning Indian media was criticized for being heavily edited.  Naval intrusion  On 5 March, the Pakistani Navy stated to have successfully warded off an intrusion attempt by an Indian submarine into its territorial waters and released a video of a surfaced submarine. The Indian Navy subsequently rejected these statements as \\"false propaganda.\\" Other incidents Closure of Pakistani airspace On 27 February, Pakistan cancelled all commercial flights and closed its airspace until the midnight of 28 February. A NOTAM was issued by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority to close the airspace. Airlines were required to reroute or cancel their flights with routes planned over Pakistan. On 1 March, the NOTAM closing the airspace was extended until 8:00 AM (UTC) on 4 March with 23 exceptions listed.https://www.caapakistan.com.pk/upload/Notams/A210-19.txt Pakistan's airspace was closed for flights crossing the country's airspace except for arriving and departing flights at major airports in Pakistan. The airspace closure was again repeatedly extended,. The Pakistan finally opened its airspace for all civilian aircraft on 15 July 2019, after 140 days. India did not close down its civilian air traffic and only the Srinagar airspace was closed for 2–3 hours on the day of the skirmish. However the Pakistani flights were allowed usage of Indian airspace only after 15 July when Pakistan opened up its airspace. The airspace closure led to a loss of for Pakistan due to the skipping of its airspace by an average of 400 aircraft daily. Air India suffered loss of till 2 July, as it had to reroute its flights that were affected by the closure of Pakistani airspace. Similarly private Indian airlines SpiceJet lost ₹ 30.73 crore, IndiGo lost ₹ 25.1 crore and GoAir lost ₹ 2.1 crore. Suspension of Samjhauta Express On 28 February, Samjhauta Express, a train that runs twice weekly between India and Pakistan, was suspended by the government of Pakistan. It was scheduled to depart from Lahore with 16 passengers, who were stranded there. On 4 March, Pakistan, and consequently India, resumed the operations of Samjhauta Express. Pakistan arrests suspected militants On 5 March, Pakistan arrested 44 members of various groups, including the Jaish-e-Muhammad. Some of those arrested had been named by India in a dossier it gave to Pakistan in the aftermath of the Pulwama attack.Asghar, Naseem. \\"Son of Masood Azhar among 44 arrested ,\\" The Express Tribune. Pakistan said those arrested will be held for at least 14 days, and if India provided further evidence they would be prosecuted.Asad Hashim. \\"Pakistan arrests scores in fresh crackdown on armed groups ,\\" Al Jazeera English Among those arrested were relatives of JeM leader Masood Azhar, including his son Hamad Azhar and his brother Abdul Rauf. Peace Offer Both Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan and Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi agreed on a peace offer on 22 March ending hostilities and vowed to fight against terrorism together. Aftermath  Revocation of special status and August border clashes  On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir (subscription required) Quote: \\"Jammu and Kashmir, state of India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent in the vicinity of the Karakoram and westernmost Himalayan mountain ranges. The state is part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947.\\" On 15 August Pakistan and Indian forces exchanged fire over the disputed frontier in Kashmir, leaving 3 Pakistani soldiers dead and two civilians. On 21 August the Indian- administered Kasmir police informed about a gun battle that left a rebel and a police officer killed. The deceased militant was a member of Lashkar-e-Taiba a terror organization.  Artillery strike  The Statesman reported that 18 terrorists and 16 Pakistani soldiers were killed when Indian Army launched artillery strikes on terrorist camps in Neelum valley on October 19 and 20. Mohammad Faisal, however, said that five Pakistani civilians had died. International reaction A number of nations, including Australia, Canada, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States, expressed their concern, with some calling for restraint. Iran and Turkey have each offered to mediate the crisis.

It has rough, dark grey bark on the lower part of its stems and smooth bark on its upper parts. The adult leaves are lance-shaped, the flower buds are ribbed and arranged in groups of seven, the flowers are pale yellow and the fruit are conical with longitudinal ribs. Description Eucalyptus annettae is a tree in the form of a mallet that grows to a height of but does not develop a lignotuber. Thicker stems have hard but thin, dark grey bark while the upper parts have smooth, dull cream-coloured to grey bark that is shed in strips. The adult leaves are lance-shaped, long and wide, dull and bluish at first but become glossy as they mature. The flowers buds are borne in groups of seven on a flattened, widening peduncle that curves downwards and is long and wide. The mature flower buds are waxy, long and the floral cup is ribbed. The operculum is conical about long, the same length as or up to twice as long as the floral cup. The stamens are mid-yellow. The fruits are waxy, cone-shaped capsules with longitudinal ridges and long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus annettae was first formally described in 2012 Dean Nicolle and Malcolm French and the description was published in Nuytsia from a specimen collected in the Cape Arid National Park. The specific epithet (annettae) honours Annett Borner, the wife of one of the authors. Distribution and habitat This tree is only known from a small area near Israelite Bay where it grows in shrubland.

The company was set up in September 2013 by French entrepreneurs Edouard Gorioux and Jérémy Bismuth. In August 2020, the platform featured 35,000 listed boats in Europe and globally, accessible to more than 400,000 registered members. The platform is available in English (US, UK and international business English), French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Greek, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese and Swedish.  History  Jérémy Bismuth and Edouard Gorioux, two entrepreneurs from Marseille and Brittanny respectively, set up Click&Boat; in September 2013, launching the website on December 2013. The startup raised €200,000 from private investors in April 2014. A month later, Click and Boat joined the incubator of Paris Dauphine University with five members of staff. By June 2014, more than 500 boats in France and Europe were available on the platform. The company offers a wide range of boats, from speedboats to houseboats (barges). In December 2014, one year after the launch of the platform, Click and Boat launched its first mobile application. Between July 2014 and July 2015, the company grew by 1,000%. By September 2015, boat owners listing their boats on the platform had earned €2m, while the company raised €500,000 in December 2015 to expand its services.http://startuppers.eu/2015/12/29/french-peer-to-peer-boat-rental- startup-click-boat-raises-e500000-in-funding/ The same month, the Click and Boat team took part in the Paris International Boat Show. In November 2016, the company bought its French competitor Sailsharing and established itself as the leader in peer-to-peer boat rental in France, increasing its boat listings by 30%. The same month, shortly before its participation in the Salon Nautique International of Paris, the startup announced a funding round of €1m raised from OLMA Fund to accelerate its international development, bringing the total amount of raised capital since its launch to €1.7m. The company launched its US homepage in February 2017. Overall, bookings made in 2017 were worth €15m. In November 2017, Click and Boat announced the opening of the platform to professional yacht charter companies, with a target of 30,000 listed boats in 50 countries by the end of 2018. Two months later, in January 2018, French sailor Francois Gabart joined the company as shareholder and official ambassador, listing his own boat on the platform. In June 2018, Click&Boat; raised €4m from previous investors to accelerate its international development. The company's co-founder Edouard Gorioux said to CNN: \\"Our target is to become the international leader, as Airbnb is for apartments\\". The majority of bookings are made by non-French customers. The company opened an office in Marseille in March 2019, hiring 50 new members of staff. Marseille is close to the Calanques, a popular boating destination in Southern France. As well as a new office in Miami, Flordia, USA, in April 2019. By August 2019, the platform offered more than 30,000 boats in over 50 countries worldwide. Click and Boat makes its first international acquisition of its German competitor Scansail in March 2020. In July 2020, the Click and Boat Group opened their fifth office in Barcelona and became the benchmark in global nautical tourism with an addition 10,000 boats on their platform after the acquisition of their number one competitor Nautal.  Business Model  Click&Boat; connects private and professional boat owners with sailing enthusiasts. The former can thus make a profit out of their vessels, since these can often be expensive to maintain and leave the marina 10 days per year on average. Hiring a boat through a private owner can be up to three times cheaper than doing this through a professional company. The company's business model is based on two concurrent trends: the collaborative consumption or sharing economy, where use as a service is preferred over ownership, and the rise of online tourism through travel websites. CNN referred to the company as ‘the Airbnb of the Seas’, while The Times dubbed it ‘the Uber of the boating world’. Since 2015 the company has been running a profit, doubling its turnover on an annual basis.  Operation  Owners can choose to rent out their boats with or without skipper, or alternatively be on board with the renter. In most locations, daily insurance covering all risks is provided through the company's partnership with Allianz.  Awards  In 2016, the startup was included in Frenchweb's FW500 ranking, featuring the top 500 French digital companies. The French newspaper L'Express ranked Click&Boat; as one of its top 200 startups for the same year.

Playing career Born in Madrid, Diezma graduated from Real Madrid's youth setup. After making his senior debut while on loan at Tercera División side CF Extremadura in the 1988–89 season, he returned to his parent club and was assigned to the reserves in Segunda División. Diezma made his professional debut on 17 March 1990, starting in a 3–1 home win against Levante UD. A backup to Santiago Cañizares, he only featured in three matches before returning to Extremadura, now in Segunda División B. In 1992, after two years as an undisputed starter, Diezma joined Real Betis in the second division, playing a key part in their promotion to La Liga in 1994. However, after the arrival of Pedro Jaro, he was demoted to second-choice, only making his debut in the category on 19 May 1996, in a 1–0 home defeat of Deportivo de La Coruña. In 1996, Diezma moved to fellow top tier club Celta de Vigo, acting as a backup option to Richard Dutruel. A move to CD Numancia followed, and he featured regularly during his first season as his side achieved promotion to the top tier. Completely ostracized by new manager Andoni Goikoetxea, Diezma did not feature in a single match for Numancia during the 1999–2000 campaign, being released in December. He subsequently represented second division sides Recreativo de Huelva, Real Murcia and Elche CF before joining Orihuela CF in the third level in July 2002. In 2003, Diezma signed for FC Cartagena still in the third division. In July of the following year, he agreed to a contract with Mérida UD in the fourth tier, and retired with the club at the end of the season. Managerial career Immediately after retiring Diezma took up coaching, working as a goalkeeping coach in Míchel's staff at Rayo Vallecano. In 2006 he returned to his first club Real Madrid, being in charge of the club's youth categories for four full seasons. On 28 July 2010, Diezma was appointed manager of AD Cerro de Reyes in the third division, but was dismissed in December. The following July, he was presented as manager of fourth tier club Real Ávila. On 6 June 2013, Diezma left Ávila after not agreeing to a contract renewal. On 7 July he was appointed at the helm of Extremadura UD, but was relieved from his duties on 9 September. Diezma subsequently moved abroad, working at football schools in China and Saudi Arabia.

Foundation  Mounted Police Barracks in 1890, former site of the society The society was founded in 1977. For some years it occupied rooms at the former Mounted Police Barracks, North Terrace, Adelaide. It is currently based at the Thebarton Police Barracks complex, 1 Gaol Road, Adelaide. The society works closely with the South Australia Police (SAPOL) and ever since its foundation the serving Commissioner of Police has agreed to hold the position of honorary patron. Membership is open to all, police and non-police.  Collections and activities  Activities focus on recording, preserving, and promoting the history and heritage of the South Australia Police and its role within the South Australian community. Monthly meetings feature guest speakers on related topics. Police Foundation Day is a significant event, held annually on 28 April, commemorating the anniversary of the date when SAPOL was founded in 1838. A museum spread over five galleries contains policing objects and uniforms, historical and recent. One of these galleries is a vehicle collection displaying police transport through the ages.Pisani, Ashleigh. (3 October 2018). \\"Vintage vehicles veer into our vicinity\\", Messenger, Adelaide, Australia. Another gallery exhibits the plaster cast made in 1949 of an unknown man's head and chest from the unsolved Tamam Shud case. Others activities include maintaining a photographic and documentary archive and database, a library, conducting an annual open day, and attending community events and re-enactments in support of local police activities. Historical research on police personnel and establishments is provided on a fee for service basis. The not-for-profit organisation is self- funded, mainly through conducting police museum tours and sales of books and memorabilia. Except on open day, tours are by appointment only.  Distinctive themes  In addition to the usual police history narratives the society keenly promotes the many elements unique to South Australia. SAPOL was founded on 28 April 1838 under the command of Inspector Henry Inman. Although Australia had several older individual policing services, that of South Australia was the first to have authority over an entire colony. It is therefore credited as being the third oldest centrally controlled police force in the world after the London Metropolitan Police (1829) and Dublin (1836) forces. In 1852-53 SAPOL conducted a gold escort service between the Victorian goldfields and Adelaide which revived the economy of South Australia. SAPOL can also claim to have, since 1915, the first women police in the then British Empire to be sworn in with equal pay and conditions to male police. In 1880 SAPOL were the first Australian police to regularly use camels for patrolling in the harsh outback. Along with horses (and later, motor vehicles), this continued right through to 1951. From 1868 to 1911 the Northern Territory was policed by SAPOL.  Magazine – Hue and Cry  The very earliest policing in South Australia was based on the process of hue and cry which relied on citizen volunteers. In 1852 SAPOL issued an official publication titled Hue and Cry containing details of crimes and wanted people.\\"Register\\" newspaper, 13 Sept 1852. In 1861 this was renamed the Police Gazette, published weekly for well over 100 years. When in 1979 the Society commenced publication of an official newsletter it was titled Hue and Cry to commemorate the original. It is today a bi-monthly magazine circulated to all Society members.

Nevertheless, the world media began to widely cover the activities of Lapshin when, in 2016, he was arrested in Minsk at the request of the Azerbaijani authorities and extradited to Baku due to a tourist visit to Nagorno-Karabakh. This caused tension in relations between Armenia and Belarus, and also became the topic of the foreign policy agenda in Israel and Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russia is categorically against the extradition of the blogger to Azerbaijan, as well as against the criminalization of visits by Russians to certain regions of the world. Israel also protested against the extradition. As a result, five states were and involved in an international scandal concerning the blogger. Biography Alexander Lapshin was born in 1976 in Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg), to a Russian father and Jewish mother. At the age of 13, he emigrated to Israel with his family. After graduating from the University of Haifa, he served three years with the Israel Defense Forces, both in the Gaza Strip and on the Lebanese-Israeli border. For about a year, he studied in the United States. Between 2003 and 2008, he lived in Moscow and was engaged in commercial real estate and the Forex market. After the financial crisis of 2008, he returned to Israel. Until 2016, he lived on the Rosh HaNikra kibbutz in Israel, near the border with Lebanon, working as a remote editor of Russian travel Internet resources. Arrest On 15 December 15, 2016, Lapshin was arrested in Minsk at the request of Azerbaijan, which had put him on a “black list” for visiting the Nagorno Karabakh Republic without approval from Baku. Lapshin visited Nagorno-Karabakh twice, in 2011 and 2012, resulting in the \\"blacklisting\\" by Azerbaijan, i.e. he was prohibited from visiting Azerbaijan. Nevertheless, Alexander Lapshin was able to visit Baku in June 2016, having entered Azerbaijan with his Ukrainian passport, which used the spelling “Olexander” instead of “Alexander” (due to the Ukrainian transliteration). The General Prosecutor's Office of Belarus decided to satisfy the request by Azerbaijan and extradited Lapshin to Azerbaijan on 7 February 7, 2017 on President Ilham Aliyev's personal jet. Diplomats of both Russia and Israel actively attempted to prevent his extradition to Azerbaijan. The Republic of Armenia actively protested his extradition as well. As a result, diplomats and officials of five countries were involved in the case. The representative of the US State Department John Kirby spoke about the Lapshin case. In Yerevan, future Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan organized protests in front of the Belarusian embassy after Lapshin was extradited from Minsk to Baku. Later, Lapshin personally thanked Pashinyan for this support. The protest in connection with the extradition of Lapshin was also announced by the OSCE. Numerous Russian politicians spoke out against Lapshin’s extradition to Azerbaijan, such as Tatyana Moskalkova, Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation, who called the incident a gross violation of the rights of journalists. The leader of the LDPR faction Vladimir Zhirinovsky condemned Lukashenko's decision to extradite a Russian citizen to Azerbaijan, saying that the journalist has the right to go wherever he wishes to fulfill his professional duty. Some politicians and public figures of Turkey spoke out against Lapshin’s extradition, such as the deputy of the Turkish Mejlis and the founder of the Green Party Ufuk Uras and human rights activist Shanar Yurdatapan. A number of Czech politicians condemned Lapshin’s extradition, primarily the Czech Republic’s deputy in the European Parliament, Jaromír Štětina, the Czech ambassador to Armenia Petr Mikiska. Also, the European MPs Frank Engel (Luxembourg) and Eleni Thehouse (Cyprus) joined the call to immediately release the blogger. Shortly before Lapshin’s arrest, Alexander Lukashenko paid a visit to Baku in late November 2016, during which the Belarusian president received the medal after Heydar Aliyev (the country's highest award), from the hands of Ilham Aliyev, kissed it and promised to “work it out”. A court in Baku sentenced Lapshin to three years in prison. Three months after that, on 11 September 2017, Ilham Aliyev signed a decree to pardon Alexander Lapshin, after which he was able to fly from Baku to Tel Aviv. Attempted murder On the night of 11 September 2017, Lapshin was attacked in a solitary confinement cell of a Baku pre-trial detention center. In the morning of September 11, Ali Hasanov, a personal adviser to the president, made a statement that Lapshin had attempted suicide, but that the prison guards managed to save his life. It was also stated that, in connection with this incident, it was decided to pardon him by presidential decree. Lapshin spent 3 days in the intensive care unit of a Baku hospital and then was deported to Israel. After arriving in Israel, Lapshin made a statement to the press that he had not committed suicide and that he had been attacked in Baku with the aim of murder. Medical examinations conducted in Israel confirmed the blogger’s version of the attempted murder, which contradicted the official position of the Baku authorities. Independent experts in Russia and the Netherlands also confirmed the assassination version, which became the basis for filing a complaint against Azerbaijan to the ECHR in Strasbourg. The circumstances of the arrest and pardon The arrest and extradition of Lapshin from Belarus to Azerbaijan remains a hot topic for the media and politicians in a numerous countries. Lapshin himself repeatedly published documents indicating that the authorities of Belarus arrested him illegally, fabricating non-existent charges and acting in violation of its own legislation. The authorities of Belarus kept Lapshin in the same cell with Belarusian opposition leader and activist Ales Yurkoit, as well as with Japanese artist Daichi Yoshida. Lapshin repeatedly gave interviews on the topic of bullying and lawlessness happening in Belarusian prisons. As for Azerbaijan, Lapshin claimed that he was kept next to the convicted Azerbaijani general Arif Chovdarov and was familiar with the Baku blogger Mehman Galandarov, also a prisoner who later has died in a prison cell under unclear circumstances. The President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, stated that Lapshin was arrested in Minsk at the request of Interpol, while Interpol reported that the blogger’s name was never on the wanted list. The extradition of Lapshin from Azerbaijan to Israel as a result of a pardon given by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev also passed with a scandal. The Azerbaijani authorities claimed that they had long ago agreed to extradite him to Israel, but for some reason the Israeli side did not agree on the necessary procedure and as a result, Lapshin attempted suicide, which Lapshin subsequently denied and called the attempted murder. In addition, the blogger arrested as a Russian citizen was extradited to Israel as an Israeli citizen. The contradictions regarding whether Lapshin pleaded guilty to the acts incriminated to him (visiting Nagorno-Karabakh without the consent of Azerbaijan) are noteworthy, since the Azerbaijani media claim that Lapshin pleaded guilty, while the Russian media claim that he did not plead. The pardon of the blogger by the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, was published on the official website of the head of state on September 11, 2017 at 10:35 in the morning, less than two hours after Lapshin’s admission to the Baku hospital (according to the Azerbaijani authorities, the blogger attempted suicide, according to Lapshin himself on he was attacked), which, according to some analysts, indicates that the incident could be related to the internal political struggle within Azerbaijan and attempts to discredit the current government. After his release, Lapshin has been actively involved in the struggle for human rights; he has repeatedly spoken in organizations such as the UN, PACE, OSCE, and at various international forums and conferences. Also in Washington, the blogger met with Armenian President Armen Sargsyan and congressmen Brad Sherman and David Price, whom he acquainted with the violation of human rights in Azerbaijan. Third countries involvement The authorities of the Republic of Azerbaijan issued an arrest warrant against Lapshin to at least 13 countries, but were refused all, except of Belarus. A complete list of these countries has not been announced anywhere by Azerbaijan, however, some sources indicate one of the countries - Ukraine, that officially refused to cooperate in a criminal prosecution of a blogger. In June 2019, Lapshin has accused the Georgian authorities of illegally transferring his personal information to the Azerbaijani authorities. In addition, Lapshin stated that he had documents indicating the transfer by the Georgian authorities of information about hundreds of tourists and Armenian citizens crossing the Georgian-Armenian border. New criminal prosecution of Lapshin by Azerbaijan In February 2019, it became known about the re- initiation of criminal proceedings by the General Prosecutor of Azerbaijan against the blogger and journalist Alexander Lapshin. This time, the Baku authorities accused the journalist on the articles \\"Discrediting or humiliating the honor and dignity of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan\\" and \\"Open calls against the Government of Azerbaijan\\". It is noteworthy that official Baku has refused to comment on this issue, while the Israeli Foreign Ministry not only made an official statement about the new persecution of its citizen, but also emphasized in its statement that Lapshin should be careful when leaving Israel, thereby emphasizing his disagreement with the actions of Azerbaijan. A number of analysts attribute Israel’s similar steps to certain irritation regarding Baku’s actions against a blogger and journalist who is a citizen of the Jewish state. Attempted kidnapping of Lapshin in Latvia On December 15, 2019, the information was published about an attempt to kidnap a blogger during his stay in Riga (Latvia). According to the Israel and Russian media reports, the order to abduct Lapshin came personally from the General Ali Nagiyev, a head of the special services of Azerbaijan and with the participation of criminal authorities controlled by him in the Azerbaijani diaspora of Latvia. Based on information in the media, the kidnapping attempt was supposed to take place at the Mercury Riga hotel, where Lapshin supposed to participate at a tourism forum. While the Azerbaijani government has refused to comment on this incident, the Azerbaijani mass media and Azeri based experts deny the Israeli and Russian versions. Thanks to the actions of local Latvian law enforcement authorities, Lapshin was subsequently able to return to Israel. Lapshin's appeal to the ECHR against Azerbaijan At the beginning of 2018, Alexander Lapshin filed a lawsuit against Azerbaijan in the European Court of Human Rights (EHCR), in which he accused Azerbaijan of attempted murder, torture, illegal imprisonment. His lawyer is Karina Moskalenko, who also represents Alexey Navalny in a complaint against the Russian Federation. On December 15, 2018, the European Court notified Lapshin’s lawyers that he had begun communication with the Azerbaijani authorities, having decided that the evidence presented about the attempted murder in a Baku prison, the infliction of grievous bodily harm and torture was enough to initiate proceedings against Azerbaijan. On July 3, 2019, the Azerbaijani authorities filed their objections to Lapshin’s lawsuit. They adhere to the previously stated version that Lapshin tried to commit an act of suicide by hanging in a Baku detention center, but the authorities managed to save his life. Charges of attempted murder are rejected. At the same time, many experts draw attention to numerous contradictions in the official version of events presented by Baku. In the objections submitted to the ECHR, they presented photographs of a belt and a nail on which Lapshin allegedly hanged himself. At the same time, the presence in Lapshin’s solitary confinement of absolutely prohibited items (nails, belts, cutting instruments) raises questions. Authorities also comment on Lapshin’s statement that no investigation was held on the attempted assassination incident and claim that the investigation was not carried out because they did not receive a formal request from Lapshin himself. This thesis raises no less questions, since any attempt on life or attempted suicide is necessarily investigated regardless of the desire of the injured person himself. Also still unclear the question with Lapshin’s letter to the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, where he thanks the head of state for pardon and recognizes Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan. The authorities attached this handwritten letter to their objections, however, the date of writing the letter is September 11, 2017. According to the authorities, Lapshin attempted suicide on this day and was hospitalized in a coma in the intensive care unit of the Baku Central Hospital and it remains unclear how this letter could be written. As for Lapshin himself, he has stated to a number of media outlets, that he never addressed the President of Azerbaijan with thanks, and considers this letter as a \\"fake\\". Lapshin's visit to the Saudi Arabia On 2 of February 2020 Lapshin paid a visit to the Kingdom of Saudia Arabia to be the first Israeli citizen to visit the kingdom officially since 1948, when the state of Israel was created. The Interior Ministry of Israel announced on January 26, 2020 that it will now permit Israelis to visit Saudi Arabia, for the first time in Israel’s history. The new rules will allow travel to Saudi Arabia for the Islamic pilgrimages known as the Hajj and the Umrah, or for business trips of up to 90 days.

When a visual stimulus moves along a continuous trajectory, the initial position of this trajectory may be seen ahead of its veridical position with respect to an unpredictable event such as a punctuate flash. The Fröhlich effect is a visual illusion wherein the first position of a moving object entering a window is misperceived. When observers are asked to localize the onset position of the moving target, they typically make localization errors in the direction of movement (\\"ahead\\" of its true localization). A proposed explanation for this effect is that the visual system is predictive, accounting for neural delays by extrapolating the trajectory of a moving stimulus into the future. In other words, when light from a moving object hits the retina, a certain amount of time is required before the object is perceived. In that time, the object has moved to a new location in the world. The motion extrapolation hypothesis asserts that the visual system will take care of such delays by extrapolating the position of moving objects forward in time. As such it is related to the flash lag illusion.

She is joint head of the public law and human rights team at Bindmans LLP, in London. Education and personal life Chahal was born in Punjab, India. She attended primary school in Twickenham and the Kneller Girls' School. She has a BA in sociology from the University of Sussex. She qualified in law in 1990, joined Bindmans LLP in 1993 and became a partner in 1995. Chahal is married to Stephen Pierce and they have two children, a daughter Asta Chahal-Pierce, and a son Jamie Chahal-Pierce. Career Chahal first came to the attention of the press when she was interviewed by the Guardian (22 Sept 1990) as the supervising solicitor at Battersea Law Centre because Wandsworth council with the lowest poll tax in the country had decided to axe the Law Centre’s funding.  Cases – right to die with dignity  At Bindmans LLP Chahal has worked on many high-profile and cutting edge cases involving right-to-die campaigners, including Tony Nicklinson, Omid T, and Phil Newby.  Debbie Purdy  She acted for Debbie Purdy, a campaigner for assisted dying, whose case went to the Supreme Court in July 2009, where in a landmark victory the DPP was obliged to formulate guidance to Crown Prosecutors on how they would decide whether to prosecute or not in cases of those helping their loved ones to die. This was the last judgment of the House of Lords before if rose to sit as the newly formed Supreme Court and the painting The Last Judgment hangs in the dining room of the Supreme Court justices. Chahal appears in the book written by Debbie Purdy who describes the first meeting with Chahal in, It's Not because I want to Die. Chahal appeared on BBC Radio 4's 2019 Test Case: The Legacy of Debbie Purdy, to discuss Purdy's case with professor Deborah Bowman, Purdy's husband Omar Puente, and barrister and peer Charlie Falconer, and Omid T. who travelled to Switzerland for an assisted death in October 2018 while waiting for the courts to consider his case seeking \\"a declaration under Section 4 (2) of the Human Rights Act that Section 2 (1) of the Suicide Act 1961 which makes assisting in a suicide a criminal offence is incompatible with his rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights\\".  Tony Nicklinson  Chahal worked on Nicklinson’s case. Nicklinson, a then 56 year old from Wiltshire, a father of two daughters, suffered a stroke in 2005, which left him almost totally paralysed, only able to move his eyes and head. While Nicklinson was able to make an informed, and fully consensual decision to end his life, his disabilities meant that he could not take his life unassisted, meaning anyone who helped him would face a murder charge.  Savage  In a widely reported case Chahal acted for Anna Savage whose mother jumped in front of a train whilst a detained patient. Chahal devised a novel challenge under the Human Rights Act arguing violation of her right to life under Art2 ECHR. The Trust argued that it would open the flood gates to claims.  Yorkshire Ripper  Chahal represented the \\"Yorkshire Ripper\\" Peter Sutcliffe in his appeal to have a tariff, or minimum term, set for his sentence, and received hate-mail and negative media coverage. In response she said \\"If I wasn't the person I am I would have asked myself why I took that case on — but I felt I was doing my job as a lawyer. Peter Sutcliffe is entitled to good legal representation as much as anyone else. It is a fundamental right enshrined in our legal system. My job is to do the best I can and not to be bullied and distracted from that course.\\" A journalist Fiona Bawden responded by writing an article about Chahal's unfair treatment by the Tabloids, in Trial by Tabloid for Ripper's Lawyer.  Junior doctors  In 2016 Chahal represented five junior doctors in their judicial review claim against the Secretary for State for Health, who was attempting to impose a new contract on Junior Doctors which would adversely affect doctors' pay and working conditions. Dr White, Dr McVeigh, Dr. Masood, Dr. Silman and Dr. Mashru, the junior doctors who founded the company Justice for Health Ltd, instructed Chahal in February 2016 immediately after Jeremy Hunt had announced a \\"decision to impose a contract on the junior doctors\\". Other notable cases Chahal represented a mother taking action against a doctor who circumcised her son at the father's request without the mother's consent, and represented Michael Sandford, a British man with autism arrested after trying to take a policeman's gun at a Donald Trump rally. Chahal was selected to form part of a legal panel representing three of the most powerful human rights law firms assembled by Times Law in a bid to help secure the release of the well known Chinese artist, Ai Weiwei from prison. Chahal acted for Alhammad in 1997 and won a landmark victory against the Welcome Trust the landlord in a housing case in the court of Appeal which reversed an earlier ruling and gave protection back to hundreds of tenants where tenants had lost protection when a leaseholder surrenders his/her tenancy. Recognition She was appointed Queen's Counsel (honoris causa) in 2014. This distinction given to lawyers \\"recognises their pioneering contribution to the law of England and Wales outside of practice in the courts\\".

Four years later she found a tree that was resistant to the disease and named it Betty which was used to help identify three genetic markers associated with resistance against the disease. Anne is heavily involved in the Nornex consortium, an open-access and crowdsourcing approach, which was established to respond to this outbreak. This involved creating a game, Fraxinus, where players analyse real data. She continues to play an active role in researching the disease, for example in estimating the mortality of trees it infects and tracing back how the fungus entered the country from just one or two fruiting bodies.  Grasspea  During her career Edwards has also worked on grass pea (Lathyrus sativus), one of the oldest known crops, native to southern and eastern Europe, Ethiopia, India, Bangladesh and Nepal. Grass pea is a key food source and is extremely drought and flood resistant. It has a very high protein content and as a nodulating legume it requires no artificial fertiliser so can grow on, and improve, the poorest of soils. However, grass pea produces a toxin that can cause irreversible paralysis if it is consumed as the main food source over several months. As such, with Cathie Martin, Edwards is working to develop safe varieties that can be used by smallholder farmers.

Badayuni was a Hanafi scholar who had deep knowledge of Islamic jurisprudence. His Urdu statements on Islamic subjects were published as Tariqi Fatwa, which later became famous. His grandson \`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni followed him as the Grand Mufti. British period In the British ruling period, Islamic scholars noted Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi who was the spiritual leader of Indian Muslims, scholar and revivalist. Thousands of students and scholars were attracted to his works and requested him to become Grand Mufti, but he declined. He wanted to be engaged with educational revival and writing. Instead, his student Amjad Ali Aazmi was elected. His book on Hanafi fiqh, Bahar-e-Shariat became a reference on this subject. Along with him, Mustafa Raza Khan Qadri s/o. Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi was the Grand Mufti during Indira Gandhi's administration. He protested the Family Planning Program enacted by the government.  Grand Muftiship of Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad  Kanthapuram A. P. Aboobacker Musliyar was sworn in as the Grand Mufti of India on 24 February 2019 at the Ramlila Maidan. He became the first Grand Mufti from south India.

Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman VrC (born 21 June 1983) is an Indian Air Force fighter pilot who, during the 2019 India–Pakistan standoff, was held captive in Pakistan for 60 hours after his aircraft was shot down in an aerial dogfight. Pakistan released videos and images showing Varthaman being rescued from a violent mob of villagers by its soldiers, receiving first aid and being questioned while blindfolded. Despite a legal attempt to thwart it, Pakistan decided on 28 February 2019 to release him as a \\"gesture of peace\\" and he returned to India at Wagah on 1 March 2019. Varthaman was conferred the Vir Chakra gallantry award in August 2019. His distinctive style of moustache later became popular in India. Early life and career Abhinandan was born on 21 June 1983. Abhinandan's family is from Thirupanamoor, a village about from Kanchipuram. His father is a retired Indian Air Force (IAF) Air Marshal (OF-8) and his mother is a doctor. Abhinandan was educated at Sainik Welfare School, Chennai. He graduated from the National Defence Academy and was commissioned into the combat (fighter) stream of the IAF as a flying officer on 19 June 2004. He was trained at the IAF centres in Bathinda and Halwara, promoted to flight lieutenant on 19 June 2006, and to squadron leader on 8 July 2010. Abhinandan was a Su-30 MKI fighter pilot before being assigned to the MiG-21 Bison squadron. He was promoted to wing commander on 19 June 2017. Abhinandan is married to a retired IAF Squadron Leader and lives in Chennai. They have two children. Capture On 27 February 2019, Varthaman was flying a MiG-21 as a part of a sortie that was scrambled to intercept an intrusion into Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistani aircraft. In the dogfight that ensued, he crossed into Pakistan territory and his aircraft was struck by a missile. Varthaman ejected and safely descended into the village of Horran in Pakistan administered Kashmir, approximately from the Line of Control. Local villagers said Varthaman could be identified as an Indian pilot by the Indian flag on his parachute. Upon landing, Varthaman asked the villagers whether he was in India, to which a young boy said yes. Varthaman reportedly said pro-India slogans, to which the locals responded with pro-Pakistan slogans. Varthaman began to run while firing warning shots. He ran for approximately to a small pond, where he attempted to sink and swallow some of his documents. The villagers captured and manhandled Varthaman before he was rescued by the Pakistan Army. Later that day, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs confirmed an Indian pilot was missing in action after a MiG-21 Bison fighter aircraft was lost while engaging with Pakistani jets. A statement released by the IAF also said before the crash, Varthaman had shot down a PAF Lockheed Martin F-16. At a media briefing on 2 March 2019, nearly two days after the aerial engagement between PAF and IAF, the IAF displayed the parts of AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles, which could be used only by the PAF's F-16. The IAF also said they had identified the electronic signatures of the aircraft and confirmed that F-16 were used during the skirmish. According to an agreement between the US and Pakistan, Pakistan is only allowed to use the F-16 against terrorists. Article in \\"India Today\\". Pakistan's Inter-Services Public Relations Director General refuted the later claims and said F-16s had not been used in the incident. The US-based Foreign Policy magazine, quoting unnamed US officials, reported in April 2019 that an audit didn't find any Pakistani F-16s missing.https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/04/did-india-shoot-down-a-pakistani- jet-u-s-count-says-no/However, the same has not been confirmed by US Official citing it as bilateral matter between US and Pakistanhttps://eurasiantimes.com/us-refuses-to-confirm-if-indian-mig-21-shot- down-pakistani-f-16-fighter-jet/  Videos  Videos and images released by Pakistani authorities showed Varthaman being rescued from a violent mob by Pakistani soldiers and being interrogated while tied and blindfolded with a bloody face. Other videos showed him receiving first aid and being further interrogated over tea. The media received a mixed reception; some commentators criticised the reports as a \\"vulgar display\\" while others praised the intervention of the Pakistani soldiers when Varthaman was in the hands of the mob. The release of the videos was suspected of being a violation of the Geneva Conventions and were deleted by Pakistani authorities after they went viral. Experts gave different opinions about the validity of the Geneva Convention to this case. Repatriation and subsequent developments Wagha border On 28 February 2019, Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan announced at a joint sitting of the Parliament of Pakistan the government had decided to release Abhinandan the next day as a \\"gesture of peace\\". A petition was filed before the Islamabad High Court seeking an injunction to stop his release but the court dismissed it the same day. Shah Mehmood Qureshi, the Foreign Minister of Pakistan, said his government announced the release of the IAF Wing Commander out of a desire for peace and that there was no compulsion or pressure on Pakistan, as was implied by the Indian media. Varthaman crossed the India-Pakistan border at Wagah on 1 March 2019. At a political rally, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed Abhinandan's release, saying the nation was proud of him. Hours before his release, a new video showing Varthaman praising the Pakistani army while criticizing the Indian media was released to the Pakistani media. IAF later said it had been filmed while Varthaman was under duress but no such claims were proven. A medical check-up upon his return located multiple bruises and a fractured rib but no 'significant injuries'. Abhinandan said the Pakistani authorities did not physically torture him but subjected him to considerable \\"mental harassment\\". Pakistan said he was treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. Akhil Bharatiya Digambar Jain Mahasamiti chairperson Manidra Jain announced Varthaman would be awarded the Bhagwan Mahavir Ahimsa Puraskar on 17 April 2019, the date of Mahavir Jayanti. In August that same year, he was presented with the Vir Chakra gallantry award.  Aftermath Abhinandan moustache Varthaman's style of moustache has become popular in India and is widely called the \\"Abhinandan cut\\". The style is similar to a combination of old gunslinger moustache and mutton chops worn by Franz Joseph I of Austria. It resembles the moustache worn by actor Suriya in the Singam film series and Rajinikanth's moustache in Petta (2019). Indian actor Ranveer Singh's barber, Darshan Yewalekar, has quoted saying that \\"the beard sported by the IAF pilot will soon be called India's very own Abhinandan style.\\" A number of companies used the moustache in their advertisements. Dairy company Amul produced a video showing a young girl wearing an Abhinandan-shaped milk moustache. The advertisement was posted on Twitter and received more than 170,000 views within 24 hours. Pizza Hut also posted a tweet showing the Abhinandan moustache on 3 March 2019.

In the early 1950s, low-cost vans were popular with small craft businesses. In 1949, the purchase price for flatbed variant was DM 3600. In total, 30,093 units of the GD750 were built. In 1950 and 1951, a huge quantity of vehicles were built, 8468 and 7136 units respectively. The number 750 in the type designation indicated the possible payload of 750 kg (1653 lb).Christian Steiger, Thomas Wirth, Alexander Wienen: Transporter der Wirtschaftswunderzeit. Heel Verlag, Königswinter 1996, , p. 81–85.  Technical description  The GD750 had a water-cooled two-cylinder two-stroke engine, displacing 396 cm³ (60 mm bore × 70 mm stroke). It that was rated 13 PS (9.6 kW) at 4000/min (factory documents vary from 13 to 14.5 PS). The vehicle's top speed is 50-55 km/h (31-34 mph). A constant-mesh four-speed gearbox was standard. The torque was sent to the rear axle with cardan shaft, as opposed to the front-wheel drive Tempo freight tricycles. An air-cooled 494 cm³ engine (67 mm bore × 70 mm stroke) with 16 PS (11.8 kW) was available as a factory option that cost DM 75. With this engine, the rated top speed was still 50-55 km/h. The engine was installed behind the front wheel. Unlike in the pre-war models F200 and F400, which used engines made by ILO-Motorenwerke, the engines for the GD750 were made by Goliath, and designed by August Momberger's engineering office INKA (engineer-construction-consortium).Peter Kurze: Borgward Typenkunde. 1. Auflage, Delius Klasing Verlag, Bielefeld 2009, , p. 57–59. The truck had a U-profile, V-shaped frame; the front wheel had single control arm suspension with a semi elliptic spring, the rear axle was a live axle with semi elliptic leaf springs. The brakes were mechanically operated; from 1953 onwards, they were hydraulically actuated. The chassis was available with different flatbed and box variants with a wheelbase of either 2950 or 3350 mm, and a tread width of either 1400 or 1600 mm. The length of the GD750 varied as well as its width; three different lengths were available (4410, 4660 or 5160 mm), and four different widths( 1720, 1770, 1929 or 2020 mm), the height of all vehicles was 1650 mm. The fuel consumption was rated 7 l/100 km (40 mpg (Imp.)). Initially, the GD750 was fitted with a 6 V, 90 V generator; later, it received a 6 V, 130 W one.  Variants  Most GD750 units produced were equipped with a flatbed. In addition to the flatbed and the box bodies, there were also numerous special body variants available; for instance, a livestock transporter and a mobile shop. In total, 26 different body variants were offered. The kerb weight was between 695 and 810 kg, the permissible total weight between 1455 and 1750 kg, depending on the body. In 1950, the prices were DM 3475 for the smallest flatbed, DM 4300 for the estate, and the \\"special carriage for livestock transport\\" cost DM 4805; a heater was a DM 65 extra, hydraulic brakes cost an additional DM 115.  Advertising for the Goliath GD750  In contemporary advertisements, the Goliath tricycle was often compared with the competitor \\"Tempo\\". Unlike the Tempo, the Goliath had rear-wheel drive, which was emphasised: \\"The reliable rear-wheel drive masters every incline even on snowy and slippery roads\\", \\"Goliath with rear-wheel drive, the economical 3/4 ton freight truck with the driving characteristics of a four-wheel car\\". To prove the quality of the tricycle chassis, Goliath built a world record vehicle with chassis parts from the GD750, a passenger car engine from the Goliath GP700, and an aluminum streamline body. In August 1951, this world record vehicle reached an average speed of 155 km/h for a time period of over two hours on the Monthléry race track.Georg Schmidt: Borgward – Carl F. W. Borgward und seine Autos. 4. Auflage, Motorbuch Verlag, Stuttgart 1986, , p. 114 In total, it broke 38 world records. Goliath's success caused many newspaper articles and thus free advertising. In attempts to break even more records, Goliath factory driver Hugo Steiner died in an accident on the Hockenheimring, which caused Goliath to stop breaking world records with freight vehicles.

Biography  Luis Barcala was born in Sant Joan d'Alicante. His father, Luis Barcala Muñoz, captain in the Spanish Air Force, died in a plane crash in Los Llanos, Albacete on November 19, 1974. In his childhood, he was an athlete and in 1975 he won the Alicante provincial youth championship in 80 meters and 300 meter sprint. He has been heavily involved in festivities of the Hogueras de San Juan. Since 1995 he has been a member of the \\"barraca\\" Els Chuanos (a social group that organizes activities during the event). In 1998 he became vice-secretary and in 2001 he became president of the barraca.  Political career  In 2005, Luis Barcala joined the executive committee of the People's Party (PP) of Alicante as secretary of Study and Programs. In 2011, he became city councilor of Alicante after José Joaquín Ripoll resigned after being appointed president of the Port of Alicante. In December 2013, he became councilor for Health and Environment in the administration of mayor Sonia Castedo. He resigned after the election of May 24th, 2015 when the Valencian Socialist Party (PSPV-PSOE), Guanyar Alacant (consisting of the United Left, Podemos, Green Party and the Socialist Alternative) and Compromis formed an alliance (holding 15 of 29 council seats) to remove the PP from the city government and made Gabriel Echávarri mayor.  Mayor of Alicante  On March 23, 2018, Gabriel Echávarri resigned after being indicted in several criminal cases, include allegations that he had fired the sister-in-law of Barcala in retaliation for the PP filing a criminal complain against him. PSPV-PSOE councilor Eva Montesinos became interim mayor, but city councilor Nerea Belmonte (who had previously been expelled from Podemos) abstained in the vote to confirm her. Since there was now no majority supporting an alternative candidate, Luis Barcala became mayor on April 19, 2018, as he had received the most seats in the 2015 election. There was an investigation into a possible attempt to bribe Nerea Belmonte to vote for Eva Montesinos, but the prosecutor closed the case due there being no evidence of a crime. In the local elections of May 26, 2019, Barcala's People's Party won the most seats in Alicante, but did not achieve an absolute majority. With the help of Citizens, he received 14 of 29 council votes and was re-elected, as none of the other parties were able to form an alternative majority coalition and voted for their own candidates.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. History Alfred Paddock was born in Litchfield, New York, in 1805. He worked as a merchant in western New York before moving to Concord in the 1840s and opening a store there. In 1844, he purchased the lot that this house sits on, and likely constructed a small house at that time. In about 1846, he built this larger house, converting the smaller structure into a rear carriage house. Paddock was involved in local politics, serving on the Concord Township Council in 1844, 1846, and 1848. He was elected Concord Township supervisor in 1849, and served in the State Senate in 1853. Paddock lived in this house until his death in 1870, after which the house passed to his son George. George Paddock occupied the house until 1897. Truman and Cora Piper Hubbard began renting the house in 1897, and purchased it in 1902. Truman Hubbard was also active in local politics, serving on the Concord Village Council from 1918 to 1933. In the 1930s, the Hubbards installed some Colonial modernizations to the house. They lived there until their deaths, Cora in 1953 and Truman in 1954. The house passed to the Hubbards' daughter, Mrs. Charles McFarlane, who occupied the house until her own death. Her sister, Marion Hubbard McFarlane, then moved into in the home. In 1986, Mrs. McFarlane established the Hubbard Memorial Museum Foundation in 1986; after her death in 1991, the foundation converted the house into a museum. Description The Paddock-Hubbard House is a 1-1/2-story, wood framed Greek Revival structure with a hip roof and a fieldstone foundation. A small hip-roofed second story / attic section projects from the middle of the main roof. The house is covered with clapboards. The front facade contains an entry porch with square Tuscan columns, with matching pilasters against the house. A broad architrave and frieze bands run under the cornices. On one side of the front entrance are six-over-six windows. Other windows are Colonial in appearance, likely the result of a 1930s modernization.

Life He was the son of Robert Smith. Given the frequency of the name \\"John Smith\\" it is very difficult to identify the correct individual or his dates. All that his known is that he owned two estates north-west of Edinburgh: Grothill (now called Groathill); and King's Cramond (also called Cramond Regis). Both still exist as district names.http://www.clanmacfarlanegenealogy.info/genealogy/TNGWebsite/getperson.php?personID=I50277&tree;=CC In 1634 he is first referred to as \\"John Smith of Grothill\\" in the purchase of the Southfield estate (south of Edinburgh) from William Adamson of Craigcrook (his close neighbour).Ancient and Modern State of the Parish of Cramond, by J P Wood As a burgess of Edinburgh he and one other (Hugh Kennedy of Ayr) were dispatched to London to settle the Treaty of London in 1641. He was also involved in the drafting of the Solemn League and Covenant in 1643. In 1643 he succeeded Sir Alexander Clerk of Pittencrieff as Lord Provost of Edinburgh. The time of this is critical as it immediately precedes Scotland's involvement in the English Civil War and is said to have been a tactical election. He was succeeded as Provost by Sir Archibald Tod.History of Edinburgh from its Foundation to the Present Time in 9 Books: Book 3 p.227: Civil Government His most important task in this period was representing the city of Edinburgh during the creation of the Solemn League and Covenant in 1643: the document which gives name to the Covenanters. Although beyond his term of office he also appears on the Treaty of 1650 (with Charles II) presumably due to ongoing negotiation in its terms.The Oxford Handbook of the English Revolution, M J Braddick In 1651 he took over from James Steuart of Coltness as Collector General of Excise (together with John Wauchope) a highly unpopular role during these periods of high taxation. In 1676 John Inglis of Cramond purchased Kings Cramond from the \\"creditors of John Smith of Grothill\\" implying Smith was deceased and his estate was broken. Grothill (Grotil) House is first shown in a map in John Adair's 1682 map of central Scotland. It stood south-east of Drylaw House. The original Kings Cramond House stood on what is now Barton Avenue West. It was demolished around 1800 and replaced by a huge mansion by Robert Adam known as Barton House and owned by the Ramsays of Barnton, a banking family. The second mansion was demolished in 1920 and redeveloped as large villas.https://canmore.org.uk/site/50395/edinburgh-barnton-avenue-west- barnton-house Groathill House was demolished in 1925 to create Telford Road, the main link between Ferry Road and Queensferry Road. Family Although little is known of John Smith, \\"John Smith, Provost of Edinburgh\\" appears in multiple genealogies (mainly linked to his sister). His sister Egidia Smith (aka Geida or Geils), married Sir William Gray of Pittendrum, an Edinburgh merchant and son of Andrew Gray, 7th Lord Gray.http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/gray1445.htm Their six sons and twelve daughters including Andrew Gray. Their daughter Agnes married John Dundas of Dundas Castle and Newliston. Following the death of John Dundas she married Archibald Primrose, Lord Rosebery. Her daughter Elizabeth married John, Earl of Stair.Burke's Genealogy of Great Britain His sister Agnes Smith was second wife to John Byres of Coates, Treasurer of the Council while he was Provost.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/146593648/john-byres There is no mention of any wife or children of John Smith. Although lacking direct heirs, his estates would normally pass to a nephew (of which he had many). Given that his estate was broken and sold in 1676 this implies he died in debt, with no heritable assets.

It is set in Taiwan in the 1980s, with a majority of the game happening in an apartment complex in Taipei. The game also incorporates elements based on Taiwanese culture and folk religion. The game was released on February 19, 2019, but was removed from Steam shortly afterwards on February 26, after the game was review bombed by Chinese players due to a controversial reference to Xi Jinping.Official Temporary Removal Notice Devotion's background music was composed by Taiwanese composer Vincent Yang. The soundtrack was released with the game on Steam as a DLC.  Synopsis  Players, for the most part, control the troubled screenwriter Du Feng Yu (杜豐于) through a Taipei apartment complex with rooms that represent various years in the lives of the Du family during the 1980s. The family consists of Feng Yu, his wife Gong Li Fang (鞏莉芳), a retired songstress, and their daughter Du Mei Shin (杜美心), an aspiring child singer. Feng Yu's screenwriting career has stagnated while Mei Shin begins to show signs of a mysterious illness. As the family's financial situation deteriorates, Li Fang has frequent arguments with Feng Yu about whether she should come out of her retirement to help support the family. In the midst of the domestic disputes, Mei Shin enters a popular singing contest, seeking to please her parents by becoming a popular singer. However, Mei Shin's performance of her mother's signature song \\"Lady of the Pier\\" (碼頭姑娘) comes one point shy of advancing to the next round. Mei Shin's condition worsens after the setback, to the point she's unable to sing. Despite a doctor's suggestion that the family seek psychiatric care for Mei Shin's illness, Feng Yu instead begins to follow the teachings of cult leader Mentor Heuh (何老師) regarding the folk deity Cigu Guanyin (慈孤觀音), who could supposedly help cure his daughter and her singing career. When Feng Yu becomes increasingly obsessed with Mentor Heuh, Li Fang attempts to convince her husband to snap out of his obsession, but Feng Yu accuses her of being possessed by evil spirits. Realising her husband will not listen to her, Li Fang eventually leaves the family. Seeing the downward spiral of her family, Mei Shin asks her father to help her fold origami tulips, believing that she will be healed when enough has been folded to fill her room. Instead, as instructed by Mentor Heuh after a séance, Feng Yu performs a dark ritual by submerging his daughter in a bathtub filled with rice wine and banded krait and locking her up in the bathroom for seven days, assumedly causing her death. A post-credits scene shows Feng Yu sitting alone in his apartment watching the noise on TV. Development Devotion draws inspiration from atmospheric first-person games like P.T., What Remains of Edith Finch and Layers of Fear. The developers of the game expressed a desire to make an atmospheric game that feels familiar with Taiwanese players, explaining that the culture of Taiwan rarely gets showcased in video games. In its planning stages, Devotion was not visualized to be a first-person 3D game, but subsequent discussions steered the game into that direction to realize producer Doy Chiang's vision. The development team, which consists of 12 people, had to learn the Unity 3D game engine as a result. Music The original soundtrack of Devotion seeks to capture the ambiance of the 1980s in Taiwan by incorporating traditional Asian instruments and folk music elements. The album includes a title track written and performed by the Taiwanese indie band and 2017 Golden Melody Awards winner, No Party for Cao Dong, and the original song \\"Lady of the Pier\\" (碼頭姑娘), which appeared during the game and in the ending. Reception A number of critics made favourable comparisons of Devotion with P.T. and Gone Home, all first-person exploration games that subvert the safe and secure feeling of home. David Jagneaux of IGN gave Devotion 8.2 points out of 10, praising it as \\"a fantastic psychological horror game that’s short, concise, and well-paced from start to finish.\\" Despite the \\"wonderful environmental storytelling\\", Jagneaux felt that the actual gameplay is \\"relatively unimpressive and boring\\". Richard Wakeling from GameSpot singled out Red Candle Game's attention to detail that \\"establishes and effectively reinforces Devotion's disconcerting sense of familiarity\\", but pointed out that the chase sequence late in the game is \\"regrettable\\" in what is otherwise a game that resists frustrating trial-and-error stealth sections and monotonous combat in many contemporary horror games. Michelle Brohier from Stuff Malaysia praised the game's references to East Asian culture in lore and horror, but commented that its epilogue didn't deliver much impact after its captivating build up. In February 2020, Devotion as well as Red Candle's other game Detention were selected for preservation at the Harvard-Yenching Library, the largest collection of East Asian works maintained at an American university. Controversy On February 21, 2019, two days after the game's release, players discovered a fulu talisman decorating a wall in the game contained the words \\"Xi Jinping Winnie the Pooh\\" () in Chinese seal script, referencing a recent Chinese internet meme that compared the Chinese paramount leader and general secretary to the Disney character. Also on the talisman were the transcribed words \\"ní ma bā qì\\" (), which sounds similar to \\"nǐ mā bā qī\\" () in Mandarin. \\"\\" means \\"your mother (is a)\\"; and \\"\\" () sounds similar to \\"\\" (, means \\"moron\\") in Taiwanese Hokkien. Taken together, this was interpreted by Chinese gamers as an insult to the Chinese leader. As a result, Devotion was heavily review bombed by Chinese gamers on Steam, and the game went from having \\"Overwhelmingly Positive\\" reviews overall to being \\"Mostly Negative\\". Red Candle Games responded by patching out the offending art material, replacing it with a talisman that reads \\"Happy New Year\\" (), explaining that the original talisman was a placeholder that was supposed to be replaced, and apologizing for the oversight. Nevertheless, other aspects of the game were analysed as insults to China, leading to the game being removed from Steam in China on February 23. Publishers Indievent and Winking Skywalker cut ties with Red Candle Games, with Red Candle Games being liable for their losses as a result of the controversy. On February 25, Red Candle removed the game from Steam globally to fix technical issues, as well as to confirm that no other hidden messages remain. Taiwan's Vice Premier Chen Chi-mai spoke out in defense of the game regarding the \\"easter egg\\", saying: \\"Only in countries with democracy and freedom can creation be free from restrictions.\\" Red Candle's Sina Weibo account remains blocked, and posts containing the hashtag #Devotion, which had hundreds of millions of views before the controversy, were hidden by Chinese censors. The episode has raised concerns about the future of the Steam platform in China, which did not gain official approval to operate there but remains accessible with up to 30 million users from China. In July 2019, the Chinese government revoked the license of Indievent. The official statement from the government stated that the revoking was due to violating relevant laws. Red Candle Games released an apology later in the month stating that they have no plans to re-release Devotion in the near term in order \\"to prevent unnecessary misconception\\", but would reconsider re- releasing the game in the future if \\"the public would be willing to view this game rationally\\". In June 2020, Red Candle announced that it would begin running pre-orders for a physical edition of the game, available only in Taiwan from June 8 to 15.

He has been voiced by Henry Polic II and Jeffrey Combs in the DC animated universe, by Dino Andrade and John Noble in the Batman: Arkham video game series, and by Robert Englund in Injustice 2. He has also been portrayed in live-action by Cillian Murphy in The Dark Knight Trilogy, and both Charlie Tahan and David W. Thompson in the FOX television series Gotham. __TOC__ Television Live- action Charlie Tahan as The Scarecrow in Gotham. * The Scarecrow appears in Gotham, portrayed by Charlie Tahan (in the first season as well as the first half of the fourth season), and by David W. Thompson (in the second half of the fourth season as well as the fifth season). He is introduced in the first- season episodes \\"The Fearsome Dr. Crane\\" and \\"The Scarecrow\\". His father Gerald Crane (portrayed by Julian Sands) creates the 'fear toxin', a serum designed to eliminate fear, and then injects Jonathan with it. Detectives Jim Gordon and Harvey Bullock save Jonathan's life, but are too late to save his father and his sanity; the toxin has left him in a state of perpetual terror, plagued by hallucinations of his greatest fear: scarecrows. He is next seen in the season four episode \\"Pax Penguina,\\" in which he is institutionalized in Gotham Asylum, where the corrupt warden Reed uses his fears to keep him under control. A gang of criminals led by Grady Harris and Merton bribe Reed to give them Crane and forces him to re-create his father's fear toxin so they can use it to control Gotham City. Jonathan eventually embraces his fear and uses the toxin against Grady Harris after Merton and his fellow gang members were arrested. He then wreaks havoc on Gotham with the toxin as \\"The Scarecrow\\". In \\"The Fear Reaper,\\" Crane invades Gotham Asylum and uses the fear gas on Warden Reed and other inmates causing the guards to flee. When Gordon confronts Scarecrow, he gets infected with fear gas until he overcomes it. After Gordon turns on the sprinklers and the fear gas' effects on the inmates, Scarecrow got away. In \\"A Dark Knight: One of My Three Soups,\\" Scarecrow is shown as an inmate at Arkham Asylum after getting apprehended at some point. He is freed by the Mad Hatter where they, along with Jerome Valeska, collaborate in a plot that involves releasing all the inmates of Arkham Asylum. After the Hatter is defeated by Jim Gordon, Scarecrow gasses the driver of his transport as he and Jerome free him for their next plot. In \\"A Dark Knight: Mandatory Brunch Meeting,\\" the Scarecrow is one of the criminals assembled by Jerome to be part of his \\"Legion of Horribles\\". He and the Mad Hatter break out Jerome from his twin brother Jeremiah's custody, but are chased off by Gordon and Bullock. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that Jerome secretly tasked Scarecrow to concocts a laughing gas for him to spread across the city. In \\"That's Entertainment,\\" Scarecrow, along with Mr. Freeze, carries out a raid on Wayne Enterprises' chemical lab to brew more of the dangerous toxin. Later, Scarecrow, Mad Hatter and the Penguin go to a hangar to load the laughing gas onto a blimp and release it upon Gotham. There, he reveals to Penguin that the other Legion members anticipated his betrayal and that he knew Penguin would go to Jim Gordon, and then proceeding to knock him out. In the episode \\"One Bad Day,\\" Scarecrow assists Jeremiah Valeska in his plot to drive Bruce Wayne insane; using his fear toxin, Scarecrow makes Bruce hallucinate an insane Alfred attacking him, but Selina sneaks in and fights the Scarecrow, who is outmatched by her and then escapes as she frees Alfred and Bruce. In season 5, with Gotham now a \\"no man's land,\\" Scarecrow leads his own gang as they take over a laboratory for Scarecrow's experiments, with Scarecrow killing the scientist who owns the lab. In the episode \\"Year Zero,\\" Scarecrow then leads his gang on an attack against the GCPD's territory to steal their supplies, where he faces Gordon, who manages to drive him off. In the episode \\"Pena Dura,\\" Gordon mentions Scarecrow to Eduardo Dorrance about the various criminals and their territories. In the episode \\"The Trial of Jim Gordon\\", Scarecrow made a cameo during Gordon's hallucination of his trial as a member of his jury and then attends his funeral. * Although he doesn't appear, Dr. Jonathan Crane / The Scarecrow is referenced in the television series set in the Arrowverse. ** In the second part of the fifth annual Arrowverse crossover event \\"Elseworlds\\", the Scarecrow's fear gas can be seen in the evidence room at Arkham Asylum, inside a box containing his belongings. During the mass breakout at Arkham Asylum, Barry Allen and Oliver Queen confront the inmate Nora Fries after she hit Killer Frost with the frozen ray of her husband's gun. Oliver then tries to use his speed to throw a lightning bolt at Nora but misses and, instead, knocks the Scarecrow's box containing the fear gas, exposing them to the gas and causing Barry and Oliver to start hallucinating, making them see each other as Eobard Thawne and Malcolm Merlyn, respectively. This leads to a fight between them until Batwoman brings both down, neutralizing the effects of the gas in the process. ** Dr. Jonathan Crane is mentioned in the Supergirl episode \\"Crime and Punishment\\". ** In Batwoman, the Scarecrow is mentioned in the episode \\"How Queer Everything Is Today!\\", as Luke Fox cites a \\"Scarecrow incident\\", in which the villain attempted to hack the internal computers on the Gotham City's trains, and caused the trains to be modified to run on an \\"independent analog system\\". In the episode \\"Grinning From Ear to Ear\\", August Cartwright uses the fear gas on his son Mouse, and in \\"Off with Her Head\\", Mouse uses it on Alice while Crane is mentioned in the same episode. * Dr. Jonathan Crane / The Scarecrow will appear in the third season of Titans, as an former Arkham Asylum inmate turned profiler and consultant for the GCPD. Animation DC animated universe Scarecrow's designs throughout the DC animated universe. * Dr. Johnathan Crane / The Scarecrow is featured in multiple shows set within the DC animated universe. ** The character first appears in Batman: The Animated Series, voiced by Henry Polic II in an English accent. In the episode \\"Nothing to Fear\\", Dr. Jonathan Crane becomes the Scarecrow to exact his revenge on the Gotham University board members who fired him for experimenting on his own students. Despite drugging Batman with his fear toxin and kidnapping the university's dean, Scarecrow is ultimately exposed to his own gas and begins hallucinating his own phobia - a fear of bats - after which he is apprehended and sent to Arkham Asylum. In \\"Fear of Victory\\", Scarecrow combines his fear toxin with adrenaline to use on Gotham's athletes, rendering them unable to play as he bets against their teams and makes a profit. In \\"Dreams of Darkness\\", Scarecrow plots to taint Gotham's water supply with fear toxin. In \\"Trial\\", Scarecrow appears as one of the \\"jury\\" members during the rogues gallery's \\"trial\\" against Batman at Arkham. In \\"Lock Up\\", Scarecrow, Harley Quinn and the Ventriloquist issue a complaint against Arkham's brutal new security guard, Lyle Bolton. ** Scarecrow returns in The New Batman Adventures, voiced by Jeffrey Combs with a low, rasping whisper (Jeff Bennett provided the character's laugh during his appearance in the episode \\"Over the Edge\\"). He gets a \\"darker\\", radically revamped design because the producers felt his original look was not frightening. Bruce Timm described Scarecrow's new outfit as resembling a \\"western preacher\\", complete with a \\"noose around his neck\\" as well as a \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre Leatherface kind of look. It really had nothing to do with being a scarecrow per se, but he was definitely scary.\\" Paul Dini commented that \\"he looked like a hanged man who had been cut down and gone off to terrorise people. We weren't even sure if there was an actual guy in the suit.\\"Batman - Arkham Files In the episode \\"Never Fear\\", Scarecrow creates a new strain of toxin that eliminates fear and makes its victims dangerously reckless; Batman is exposed to the gas which renders him unafraid to kill. When Batman loses control and attempts to kill Scarecrow, Robin administers the antidote and the two send Scarecrow back to Arkham Asylum. In \\"Over the Edge\\", Scarecrow seizes control of Gotham City Hall and sprays Batgirl with his fear toxin, causing her to have a nightmare in which she is killed by him and a vendetta erupts between Batman and her father, Commissioner Gordon. ** Scarecrow was initially slated to be featured in the final season of Justice League Unlimited as a member of the Legion of Doom, referencing his appearance as an original member of the group in Challenge of the Super Friends, but these plans were ultimately canceled due to the Bat- embargo. Other shows * Scarecrow appeared in The Batman/Superman Hour, voiced by Ted Knight. Although he does not use fear gas in this series, he uses knock-out gas, which he keeps in eggs. He was seen in the episode \\"The Great Scarecrow Scare\\". * Scarecrow appeared in Challenge of the Super Friends, voiced by Don Messick. He is as a member of Lex Luthor's Legion of Doom and is shown to have control over a flock of crows, but no other powers. * Scarecrow appeared in the Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians, voiced by Andre Stojka. In the episode \\"The Fear\\", Scarecrow captures Robin and Wonder Woman after he expose them and Batman to his fear transmitters, as he forces the Caped Crusader to relive the memories of his parents' murder in Crime Alley, which would be the first animated rendition of Batman's origin. In the same episode, Professor Crane was working as a consultant for Commissioner Gordon and the Gotham City Police Department to help them find Scarecrow and put an end to his exploits of fear, without anyone knowing yet that both are the same person. Using his detective skills, Batman was able to figure out that Scarecrow and Professor Crane were one and the same. Later, Batman confronts the villain in a cornfield, where he was soon able to apprehend Crane, rescue Wonder Woman and Robin, and turn him over to the Gotham City Police. * Scarecrow appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. In the episode \\"Trials of the Demon\\", he collaborates with Scream Queen to put jack-o'-lanterns filled with fear gas on a Halloween night in a local neighborhood.

Though he is nearly thwarted by Harley Quinn and her crew, he succeeds in poisoning the Gotham Reservoir and transforming Gotham's trees into man-eating monsters. He makes a cameo in the following episode, \\"Devil's Snare\\", while being pursued by Batman in response to the event. In the season finale \\"The Final Joke\\", Scarecrow became the Joker's new sidekick after he captured Batman and Harley's crew and took over Gotham. After a week of torturing them, Joker becomes bored, so Scarecrow tries to help by unmasking Batman in front of him. However, this enrages Joker, as it ruined the \\"mystery\\", and he kills Scarecrow with his acid-squirting flower. Film Live-action The Dark Knight Trilogy Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow in Batman Begins (2005). * Cillian Murphy portrays Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy, and is the only villain to appear in all three films. This version of the character wears a burlap sack with a built-in rebreather that doubles as a gas mask for his fear experiments. Murphy explained that the relatively simple mask, as opposed to the full scarecrow costume usually seen in the comics, was utilized because he \\"wanted the Scarecrow to avoid the Worzel Gummidge look, because he's not a very physically imposing man—he's more interested in the manipulation of the mind and what that can do\\". ** In Batman Begins, Dr. Jonathan Crane is a corrupt psychopharmacologist working as Chief Administrator at Arkham Asylum who has secretly created a fear-inducing gas. He plots with the terrorist Ra's al Ghul to expose the entire population of Gotham City to this toxin. Crane smuggles the hallucinogenic chemical ingredient for his \\"fear gas\\" into Gotham through the connections of mob boss Carmine Falcone, and in exchange Crane testifies in court that all of Falcone's arrested men are legally insane and should be moved to Arkham for \\"rehabilitation\\". Assistant District Attorney Rachel Dawes accuses Crane of being corrupt, prompting Crane and Falcone to plot to have Dawes murdered. When an arrested Falcone later attempts to blackmail Crane, the latter dons his gas mask and douses Falcone with his fear toxin, driving the crime lord insane and causing him to repeatedly utter 'Scarecrow'. During Crane's first encounter with Batman, he sprays the vigilante with his fear gas and sets him on fire, though Batman narrowly escapes with both his life and mind intact. With Lucius Fox's help, Batman develops an antidote to Crane's drug. At Arkham Asylum, Crane exposes Rachel to his fear toxin when his illegal operations are discovered. However, Batman arrives and gives Crane a dose of his own toxin before leaving him for James Gordon to arrest, and he is driven insane by the exposure of his own chemical. Despite being institutionalized at Arkham, Crane escapes during the mass release of the asylum's inmates as part of Ra's plot to plunge Gotham into fear. As Ra's unleashes the gas on the city's slums, Crane, now calling himself 'Scarecrow', pursues Rachel and a boy on a police horse. After Rachel shocks Scarecrow with a taser, Crane aimlessly rides off into the night and remains at large. ** In The Dark Knight, Scarecrow returns near the beginning of the film, his sanity is apparently restored but has become a drug dealing criminal. He and his men meet with mob boss Chechen's crew at a car park, who complains about the effects that Scarecrow's sold toxin has on his customers. A group of Batmen impostors then arrive and attack the two criminals, only to be interrupted by the real vigilante. Scarecrow attempts to escape in his van after spraying a Batman impostor with his gas, but the real Batman manages to apprehend Crane and ties him up along with the impostors for the police to arrest. ** In The Dark Knight Rises, Jonathan Crane has a minor role. He is released along with the other prisoners of Blackgate Penitentiary when Bane takes control of Gotham. Once liberated, Crane presides over a show trial which he refers to as a sentencing hearing wherein Gotham's wealthiest citizens are given a choice between death and exile. Those who choose \\"exile\\" are made to cross the thin ice over the frozen river connecting Gotham to the other shore, with an almost certain chance of falling through the thin ice and drowning. In addition, Bane also grants Crane full control of the courts to the extent that even Bane himself would not affect his ruling decision. When Commissioner Gordon, several cops, and Miranda Tate are captured and brought into trial, Gordon tells Crane that he and his men won't go on the ice willingly and therefore chooses death. Crane sentences them to \\"death by exile\\", while Bane takes Miranda. However, Batman manages to save Gordon. After Batman stops Bane's plan to detonate a nuclear bomb in Gotham, Crane is presumably arrested by Gotham police along with many other convicted criminals.

Batman soon discovers that Scarecrow's new fear gas is being manufactured at the ACE Chemicals plant. Defeating the militia there, Batman confronts Scarecrow in the central mixing chamber, where the villain informs Batman that Barbara Gordon has been captured, before locking the hero inside the imploding facility.

He wrote the novels The Island of Krk (1994), Wozzeck & Woczkurgia (1996, 1997), Double Leon (2000) and AM™ (2004). He also wrote the poetry collection Stanislav and his 11 Liberators (1996), several collections of essays, and a number of short stories, articles on cultural studies and literary criticisms. Izdryk is also one of the founders of the Stanislav phenomenon, a group of postmodernist post-Soviet writers. He lives and works in his birthplace, Kalush. Izdryk is also a visual artist and music composer, and has written stagings for theatrical plays. Biography Early life and education Izdryk's father, Roman Andriyovych, spent his youth in the village of Gremyachinsk of the Perm region. He and five of his brothers and sisters were deported there with their mother while their father, Father Andriy Izdryk, was imprisoned in Stalinist concentration camps. Izdryk excelled in school, especially in mathematics, and played in a school music ensemble. Around the same time, his interests in literature began, reading Vsevolod Nestayko, Stepan Rudansky, Aleksandr Kuprin, and the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. At age 14, he wrote his first poem in Russian. He was greatly inspired by the four-volume texts of Hemingway, which became \\"the first textbook of a true Ukrainian literary language\\", and made it clear that \\"all things, all emotions, all experiences, all, in general, can be translated into their native language\\". Izdryk graduated from music school in cello and piano, and also played guitar and mandolin. After graduation, he entered the Lviv Polytechnic Institute's Faculty of Mechanics and Technology, where he studied art history, played in rock bands, and participated in productions of an amateur student theatre. Early career After graduating in 1984, Izdryk began working as an engineer at a machinery plant in Ivano-Frankivsk. In 1986, he transferred to the Kalush Research Institute of the Khalkaria and worked there until 1990. At the end of the 1980s, he participated in numerous official and unofficial artistic events and exhibitions and collaborated with the Komsomol oblast newspaper. In 1989, he began work on the magazine Chetver. The first two editions were self-published. In 1990, at one of the artistic events (during the preparation of the biennial \\"Impreza\\" that took place in Ivano-Frankivsk), Izdryk met with Yurii Andrukhovych, which became a decisive factor in his life. He asked Andrukhovych to edit Chetver with him, and for several years the two artists worked on the magazine together. Artistic establishment Yurko Izdryk on the Book Arsenal. Kyiv, 2016 Izdryk's first works appeared in the self-published editions of the magazines Chetver and Breaking (Poland). These included the serial The Last War and the poetic cycle Ten poems about the Motherland. The style of these early works led some critics to believe that Izdryk was a pseudonym of Andrukhovych, as certain stories, characters and phrases are similar – which later came to distinguish the creators of the Stanislav phenomenon. Over time, Izdryk declared himself an extraordinary artist, and plagiarism was dismissed. Visual art briefly interrupted Izdryk's writing. He began to actively engage in painting, and participated in exhibitions between 1990 and 1994. He also engaged the artistic design of books and magazines and conducted personal exhibitions. His drawings were popular and he was able to make a living from them. For a time he was fascinated by theatre and wrote staging for The Cricket on the Hearth and The Catcher in the Rye, which were used by the Chernihiv regional youth theatre in the early 1990s. In 1994, Izdryk returned to literary endeavours. His short story appeared in the mainstream magazine in 1994, and was received positively by critics. A Polish translation later appeared in the magazine Literatura na Świecie, and the story was featured in the 1998 collection The Island of Krk and Other Stories. Izdryk published his first novel, Wozzeck, in 1998. He followed this with Double Leon in 2000 and AM™ in 2004. He continued to edit Chetver until its publication was suspended in 2008. In 2009, Izdryk published the collections of essays and sketches Flash 2GB and TAKE, for which he received a 2010 Book of the Year award from BBC-Ukraine. In 2011, Izdryk published Underwor(l)d, a collection of poetry and essays. In 2013, he published Izdryk. Yu a collection of poetry originally published in his blog, \\"Dead Diary\\". Izdryk's focus returned to music. He had written music cycles on poems by Andriyovych and Anna Kirpan. He collaborated on joint musical projects with poet and musician Grigory Semenchuk. In 2014, while attending the International Scholarship for Poets, Meridian Czernowitz in Chernivtsi, Izdryk began collaborating on the Summa media project, which involves the constant communication of the authors with the audience. The end product of Summa was to be a book of the same name. In June 2018, he recorded a videoconference in support of the Ukrainian director in prison, Oleg Sentsov. Stanislav phenomenon Izdryk is considered one of the primary representatives of the Stanislav phenomenon. According to Ukrainian literary scholars, the writers of the Stanislav phenomenon are the most representative branch of Ukrainian postmodern literature. In this form of postmodernism, authors try to answer the question of whether members of this group are really postmodernists, or if they are some type of modern avant-garde.

The airstrikes were part of PAF military operation codename Operation Swift Retort and were conducted in retaliation of Indian Air Force (IAF) airstrike in Balakot just a day before on 26 February. It was the first time since 1971 that both countries airforces conducted airtstrikes on the opposing territories across the Line of Control (LoC). India conducted an airstrike in Balakot on 26 February while Pakistan responded by conducting airstrike in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. Following Pakistan's airstrikes, Indian Air Force (IAF) jets started pursuing Pakistan Air Force (PAF) jets. In the resulting dog fight, Pakistani officials claimed to have shot down two Indian jets and captured one Indian pilot. Indian officials acknowledged that one IAF jet was shot down. Indian officials also claim to have shot down a PAF's F-16 jet. Pakistan rejected Indian claims and said that PAF did not suffer any losses in the dog fight. One IAF Mil Mi-17 helicopter was also lost due to a friendly fire.  Background  On 14 February 2019, a convoy of vehicles carrying security personnel on the Jammu Srinagar National Highway was attacked by a vehicle-borne suicide bomber at Lethpora in the Pulwama district, Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. The attack resulted in the deaths of 46 Central Reserve Police Force personnel and the attacker. The perpetrator of the attack was from Indian-administered Kashmir. India Blames Pakistan for Attack in Kashmir, Promising a Response , The New York Times. 15 February 2019. India said it targeted alleged militant camps of Jaish-e- Mohammed and killed large number of militants. Pakistan condemned the violation of LoC and vowed to retaliate. In a press conference spokesperson of Pakistan Army Major General Asif Ghafoor said that Pakistan will respond to the airstrike and will surprise India. He rejected India's claims of hitting militant camps and causing any damage or casualties. Ghafoor said that if it caused casualties there would have been blood and funeral prayers but not even a single brick or debris is present there. He further said that anyone can visit the site to verify the claims. The site is open for all ambassadors, defence attaches, United Nations Military Observers in Pakistan and even the civilians or the army representatives from India.  Airstrikes  On 27 February 2019, Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Pakistan Air Force had conducted six airstrikes at non-military targets in Indian- administered Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistani officials claim that their aircraft were able to lock onto the target with great accuracy but they were ordered to drop their bombs in an open field in order to avoid any human loss or collateral damage. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said that the strikes were meant to send a message to India. The PAF jets entered into Indian air space over Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch and Nowshera sector to hit targets. The locations struck by PAF jets were identified to be Nadian, Laam Jhangar, Kerri in Rajouri District and Hamirpur area of Bhimber Ghali in Poonch by Indian officials. Indian officials, however, denied that the target of Pakistani airstrike were non-military targets. Indian officials claimed that the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) jets had deliberately targeted military positions like the Indian army's 25th division headquarters, ammunition and supply depot. PAF jets were intercepted by an unspecified number of IAF jets. The IAF fleet was composed of MiG-21, Sukhoi Su-30MKI and Dassault Mirage 2000. The announcement was followed by a tweet of Director general of the ISPR Maj Gen. Asif Ghafoor revealed that the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) had shot down two Indian aircraft after they encroached on Pakistan's airspace. Wreckage of one of the aircraft fell in Azad Kashmir while the other one fell in Indian- administered Jammu and Kashmir. One of the aircraft which crashed in Azad Kashmir was identified to be a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 flown by Wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman. He was captured by Pakistan military unit who were present in the premises. The villagers at the ground also claim that they saw two jets in flame. They claim that one jet fell in Azad Kashmir while the other one sped toward Indian-administered Kashmir. The other IAF military aircraft were said to be Sukhoi Su-30MKI according to Pakistani media.https://www.defenseworld.net/news/24409/Pak_Pays____Tributes____to_Two_Pilots_who_shot_down_Indian_Aircraft_on_February_27 However, Indian officials rejected Pakistani claims of shooting down of IAF Su-30 MKI jets and said that it was an attempt by Pakistan to cover-up the loss of its F-16. The Indian defence research wing (IDRW) website reports that there were no reports of a large aircraft crash in Indian administered Kashmir and its impossible to hide an aircraft crash as of now.https://idrw.org/ispr- says-impossible-to-hide-f-16-debris-but-then-accuses-india-of-hiding- su-30-debris/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-trashes- pakistans-claim-of-downing-iafs-sukhoi-jet-during-last-weeks- dogfight/articleshow/68275863.cms?from=mdr Pakistan at the beginning said that it caught more than one Indian pilot and said one was admitted to CMH hospital, but changed their statement after some time and to say only one pilot is in their custody.https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/iaf-airstrike- india-pakistan-asif-ghafoor-one-pilot-in-custody-1466438-2019-02-27 Indian officials initially denied that an Indian Air Force (IAF) jet was shot down. They also claimed that all IAF pilots were accounted for and denied that any IAF pilot was captured by Pakistani security forces. Later on, Indian officials acknowledged that one IAF Mig-21 was shot down and its pilot was in the custody of Pakistan security forces. The Indian Air Force also claimed to have shot down one F-16 by Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman from his Mig-21 aircraft.https://scroll.in/latest/919092/iaf-refutes-us-magazine-claim-says- it-shot-down-f-16-fighter-jet-in-aerial-skirmish-with- pakistanhttps://m.economictimes.com/news/defence/iaf-releases-proofs-of- shooting-down-pakistans-f-16-fighter-jet/videoshow/68781278.cms However, Pakistani officials rejected India's claim. Pakistani officials claimed that \\"in today's day and age, it is impossible to hide downing of an aircraft\\". Friendly fire On the same day, one Indian Mil Mi-17 helicopter crashed killing 6 Indian Air Force personnel and 1 civilian in the Budgam district. Initially India claimed that the helicopter crashed because of technical failure. However, after six months of investigation, Indian officials revealed that the helicopter was shot down by India's Israeli-manufactured SPYDER air defense system. The SPYDER air defense system fired a missile in response to Pakistan Air Force jets who had crossed Line of Control (LOC). However, the missile had instead hit the Mi-17 helicopter killing all the people on board and a civilian on the ground. After the investigation, five IAF personnel were held guilty in the friendly fire case. The families of IAF personnel (who were on board the helicopter) allege that the government officials tried to hide the facts from them. They allege that the matter of friendly fire was hushed up to avoid embarrassment for current government during the election season. They also allege that some members of Indian Air Force (IAF), who were colleagues of the IAF personnel on board the helicopter, had also hinted that a friendly fire had brought down the helicopter but they told the family members of the victims to remain silent.  Aftermath   India  India's Ministry of External Affairs in a press conference claimed that PAF violated LoC and entered Indian territory through Nowshera and Poonch sector shooting down one IAF jet and its pilot going missing. India also claimed to have shot down one PAF F-16 Fighting Falcon. A claim which was denied by Pakistan saying no F-16 was used in the operation. Indian officials also rejected Pakistani claims of shooting down an Su-30MKI. On 28 February, Indian officials again alleged that two Pakistan Air Force (PAF) jets have violated Indian airspace. According to the Indian officials, the PAF jets were intercepted over Poonch and Krishna Gati sector. However, no aerial combat took place and PAF jets returned to their airspace. Christine Fair, an expert on South Asian political and military affairs, stated that no F-16 was shot down by Indian air force. She made these statements while attending a military literature festival in Chandigarh, India.  Pakistan  DG ISPR Asif Ghafoor later conducted a press conference stating: \\"Since today morning activity has been ongoing at LoC. This morning PAF engaged six targets across LoC from within Pakistani airspace\\". He also said that the strikes were carried out to just demonstrate Pakistan's aggressive capabilities. Pakistan asserted that no F-16 was used in the operation. Initially Pakistani officials claimed that two IAF personnel were caught but later corrected their statement and stated that only one IAF personnel was in their custody. Pakistani officials stated that it was the fog of war which led them to believe that there were two IAF personnel in their custody. Prime Minister Imran Khan addressed the nation saying that the sole purpose of our action was to convey that \\"if you can come into our country, we can do the same\\". Khan also offered India for peace talks.  United States  According to Foreign Policy journalist Lara Seligman, U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the matter asserted that the US has recently completed a physical count of Pakistan's F-16s and has found none missing. One US official also disagreed with India's claim that usage restrictions disallow Pakistan from employing F-16s in military encounters with India. Indian newspaper, Hindustan Times, reported that United States Department of Defense spokesman claimed that he was \\"not aware\\" of any such investigation that was conducted and stated \\"As a matter of policy, the Department does not publicly comment on details of government-to-government agreements on end-use monitoring of US- origin defence articles.\\" However, The Washington Post reported that like the Pentagon, the State Department has yet to issue any public statement on F-16 count. In December 2019, USNews reported that the United States had sent a letter to Pakistan Air Force in August expressing its concern about the alleged misuse of F-16s during the skirmish in February. The letter mentioned the State Department's confirmation that Pakistan had violated its agreement with the US by deploying F-16s and its complement of missiles to unauthorized forward air bases. The New York Times in an article titled \\"After India Loses Dogfight to Pakistan, Questions Arise About Its ‘Vintage’ Military\\", called the aerial clash \\"a rare test for the Indian military\\".  Exhibit  A statue of the Indian pilot Abhinandan was installed in Pakistan Air Force museum in an exhibit named Operation Swift Retort, which also shows the missing parts and wreckage of MIG 21 as well as a tea mug.  Pakistani Film  An official Pakistani film on the topic was released on 14 August 2019 directed, produced and written by DJ Kamal Mustafa. The story of the film is based on the attack, and shows the Pakistan Air Force response to the Indian attack and the capture of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman. The 23-minute long animated film is available for streaming on YouTube and other social digital platforms. It is the only single animated film released in Pakistan in 2019. Operation Swift Retort was a non-profit movie. Operation Swift Retort Film was made entirely in 2 months, by a team of one and in the film DG ISPR Major General Asif Ghafoor also makes a number of claims about Indian propaganda.

In the Early Buddhist Texts such as the Nikāyas and Āgamas, filial piety is prescribed and practiced in three ways: to repay the gratitude toward one's parents; as a good karma or merit; and as a way to contribute to and sustain the social order. In Buddhist scriptures, narratives are given of the Buddha and his disciples practicing filial piety toward their parents, based on the qualities of gratitude and reciprocity. Initially, scholars of Buddhism like Kenneth Ch'en saw Buddhist teachings on filial piety as a distinct feature of Chinese Buddhism. Later scholarship, led by people such as John Strong and Gregory Schopen, has come to believe that filial piety was part of Buddhist doctrine since early times. Strong and Schopen have provided epigraphical and textual evidence to show that early Buddhist laypeople, monks and nuns often displayed strong devotion to their parents, concluding that filial piety was already an important part of the devotional life of early Buddhists. When Buddhism was introduced in China, it had no organized celibacy. Confucianism emphasized filial piety to parents and loyalty to the emperor, and Buddhist monastic life was seen to go against its tenets. In the 3rd–5th century, as criticism of Buddhism increased, Buddhist monastics and lay authors responded by writing about and translating Buddhist doctrines and narratives that supported filiality, comparing them to Confucianism and thereby defending Buddhism and its value in society. The Mouzi Lihuolun referred to Confucian and Daoist classics, as well as historical precedents to respond to critics of Buddhism. The Mouzi stated that while on the surface the Buddhist monk seems to reject and abandon his parents, he is actually aiding his parents as well as himself on the path towards enlightenment. Sun Chuo (300–380) further argued that monks were working to ensure the salvation of all people and making their family proud by doing so, and Liu Xie stated that Buddhists practiced filial piety by sharing merit with their departed relatives. Buddhist monks were also criticized for not expressing their respect to the Chinese emperor by prostrating and other devotion, which in Confucianism was associated with the virtue of filial piety. Huiyuan (334–416) responded that although monks did not express such piety, they did pay homage in heart and mind; moreover, their teaching of morality and virtue to the public helped support imperial rule. From the 6th century onward, Chinese Buddhists began to realize that they had to stress Buddhism's own particular ideas about filial piety in order to for Buddhism to survive. Śyāma, Sujāti and other Buddhist stories of self- sacrifice spread a belief that a filial child should even be willing to sacrifice its own body. The Ullambana Sūtra introduced the idea of transfer of merit through the story of Mulian Saves His Mother and led to the establishment of the Ghost Festival. By this Buddhists attempted to show that filial piety also meant taking care of one's parents in the next life, not just this life. Furthermore, authors in Chinaand to some extent Japanwrote that in Buddhism, all living beings have once been one's parents, and that practicing compassion to all living beings as though they were one's parents is the more superior form of filial piety. Another aspect emphasized was the great suffering a mother goes through when giving birth and raising a child. Chinese Buddhists described how difficult it is to repay the goodness of one's mother, and how many sins mothers often committed in raising her children. The mother became the primary source of well-being and indebtedness for the son, which was in contrast with pre-Buddhist perspectives emphasizing the father. Nevertheless, although some critics of Buddhism did not have much impact during this time, this changed in the period leading up to the Neo- Confucianist revival, when Emperor Wu Zong (841–845) started the Great Anti- Buddhist Persecution, citing lack of filial piety as one of his reasons for attacking Buddhist institutions. Filial piety is still an important value in a number of Asian cultures. In China, Buddhism continued to uphold a role in state rituals and mourning rites for ancestors, up until late imperial times (13th–20th century). Also, sūtras and narratives about filial piety are still widely used. The Ghost Festival is still popular in many Asian countries, especially those countries which are influenced by both Buddhism and Confucianism. Furthermore, in Theravādin countries in South and Southeast Asia, generosity, devotion and transfer of merit to parents are still widely practiced among the population.  In Buddhist texts  In the Early Buddhist Texts such as the Nikāyas and Āgamas, filial piety is prescribed and practiced in three ways: to repay the gratitude toward one's parents; as a good karma or merit; and as a way to contribute to and sustain the social order.  Repaying the debt of gratitude  In the Early Buddhist Texts such as the Nikāyas and Āgamas, filial piety is prescribed and practiced. In the Nikāyas, two qualities are often named in pair: kataññuta and katavedita. Whereas the first word refers to acknowledgement of the indebtedness towards others, the second quality is interpreted as repaying such debt. Buddhist texts often encourage children from the age of discretion to take care of their parents, remember their gratitude to them, honor them and do everything they can to repay their gratitude to them. The care and attention the parents have given the child is seen to deserve full acknowledgment from the child. In a discourse called the Sigalaka Sutta, several ways are mentioned in which a child can repay its parents: \\"I will perform duties incumbent on them, I will keep up the lineage and tradition () of my family, I will make myself worthy of my heritage.\\" The deity Sakka is reported to have had seven rules of conduct according to which he lived his life, the first of which being \\"As long as I live, may I maintain my parents\\". This rule is also cited in the commentary to the Dhammapada, indicating the impact of filiality during that period. However, in the early discourse called Kataññu Sutta, the Buddha describes through several metaphors the difficulty in repaying the gratitude of one's parents through material means only. The discourses say that even if children were to carry their parents on their backs their entire lives, or let them be kings and queens of the country, they would still not have repaid the large debt to their parents. Eventually, he concludes that it is only possible to repay one's gratitude by teaching them Buddhism through spiritual qualities, such as faith in Buddhism, morality, generosity and wisdom. Though this discourse was translated and cited in many Buddhist traditions and schools, it came to be more emphasized with the arising of Mahāyāna Buddhism in India in the 1st century CE. In a third early discourse called Sabrahmā Sutta, parents are described as worthy of respect and gifts, because they have created their children, and were the ones who educated their children in their formative years. Furthermore, parents have provided the basic requirements for the child to survive. Children who attempt to pay back their debt to their parents by providing for them, are considered () expected to go to a heavenly rebirth in their afterlife, whereas people who are negligent in this, are called \\"outcasts\\" (). Buddhist studies scholar Guang Xing believes a comparison is drawn here between the devotion to Brahma, and the devotion toward one's parents, of which the latter is considered better, because they are considered the real creators. Parents are also compared to \\"Worthy Ones\\" and Buddhas, which is similar to the filial devotion expressed in the Hindu Taittirı̄ya Upaniśad. In a fourth discourse Mahāyañña ('great sacrifice') in the Aṅguttara Nikāya, the Buddha compares reverence toward one's parents, family and religious leaders to fire worship, and concludes that those people are much more useful and meaningful to tend to than the fire. The parents are mentioned here as first and foremost. Buddhist studies scholar Reiko Ohnuma does point out, however, that Buddhist texts describe the ideal monk as a person who detaches himself from his parents, which is seen as a hindrance to his spiritual progress. He is to develop even-mindedness, feeling the same for his loved ones and foes. On a similar note, the texts say a monk should see all women as his mother, not only his biological mother. This is considered a helpful method to practice the celibate life.  Other early discourses  Some early Buddhist texts describe the children's devotion toward their parents as a good deed that will reap religious merit, lead to praise by the wise, and finally, a rebirth in heaven. It is described as a fundamental good deed, and is in some Āgama texts compared to making offerings to a Buddha-to- be (). By contrast, killing one's parents is considered one of the most gravest deeds to do, leading to an immediate destiny to hell. According to Buddhist texts, people who had done so were not allowed to become members of the monastic community, and if they already were but were found out later to have killed a parent, they were expelled. This sentiment is echoed in the later Milindapañhā, which states that a person who committed matricide or patricide cannot attain to insight in Buddhist teachings. Apart from merit, in many Āgama texts, filial piety is said to lead to an orderly and harmonious society. In Pāli texts, the belief that children are indebted to their parents is a form of right view, part of the Buddhist eight-fold path.  In canonical and post-canonical narratives  Wall painting of Śyāma carrying his parents, Saphan Sam Temple, Phitsanulok, Thailand A well-known story that expresses filial piety is the Buddha's journey to the second Buddhist heaven to teach his mother, who died when giving birth to him. It is found in both the Pāli commentaries Aṭṭhasālinī and the commentary to the Dhammapada, as well as the Ekottara and Saṃyukta Āgamas. On a similar note, the Pāli tradition relates how the Buddha teaches his father Suddhodana on several occasions, eventually helping his father to attain enlightenment. Further, the Mahāyāna tradition has it that the Buddha organizes a funeral ceremony for his father out of piety. The Buddha is not only depicted as showing filial piety to his natural parents, but also his foster mother Mahāpajāpatī. Ohnuma has argued that a major reason for the Buddha to allow his foster mother to become a full-fledged Buddhist nun, and thereby starting the order of nuns, was gratitude toward her. In stories of the previous lives of the Buddha, there are several examples that illustrate filial piety. In one life found in several Buddhist collections, the Buddha-to-be is Śyāma, a filial son who takes care of his blind parents in their old age. This story was very popular in Buddhist India, as derived from epigraphical evidence from the first centuries CE, and can be found in both the Pāli and Chinese Buddhist scriptures. In the Pāli version of the story, it is prefaced by the life of a man who is ordained as a monk. After having been a monk for 17 years, he discovers his parents are abused by their servants and are starving. He then feels he needs to choose between the monastic vocation and taking care of his destitute parents as a lay person, since he assumes he cannot do so as a monk. The Buddha is able to prevent him from disrobing, however, and teaches him he can take care of his parents while still in monk's robes. The monk then decides to share gifts of food and cloth with them regularly, for which he is criticized by his fellow monks. His fellow monks consider this inappropriate for a Buddhist monk and report this to the Buddha. The Buddha, however, speaks high praise of the monk's filial piety, and he relates a discourse called the Mātuposaka Sutta, as well his own previous life as Śyāma. In this previous life, the Buddha-to-be was taking care of his blind parents, but was accidentally shot by a king hunting. Whilst his last thoughts went out to his parents who would no longer have any one to take care of them, a deity intervened and Śyāma came back to life. In some versions of the story, it is the mother who makes an \\"act of truth\\" referring to the virtue of her son, and by doing so magically revives him. There is also a story of the elder Maudgalyayāna, one of the main disciples of the Buddha, who is described saving his mother from hell by sharing his religious merits. In this story, Maudgalyayāna sees through meditative vision that his mother who has just died is reborn in hell. Shocked by this, he tries to use his meditative psychic powers to help his mother, but to no avail. Then the Buddha advises him to do meritorious acts toward the monastic community on behalf of his mother, which does help.  In Mahāyāna texts  Early Buddhist texts, such as the Māta Sutta of the Saṃyutta Nikāya, mention that every living being has once been one's relative in a previous life in the cycle of birth and rebirth. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, therefore, helping to liberate other living beings from suffering came to be seen as a form of filial piety, since it was believed that all beings could have once been one's parents. This doctrine has affected Buddhist practice as well. For example, in some forms of Tibetan meditation, practitioners are instructed to develop loving-kindness to all living beings by remembering that all could have been their mother in previous lifetimes. Just as in Pāli texts, Mahāyāna texts compare particularistic love negatively to universal love, which is seen as superior.  History   Early Buddhist history  In the early days of Western Buddhist scholarship, a number of scholars, among which Indologist I.B. Horner (18961981) and linguist Jean Przyluski (18851944), emphasized the role of filial piety in Indian Buddhism. However, in later years, scholars such as Hajime Nakamura, Michihata Ryōshū, Miyakawa Hasayuki and Kenneth Ch'en developed the perspective that filial piety was unique for the period in which Buddhism was introduced in China, and had not been part of Indian Buddhism before that. But in a more recent development, starting with Buddhist studies scholars such as John Strong and Gregory Schopen, it has been shown that filial piety was part of Buddhist teaching since early times, though Strong did regard it as a compromise to Brahmanical ethics. In early Buddhism, filial piety was an important part of Buddhist ethics, though not as fundamental to ethics as it was in Confucianism. alt=Former Thai prime minister holding a vessel and pouring water during a ceremony with a large number of monks. At the time when Buddhism developed in India, there was criticism that Buddhist otherworldly ideals did not fit in with expectations of filial piety. Devotion to the mother was seen as a fundamental virtue, and early Buddhists had to reconcile Buddhist doctrine and practice with Indian social institutions. Schopen found much epigraphic evidence and some textual evidence showing that early Buddhist laypeople, monks and nuns often displayed strong devotion to their deceased parents, concluding filial piety was already an important part of the devotional life of early Buddhists. Contrary to the general scholarly view, devotional practices like dedicating the merit of a building to one's parents were common among Buddhist monastics, even more so than among laypeople. There is also textual evidence to suggest that the ties monastics had with their parents were not absolutely severed as ideally prescribed. For example, in some texts of monastic discipline there are anecdotes that suggest monastics regularly kept contact with their parents, expressed concern for them, and even borrowed money to support them. Also, in many Jātaka stories monks are mentioned that take care of their parents, sometimes financially. Lastly, John Strong and Kenneth Ch'en have argued that the doctrine of the transfer of merit, so much emphasized in the filial story of Mulian Saves His Mother, originated in Indian Buddhism, within the context of ancestor worship and offerings to hungry ghosts. Scholar of religion Stephen F. Teiser has stated, however, that there is no evidence of an Indian predecessor to the Chinese Ghost Festival with its emphasis on salvation of ancestors. Although many similarities can be found between the contexts in which Indian and Chinese Buddhism arose, it was only in China that Buddhism would, in Strong's words, \\"systematically and self-consciously\\" develop its response to the question of filial piety.  Introduction of Buddhism in China  Buddhism stressed individual salvation, which went against the Confucian tenets, that mostly focused on family life and society. Buddhism advocated monasticism and celibacy, and emphasized the suffering inherent in family life, which was unacceptable in the Confucian world view. Confucianism considered it a child's duty to continue the parental line. Moreover, celibacy did not exist in China before the arrival of Buddhism. Therefore, in early medieval China (), Buddhism was heavily criticized for what Confucianists perceived as a disregard for Confucian virtues and role ethics among family members. In addition, Buddhist monks were without descendants, and therefore did not create the offspring necessary to continue the ancestor worship in next generations. Furthermore, Buddhist monks shaved their heads, which was perceived as a lack of filial piety, because Confucianism saw the human body as a \\"living monument of filial piety\\" and considered tonsure a form of mutilation. Another problem was that early Chinese Buddhist monks did not formally pay homage to the emperor, which was seen as going against social propriety and was connected with the idea that Buddhism did not adhere to filial piety. This already became a problem in the Eastern Jin Dynasty (265–420). Furthermore, during the Wei (386550) and Jin Dynasties, many Chinese women became ordained as nuns and left their families behind, which was very disturbing for Buddhism's critics. Nevertheless, many Chinese Buddhists still adhered strongly to Confucian values, and attempted to reconcile the two value systems. In the process of introducing and integrating Buddhism in China, historian Kenneth Ch'en distinguished three stages. In the first stage, Buddhism actively advocated filial piety as a Confucian virtue. In the second stage, Buddhists referred to their own tradition to make an argument that filial piety had always been part of it. In the last stage, they argued that Buddhist ethics were more universal and therefore more superior than Confucian kinship-oriented filial piety. Over time, the debate between critics and Buddhists became more refined as more Buddhist texts were translated and Buddhism became better known in China.  Apologetics and adaptation (3rd–5th century)  pious to the emperor. When Buddhism was introduced to China, it was redefined to support filial piety. Many elements of Buddhist teaching were once secondary in Indian Buddhism, but now gained new importance and a new function in a process of apologetics. For example, the Mouzi Lihuolun (牟子理惑論) presented arguments why Buddhist practices did not go against Confucius, but were actually praised by him. The Mouzi does this by referring to the Confucian and Daoist classics, as well as historical precedents. In one passage, the text compares the life of a Buddhist monk with a pious son who saves his father from drowning: > \\"A long time ago, the Ch'i people crossed a large river in a boat and it > happened that their father fell into the water. His sons rolled up their > sleeves, seized his head, and turned him upside down, forcing the water out > of his mouth, thus bringing their father back to life. Now, to seize one's > father's head and turn him upside down is certainly not very filial. Yet > they could have done nothing better to save their father's life. If they had > folded their hands and practiced the norm of filial sons, their father's > life would have been lost in the waters.\\" The behavior of a Buddhist monk is similar. While on the surface the Buddhist seems to reject and abandon his parents, the pious Buddhist is actually aiding his parents as well as himself on the path towards enlightenment. In this regard, the Mouzi cites Confucius saying that judgments should be made appropriately, weighing circumstances. In a way, Buddhists claimed therefore that a Buddhist monk benefited his parents, and in superior ways than Confucianism, because their renunciation was the \\"height of self-giving\\". The Mouzi Lihuolun also attempted to counter charges that not having children was a violation of good ethics. It was pointed out that Confucius himself had praised a number of ascetic sages who had not had children or family, but because of their wisdom and sacrifice were still perceived as ethical by Confucius. The argument that Buddhist filial piety concerns itself with the parent's soul is the most important one. Later, Sun Chuo (300–380), made an even stronger argument, by stating that Buddhists monks (far from working solely for their own benefit) were working to ensure the salvation of all people and making their family proud by doing so. Any change in the son's status would reflect on the parent, therefore the spiritual achievements of the monk were at the same time a form of filial piety toward his parents. In that sense, Sun Chuo claimed that Buddhism teaches what amounts to a perfect form of filial piety, which he further amplified by referring to the Buddha's conversion of his father. Sun Chuo also responded to criticism with regard to the story of Sudāna (), a previous life of the Buddha, in which a prince becomes an ascetic and gives away his father's possessions, his own wife and children as a practice of generosity. Sun Chuo's opponent critic described Sudāna as an \\"inhuman creature\\", but Sun Chuo argued that Sudāna had realized the highest form of filial piety, because in his final lifetime as Gautama Buddha he would eventually help his family to attain enlightenment. Sun Chuo concluded: \\"If this is not filial piety and humanity, then what is piety and humanity?\\" Seven Buddhas and the deeds of filial piety they performed in previous lives. Baodingshan, Dazu, China, 12th–13th century Responding to criticism from emperor Huan Xuan (369–404), Huiyuan (334–416) argued that Buddhist monks did not have to pay homage to the emperor in \\"a manifested way\\", but just in heart and mind. Buddhist monks did in fact support imperial rule, he continued, but do so by teaching virtue to the people and in that way \\"all the six relationships, father and son, older and younger brother, husband and wife, will be benefited\\". He further stated that in order to become a monk, a devotee had to ask permission from his parents and emperor firstordination as a monk was therefore not against filial piety, he argued. This argument was supported by certain rules in the Indian Buddhist monastic discipline, but the intention behind these rules was redefined to show that Buddhism was congruent with traditions of piety and loyalty. In his arguments Huiyuan was supported by some government officials and prominent lay people. His writings effectively stopped the debate with regard to monks not prostrating for the emperor, but the more general issue of the Buddhist monastic order being exempt from certain duties and obligations still remained. During the Northern and Southern dynasties (420–577), Buddhism developed much in China, and conflicts arose with Daoists and Confucianists. A Daoist wrote a polemic called the Sanpo Lun attacking Buddhism for destroying the nation and the family. He argued that monks did not do anything productive, and resources were wasted on building Buddhist monasteries. He also criticized the shaving of hair as \\"destructive to the person\\". Again, Buddhist writers responded in defense. Sengshun replied that Buddhist supported imperial rule by promoting virtuous behavior, referring to the Shanshengzi Jing (, i.e. the Chinese translation of the Sigalaka Sutta) to show that Buddhists observed social norms. In addition, Liu Xie argued that Buddhist monks and lay people did practice filial piety, but monks did so by sharing merit with their departed relatives. Responding to the criticism that monks shave their hair, Liu Xie stated they abandoned minor filial acts in order to perform greater ones. The adaptation of Buddhism to fit in with Confucian expectations of filial piety did not only take place on an academic level. Even on the grassroots level, in folk religion, Buddhism was adapted to fit in with Confucian values, as evidenced in the 5th-century text Tiwei Boli Jing.  Reinvention (6th–13th century)  Drawing in a 1846 version of The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars, of which the story of Śyāma eventually became part. In the process of integrating Buddhism in Chinese culture, Buddhists soon realized that refutation of criticism by Confucianists was not sufficient to hold their own. Chinese Buddhism had to stress its own ideas about filial piety. To more directly point out the Buddhist's filial nature, passages and parables about filial piety in Northwest Indian and Central Asian Buddhism became very prominent in Chinese Buddhism. The story of Śyāma () was an example of this. The story was often mentioned in the Chinese canon of Buddhist texts, was included in a number of different anthologies such as the Liudu Jijing and even the Confucian tradition of twenty-four stories of filial piety (1260–1368). A similar story of Sujāti () relates that she cut off her own flesh to feed her parents, to keep them alive. During the T'ang dynasty (618–907), the story gained much popularity and it was eventually transformed into a Confucian classic tale as well. Furthermore, it was a way for Chinese Buddhists to make a statement that Buddhist filial piety was superior to Confucian filial piety. Sujāti and other Buddhist stories of self-sacrifice spread a belief that a filial child should even be willing to sacrifice its own body. As for the story of Maudgalyayāna, this was incorporated in the Ullambana Sūtra, and led to the establishment of the Ghost Festival in China in the 6th century. The festival was held in the seventh moon of the Chinese calendar, and commemorated Maudgalyayāna () saving his mother. The festival became very popular throughout Chinese society, even to the point of imperial families and government officers becoming involved. The story also became very popular: though already part of the Indian Buddhist tradition, East Asian Buddhism raised it from a peripheral role to a central one. Buddhists attempted to show that filial children could still take care of their parents in the afterlife, a concept which they believed Confucianists overlooked. Some Buddhist authors like Ch'i-sung proclaimed that Buddhists not only practiced filial piety, but also did so at a more deeper level than Confucianists, because they took care of their parents in both this life and the next. The Sutra on a Filial Son stated in this regard that the best way to repay one's parents' kindness was by helping them to develop faith in Buddhism, not just by taking care of them materially. On a similar note, the monk Zongmi (780-841) argued that the main motivation for Prince Siddhārtha leaving his parents and becoming a monk was so he could teach them later on and thereby repay his debt of gratitude to them. Zongmi described the Ghost Festival as the highest expression of filial piety, in which Buddhist and Confucian doctrine could meet. alt=Bearded man with hat Apart from religious texts, the first generations of Buddhists in China responded to criticism from Confucianists by emphasizing the lay life more and the monastic life less in their teachings, and for those who did become ordained as monastics, they decided to erect monasteries in populated areas, instead of retreating to the remote wilderness. This also helped to contribute to the social expectations of Chinese Confucian culture. By the end of the 6th century, Buddhist monks were paying homage to the Chinese emperor through rituals and services, which also helped to stop the argument whether monks should prostrate themselves. Nevertheless, in 662 emperor Gaozong issued decrees obliging monks to prostrate before their parents and the emperor. Dao Xuan and Fa Lin, standing in the tradition of Huiyuan, argued that monks paid respects internally, and that such internal respect was more important than outward expression. There was so much opposition that Gaozong had to adjust the decree and eventually fully rescind it. Later, in the middle of the T'ang Dynasty, Han Yu attempted to criticize Buddhism for lack of filial piety in a memorandum, but his protests were suppressed by emperor Xian Zong and not much responded to. Han Yu was nearly executed and banished. His popularity later rose, however. During the 10th-century neo-Confucianist revival, Han Yu's writings were rediscovered and he became a saintly figure. Already in the 9th century, Emperor Wu Zong took Han Yu's arguments to heart and began a campaign to extinguish Buddhism (841–845), citing as one of the justifications that Buddhists would \\"abandon their rulers and parents for the company of teachers\\". Monastics were defrocked and monasteries were destroyed at a large scale. Although Wu Zong's successor Emperor Xuan Zong (810–859) attempted to recover the damage done, since that time Chinese Buddhism has never completely recovered to its former status. It did continue to uphold a role in state rituals and mourning rites for ancestors, up until late imperial times (13th–20th century). Monasteries were given names like \\"Monastery for Honoring Loyalty [to the State]\\" and \\"Monastery for the Glorification of Filial Piety\\". Neo-Confucianism upheld the principle of \\"gradational love\\" (), which argued that good people should develop filial piety for their parents and neighbors first, and only in a later stage develop love for humankind. Although this idea was influenced by Mahāyāna Buddhist doctrine, the principle was eventually used as a criticism against Buddhism, which was seen to disregard filial piety in favor of universal kindness. = New elements = In the Dunhuang grottoes illustrations were found of the Discourse on the Difficulty in Paying the Debt to Parents During this period, in response to attacks from Confucianists and Daoists, works written in defense of filial piety in Buddhism reflected a higher level of maturity. For example, in response to Daoist criticism that Buddhism teaches abandonment of one's parents, Fa Lin responded by referring to the Buddhist idea that all living beings might have been our parents, but also our enemies. A wise man therefore practices impartiality and seeks enlightenment. This is the Buddhist way to benefit one's parents and all living beings. The Zen master Qisong (1007 – 1072) criticized Han Yu's writings for not conforming to Confucian doctrine. Also, during this time some Buddhist writers started to argue that the five moral precepts in Buddhism were an expression of filial piety. Although the promotion of the five precepts by Buddhist monks had previously been referred to as a way to support imperial rule and therefore a form of filial piety, Buddhist writers now took this further. In particular, Qisong in his work the Xiaolun equated each of the precepts with a Confucian virtue (known as \\"five constants\\"), but argued that Buddhist ethics were superior to Confucian ethics, because of the virtue of compassion for all living beings. This is a higher form of filial piety, he argued, because one presumes that all living beings have once been our parents and tries to repay the debt of gratitude to them. Qisong summarized his argument by stating that piety is venerated in all religious teachings, but it is especially true in Buddhism\\". On a similar note, the Fanwang Jing () contained a phrase stating that \\"filial piety is called precepts\\", which inspired writings by Buddhist scholars on the subject and made the Fanwang Jing very popular. Furthermore, in order for Confucianists to accept Buddhism more easily, new elements were introduced in the Buddhist doctrine. During the Han dynasty , Chinese Buddhist leaders introduced the teaching of the four debts that a person should repay: the moral debt to one's parents, to all living beings, to one's ruler and to the Triple Gem (the Buddha, his teaching and the monastic community). Perhaps inspired by Brahmanical teachings, Chinese Buddhists hoped that edifying people about the four debts would help for Buddhism to become more accepted in China. However, the teaching of the four debts only gained much popularity during the 8th century, when the Mahāyāna Discourse on the Concentration of Mind Ground was translated in Chinese () by Prajñā. In the 2nd century CE, another text was composed based on the Kataññnu Sutta (), called the Fumuen Nanbao Jing, the Discourse on the Difficulties in Repaying Parents' Debts. The text emphasized the compassion parents have towards their children. It later became highly popular in East Asian countries, as it was cited in at least ten Chinese translations of Indian texts. Based on this text, the more popular Fumu Enzhong Jing was composed (, title has similar meaning). In the T'ang Dynasty, the Fumu was depicted in illustrations found in the Dunhuang caves dating back to the T'ang (618–907) and Song dynasties (960–1279). Popular preaching and lectures, mural and cave paintings and stone carvings indicate that it once was very popular among the common people.  The role of women  Sūtra of Filial Piety, Korean woodblock, 16th century When Buddhism developed in China, not only filial piety itself was redefined, but also the role of women in Chinese culture: in texts such as the Yuyenü Jing women, especially daughters-in-law, were described as pious children, a description that had hardly been used for women. This changed all genres of writing from the early medieval period onward. Buddhist doctrine helped fulfill the need for changing post-Han society to deal with daughters-in-law perceived as unruly, by providing a role for her as a filial daughter where indigenous tradition was silent or ambiguous. In edifying stories about virtuous daughters-in-law, women were given a pivotal role in creating harmony in the family, which was unprecedented. However, although daughters' expression of filial piety was basically the same as that of sons, daughters expressed it in more extreme forms, including infanticide or suicide. Often their role only became important in the absence of any sons. On a similar note, in 517, the monk Shi Baochang wrote a number of hagiographies of virtuous nuns. In these stories, a new ideal Chinese woman was constructed, who was both filial yet also practiced Buddhist virtues. In Baochang's stories, he depicted women that excelled at both Confucian and Buddhist virtue and practices, by either combining such practices, practicing them at different periods in life (e.g. being a filial daughter and later choosing the nun's life), or by transforming Confucian practices in Buddhist practices. Though the ideal of self-sacrifice agreed with Confucian values, such sacrifice was redefined fitting with Buddhist values. Through these writings, Chinese Buddhists attempted to connect the family with the monastery in a mutually supportive relationship. Inscriptions show that female donors of Buddhist monasteries often dedicated their generosity to their parents, effectively helping to establish a new ideal of female filial piety. Also, the legend of Miaoshan became quite popular, which related how the bodhisattva Guanyin is born as a princess and refuses to marry following her father's wishes. She eventually manages to find salvation for herself and her father, when she heals her father from his illness by sacrificing some of her body parts to be used for medicine. This story is still used by Buddhist women in Singapore to justify their resistance to marriage. Another story that connects filial piety with the bodhisattva figure is that of Dizang's previous lives, both as filial daughters. Buddhist writings on filial piety influenced Confucianism and Chinese culture at large. In India, where Buddhism originated, women had different social roles than in China, and devotion of the child to the mother was an important virtue. The debt of a child to its mother was seen as more important than the debt to its father, and hurting one's mother was considered more severe than hurting one's father. Although a child was seen to be indebted to both parents, \\"he obligation to the father is a call of duty, whereas the obligation to the mother is a pull of love\\". In T'ang dynasty China, a number of apocryphal texts were written that spoke of the Buddha's respect for his parents, and the parent–child relationship. The most important of these, the Sūtra of Filial Piety, was written early in the T'ang dynasty. This discourse has the Buddha make the argument that parents bestow kindness to their children in many ways, and put great efforts into ensuring the well-being of their child. The discourse continues by describing how difficult it is to repay one's parents' kindness, but concludes that this can be done, in a Buddhist way. The Fumu Enzhong Jing contained a similar message. The Sūtra of Filial Piety was not only a way for Chinese Buddhists to adapt to Confucian ideals, it added its own Buddhist contribution to the concept of filial piety. It added the role of women and poor people in practicing filial piety, and regarded filial piety as a quality to be practiced toward all living beings in this and the next life. Therefore, the sūtra served not only as an adaptation to Confucian values, but also served Buddhist ideals of edification. In their teachings about filial piety, Chinese Buddhists emphasized the great suffering a mother goes through when giving birth and raising a child. They described how difficult it is to repay one's parents, and how many sins the mother often would commit in raising her children. They even went so far that she might even go to hell as a result of the sins she committed. The mother became the primary source of well-being and indebtedness for the son, which was in contrast with pre- Buddhist perspectives. This emphasis on the son's obligation to the mother was a new addition to the Chinese concept of filial piety, as the bond between mother and son became the primary relationship. According to scholar Nomura Shin'ichi, the ideal of the son repaying the gratitude to his mother played an important part in uniting two contrasting ideas in East Asian culture at the time, that is, the concept of feminine impurity on the one hand and the ideal of pure motherhood on the other hand. The son was taught to deal with this indebtedness to his mother by making donations to the local monastery. The monastery would then perform recitation of texts and dedicate the merit to the mother, which would help her. In other words, to be a good son, one also had to be a good Buddhist. Religious studies scholar Alan Cole has attempted to describe the role of women in Chinese Buddhism using a Freudian framework. Cole states that Chinese Buddhist texts depicted women as examples of virtue and sacrifice, but also as lustful and greedy people. However, Cole's monograph about the family in Chinese Buddhism has received mixed reviews and his conclusions are disputed. Chinese Buddhists urged people to stop killing animals for ancestor worship, because this would create only bad karma; rather, people were encouraged to practice devotion and make merit, especially making donations to the Buddhist clergy and in that way to help their mothers from a bad rebirth in hell. The traditional ancestral sacrifices were therefore discouraged by Chinese Buddhists.  Development in other parts of Asia  Koryo period. |alt=Map of the Koryo kingdom |upright=.6 The Discourse on the Difficulty in Paying the Debt to Parents was introduced and translated in Korea in the Koryo period, in the 17th century. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Confucian value of filial piety toward parents and emperor became strongly associated with Buddhism. Important in this process was the spread of edifying vernacular songs, in which filial children were encouraged to chant invocations of the Buddha Amitabha for their parents' rebirth in a Pure Land. Further, the songs, meant for Buddhists, urged people to respectfully serve social relationships including parents, in agreement with Confucian social ethics. In an 18th-century shaman song informed by Buddhist principles, a princess called Pari kongju is abandoned by her parents because they want a male heir. She is later saved by the Buddha and raised by others. Despite being abandoned, she later finds medicine for her ill royal parents and cures them out of filial piety. During the Edo period in Japan (1603–1868), large quantities of biographies of filial people were written, as Japanese authors were inspired by Ming dynasty Chinese texts and started writing extensively about filial piety. Some of these works were written by Japanese Buddhist monks, writing about filial Buddhist lay people or monks. Others were written by Chinese Buddhist monks that had moved to Japan as part of initiatives to revitalize Buddhism for Chinese residents in Japan. Bankei Yōtaku (1622–1693) emphasized filial piety in his teachings, considering it part of Buddhahood. In the 18th-century, filial piety was reinterpreted by Japanese writers such as Fórì and Tōrei Enji. Just like in Song Dynasty China, filial piety was not seen as just a virtue to be practiced towards parents, relatives and ancestors, but to all living beings. Since all living beings were seen to have been one's parents from previous lives, the filial role of the individual was more broadly construed, and blood lines were interpreted in a more spiritual sense rather than only blood relations. With this, Tōrei meant to emphasize the role of religion and its lineage. Therefore, in Japan, Buddhists regarded the position of Buddhism on filial piety as either the same as in Confucianism, or as broader and deeper than in Confucianism. In South and Southeast Asia, the example of the Buddha maintaining a loving relationship with his family, as depicted in a wide range of narratives, had a profound effect in countries where Theravāda Buddhism took hold. In devotional texts, parents were mentioned in the same list with the Triple Gem as objects of devotion. Vernacular narratives warned of the dangers of treating one's parents with disrespect and encouraged the listeners a life-long respect for mothers and mother-like figures. Buddhist rituals marking the period of adulthood of a young male emphasized gratitude and honor to the mother. A common metaphor found in popular Sinhalese verse and religious prose dating from medieval times is that of the Buddha as a caring, loving mother. In another example, vernacular post-canonical Pāli texts in several Theravādin countries mention a previous life of the Buddha in which he first conceived the idea of becoming a Buddha (). The story depicts the Buddha-to-be as a filial and grateful son, which the text says is a habit of Buddhas-to-be in general. The mother is part of the reason the Buddha-to-be aspires to become a Buddha in a future life.  Practice in the present day  Among some Buddhists, there is a custom of prostrating to parents. The Discourse on the Difficulty in Paying the Debt to Parents is still popular in East Asia and is often referred to in preaching by monks. The story of the monk Mulian is still depicted in Chinese opera to this day, which is especially popular in the countryside. Throughout Asia, the Ghost Festival is still celebrated, though its importance is most felt in countries which have been influenced by both Buddhism and Confucianism. Filial piety is still an important part of moral education in Buddhist countries. It is an important value in a number of Asian cultures, some of which are based on Buddhism, such as Thailand. In the context of care-giving in Thailand, the parents of a child are compared to an enlightened Buddhist monk from the perspective of the family. The children of a parent are seen to have a relationship of bunkhun with the parents, which is a value that informs their filial piety, and gives it a sense of \\"respect, honor, fidelity, devotion, dutifulness, and sacrifice\\". Furthermore, there is a custom among Theravādin Buddhists in Asia for male children to temporarily become ordained as a Buddhist monk in order to share the religious merit with their parents. Having passed this rite is regarded by the Thai as a sign of maturity and as an expression of filial piety. in Thailand, women cannot receive full ordination, however, and therefore practice their filial role mostly economically. Even Thai women who emigrate abroad tend to still send money to their aging parents. The custom of sending money to one's parents is common among rural Thai, who often work in big cities to earn money. During the Thai New Year festival, gratitude is widely and publicly expressed as elderly parents are honored by gifts. Among Sri Lankans, commemoration of one's deceased parents is an important part of daily routine of many people. This may be done by a simple daily act of lighting incense. There still is a common expression among Sri Lankans that \\"the mother is the Buddha of the home\\". Among some Buddhists, there is a custom of prostrating to parents. In a 2015 study among British teens who self-identify as Buddhist, 78% of heritage (ethnic) Buddhists indicated they prostrated to their parents, and 13% of convert Buddhist teens.

Origin In the spring of 1905, the Moscow Governor attempted to call on some peasant societies in the Moscow province to compile patriotic addresses with an expression of readiness to continue the Russian- Japanese war. This initiative led to the opposite result – many societies of the Moscow region peasants began to write letters of opposite content. Under the influence of some members of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party in May 1905, a peasant congress was organized in Moscow in order to agree and coordinate efforts in this direction. During this period, several similar professional congresses took place in Russia. The Peasant Union of the Moscow Province was formed at the Moscow Congress. During the summer of 1905, similar alliances arose in other provinces of the Russian Empire. Founding Congress From July 31 to August 1, 1905, the Constituent (the first one) congress of the All-Russian Peasant Union was held in Moscow. It was illegal, the delegates gathered in private apartments. Among them were representatives of peasant unions of 22 provinces, mainly central and purely Russian. At the congress there were more than 100 people, including about 25 rural intellectuals (Social Revolutionaries, Liberators and several Social DemocratsAll-Russian Peasant Union. // Historical reference book of the Russian Marxist, 1999). The congress proclaimed itself the first Constituent Congress of the All-Russian Peasant Union. They determined the structure of the All-Russian Peasant Union: it included periodic conventions (All-Russian, regional, provincial) and committees (Main, provincial, district, volost and rural). The congress elected the Main Committee, which included 8 people (Semyon and Vasily Mazurenko, Vasily Krasnov, Sergey Kournin, Medvedev, Ovcharenko, Grigory Shaposhnikov, Khomutov), as well as the \\"Central Assistance Bureau\\" composed of Stepan Bleklov, Alexander Levitsky, Alexey Staal, Vladimir Tan-Bogoraz, Arkhip Teslenko.Simonova. Peasant Union All- Russian. // Soviet historical encyclopedia The congress participants recognized the necessity of convening a Constituent Assembly elected by universal direct, equal and secret ballot, the requirement of voting rights for women was unanimously adopted; age limit determined by a majority of 20 years; the idea of a two-step election provoked a strong protest. Further, it was decided to require compulsory and free education, and schools should be secular; the teaching of the law of God was deemed unnecessary; teaching was to be conducted in the local national languages; the period of study was to be at least 5 years. Local government should be widely developed and built on the principle of universal suffrage. The congress advocated the nationalization of the land and the abolition of private land ownership; monastic, church, specific, cabinet and state lands should have been selected without redemption; land should be taken away from private owners by part for remuneration, part without remuneration; the conditions for the nationalization of the land should be determined by the constituent assembly. The program of the congress was very close to the program of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. The proposal of the representative of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, Andrey Shestakov, to include in the resolution an item on a democratic republic was rejected. The leadership of the Union and most of the delegates were supporters of peaceful means and opposed the armed struggle. According to the materials of the constituent congress, the main committee of the All-Russian Peasant Union published a brochure: \\"The Constituent Congress of the All-Russian Peasant Union. Protocol\\" (Moscow, 1905). In the same year of 1905 in St. Petersburg, it was also implemented in the form of a brochure and another edition of the same protocol. Although this edition was attended by some interesting details that were not in the first brochure, but the Committee of the Peasant Union took responsibility only for the first, official publication. Delegate convention From November 6 to 10, 1905, in the new political conditions, that is, the first regular (or second) congress (or delegate meeting) of the Peasant Union was held legally in Moscow. Sessions were held in the building of the agricultural school. Attended by 187 delegates (including 145 peasants) from 27 provinces, including delegates from Belarus, who were completely absent at the first congress. Among the delegates there was a large number of rural intellectuals. The general tone that prevailed at the congress was still much more radical than at the constituent congress. In particular, it was decided: #Do not submit rural and parish verdicts for approval by the Zemstvo bosses, but bring them into effect according to the decrees of the assemblies. #Do not contact the Zemsky heads in any matters. #Do not give officials and police a carriage, apartments, travel money, do not send sots and ten according to the requirements of the authorities. #Change all local peasant authorities (foremen, wardens, clerks) and choose new ones, while choosing universal direct, equal and secret ballot, giving everyone the right to vote in the parish without distinction of gender, ethnicity, religion or class. #Do not pay taxes. #Refuse to testify at interrogations. #When the people achieve the power to insist on the payment of % for all state loans concluded before November 10, 1905, but to consider all loans that are concluded by the government after November 10 before the Constituent Assembly is illegal and non-refundable. Further activities during the first Russian revolution According to incomplete data, by October-December 1905, in the European part of Russia there were already 470 volost and rural organizations of the All- Russian Peasant Union, uniting up to 200 thousand people. Organizations also originated in Siberia and the Far East. At the end of 1905, several regional, 10 provincial and 30 district congresses of the Peasant Union were held. Some Congresses have put forward a program of armed seizure of landed estates. The local organizations of the Union in the areas of mass peasant unrest (Ukraine, the Volga region, the Center of the European part) played the role of revolutionary Peasant committees. In March 1906, an illegal congress of the Union took place in Moscow, and 18 provinces were represented there. With the beginning of the work of the 1st State Duma, the activities of the Union focused around the \\"Labor Group\\". Union committees began to be viewed as grassroots bodies of the group, supporting it with instructions and agitation in the peasantry. In May 1906, a meeting of the Union was held in Helsingfors, which approved these tactics and decided to prepare an armed uprising in alliance with the revolutionary parties. The Peasant Union took part in the elections to the Second Duma and held there several of its members who joined it in the Labor Group. Individual members of the Union were subjected to political persecution in 1905. Against the Union itself, repressions began in 1906, the organizers of the Union Anikin, Professor Anichkov, Mazurenko and others were arrested. The Union’s bureaucracy continued to operate for a while, however, its activities gradually calmed down and finally ceased by the end of 1908. Arrests for membership in the All-Russian Peasant Union continued in 1914. Some representatives of this organization abroad formed the Foreign Bureau of the Peasant Union, and the Mensheviks were included in it. Peasant Union All-Russian. // Great Soviet Encyclopedia First Peasant Congress (May 1917) The resumption of the All-Russian Peasant Union in 1917 The activities of the All-Russian Peasant Union resumed after the February 1917 revolution. In March, a part of the former leaders of the Union, representatives of the Popular Socialists, the Social Revolutionaries, the Mensheviks, and the cooperative movement formed the Main Committee. On March 25, 1917, the Main Committee issued an appeal calling on the peasants to support the Provisional Government, suspend the seizures of landlords and support the continuation of the war. From August 13 to 19, a congress of the Union was held in Moscow. It was attended by 316 delegates from 33 provinces and regions of European Russia and Siberia and 34 delegates of military units. At the congress there was a split. Representatives of the All-Russian and Moscow Council of Peasant Deputies, dominated by the Social Revolutionaries, accused the Main Committee of the All-Russian Peasant Union of destroying unity and creating a second, parallel to the Councils, peasant organization. Supporters of the peasant councils, and with them a significant part of the delegates left the congress. At the congress, 120-140 delegates remained. They adopted a new statute, declaring the All-Russian Peasant Union \\"a broad professional-political organization of the peasantry\\", it was emphasized that the Peasant Councils are essentially a Social Revolutionary organization. A main committee of 25 people was elected (with chairman Semen Mazurenko). The program of the Union included the socialization of the land with the transition to the free use of the people; the redemption of landowner lands was provided for in an indirect form, namely in the form of payment of mortgages on the land by the state. The final decision of the land issue was provided to the Constituent Assembly. The congress spoke out against the seizures of landowner lands, supported the Provisional Government, called for a defense policy, supported the dissolution of the Finnish Diet. In April- October 1917, the newspaper \\"Voice of the Peasant Union\\", the publication of the All-Russian Peasant Union, was published. In the Bolshevik time, the Union ceased to exist.

He is best known today for his portrait painted by Johan Conrad Leich in 1882 when Kooi was back in the Netherlands. He is proudly wearing his four Dutch service medals, the most prominent being the leftmost one, Knight of the Fourth Class of the Military Order of William, which he received in 1878 for his service in the Second Aceh Expedition, part of the Aceh War.

It was recorded at Apple Studios in London and reached No. 135 on the Billboard 200 charts. A single from the album, a cover of \\"Ain't That Peculiar\\" hit the Billboard Hot 100. Background By late 1971, Fanny had achieved some critical and commercial success, with the title track to the album Charity Ball reaching the Billboard top 40. Fanny Hill was recorded at Apple Studios in London and produced by Richard Perry. Former Beatles associate Geoff Emerick engineered the album. Regular Rolling Stones sidesmen Bobby Keys and Jim Price performed on several tracks, particularly the Stones-influenced \\"Borrowed Time\\". The opening track was a cover of Marvin Gaye's \\"Ain't That Peculiar\\", which was rearranged to include Latin-influenced percussion and a slide guitar solo from June Millington. It was released as a single, reaching No. 85 on the Billboard Hot 100. The group also covered The Beatles' \\"Hey Bulldog\\". Their arrangement included different lyrics to the original, which were reportedly approved by the Beatles. Release The album was originally released in February 1972 by Reprise Records. It reached No. 135 on the Billboard 200 chart. In 2015, an expanded version was released on CD by Real Gone Records, including out-takes and backing tracks. Critical reception The album received a good review in Rolling Stone, who said \\"the number of groups that can inspire affection the way Fanny have with this album, simply from the pure exuberance of their music, are far and few between\\".

They married in 1897 and settled in Cincinnati where he opened a music studio, became involved in politics, was city paymaster, became the first president of the local chapter of the NAACP, and started the Ohio Enterprise newspaper in 1902. It eventually became The Union which he published until 1952, the year of his death. He wrote several books and pamphlets including one about leading African Americans in Cincinnati, a biography of his close friend Maggie L. Walker (the first woman to charter a bank in the U.S.), and published a collection of his newspaper writings. Walker hired Dabney to write her biography. He also composed songs. He objected to laws restricting marriage between African Americans and whites. The Dabney Building was at 420 McAllister Street.

Tried on 15 May 1843. Mean speed of 6 runs, 12.142 miles. An iron steamer she was built at Blackwall for a private individual, and was afterwards purchased by the Admiralty as the first screw- propelled vessel in the Royal Navy. Constructed of iron, she showed on her trial trip in 1843 that her speed was over 12 miles an hour, and on being taken over she became known as HMS Dwarf, though she had been launched as Mermaid. She was of 164 tons, and her mean draught on her trial trip was only , which was in wonderful contrast to the modern of the day, which drew as much as . She was fitted with Bennet Woodcroft's patent varying pitch screw propeller. Dwarf went on to serve as a tender to , she was under the command of Lieutenant Commander Edward Halhead Beauchamp-Proctor until March 1843, when the vessel was paid off at Woolwich. Prince Albert while on board HMY Victoria and Albert at Cowes in October 1844 professed interest in the little screw and came on board with Queen Victoria for a closer look. The results of her extensive propeller trials were published in December 1844 In December 1845, she was sent to Sheerness to take on the duties of that port's admirals tender. Lieutenant Osborne, when in command of Dwarf on the coast of Ireland in 1848, fitting out in the Portsmouth Basin, heard the cry of \\"a boy overboard,\\" he immediately plunged in with his full uniform on, including his sword, and saved the boy a first class certificate was awarded, and he was strongly recommended to the Parent Society in London. Dwarf, while moored in Kingstown Harbour, Ireland, sent an armed boat's crew to Ann Kenney and captured an unrecognised emerald silk flag. On 26 September 1849, she was run down by and collided with in the Atlantic Ocean southeast of the Old Head of Kinsale, County Cork. Dwarf was severely damaged. Her crew were taken off by Trident, which towed her into Kinsale, County Cork for repairs. She was scrapped in 1853. The second screw vessel in the Royal Navy was a paddle vessel, built of wood and launched in 1842 as a tender to the Royal Academy, Portsmouth. Bee had additional screw propulsion fitted in 1844. She was broken up in 1874. Both vessels were purely experimental and never intended for active service.

Shadow Captain takes place in a setting 10 million years in the future called The Congregation, where the Solar system has been through thirteen \\"Occupations\\" that has reduced the planets to rubble and rebuilt it into its current state, a collection of 50 million micro-worlds, with 20,000 of them occupied by the remnants of humanity and alien species. While Revenger is told from the first person perspective of Arafura Ness, Shadow Captain is told from the first person perspective of her older sister, Adrana. The final book in the trilogy, Bone Silence, has been published in 2020. Plot summary Three months after the events of the novel Revenger, Arafura ('Fura') Ness finds herself in command of the Revenger. They break into a bauble in order to raid a cache of fuel. Barely escaping 'twinkle-heads' found inside, they retreat back to space. Surt and Adrana believe they are being followed by another ship, but Fura dismisses the concern. A book is found on board that documents the history of Occupations, but in addition there is a second timeline that hints at the existence of \\"Shadow Occupations\\". Revenger is struck by a photon storm, and it's decided they should travel to Wheel Strizzardy (a wheel world) on the outer reaches of the Congregation. While en route they are shot at by the still hidden ship trailing them, injuring Strambli. Arriving at Wheel Strizzardy the crew take on fake identities and bribe their way onto the station. Strambli is given over to the care of Dr. Eddralder. The crew meets with Mister Glimmery who is infected with the \\"glowy\\" like Fura, in his presence is an alien Crawly named Cuttle. Afterwards they are escorted by Sneed to another part of the wheel to find accommodations. The crew goes out to secure supplies, but when they return they find Cuttle skulking near their rooms. Cuttle falls off a balcony and dies. Adrana and Prozor are accused of his murder by two Crawlies who show up on the scene. While on the station Fura manages to capture Lagganvor, a former associate of Bosa Sennen, who knows the whereabouts of The Miser, a bauble holding Bosa's cache of quoins. Merrix is Dr. Eddralder's daughter and is being used by Glimmery to ensure he is not poisoned by the doctor's glowy treatments. But Eddralder ends up slipping a poison to Glimmery anyway. Eddralder leaves six syringes with an antidote, and joins the crew of the Revenger with Merrix, promising to radio back how to cure the poison. Lagganvor also goes along with the crew. They travel to The Miser and once inside they find trams that hold more quoins than any of them have ever seen. As the trams near the central chamber the quoins begin glowing bright white and emit a scream that's heard inside their heads. They separate the trams and find that the quoins have been reset to seemingly random denominations. Returning to Revenger they discover the same is true throughout the 20,000 worlds, and fear that this financial event may cause the end of the Thirteenth Occupation. Adrana works out that Lagganvor is Pol Rackamore's brother (Brysca) who took on the identity to get revenge for his brother's death. Their plan at the end is to go into hiding by pursuing the object that Adrana believes is orbiting the Old Sun at intervals coinciding with Shadow Occupations.

Reception Paul Di Filippo at Locus gives a generally favorable review of Shadow Captain, saying: \\"what Reynolds is really doing is channeling some of the great writers from what David Pringle calls the Age of Storytellers–Dickens, Stevenson, Sabatini, Dumas–into space opera form [...] This second installment is a highly entertaining and worthy successor to Revenger.\\" SFFWorld rates the novel favorably and says the following: \\"Whilst there are clichés (it is, after all, space pirates!) there were times when I genuinely wasn’t sure where this was going to go. I will now wait impatiently for the third novel.\\" Tor.com contrasts the slow start of the novel with a strong finish and abundance of worldbuilding. \\"[...] as the decaying relationship of the sisters Ness takes centre stage, and our understanding of the Congregation is roundly reshaped, Shadow Captain goes from strength to strength, setting the scene for a conclusion that has a real chance of recapturing the vim and the vigour of volume one.\\" References to music Many of Reynolds' novels and stories make reference to the progressive rock genre. Shadow Captain is a song off the Crosby, Stills & Nash album CSN (1977). When asked by a fan if there is \\"Any reference there, subtle or otherwise\\" between the title of the book and the title of the song, Alastair Reynolds confirmed with \\"Yes, it's a wonderful song and the lyrics (trying to give the light the slip, etc) seemed to resonate well with the mood of the novel.\\" References Category:2019 science fiction novels Category:Space opera novels Category:Novels by Alastair Reynolds ","title":"Shadow Captain (novel)"},{"id":"60089497","text":"Cryptozona is a genus of air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Ariophantidae.

The problem Are the equators in \\\\mathbb{S}^{n+1} the only smooth embedded minimal hypersurfaces which are topological n-dimensional spheres? Additionally, the spherical Bernstein's problem, while itself a generalization of the original Bernstein's problem, can, too, be generalized further by replacing the ambient space \\\\mathbb{S}^{n+1} by a simply-connected, compact symmetric space. Some results in this direction are due to Wu-Chung Hsiang and Wu-Yi Hsiang work. Alternative formulations Below are two alternative ways to express the problem: The second formulation Let the (n − 1) sphere be embedded as a minimal hypersurface in S^n(1). Is it necessarily an equator? By the Almgren–Calabi theorem, it's true when n = 3 (or n = 2 for the 1st formulation). Wu-Chung Hsiang proved it for n ∈ {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14} (or n ∈ {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13}, respectively) In 1987, Per Tomter proved it for all even n (or all odd n, respectively). Thus, it only remains unknown for all odd n ≥ 9 (or all even n ≥ 8, respectively) The third formulation Is it true that an embedded, minimal hypersphere inside the Euclidean n-sphere is necessarily an equator? Geometrically, the problem is analogous to the following problem: Is the local topology at an isolated singular point of a minimal hypersurface necessarily different from that of a disc? For example, the affirmative answer for spherical Bernstein problem when n = 3 is equivalent to the fact that the local topology at an isolated singular point of any minimal hypersurface in an arbitrary Riemannian 4-manifold must be different from that of a disc.
