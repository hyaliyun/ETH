The calendars of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada (ELCIC) are from the 1978 Lutheran Book of Worship and the calendar of Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS) and the Lutheran Church - Canada use the Lutheran Book of Worship and the 1982 Lutheran Worship. Elements unique to the ELCA have been updated from the Lutheran Book of Worship to reflect changes resulting from the publication of Evangelical Lutheran Worship in 2006. The elements of the calendar unique to the LCMS have also been updated from Lutheran Worship and the Lutheran Book of Worship to reflect the 2006 publication of the Lutheran Service Book. The basic element to the calendar is Sunday, which is a festival of Jesus‚Äô resurrection. However, Christian Churches have historically observed other festivals which commemorate events in the life of Jesus or of significant individuals in the history of the Church. The purpose of the liturgical calendar is to guide commemorations as a part of the daily worship of the Lutheran Church. There is some variation associated with the observance of the calendar, as each Lutheran Church creates its own calendar and each congregation must choose independently how many individuals will be commemorated within a given year and how many festivals and lesser festivals they will publicly celebrate, especially if they do not coincide with a Sunday. Structure Lutheran church year and the temperate seasons of the Earth's Northern Hemisphere. The Lutheran calendar operates on two different cycles: the Temporal Cycle and the Sanctoral Cycle. The Temporal Cycle pivots on the festivals of Christmas and Easter. All Sundays, Seasons, and Festivals are related to these festivals.Phillip Pfatteicher, Festivals and Commemorations, p. 11. Because Easter varies in date each year based on the vernal equinox and the phases of the moon, it is called a moveable feast (see: Computus). Dates affected by placement of Easter include Ash Wednesday and the start of Lent, the start of Easter itself, Pentecost, and Holy Trinity.Phillip Pfatteicher, Lutheran Book of Worship: Manual on the Liturgy, p. 22. Advent, the other pivotal season on the calendar, comes exactly four Sundays before the start of Christmas (if Christmas falls on a Sunday, that day does not count), or the Sunday closest to St. Andrew's Day (November 30). Like the other Western Church calendars, the first Sunday of Advent is also the first day of the liturgical year.Pfatteicher, Lutheran Book of Worship: Manual on the Liturgy, p. 22. The Sanctoral Cycle is the fixed daily commemorations of individuals and events not related to the Temporal Cycle of Sundays, Festivals, and Seasons.Pfatteicher, Festivals and Commemorations, p. 11. It is the Sanctoral Cycle which is sometimes thought of as being the ‚ÄúCalendar of Saints‚Äù of a Church. Beyond their place in the Temporal or Sanctoral Cycles, the events commemorated on the Lutheran liturgical calendar fall into one of three different categories depending upon their liturgical priority: Festivals, Lesser Festivals, and Commemorations. Festivals The Festivals are Nativity, Epiphany, the Baptism of our Lord, the Transfiguration, the Annunciation, Palm Sunday, Easter, the Ascension, Pentecost, Holy Trinity, All Saints, and Christ the King.Evangelical Lutheran Worship, p. 3 and Lutheran Service Book, p. xi Most of these festivals are tied to the moveable feast of Easter. Festivals take precedence over all other days, including Sundays, have their own collects and Eucharistic proper prefaces. Of the festivals, Christmas is considered to be twelve days in length (from December 25 until January 5) and Easter is fifty days in length (from Easter Sunday up to and inclusive of Pentecost).Phillip Pfatteicher, Commentary on the Lutheran Book of Worship, p. 498. For Easter, Sundays are considered to be another part of the festival. For the Ascension which, falling on fortieth day of Easter, will always be on a Thursday, the festival is sometimes transferred to the Seventh Sunday of Easter in addition to or in place of the normal part of the Easter festival for that day.Evangelical Lutheran Worship, p. 23. There is another type of day which, while not a festival, is considered to be equal with a festival. These days, called Days of Special Devotion, are Ash Wednesday and all the days of Holy Week, especially Good Friday.Pfatteicher, Commentary on the Lutheran Book of Worship, p. 498. These particular days, like other festivals, automatically take precedence over any event on the calendar and sometimes even over other festivals. A good example of this would be in 2005 when Good Friday and the Annunciation fell on the same day (March 25). The Annunciation was transferred to March 28, or the second day of Easter, to make room for Good Friday.Philip Pfatteicher, Festivals and Commemorations, 132. The principle of the Church of Sweden is that the Annunciation is celebrated on the Sunday between 21‚Äì27 March; although, should Good Friday or any other day of Holy Week, or Easter Sunday or Monday respectively, fall on 25 March, Annunciation is moved to the Sunday before Palm Sunday. (For instance, in 2003 Annunciation was celebrated on 13 March; 2008 (when Easter Sunday was 23 March) it was celebrated on the 9th.) One unique feature of the ELCA calendar is that it has given congregations the options of two dates for the Transfiguration. Following most other Western Churches, the ELCA moved the Transfiguration from its August 6 date to the Last Sunday after Epiphany (the Sunday immediately preceding Ash Wednesday) as an option to the traditional Last Sunday after Epiphany in an effort to encourage a wider observance of the Transfiguration within congregations. However, the traditional date of August 6 was left on the calendar. Congregations were given the option of observing Transfiguration on the Last Sunday after the Epiphany and August 6, thus leaving open the possibility that the Transfiguration could be commemorated twice within a calendar year.Philip Pfatteicher, Festivals and Commemorations, 133 In Sweden, Transfiguration Day is celebrated on the seventh Sunday after Trinity Sunday, which is the eighth Sunday after Pentecost. Lesser Festivals The altar book editions of the Lutheran Book of Worship (green) and Evangelical Lutheran Worship These are days which are associated with the life of Christ or the Apostles and deserve attention in their own right. Lesser Festivals do not have priority over festivals and technically do not have precedence over ordinary Sundays. However, the Lutheran Book of Worship does permit the celebration of a Lesser Festival on Sundays where the normal color of the day would be green (that is, seasons after Epiphany or after Pentecost) or on the Sundays in Christmas.Pffatteicher, Lutheran Book of Worship: Minister‚Äôs Desk Edition, 21. This is abrogated for patronal festivals (that is, the day commemorating the saint or event for which a congregation is named) provided that they do not take place in Lent, Advent, or Easter, in which case they must also be transferred to the next convenient weekday. Most Lesser Festivals have their own collects and a few, such as All Saints, have their own proper. Commemorations Commemorations are for individuals or events which have been noteworthy in the life of the Church and in the history of Lutheranism in particular.Pfatteicher, Commentary on the Lutheran Book of Worship, p. 22. These days do not take precedence over any other festival day, and if there is a conflict between a commemoration and a festival of any other rank, the commemoration is generally transferred to the next open weekday. If a commemoration falls on a Sunday where the color of the day is green, the collect for which that individual or event belong to could be said before the daily collect/prayer of the day or in place of it. For example, if September 13 fell on a Sunday and there was a desire to commemorate St. John Chrysostom, the pastor would recite the common of theologians and then the prayer of the day or the common of theologians on its own. The person may also be mentioned by name in the prayers of the faithful in addition to recitation of the applicable collect. Finally, their lives might be summarized or their teachings related to the day's lessons in some way. In cases of conflict between commemorations (for example, November 11 with St. Martin of Tours and S√∏ren Kierkegaard), there is no order of precedence, and individual worship planners need to choose which commemoration, if any, to highlight. In some cases, several individuals are listed together (June 14 with St. Basil the Great, St. Gregory the Theologian, and St. Gregory of Nyssa) because of their close association with each other, and they are thus designed to be commemorated jointly, not as a choice between one or the other.Pfatteicher, Festivals and Commemorations, p. 20 The schedule of commemorations within the ELCA has been specifically designed so that there is at least one person on the calendar from each century so as to emphasize the continuity of Christian tradition.Pfatteicher, Festivals and Commemorations, 19. Clearly, some centuries have more commemorations than others, the largest number of persons commemorated being in the first four centuries of Christian history and immediately following the Reformation. This leaves the space from the 5th to the 15th centuries and the 16th to the 20th centuries rather sparse; nevertheless, it is an improvement over some calendars wherein only a very few persons, all from the patristic or Reformation periods, were commemorated.Phillip Pfatteicher, Commentary on the Lutheran Book of Worship, p. 22. ¬¢‚Ä†‚Ä° Liturgical colors A Lutheran pastor celebrating the Eucharist during the Easter season The service books of Lutheran Churches designate specific colors for events which are listed on the liturgical calendars and the seasons which are a part of the Temporal Cycle. This color is sometimes known as ‚Äúthe color of the day.‚Äù The Lutheran Church generally follows the color scheme which is used by other churches in Western Christianity since Lutheranism has historically been linked with the Roman Catholic Church. The color of the day dictates the color of the vestments for all ministers and the color of paraments. White is the color designated for Festivals of Christ, with gold sometimes offered as an alternative for the first days of Easter. Festivals for which white is the color of the day include: *Christmas (all twelve days) *Epiphany *The Baptism of our Lord (First Sunday after Epiphany) *Transfiguration (Last Sunday after Epiphany and/or August 6) *Easter (all days except Pentecost) *Holy Trinity *Christ the King White is also used as the color for anyone commemorated on the calendar who was not martyred and is the color appointed for funerals regardless of whatever the color of the day might otherwise be. Purple is commonly used for the season of Lent. It is also optional for use during Advent, though blue is the preferred color for this season because of its hopeful connotations rather than the penitential character implied by purple and its association with Lent. Red is used for the commemorations of martyrs and is used on the Day of Pentecost. Scarlet is also used for Holy Week, though purple is also allowed. Black (with purple as an alternative) may be used on Ash Wednesday. The only day which does not have a color is Good Friday, when all the paraments are traditionally removed from the church. The color for Holy Saturday is white or gold since it is the day when the Great Vigil of Easter is celebrated, though until the vigil, the church would remain void of paraments. Historical development Liturgical calendars began to be developed in Christianity around the fourth century, with the church calendar as it is known today coming into full development in the period of the medieval sacramentaries.Frank C. Senn, Christian Worship, p. 188. While Sunday had long been established in the weekly calendar, festivals such as Easter and Christmas were also a fixed part of the calendar by this time. The ninth century also saw the inclusion of numerous saints in the calendar (a practice already begun by the second century), even to the point that normal Sunday propers were taking place over those normally appointed for Sunday.Senn, Christian Worship, p. 162-163, 188. The Lutheran calendar owes much to the proliferation of commemorations of the medieval calendars of Western Christianity. Reformation era All of the Reformers attempted to reduce the number of individual commemorations and ‚Äúsaint‚Äôs days‚Äù, though this reduction was sometimes more drastic than others. In the case of the Lutheran churches, most of the saints' days were removed (with the exception of some New Testament personages), though the basic temporal cycle of the calendar remained more or less intact.Pfatteicher, Festivals and Commemorations, 11. In some instances, a celebration of the Reformation was added to October 31, the first instance being the church order prepared by Johannes Bugenhagen, though other churches selected alternative dates, including June 25, the anniversary of the presentation of the Augsburg Confession.Senn, Christian Worship, p. 344. The commemoration of the Reformation quickly died out before the Thirty Years War. In Germany The content of the liturgical calendar (like the content of the liturgy itself) was the responsibility of territory in which the church was found.Senn, Christian Worship, p. 342. Thus, there was a different order for Saxony, one for Prussia, one for Hesse, and one for Wittenberg, among others. Despite their differences, the calendars and liturgies maintained significant similarities between each other as well as the calendar of the Roman Catholic Church. The church year continued to begin with the First Sunday of Advent (which was still fixed based on the traditional formula), and many of the festivals surrounding Christmas (St. Stephen, St. John, the Holy Innocents) remained in place, even if they were often ignored. Epiphany also continued to be celebrated as the visit of the Magi, though Martin Luther preferred to commemorate the baptism of Christ.Senn, Christian Worship, p. 343. Brandenburg and Calenburg and G√∂ttingen retained Lent and the fasting days associated with the season. They also retained the violet or black vestments for the penitential season. However, popular devotions such as the blessing of palms or the imposition of ashes were suppressed in most church orders,Senn, Christian Worship, p. 346. despite the fact that a number of them had retained Ash Wednesday as the start of Lent. Good Friday, while kept with solemnity, was often a celebration of Holy Communion, thus less somber than the contemporary Roman Catholic Church. And while Easter had been a common day of communion in the church before the reformation, ‚Äúthe reformers tried to prevent too many communions on this day, and instead urged the faithful to receive it on various Sundays throughout the year.‚Äù The Reformation also saw the development of a new ‚Äúfestival‚Äù connected to Easter, where the second Sunday became popularly known as ‚ÄúGood Shepherd Sunday‚Äù based on the opening of the psalm appointed for the day, Misericordia domini or ‚ÄúGoodness of the Lord‚Äù. In addition, Corpus Christi was commonly retained until about 1600, owing to its significant popularity in the Medieval period. While many saints were removed from liturgical calendars by the reformers, some were nevertheless retained. St. Ansgar was commemorated in Halberstadt and Nordligen with a special thanksgiving service on the Sunday after 3 February, no doubt because of the saint‚Äôs historic connection to the area.Senn, Christian Worship, p. 345. The same was true of Elizabeth of Thuringia in the Schweinfurth Order, and St. George was also commemorated in Nordlingen. Festivals of the apostles and evangelists were also found on Lutheran calendars of the era, but were not always observed if they fell on a day other than Sunday. Some of the Marian festivals, notably the Nativity of Mary (September 8) and her Assumption (August 15) were retained by Luther whereas the feasts of her conception and presentation in the Temple were suppressed ‚Äúbecause they were judged to have no scriptural or dogmatic interest.‚Äù In Scandinavian countries Martin Luther, commemorated on February 18Evangelical Lutheran Worship. Minneapolis: Fortress Press (2006), 15. When the Lutheran Reformation was brought to Sweden from Germany via Denmark after the election of Gustav Vasa in 1523, the movement from the start had its own distinct characteristics. The development of Swedish liturgy was, in part, thanks to Olavus Petri, which is sometimes regarded as his most important work.Senn, Christian Worship, p. 404. His Swedish Mass, 1531 remained in use, with only slight modifications, until the twentieth century. The Swedish Mass draws from a number of different sources, though Luther‚Äôs Formulae Missae is apparent in regards to the Eucharistic structureSenn, Christian Worship, p. 407. This included revising the calendar along similar lines as those in Germany. Laurentius Petri further revised the Swedish Mass 1557. In large part, the Swedish liturgy retained ‚Äúvestments, altars and frontals, gold and silver chalices and patens‚Äù and many other ‚Äúpopish‚Äù customs.Senn, Christian Worship, p. 415. Following Laurentius‚Äô death in 1573, King John III embarked on a separate, though similar, religious policy more conciliatory towards Catholicism. Much of his work was in the area of liturgy and his Nova Ordinantia reinstated much of the sanctoral cycle from the Old Swedish Mass, reviving the feasts of St. Mary Magdalene, St. Lawrence, Corpus Christi, and the Assumption and Nativity of the Virgin Mary.Senn, Christian Worship, p. 419. Many of John‚Äôs reforms were controversial. Modern era The majority of calendars between the start of the Reformation and the 20th century were quite minimal in their commemorations. Most included events such as the Annunciation or persons such as Saint Paul, these days often went unobserved despite scrupulous attention to the temporal cycle. Even further, the commemoration of some biblical persons of note (including the Virgin Mary) were often omitted entirely.Pfatteicher, Festivals and Commemorations, 11-12. During the 20th century, especially at the instigation of the liturgical movement, familiar saints began make a reemergence onto the calendar, along with newer names and events. The calendar in Europe Many of the changes to the calendar that had accompanied the Reformation remained in place during the subsequent centuries. In Saxony in the eighteenth century, in addition to chief festivals of Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost, a number of festivals were also celebrated with Vespers and Holy Communion, including Saint Stephen, Saint John, the Circumcision, Epiphany, Purification of Mary, the Annunciation, the Ascension, Holy Trinity, Nativity of Saint John the Baptist, the Visitation (on July 2), and Saint Michael (on September 29).Senn, Christian Worship, p. 500. When Holy Communion was celebrated, a chasuble was used in the color of the day, though especially at Leipzig, these colors were different from the ones normally used today.Senn, Christian Worship, p. 500-501. In the twentieth century, Lutherans in Europe came under the influence of the Liturgical Movement and many Lutheran churches adopted new calendars and rubrics similar to the Roman Calendar as revised by Vatican II.Senn, Christian Worship, p. 657-658. The Swedish Church also experienced a similar reform of its liturgy and calendar during this same period. The calendar in North America When Lutherans came to North America, they brought with them their disparate liturgical traditions. The Pennsylvania Ministerium composed the first liturgy for North America, including its calendar along somewhat minimal lines. However, since the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the calendar within North American Lutheran churches has been expanding.Pfatteicher, Commentary on the Lutheran Book of Worship, p. 20. In 1868, four chief festivals in the Church Book were Christmas, New Year‚Äôs Day, Epiphany, and Reformation Day, with Easter and Pentecost being considered a separate category because they invariably fell on Sunday. The Church Book also included several minor festivals, including festivals for all the Apostles, and the Annunciation. The Common Service Book (1918) also expanded the calendar to help congregations determine which days took priority over others in cases of coincidence. It added to the calendar the Sundays of Advent, Transfiguration (last Sunday after Epiphany), Septuagesima, Sexagesima, Quinquagesima, Ash Wednesday, Sundays in Lent, all days in Holy Week, Ascension and the following Sunday, and Holy Trinity. It also included All Saints, and Saints Mark and Luke, both of which were omitted from the Church Book.Pfatteicher, Commentary on the Lutheran Book of Worship, p. 20-21. The Service Book and Hymnal (1941) also moved the Transfiguration to August 6 and added Holy Innocents to the calendar.Service Book and Hymnal, p. 278 The previous North American calendar of the ELCA was different from its European counterparts in that it does not give equal weight (and sometimes gives no mention) to persons who may be commemorated in Scandinavian regions. One example would be the absence of St. Lucia on December 13, although she enjoys particular popularity in Sweden. But Lutheran calendars also differ amongst one another in North America, with some individuals commemorated on multiple calendars but on different days (e.g., St. Bernard of Clairvaux on August 19 in the LCMS and August 20 in the ELCA) or individuals commemorated on one calendar and not the other (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. on January 15 for the ELCA and C. F. W. Walther on May 7 for the LCMS); with the 2006 publication of Evangelical Lutheran Worship (ELW) as a replacement to the Lutheran Book of Worship (LBW), some of these deficiencies in the ELCA calendar have been corrected. Within the ELCA, This Far by Faith and Libro de Liturgia y Cantico both prescribe calendars with additional commemorations specific to the ethnic communities they were intended to be used in (African Americans and Latinos respectively).ELCA Worship Resources Official Webpage The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod has a different, somewhat minimized calendar when compared the LCMS and especially the ELCA.The majority of WELS congregations utilize The Service Book and Hymnal or Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal, neither of which have extensive calendars of commemorations. The LCMS prayerbook, Lutheran Worship, is available through the official WELS publisher, Northwestern Publishing House, which would provide congregations utilizing that prayerbook a larger calendar to select from. Unlike the ELCA and the LCMS, the WELS does not maintain an official Sanctoral Cycle, but they do have congregational resources available for the full Temporal Cycle on their website. Differences from other calendars The Lutheran calendar is most similar to the calendar of The Episcopal Church and thus to the Anglican Calendar of Saints, though it also bears resemblance to the Roman Calendar of Saints because it commemorates many of the same individuals. However, the Lutheran calendar differs from both in two very significant ways, aside from its emphasis on commemorating persons important to the Lutheran tradition. First, the Lutheran calendar, while commemorating many of the same events or persons, often does so on different days from either calendar (St. Cyprian of Carthage on September 16 for Lutherans, but September 13 in the Episcopal Churchcf. Calendar of Saints (Episcopal Church); of note, Cyprian is commemorated on September 16 in the Roman Catholic Calendar.). In other cases (such as St. Valentine on February 14), individuals who have long standing within Western Christianity are not mentioned in the Lutheran calendar, or are only mentioned in the calendars of some Lutheran churches.cf. Calendar of Saints (Lutheran) where Valentine is commemorated by the LCMS but is not commemorated by the ELCA. Furthermore, some Lutheran calendars (such as that of the LCMS) still venerate individuals whose commemorations have been suppressed in other Western Churches. Finally, the Lutheran calendar commemorates persons or events (such as the presentation of the Augsburg Confession on June 25) which are not commemorated in any other Christian calendar because of their specific importance to the Lutheran Church. In general, like the Anglican counterpart, the Lutheran calendar has taken on many of the precedents established by the post-Vatican II reforms of the liturgy in the Roman Catholic Church. The other significant difference is that the Lutheran calendar commemorates a wider variety of individuals than does either of its counterparts. Included on the calendar are musicians and artists who are associated with the Church, but are not typically thought of as ‚Äúsaints‚Äù in the classical sense. The intent is to provide a wider venue for commemoration of outstanding individuals who have served the Church through their vocations rather than simply commemorating the outstanding among the religious.Pfatteicher, Festivals and Commemorations, 18 The calendar for the ELCA is similar to many other Western Calendars in that it does not commemorate any persons from the Old Testament. The calendars of the Orthodox Churches have Old Testament individuals, and the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod has done the same. At one point there was a proposal to include a day on the Episcopal Church calendar (which was taken into consideration by the Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship in developing the Lutheran Book of Worship) for Old Testament saints following the octave of All Saints (November 8), but this idea was ultimately rejected as tokenism. \\"Saints\\" in the liturgical calendar A.C. Article XXI.Augsburg Confession, Article 21, \\"Of the Worship of the Saints\\". trans. Kolb, R., Wengert, T., and Arand, C. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2000. There is also no use of the title \\"saint\\" for anyone other than biblical persons (and even then the title is used with a certain degree of exclusivity). This is to prevent oddities of convention (such as St. Nicolaus Copernicus)Pfatteicher, Commentary on the Lutheran Book of Worship, 22. as well as to underline the Lutheran emphasis on the priesthood of all believers. Nevertheless, individuals who typically have \\"saint\\" affixed to their given name are still referred to as such in common discourse (so that Francis of Assisi would still be called \\"St. Francis\\" rather than just \\"Francis\\"). In the New Testament, all Christians are referred to as saints. However, the use of \\"saint\\" as a title for an individual who had led a good and exemplary life or who had been martyred began to develop in Christianity. By the time of the Reformation, the use of \\"saint\\" was almost exclusively the restrictive, titular sense.Pfatteicher, Festivals and Commemorations, p. 12. One of the effects of the Reformation was to eliminate the abuses of the cult of saints, and as a result, it is a common misconception that Lutherans do not have (or rather, do not venerate) saints. However, the confessional documents of the Lutheran Church, particularly the Augsburg Confession, accept both the general and particular use of the word saints.Robert Kolb and James Schaffer, The Book of Concord: The Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, Augsburg Confession, Article XXI. In regards to the titular sense, the Augsburg Confession commends that \\"it should be taught among us that saints should be kept in remembrance so that our faith may be strengthened when we see what grace they received and how they were sustained in faith. Moreover, their good works are to be an example for us, each of us in his own calling.\\"Robert Kolb and James Schaffer, The Book of Concord: The Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, Augsburg Confession, Article XXI. Article XXI of The Apology to the Augsburg Confession goes further to describe three types of honor which are due to the saints and acknowledgment that the saints pray for the Church. However, the Augsburg Confession opposes prayer to saints, stating, \\"Scripture does not teach calling on the saints or pleading for help from them. For it sets before us Christ alone as mediator, atoning sacrifice, high priest, and intercessor.\\"Augsburg Confession Article XXI. Augsburg Confession, Article 21, \\"Of the Worship of the Saints\\". trans. Kolb, R., Wengert, T., and Arand, C. Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 2000.

History Originally known as Marr's Bluff during the American Revolution, the area west of the Great Pee Dee River eventually became known as Mars Bluff at some point before the American Civil War. Near the end of the American Civil War, the Mars Bluff Naval Yard was established, one of many inland Confederate naval yards. Nuclear bomb accident Historical marker and access sign On March 11, 1958 a U.S. Air Force B-47 Stratojet with a nuclear payload left for nuclear training exercises for war preparations in the United Kingdom and South Africa. The navigator mistakenly pulled the emergency release pin which resulted in the bomb falling out of the plane. Although the bomb was not armed with the trigger (a removable capsule of fissionable material which was securely stored in a containment area on board the plane), it nevertheless contained a high-explosive detonator. The resulting explosion created a crater estimated to be wide and 25-35 feet (7.6-10.7 m) deep. It destroyed a local playhouse, near the residence of Walter Gregg, and leveled nearby trees. Nobody was killed by the blast but several people in Gregg's family were injured. The site is located near US 301, but is difficult to access due to the site being on private property.

In a career that lasted from September 1931 until September 1932 he ran nine times and won three races. He failed to win or be placed in his first five races, but then showed sudden improvement in the spring of 1932, winning his next three races including The Derby. His subsequent career was adversely affected by injury and after one more unsuccessful race he was retired to stud, where he had little impact as a sire of winners. Background April the Fifth was a big, good-looking brown horse sired by Craig an Eran, the winner of the 1921 2000 Guineas and Eclipse Stakes, as well as the runner-up in that year's Epsom Derby, finishing second to Humorist by a neck. His grandsire Sunstar won the 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby in 1911 before becoming a successful stud; apart from Craig an Eran, notable offspring included the 1917 Epsom Oaks Sunny Jane. His dam, Sold Again had an unfashionable pedigree, proved useless in a career as a racehorse on the flat and was given away free to her trainer who sold her for 20 guineas. She was bought for 230 guineas by Sydney McGregor who raced her over hurdles without success before retiring her to stud. April the Fifth was bred by McGregor in partnership with Mr G.S.L. Whitelaw at the Lillington StudRoyal Leamington Spa Courier, 12 April 1940, p5 near Leamington Spa. He was foaled on 5 April, which was also the birthday of his breeder, McGregor. When the partnership of McGregor and Whitelaw was dissolved, April the Fifth was put up for auction as a yearling and bought for 200 guineas by McGregor, who was therefore both part-vendor and buyer in the transaction. He raced in the name of Tom Walls who trained him at his stables at Epsom Downs Racecourse. Although Walls had a keen interest in the sport he was much better known as a comic actor who was famous for his stage and film performances in the farces of Ben Travers. The ownership arrangement was that Walls was named as the official owner in return for meeting all the training expenses, with any prize money being equally divided between Walls and McGregor. Racing career 1931: two-year-old season April the Fifth raced three times in 1931 without success and failing to show any worthwhile form. On his racecourse debut he finished sixth in a minor race at Gatwick and then failed to reach the first ten in similarly unimportant events at Wolverhampton and Derby. Walls later admitted that his illness in 1931 prevented him from preparing the horse as he would have wished. 1932: three-year-old season April the Fifth showed some sign of improvement on his three-year-old debut as he finished a close fourth in a small handicap race at Birmingham Racecourse in March. Despite his modest achievements he was then sent to Newmarket for the 2000 Guineas on 27 April and finished sixth of the eleven runners behind Orwell, who had been the best British two-year-old of the previous season. The performance by the 50/1 outsider surprised many who had expected him to be completely outclassed. At his sixth attempt, April the Fifth was successful as he won a one-mile maiden race at Gatwick on 14 May. A week later he was moved up in distance to contest the inaugural running of the Lingfield Derby Trial over one and a half miles. In a strong field which included the Aga Khan's well-regarded colt Firdaussi, April The Fifth displayed form well in advance of anything he had previously shown to win comfortably by two lengths. The win saw him enter contention for the Derby, although some questioned whether Walls had the necessary experience and expertise to prepare a horse for the most important race of the year. In the build-up to the Derby, Walls made no secret of his belief in his colt: in a column for a Sunday newspaper three days before the race he informed his readers that \\"April the Fifth is not a joke...(he is) the best place bet in the race.\\" On 1 June, with a million spectators at Epsom Downs, April the Fifth started at odds of 100 to 6 (16.7/1) in a field of twenty-one runners with Orwell being made the 5/4 favourite, despite doubts concerning his stamina, ahead of the Newmarket Stakes winner Miracle. Ridden by Fred Lane, April the Fifth was restrained in the early stages before being produced with his challenge in the straight. Finishing strongly, he overtook the Aga Khan's colt Dastur inside the final furlong to win by three quarters of a length with Miracle a short head back in third. Firdaussi, the Aga Khan's other entry, finished fifth, while Orwell was ninth. The winning time was two minutes and 43 seconds. April the Fifth was a very popular winner and the first Epsom- trained horse to win the Derby since Amato in 1838. After the race, Walls joked that he would consider changing the horse's name from \\"April the Fifth\\" to \\"June the First\\". The form of the Derby was boosted later in the month when five of the beaten horses won races at the Royal Ascot meeting. Following his Derby win, April the Fifth was given a break from training before beginning his preparation for the St Leger at Doncaster. While staying at a stable in Sussex he sustained a knee injury which interrupted his schedule and prevented him from running in a trial race at Hurst Park. Attempts to restore his fitness with \\"considerable amounts of sea-bathing\\" were only partially successful. At Doncaster on 7 September he reached third place half a mile from the finish but faded in the straight and finished unplaced behind Firdaussi, a horse he had beaten comfortably in his two previous races. In this race Dastur completed the rare achievement of finishing second in all three legs of the British Triple Crown. Walls announced that April the Fifth would be kept in training with the Coronation Cup and the Ascot Gold Cup as his principal targets, but he never raced again and was retired to stud. Retirement April the Fifth spent twenty years at stud, but he was a poor sire of flat racers. He was however a useful sire of National Hunt horses and Sydney McGregor bred the 1958 Ascot Gold Cup winner Gladness from a mare by April the Fifth. His most successful offspring was the steeplechaser Red April, who earned ¬£12,900 for his owner Lord Stalbridge. He died in 1954.

Kasteel Cru Rose was also brewed in Alsace with a hint of elderflower & elderberry. Kasteel Cru Rose is a fine, crisp lager with a distinct rose-like colour and a clean, sparkling taste. Kasteel Cru is brewed at Brasserie la LicorneThe site of Karlsbrau, alsatian brewery (french).(en: the unicorn brewery) in Saverne, Alsace, France, using malted barley, hops and pure Alsace water from the Vosges mountains; alcohol volume of 5.2%, and is 129 calories. This light and zesty beer was first introduced in 2001. As Beer Advocate states, \\"One of the newest and most interesting styles of beer with much potential in the beer industry as a top-shelf crossover beer. Primarily brewed in Belgium, these beers typically undergo a lengthy maturation. Some are even cave-aged in France and are then subjected to remuage and d√©gorgement, which is the \\"methode de champenoise\\" process of removing yeast from the bottle. Most are delicate, high in alcohol, highly carbonated and sometimes spiced. Color can range from very pale to dark hues.\\" Kasteel Cru is the only beer in this style made entirely in France, even its bottle is produced by glass-moulders in Reims. Other beers in this style are mostly ale style (except one other) and all are packaged in 750ml glass, corked and caged bottles, Kasteel Cru is unique because it is a lager, and packaged in a thick 330ml (11.2 oz) bottle with a crown cap and punt. According to former US Brand Director, Scott Franklin, Kasteel Cru was discontinued in the US as of November 2009. Distribution in the UK was discontinued in 2012. Other beers in this style are: Deus, Malheur Brut Noir, Malheur Bi√®re Brut (Brut Reserve) and Malheur. The heavy carbonation in these delicate beers makes them extremely light tasting and refreshing.

Character and storylines  Ben arrives in Llanview, Pennsylvania, in 1999 with a tumultuous past and takes a job as a bartender at Crossroads. It is here that he meets Victoria \\"Viki\\" Lord Carpenter. The two become closer, and when Ben's past with the mob catches up with him and he is shot; Viki comes to his rescue. They marry on November 13, 2000. Ben has a long- standing feud with Asa Buchanan, whom he would later learn is his father. Asa has a heart attack during one of these confrontations and Ben is content to let him die, until Max Holden convinces him to save Asa's life. Eventually, after many battles, Asa learns to accept Ben as his son and they get along with one another. Ben's mother Renee Divine Buchanan is initially hurt by Ben's lies but becomes close to Ben. In 2002, Ben is pushed out of a second story window at Llanfair by Viki's alter ego, Niki Smith (Viki had been suffering from a recurrence of her dissociative identity disorder). Viki's daughter Natalie Buchanan is initially blamed for pushing him, until Ben's amnesia clears and he remembers that Niki had pushed him. He recovers from the fall; however, shortly after he is accidentally shot by Antonio Vega, who is trying to save Viki from Allison Perkins (who had kidnapped her). The incident leaves Ben comatose.

Though reluctant at first, Viki accepts Ben's heart and brother-in-law Dr. Larry Wolek performs her surgery. In July 2008, Viki is involved in a car accident with Dorian Lord and dies; she visits Heaven, where she is reunited with deceased loved ones, including Ben. After Ben advises Viki to give love another chance and forgive Charlie Banks, Viki decides to return to her loved ones.

It is at least 6.38 times the mass of Jupiter and is likely to be a gas giant. As typical for long-period planets discovered around other stars, it has an orbital eccentricity greater than that of Jupiter. The discoverers estimate its effective temperature as 264 K from solar heating, but it could be at least 10-20 K warmer because of internal heating. Preliminary astrometric measurements suggested that the orbital inclination is 170.3¬∞, yielding an object mass of 38 times that of Jupiter, which would make it a brown dwarf. However, subsequent analysis indicates that the precision of the measurements used to derive the astrometric orbit is insufficient to constrain the parameters, so the true inclination and mass remain unknown. A more plausible suggestion is that this planet shares its star's inclination, of 69¬∞.

She was born in New Brighton and raised in Liverpool, England, and graduated in Psychology from UCL in 1968. She began her career as a prison psychologist, and in 1975 she completed her PhD, working at Wormwood Scrubs prison in West London. Building on her PhD research, she commenced work in the late 1970s at the Home Office Research Unit where she stayed for over thirty years, dedicating the last twenty to research and development in the policing and crime prevention fields. She founded the Home Office Police Research Group, and edited its publications on policing and crime prevention for seven years. Alongside working in Britain, she has been a consultant on policing and crime prevention in North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, South Africa, the UAE and Europe. She was an advisor to HEUNI, a UN affiliated crime prevention organisation based in Helsinki from 2001 until 2012. In 1999 she was awarded an International Fellowship by the United States National Institute of Justice in Washington DC, followed by a four-month consultancy at the Australian Institute of Criminology in Canberra. She returned to the UK to become the founding director of the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science in 2001. The institute engages a wide range of sciences and design experts in cross-disciplinary work in collaboration with police and industry to find new ways to reduce crime. Professor Laycock‚Äôs contributions cover a wide range of policing and crime prevention topics, including the development of a research programme on repeat crime victimisation. The prevention of repeat victimisation became an important indicator of policing performance and effectiveness in the United Kingdom. In 2010 she left UCL on special leave and was appointed to improve policing in the United Arab Emirates. In 2013 she returned to UCL where she is now the Jill Dando Professor of Crime Science.

It is sometimes abbreviated to AXR, or KUB (for kidneys, ureters, and urinary bladder). Indications In children, abdominal x-ray is indicated in the acute setting: *Suspected bowel obstruction or gastrointestinal perforation; Abdominal x-ray will demonstrate most cases of bowel obstruction, by showing dilated bowel loops. *Foreign body in the alimentary tract; can be identified if it is radiodense. *Suspected abdominal mass *In suspected intussusception, an abdominal x-ray does not exclude intussusception but is useful in the differential diagnosis to exclude perforation or obstruction. Yet, CT scan is the best alternative for diagnosing intra-abdominal injury. Computed tomography provides an overall better surgical strategy planning, and possibly less unnecessary laparotomies. Abdominal x-ray is therefore not recommended for adults with acute abdominal pain presenting in the emergency department. Projections The standard abdominal X-ray protocol is usually a single anteroposterior projection in supine position. Special projections include a PA prone, lateral decubitus, upright AP, and lateral cross-table (with the patient supine). A minimal acute obstructive series (for the purpose of ruling out small bowel obstruction) includes two views: typically, a supine view and an upright view (which are sufficient to detect air-fluid levels), although a lateral decubitus could be substituted for the upright. Coverage on the x-ray should include from the top of the Liver (or diaphragm) to the pubic symphysis. The abdominal organs included on the xray are the liver, spleen, stomach, intestines, pancreas, kidneys, and bladder. KUB Constipation in a young child as seen by KUB X-ray. Circles represent areas of fecal matter (stool is opaque white (not to be confused with white opaque skeletal mass and muscle mass) surrounded by black bowel gas KUB stands for Kidneys, Ureters, and Bladder. The KUB projection does not necessarily include the diaphragm. The projection includes the entire urinary system, from the pubic symphysis to the superior aspects of the kidneys. The anteroposterior (AP) abdomen projection, in contrast, includes both halves of the diaphragm. If the patient is large, more than one film loaded in the Bucky in a \\"landscape\\" direction may be used for each projection. This is done to ensure that the majority of bowel can be reviewed. A KUB is a plain frontal supine radiograph of the abdomen. It is often supplemented by an upright PA view of the chest (to rule out air under the diaphragm or thoracic etiologies presenting as abdominal complaints) and a standing view of the abdomen (to differentiate obstruction from ileus by examining gastrointestinal air/water levels). Despite its name, a KUB is not typically used to investigate pathology of the kidneys, ureters, or bladder, since these structures are difficult to assess (for example, the kidneys may not be visible due to overlying bowel gas.) In order to assess these structures radiographically, a technique called an intravenous pyelogram was historically utilized, and today at many institutions CT urography is the technique of choice.Paul Schmitz, MD, et al. Medscape. Kidneys, ureters, and bladder imaging: plain films of the abdomen. Updated 27 Aug 2015. KUB is typically used to investigate gastrointestinal conditions such as a bowel obstruction and gallstones, and can detect the presence of kidney stones. The KUB is often used to diagnose constipation as stool can be seen readily. The KUB is also used to assess positioning of indwelling devices such as ureteric stents and nasogastric tubes. KUB is also done as a scout film for other procedures such as barium enemas. Gastrointestinal series An upper gastrointestinal series is where a contrast medium, usually a radiocontrast agent such as barium sulfate barium salt mixed with water, is ingested or instilled into the gastrointestinal tract, and X-rays are used to create radiographs of the regions of interest.

It is an Aermotors type lookout tower. Construction of the tower began in 1936 under the auspices of the Civilian Conservation Corps. It is constructed of steel with a seven foot square 'cab' on the top where the lookout was posted with various equipment including an alidade device used to help locate the location of fire outbreaks. As constructed, the tower included 123 wooden steps to provide access to the cab Following a refurbishment of the tower, the wooden steps were replaced. Today, there are 133 steel steps. Originally there was a cabin or guard station, a latrine, and a garage built on the site. All but the tower have now been removed. The tower was manned during periods of high fire danger for approximately 40 years. During such times, a small team of fire fighters was stationed at the base of the tower to respond to fire reports as needed. Some peak times saw as many as four to five fires per day. One of these fires, one of the largest on record for the area, came within half a mile (800 meters) of the tower before it was stopped. The tower never endured a fire, though it has been struck by lightning. Manning of the tower ceased in the late 1970s as the need for the tower had been replaced by other technologies. The tower was one of eight located in the Hoosier National Forest, but is now the only tower remaining. It was added to the National Historic Lookout Register in October 1990, the first such tower in Indiana to be listed. The tower remains open to the public throughout the year as an observation tower.

(c. 1530 - 28 September 1597) was a Flemish painter, fresco painter, glass painter and sculptor of the late-Renaissance or Mannerist period. After training in Flanders, he travelled to Italy where he remained active in various cities for the remainder of his life. He was court painter to Cosimo I de Medici in Florence and worked as a fresco painter in Rome on the large decorative projects of pope Gregory XIII.Hendrick van den Broecke at the Netherlands Institute for Art HistoryBiography of Arrigo Fiammingo in Giovanni Baglione, Le vite de' pittori, scultori, architetti, ed intagliatori : dal Pontificato di Gregorio XIII. del 1572. fino a' tempi di Papa Urbano VIII. nel 1642, 1733, p. 73 Life Hendrick van den Broeck was born in Mechelen as the son of Hendrick van den Broeck, of whom it is not known whether he was an artist. His family also used the latinized name 'Paludanus'. The latinized name is based on the Latin translation ('palus') of the Dutch word 'broeck' which is part of the family and means a marsh or swamp land. His family members included artists who were active in Mechelen. He was a brother of the sculptor Willem van den Broecke and the painters Joris and Pieter. The painter Chrispijn van den Broeck was likely a relative.J. Duverger and M.J. Onghena, 'Enkele nieuwe gegevens betreffende beeldhouwer W. van den Broecke alias Paludanus (1530-1580', Gentsche bijdragen tot de kunstgeschiedenis 8 (1942), pp. 173‚Äì204 Saint Bernard of Siena preaching Hendrick was a pupil of Frans Floris. Frans Floris was one of the Romanist painters active in Antwerp. The Romanists were Netherlandish artists who had trained in Italy and upon their return painted in a style that assimilated these Italian influences into the Northern painting tradition.Ilja M. Veldman. \\"Romanism.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 26 September 2019 Around 1557 van den Broecke moved to Italy. Here he would remain for the remainder of his life working in many different cities. It has been speculated that his frequent moves from one city to the other were motivated by his financial difficulties. In the years 1557 and 1558 he was in Florence where he worked mainly as a glass painter on commissions for Duke Cosimo I de Medici and his court. The Flemish priest Adriaan de Witte who was chaplain of the guard of the Duke played a role in calling van den Broeck to the Ducal court. He principally worked on glass paintings. He was commissioned to paint four glass windows in the Sala degli Elementi (Room of the Elements} in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. Adriaan de Witte provided the iconographic program of the glass windows, which included allegories of Envy, Justice and Victory, with mottoes in Latin. The program was approved by the duke. The windows themselves were lost on an unknown date. Van den Broeck subsequently worked on glass paintings in the monastery complex of San Lorenzo. In the meantime many monuments and buildings had come under the supervision of Cosimo's court. In 1558 van den Broeck supplied painted windows for the choir and the sacristy of San Lorenzo and also the Biblioteca Laurenziana. He remained active at this location until the early 1560s and worked there alongside another Flemish painter referred to as Gualtieri di Giovanni Battista Fiammingo.G.J.J. van der Sman & Bouk Wierda, Wisselend succes - De loopbanen van Nederlandse en Vlaamse kunstenaars in Florence, 1450-1600, in: Netherlands yearbook for history of art , 63, pp. 170-239 While employed by the Ducal court the young Hendrick was involved in an incident. He was provided with a supply of precious glass by the court. He had used part of the glass for other purposes without official permission. He had been forced to do so out of necessity as the court was slow in paying him for his work. Van den Broeck's employment at the court was in peril when the court investigated the matter of the missing glass. Adriaan de Witte helped him sort out the matter with the court. Witnessed the Ragionamenti of Vasari, Adrian's plan was subsequently also implemented. Hendrick may have been accompanied in Florence and Rome by his brother Willem. The Last Judgement In Florence, he had the greatest trouble keeping his income and expenses in balance and providing for himself. He left for Rome where he worked for a few years. In 1561 he entered into a contract with the Opera of Orvieto Cathedral to provide decoration of the new altars in the nave. In 1565, he finally ruled out the possibility of creating the works himself on site. He suggested that his associate Niccol√≤ Circignani paint the frescoes of one of the chapels while he would paint the altarpiece in Rome, where he was then residing. In the end Circignani also painted the altarpiece onsite.dell‚Äô Opera del Duomo: Room V He was commissioned in 1561 by Ranuccio Farnese, abbot commendatory of Farfa Abbey to paint a Last Judgement.Gigliola Fragnito, FARNESE, Ranuccio, in: Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 45 (1995) Van den Broecke created a large canvas painting on the subject, which was influenced by Michelangelo's treatment of the same subject in the Sistine Chapel. This is particularly visible in the contorted bodies which are muscular and in an exalted state. The influence of the Venetian school is also visible in the nudes.Benedetto Coccia, I percorsi dell'aldil√† nel Lazio, Editrice Apes, 2007, p. 404 He worked for the first time in Perugia in 1562. Upon his return to Rome he searched for a new formula to get the attention of local patrons. He entered into a formal partnership with the painter Niccol√≤ Circignani to collaborate on commissions. Adoration of the Magi Duke Adriano Montemelini commissioned van den Broeck to paint the Adoration of the Magi (1564, now in the Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria) for his chapel in the Church of San Francesco al Prato in Perugia. This work was criticized by Giorgio Vasari. El Greco disagreed with Vasari's view and admired this work. In 1565 he returned to Perugia where he was commissioned by Francesco Bossi, the Papal Governor in 1564-5, to restore frescos in the Chapel or Capella dei Priori in the Palazzo dei Priori by Benedetto Bonfigli. He likely painted in the Chapel the fresco of the Crucifixion with Saints Francis and Herculanus in which he included on the lower right a figure of Francesco Bossi in prayer.Galleria Nazionale: Cappella dei Priori He received payment in 1565. In 1565 he registered in the Confraternita of the Santa Maria della Piet√† in Camposanto dei Teutonici, the national church of Germans and Flemish people in Rome. He was recorded in Napels in the years 1567 and 1568. Here he worked in the Catacombs of Saint Gaudiosus in 1567. In this city he painted the next year a Life of the Virgin in the Santi Severino e Sossio. He was registered in the Compagnia di Santa Barbara in Florence in 1572. He worked with Giorgio Vasari and 11 other artists on the decoration of the Sala Regia of the Vatican in Rome. He also worked on frescos in the Vatican Library.Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi, a fully digitized exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries, pp. 40-41 He worked under Cesare Nebbia to help decorate the Capella Sistina of Santa Maria Maggiore, as well as the better known Sistine Chapel in the Vatican complex, where he painted a Resurrection of Christ on thewall facing of the entrance, where previously there had been a painting by Domenico Ghirlandaio which had become damaged. This painting is located on the wall opposite Michelangelo's Last Judgment. Van den Broecke's commission for the Resurrection of Christ in the Sistine Chapel (1571-1572) is regarded by many as a lucky stroke for the artist as it gave him the opportunity to paint one of the most important scenes in the program of decorations of the Sistine Chapel. Venus Kissed by Cupid There are gaps in the surviving records on his activities, especially in the period 1575 to 1579. Possibly he was working in Florence during this period. In the cash books of the Brotherhood of Saint Barbara (Compagnia di Santa Barbara) in Florence an Arrigo fiamingo - without specifying surname or profession - was registered for five years, the last time in 1580. This does not necessarily contradicted by the fact that Hendrick received a commission for frescoes in Rome in 1579 and was also registered in the Brotherhood of the Flemish community there in December of that year. The next year he was admitted to the Accademia di San Luca and remained active in Rome and Umbria for many years. He was recorded in 1578 in Perugia where he obtained citizenship on 24 September 1579. During the period from 1580 to 1597 he made frescoes in the Cappella Sisitina in Santa Maria Maggiore (1587) and in the Vatican Library (1589). He was in 1588 in where he worked with his collaborator Johannes Wraghe II, another expatriate Fleming. He married Antonia Dunan, who was from Burgundy. He died in Rome. His date of death, 28 September 1597, is recorded in the records of the parish of Saint Roch in Rome. Work Hendrick van den Broeck was a prolific and multi-faceted artist who practised as a painter, fresco painter, glass painter and sculptor. He may have been forced by economic reasons to try his hand at various techniques. These financial difficulties likely also explain his frequent moves from one city to the other in Italy. He worked in a Mannerist style influenced by Michelangelo and the Venetian school.

Geography Neitersen is 4 miles southwest of Altenkirchen on the river Wied. The village divides in the districts Neiterschen, Nieder√∂lfen, Kahlhardt, Fladersbach and Neitersen. Neitersen is 700 feet above sealevel. History On 1 March 1262, Countess Mechthild, the widow of Count Henry III of Sayn, made an agreement with the Archbishop of Cologne, Conrad of Hochstaden. In this deed, several Dienstleute are listed, who were to attend to the countess's service for her lifetime. They included three people, namely Henriche, Gobelin and Gylise of Nithirshusen. The original is in the State Archives in Koblenz. This is the first known historical document in which Neitersen is mentioned. In the 18th century, ownership of the local forest changed from the Count of Sayn-Hachenburg, to the local residents in Neitersen. 1848, the famous mayor from Weyerbusch Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen founded the first school in Neitersen. The building still exists. In 1882, construction on the railway from Siershahn to Altenkirchen began. On 30 May 1884, passenger services were inaugurated and a railway station and post office were built in Neitersen. There is a report in German available how the name Neitersen got established. It is written by Wilhelm Hundhausen and can be checked here. Until 1908 there was a mine for iron ore in duty, its name was Emma. First powerline got established in November 1918 from the local mill into their neighbourhood. After 100 years of service the railway company stopped all passenger transportation in 1984.

Although a commercial disappointment, it stands as one of Ronstadt's most acclaimed albums. History Winter Light was Ronstadt's first solo album since Don't Cry Now not to be produced by Peter Asher; she elected to produce it herself, along with George Massenburg. The album marked Ronstadt's increased responsibilities and confidence behind the boards, this time achieving a multi-layered Enya-styled New Age-oriented sound, as in Anna McGarrigle's \\"Heartbeats Accelerating\\" ‚Äî the album's first hit single ‚Äî and Brian Wilson's \\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head on my Shoulder)\\". \\"Heartbeats Accelerating\\" featured a popular music video while another track, a remake of the classic 1960s R&B; hit, \\"Oh No Not My Baby\\", was a Top 30 Adult Contemporary hit for Linda in the spring of 1994. Other aspects of the album show Ronstadt paying tribute to great female vocalists of the 1960s, with a combination of rock n roll, oldies, and rock ballads. Three of the songs - \\"Anyone Who Had A Heart\\", \\"Oh No Not My Baby\\", and \\"I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself\\" - had been previously recorded by Dusty Springfield. Ronstadt selected classic compositions from various songwriters such as Burt Bacharach, Carole King, and Jimmy Webb, as well as from contemporary ones such as Tish Hinojosa. The album also showcased Ronstadt the singer-songwriter and music arranger, introducing her own composition, \\"Winter Light,\\" which was notably covered by Sarah Brightman on her 2001 album, Classics and Chlo√´ Agnew for her Walking In The Air album. The title track was also prominently used in the 1993 film The Secret Garden, but was not featured on the film's original soundtrack release. Critical reception Winter Light is considered to be one of Ronstadt's best and most underrated recordings. Rolling Stone rated the album '4' (out of a possible '5') stars. However, it was a commercial failure for Ronstadt and peaked at a disappointing #92 on the Billboard album chart. The disc had modest sales, moving 248,410 copies in the United States. In 2008, it became Ronstadt's first Elektra/Asylum release to be taken out of print (In 2009, several more classic Ronstadt albums were deleted from her catalog). Allmusic critic Jose Promis praised the album and wrote, \\"Winter Light could arguably be classified as Linda Ronstadt's best pop album of the 1990s... there is not a single dud on this impeccably produced album, which, in fact, gets better and better with each listening. This sadly overlooked album is nothing short of a shining gem, and an absolute must for fans of this amazing singer.\\" Track listing The original 1993 USA release as Elektra 61545-2 had the songs on the back of the tray card listed incorrectly. One can notice that there is no track number 8 listed. The listing order goes from track 7 to track 9. The glitch had gone unnoticed when it went into print. Although all the songs are listed there, it would give the impression that there are 12 tracks on the CD instead of eleven. The discrepancy would then be noticed when the CD was being played because the playback readout would truly show its 11 tracks.

The service was piloted in Lisbon in 2006 and was later extended to Porto and Castelo Branco.  History  MEO in its current form was founded in 2007 after the separation of PT Comunica√ß√µes and PT Multim√©dia (later ZON Multim√©dia). While PT Multim√©dia employed coaxial cables, after separation, MEO started making use of copper cables. The television service supplied by MEO within the copper cable network is served on the ADSL line. Telecomunica√ß√µes M√≥veis Nacionais (TMN), Portugal's first and largest mobile network operator, was later integrated into the MEO brand in 2014 after two of TMN's shareholders, Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP) and Marconi Comunica√ß√µes Internacionais (the Portuguese operations of the UK-based Marconi Company) were acquired by Portugal Telecom in 1994 and 2002 respectively. The commercial launch of the ADSL2+ service took place in June 2007. The satellite service began in April 2008, using the Hispasat satellite, soon followed by the FTTH service. The ADSL2+ and FTTH offers reached across Portugal and included broadband Internet services (at up to 400Mbit/s) as well as a telephone service. In May 2009, PT Comunica√ß√µes announced, after Terrestrial Digital Television (TDT) transmissions had started, that the triple play service was also available with fiber optic speeds can achieve 400 Mbit/s. Another service relies on TDT, MEO TDT, which is included in the 3G plates service that is captured through the mobile internet signals from TDT. This service included one High Definition (HD) channel and the five main Portuguese channels: RTP1, RTP2, SIC, TVI e ARTV. MEO TDT service also allows some of the advantages found on the ADSL and Fiber Optic service (pause, record...). In July 2010, Portugal Telecom informed that MEO had surpassed 700 thousand clients. In November 2011, MEO achieved one million subscriptions. In January 2014, MEO and TMN became a single brand, MEO Servi√ßos de Comunica√ß√µes e Multim√©dia S.A.. In 2013, MEO launched a quadruple play service called M4O that in addition to the functionalities already referred has added the mobile phone, in a converged strategic logic. In July 2014, MEO launched a bundle which also includes the offering of mobile internet, called M5O. Chronology  1991 *Created on 22 March to take on the only existing mobile service in Portugal, based on an analogue network launched in 1989 by TLP (Lisbon and Oporto's phone service) and CTT (Portuguese Postal Service/national phone service), both State companies. The network prefix was 0676. *In December, Marconi (Portuguese international phone service, also a State company) bought into the company; ownership became equally split among the three partners. 1992 * In March, regulatory agency ICP-Instituto das Comunica√ß√µes de Portugal (Communications Institute of Portugal) announced the winners of the public bids for two licenses for mobile services through GSM. One winner was TMN; the second winner was a private consortium formed for the bid, called Telecel (later bought by Vodafone). * In May, the first GSM call was placed. Prefix was 0936. * On 8 October the GSM service was commercially launched. 1993 * In May, the first roaming call was made. * In October, TMN launched the voice mail service for free to all customers. 1994 * TMN was incorporated into Portugal Telecom, the State-run telecom born from the merger of TLP, Marconi and Telecom Portugal (spin-off from CTT). 1995 * Inauguration, in February, of the digital network in the Madeira island. * In September, launch of MIMO, the world's first prepaid mobile service. 1996 * In April, a new logo was presented. *In June, launch of SPOT, a prepaid tariff for younger customers. * In July, inauguration of the digital network in the Azores. 1998 *In April, TMN was the first Portuguese operator to adopt billing by the second as imposed by law. *TMN reached one million customers. *In September, third GSM competitor was launched: Optimus (now NOS). 1999 * TMN reached two million customers. It got its second million customers in just one year, as opposed to nine years for the first million. *ICP granted to TMN a license for Fixed phone services, with prefix 1096. TMN would only offer this service to its corporate customers, backed on its parent company's landline network. 2000 * Prefix of TMN was changed to 96 as part of an overall restructuring of the national numbering system. 2003 * In June, TMN launched a mobile portal, i9 (pronounced innov), on the trail of Vodafone live!, launched in November 2005. 2005 * On 28 September TMN introduced a new logo, shown above. 2014 * In January it was reported that Portugal Telecom will discontinue TMN brand and merge it with Meo. 2017 * From 31 October the carrier name on the iPhone changed to altice MEO  Marketing  The communication campaign invested in a strong advertising effort, protagonized by Portuguese humoristic characters, the Gato Fedorento.  Service  MEO's technology transmits over fiber optic and ADSL‚Äîeither television (IPTV), telephone (VOIP) and internet. MEO ADSL integrates a router with a switch, connected to the telephone plug to decode and distribute the signal, and another for the television called MEOBox. The two MEOBox models are built by Motorola and Scientific Atlanta, with a processor, optional hard drive, HDMI slot, two SCART slots, a digital sound slot and an Ethernet slot. The MEO Fiber Optic service uses an Optical Network Terminal, that decodes the fiber optic signal and passes it to the router.  Television  MEO offers television content transmission through four platforms: the ADSL network (IPTV), fiber optic (IPTV), satellite (DTH) and the 3G/4G network inherited from mobile communications carrier TMN, added to MEO in January 2014. MEO ADSL television service includes a basic slate of 120 TV channels. Subscribers can access more than 170 channels if purchasing the ‚ÄúMEO Total‚Äù bundle, which included HD channels.Pacotes MEO ADSL FTTH MEO offers bundles distinguished by the speed of data transmission. Just like MEO ADSL, the basic package includes 120 channels. With IPTV channels can be purchased through the MEObox remote control, unlike the satellite and coax services. Another advantage is its speed of 200 milliseconds. The IPTV network also enables the customer to play games in the MEOBox and to explore content from the internet and dozens of interactive apps. The programming schedule is available along with a ‚ÄúPIP‚Äù (Picture In Picture) showing other channels onscreen alongside the current selection. It is also possible to record and pause the show being live transmitted or even watching what was transmitted on the last 7 days (automatic recordings. In geographies where fiber-optic or ADSL networks are not available, MEO offers a television service by satellite. The anywhere MEO's TV solution is called MEO Go.  MEO VideoClube  MEO VideoClube is a video-on-demand service that offers a catalog of thousands of Portuguese and international programs (including movies, documentaries and concerts).

Net neutrality dispute Portuguese Internet service provider MEO offers to sell additional access to particular data services in this October 2017 advertisement. Many media sources republished this ad as a starting point for discussions about net neutrality. A MEO advertisement for data access was the focus of a discussion beginning in October 2017 in Portugal, the European Union and the United States and relating to net neutrality. MEO posted their advertisement for Internet services on their own website. On 26 October 2017, Democratic Party U.S. Representative Ro Khanna posted a screenshot of MEO's website to his Twitter feed while stating that their sales model was a violation of net neutrality and bad. Following Khanna's message, the technology community at Reddit discussed it on 27 October. Net neutrality advocate Cory Doctorow featured the ad as an illustration of a net neutrality violation on Boing Boing on 28 October. Quartz reported that the ad showed a net neutrality violation on 30 October. Tim Wu, the legal scholar who defined the term \\"net neutrality\\", commented on 30 October after reading the Quartz article that the ad did show a violation of net neutrality. From this point the discussion was far ranging. By 22 November, MEO published a response to the attention. Responses Many media sources reported that the sales model which the image described was a bad thing for being a violation of net neutrality.      Some other media sources reported that many people are misunderstanding the image.   To clarify, these sources reported that MEO's sales model is aligned with Portuguese and European law, and that law defines net neutrality in a way that permits MEO's sales model. In another clarification point, sources noted that the MEO ad is for services to mobile phones and not an additional fee to broadband service (cf. EU Regulation 2015/2120).

One night in a players' meeting, one customer who came from El Salvador told them about an Argentine movie showing in that country, Pelota de Trapo (Ball Rag).

Early life Jack Ag√ºeros was born September 2, 1934, in New York City, and grew up in East Harlem. His parents, Carmen Diaz and Joaquin Ag√ºeros, had immigrated separately from Puerto Rico to New York. Carmen worked for many years as a seamstress, while Joaquin was in the merchant marine and also worked in restaurants and factories.Espada, Mart√≠n. \\"Jack Ag√ºeros,\\" Ag√ºeros attended Public School 72 (now the Julia de Burgos Cultural Center) and then Benjamin Franklin High School, East Harlem's first public high school, from which he graduated in June 1952. After serving for four years in the United States Air Force as a guided missile instructor, he attended Brooklyn College on the G.I. Bill, intending to become an engineer. Inspired by Bernard Grebanier, a charismatic professor of English, and his lectures on Shakespeare, Ag√ºeros began writing plays and poems, and instead graduated with a B.A. in English literature and a minor in speech and theatre. Activism During the 1960s, Ag√ºeros worked with a variety of community groups in New York. Starting out at the Henry Street Settlement, he moved on to the Office of Economic Opportunity, a federal agency created by President Lyndon Johnson to fight the War on Poverty, before becoming the deputy director of the Puerto Rican Community Development Project (PRCDP),Kihss, Peter (1967-07-28). \\"Puerto Ricans Lay Inaction to Mayor; Puerto Ricans Accuse the Mayor Of Inaction on Their Proposals.\\" The New York Times. the nation's first Puerto Rican anti- poverty organization.Lee, Sonia and Diaz, Ande. \\"'I Was the One Percenter': Manny Diaz and the Beginnings of a Black-Puerto Rican Coalition.\\" Journal of American Ethnic History, Vol. 26, No. 3 (Spring 2007).

Ag√ºeros went on to be a member of the first cohort of National Urban Fellows, working as an advisor to the mayor of Cleveland and earning a M.A. in Urban Studies from Occidental College. He returned to New York and in 1970, became director of Mobilization For Youth, an organization located in the Lower East Side that provided job training and placement, social services, and special educational programming. Early writing Jack Ag√ºeros wrote his first poems and plays while still a student at Brooklyn College, receiving his first literary awards there. He continued to write while working as a community activist in the 1960s and early 1970s. Among the highlights from this period are the script for \\"They Can't Even Read Spanish,\\" a half-hour play about Puerto Rican life in New York that aired on WNBC TV Channel 4 on Saturday, May 8, 1971.Berg, Beatrice (1971-04-25). \\"This Bodega Sells Insight.\\" The New York Times. The script is now preserved at the Centro de Estudios Puertorrique√±os at Hunter College. Ag√ºeros also wrote a script for Sesame Street, \\"No Matter What Your Language\\".Interview with Carmen Dolores Hern√°ndez, Puerto Rican Voices in English: Interviews with Writers (Praeger, 1997) The song by that name first appeared on the show in its third season (1971‚Äì1972). In the song, which has since been featured in a number of episodes, a Spanish speaker teaches an English speaker that, if they take the time, anyone can learn a new language. Ag√ºeros was a member of the National Board for Bilingual Programming for Sesame Street, which received a portion of the show's budget to produce Spanish-language content, and was quoted at the time as being dissatisfied with the show's attempts at bilingualism.UPI (1971-04-26). \\"Dissension on 'Sesame Street'.\\" Palm Beach Post Ag√ºeros's essay \\"Halfway to Dick and Jane\\", about his childhood in East Harlem, was included in The Immigrant Experience: The Anguish of Becoming American, a collection published in 1971 by the Dial Press that also featured contributions from Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz and Mario Puzo. In his New York Times review of The Immigrant Experience, Gay Talese praised Ag√ºeros's contribution, writing \\"In this book is the first published work of Jack Agueros [sic], impressively describing Puerto Rican homelife in East Harlem.\\"Talese, Gay (1971-08-29). \\"The Immigrant Experience; The Anguish of Becoming American. Edited by Thomas C. Wheeler. 212 pp. New York: The Dial Press. $6.95.\\" The New York Times. Ag√ºeros maintained an active interest in theatre, reviewing several plays for the Village Voice.Ag√ºeros, Jack. \\"A moral Don Juan\\" (1973-01-04), \\"Oedipus in the ghetto? Never!\\" (1973-02-22), \\"In a very Ghetto way\\" (1973-04-19), \\"The taste of things Latin\\" (1973-07-05). Village Voice. (He has also written for El Diario-La Prensa, Soho News, and New York Newsday.) Two of Ag√ºeros's poems were included in one of the first anthologies of Puerto Rican literature, Borinquen, edited by Maria Teresa Babin and Stan Steiner, which was published by Knopf in December 1974. The two poems, \\"Canci√≥n del Tecato\\" and \\"El Apat√©tico\\", are both in Spanish and appear in the section \\"Where am I at? The Youth,\\" which also includes Pedro Pietri's well-known poem \\"Puerto Rican Obituary\\". Both poems had originally been published in a literary journal, The Rican (based in Chicago, Illinois) in 1971, and both were later included in Ag√ºeros's first book, Correspondence Between the Stonehaulers. Ag√ºeros also published two children's stories in Nuestro, the first national Latino magazine, which was launched in 1977. The first, \\"The Magic Maraca\\", appeared in English and in Spanish in the December 1977 issue and was illustrated by Ag√ºeros's one-time neighbour and friend, the artist Robert Zakanitch. The second, \\"Cheo Y Los Reyes Magos\\" (\\"Cheo and the Three Kings\\"), written in English, was included in the December 1978 issue. His children's story written around the same time, Kari & the Ice Cream Cone, was later turned into a play co-written with David Smith, and produced at Monroe Community College Theatre in Rochester, NY, and at Eastern Connecticut State University Theatre, Willimantic, CT, in 1988 and 1994 respectively. Cayman Gallery and El Museo Del Barrio On June 10, 1975, the Friends of Puerto Rico, a non-profit organization founded and incorporated in 1956, opened the Cayman Gallery in a SoHo loft at 381 West Broadway, with Jack Ag√ºeros as its first director. The Cayman Gallery was one of the first galleries dedicated to Puerto Rican and Latin American art in New York City. In July 1977, Ag√ºeros was appointed director of El Museo del Barrio by the Museo's Board of Trustees. That fall, he negotiated with Boys Harbor, a non- profit youth services agency, to relocate El Museo from its home on Third Avenue to its present location: the main floor of the Heckscher Building, a multi-tenant, city-owned property at 1230 Fifth Avenue, between 104th and 105th Streets. In January 1978, Ag√ºeros began El Museo's tradition of organizing a Three Kings Day Parade to celebrate the Epiphany. The Parade, held annually on January 6, includes live animals (including camels), school groups, and props and costumes, such as paper-mache figures of the Three Kings, made by artists. During his tenure, Ag√ºeros implemented a series of capital improvements and gallery expansions, and helped build El Museo's permanent collection. In 1979, he co-founded the annual Museum Mile Festival on Fifth Avenue with ten major institutions, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of the City of New York, and The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. He also articulated the evolution of El Museo to an institution with a pan-Latin American mission, telling an interviewer in 1978: \\"Our focus is no longer limited to Puerto Ricans. We are too culturally rich to force ourselves into ghettoes of narrow nationalism. El Museo now wants to embody the culture of all of Latin America. New York is the fourth or fifth largest Spanish speaking city in the world, with people from every Spanish speaking country, and El Museo must reflect everything that is Latino. We must look upon Latin America as our Indian ancestors did. They did not see artificial boundaries dividing nations. They saw an open world where they were free to travel from one place to another, pursuing their livelihood and mixing their culture.\\"Carlos Ort√≠z (1978-04). \\"The Arts: Museo de la Gente.\\" Nuestro. Ag√ºeros served as director of El Museo until March 14, 1986. Later writing After leaving the Museo, Ag√ºeros's poems and short stories began to appear more regularly in literary magazines. For example, his poem \\"Sonnet After Columbus II\\" appeared in The Portable Lower East Side (Volume Six, Number One) in 1989 and he was a regular contributor to Hanging Loose, a magazine published three times a year by Hanging Loose Press. Two of his sonnets, \\"For Maddog\\" and \\"For Willie Classen\\", appeared in Hanging Loose 55, while \\"Sonnet For The Bicycle Rider's Leg\\", \\"Sonnet: The History Of Puerto Rico\\", and \\"Sonnet For Alejandro Roman, Remarkable Rider\\" all appeared in issue 64. The poems for Maddog and for Willie Classen are typical of Ag√ºeros's use of a classical form to pay tribute to unusual poetic subjects: in the case of Maddog, a 19-year-old with (already) a long criminal record, and in the case of Classen, a boxer who died a few days after a fight at Madison Square Garden in November 1979. His poems also occasionally appeared in national magazines: for example, \\"Sonnet on the Location of Hell\\" was published in the April 1996 issue of the Progressive. In 1991, Ag√ºeros's first collection of poems, Correspondence Between Stonehaulers, was published by Hanging Loose Press. This was followed by Sonnets from the Puerto Rican (a play on Elizabeth Barrett Browning's famous Sonnets from the Portuguese) and Lord, Is This a Psalm?, which were also published by Hanging Loose in 1996 and 2002 respectively. In 1996, Curbstone Press published Ag√ºeros's Song of the Simple Truth: The Complete Poems of Julia de Burgos, the first book to collect all of the poems by the woman widely considered to be Puerto Rico's greatest poet and to present them in both Spanish and English. In his introduction to the book, Ag√ºeros recounts seeing de Burgos twice on the streets of East Harlem in the 1950s and having a hard time believing that she was Puerto Rico's most famous poet, as one of his friends told him. He then mostly forgot about her until years later, as an adjunct professor at Touro College teaching English as a second language and public speaking, \\"[o]ne day I asked if they [his students, mostly Puerto Rican women] had ever heard of Julia de Burgos and to my surprise nearly every student had. Moreover, they repeated the 'Puerto Rico's greatest poet' line. I decided to find some poems by Julia de Burgos and translate them into English for my students to recite. Ever since I have been in her custody.\\"Ag√ºeros, Jack. Song of the Simple Truth: The Complete Poems of Julia de Burgos (Curbstone Press, 1996) Dominoes and Other Stories from the Puerto Rican, a collection of short stories, was published by Curbstone Press in 1993. Later short stories appeared individually, including \\"i always wanted to be an old man\\" in Hanging Loose 72 (Hanging Loose Press) in 1998 and \\"He is Shorter...A Story\\" in Prosodia (published by the New College of California, San Francisco) in 1999. An autobiographical essay on Ag√ºeros's love of bread, \\"Beyond the Crust\\", appeared in Daily Fare: Essays from the Multicultural Experience, an anthology that appeared in 1993. \\"Johnny United\\", a story centered on a stickball game in East Harlem, was included in Growing Up Puerto Rican, another anthology published in 1997 that also featured contributions from Abraham Rodriguez, Piri Thomas, Edwin Torres, and Ed Vega among others. In parallel, Ag√ºeros wrote plays, several of which ran off Broadway. Awoke One was produced at the Ensemble Studio Theatre in 1992; The Sea of Chairs was produced by the Medicine Show Theatre Ensemble in 1993; and Love Thy Neighbor was produced at HERE Theatre in 1994. Dream Star Caf√© ran at Theater for the New City from January 31 to February 24, 2002. He also translated plays; for example, his English translation of Alberto Adellach's Sabina and Lucrecia was performed by the Puerto Rican Traveling Theatre in spring 1991.Bruckner, D. J. R. (1991-04-14). \\"The Games of Women Trapped in Madness.\\" The New York Times Awards and legacy In 1973, Ag√ºeros won a Council on Interracial Books for Children (CIBC) literary award in what was the CIBC's fifth annual contest. Founded in 1965, one of the CIBC's goals was to promote a literature for children that better reflects the realities of a multicultural society.Banfield, Beryle (Spring 1998). \\"Commitment to Change: The Council on Interracial Books for Children and the World of Children's Books.\\" African American Review, Vol. 31, No. 1.

References Category:Altenkirchen (district) ","title":"Obernau"},{"id":"11774498","text":"In mathematics, specifically in operator K-theory, the Baum-Connes conjecture suggests a link between the K-theory of the reduced C*-algebra of a group and the K-homology of the classifying space of proper actions of that group. The conjecture sets up a correspondence between different areas of mathematics, with the K-homology of the classifying space being related to geometry, differential operator theory, and homotopy theory, while the K-theory of the group's reduced C*-algebra is a purely analytical object. The conjecture, if true, would have some older famous conjectures as consequences. For instance, the surjectivity part implies the Kadison‚ÄìKaplansky conjecture for discrete torsion-free groups, and the injectivity is closely related to the Novikov conjecture. The conjecture is also closely related to index theory, as the assembly map \\\\mu is a sort of index, and it plays a major role in Alain Connes' noncommutative geometry program. The origins of the conjecture go back to Fredholm theory, the Atiyah‚ÄìSinger index theorem and the interplay of geometry with operator K-theory as expressed in the works of Brown, Douglas and Fillmore, among many other motivating subjects. Formulation Let Œì be a second countable locally compact group (for instance a countable discrete group). One can define a morphism : \\\\mu: RK^\\\\Gamma_*(\\\\underline{E\\\\Gamma}) \\\\to K_*(C^*_r(\\\\Gamma)), called the assembly map, from the equivariant K-homology with \\\\Gamma-compact supports of the classifying space of proper actions \\\\underline{E\\\\Gamma} to the K-theory of the reduced C*-algebra of Œì. The subscript index * can be 0 or 1. Paul Baum and Alain Connes introduced the following conjecture (1982) about this morphism: :Baum-Connes Conjecture. The assembly map \\\\mu is an isomorphism. As the left hand side tends to be more easily accessible than the right hand side, because there are hardly any general structure theorems of the C^*-algebra, one usually views the conjecture as an \\"explanation\\" of the right hand side. The original formulation of the conjecture was somewhat different, as the notion of equivariant K-homology was not yet common in 1982. In case \\\\Gamma is discrete and torsion-free, the left hand side reduces to the non-equivariant K-homology with compact supports of the ordinary classifying space B\\\\Gamma of \\\\Gamma. There is also more general form of the conjecture, known as Baum‚ÄìConnes conjecture with coefficients, where both sides have coefficients in the form of a C^*-algebra A on which \\\\Gamma acts by C^*-automorphisms. It says in KK- language that the assembly map : \\\\mu_{A,\\\\Gamma}: RKK^\\\\Gamma_*(\\\\underline{E\\\\Gamma},A) \\\\to K_*(A\\\\rtimes_\\\\lambda \\\\Gamma), is an isomorphism, containing the case without coefficients as the case A=\\\\C. However, counterexamples to the conjecture with coefficients were found in 2002 by Nigel Higson, Vincent Lafforgue and Georges Skandalis. However, the conjecture with coefficients remains an active area of research, since it is, not unlike the classical conjecture, often seen as a statement concerning particular groups or class of groups. Examples Let \\\\Gamma be the integers \\\\Z. Then the left hand side is the K-homology of B\\\\Z which is the circle. The C^*-algebra of the integers is by the commutative Gelfand‚ÄìNaimark transform, which reduces to the Fourier transform in this case, isomorphic to the algebra of continuous functions on the circle. So the right hand side is the topological K-theory of the circle. One can then show that the assembly map is KK-theoretic Poincar√© duality as defined by Gennadi Kasparov, which is an isomorphism. Results The conjecture without coefficients is still open, although the field has received great attention since 1982. The conjecture is proved for the following classes of groups: * Discrete subgroups of SO(n,1) and SU(n,1). * Groups with the Haagerup property, sometimes called a-T-menable groups. These are groups that admit an isometric action on an affine Hilbert space H which is proper in the sense that \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} g_n\\\\xi\\\\to\\\\infty for all \\\\xi\\\\in H and all sequences of group elements g_n with \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}g_n\\\\to\\\\infty. Examples of a-T-menable groups are amenable groups, Coxeter groups, groups acting properly on trees, and groups acting properly on simply connected CAT(0) cubical complexes. * Groups that admit a finite presentation with only one relation. * Discrete cocompact subgroups of real Lie groups of real rank 1. * Cocompact lattices in SL(3,\\\\R), SL(3,\\\\C) or SL(3,\\\\Q_p). It was a long-standing problem since the first days of the conjecture to expose a single infinite property T-group that satisfies it. However, such a group was given by V. Lafforgue in 1998 as he showed that cocompact lattices in SL(3,\\\\R) have the property of rapid decay and thus satisfy the conjecture. * Gromov hyperbolic groups and their subgroups. * Among non-discrete groups, the conjecture has been shown in 2003 by J. Chabert, S. Echterhoff and R. Nest for the vast class of all almost connected groups (i. e. groups having a cocompact connected component), and all groups of k-rational points of a linear algebraic group over a local field k of characteristic zero (e.g. k = \\\\Q_p). For the important subclass of real reductive groups, the conjecture had already been shown in 1987 by Antony Wassermann.MathSciNet bibliographic data Injectivity is known for a much larger class of groups thanks to the Dirac-dual-Dirac method. This goes back to ideas of Michael Atiyah and was developed in great generality by Gennadi Kasparov in 1987. Injectivity is known for the following classes: * Discrete subgroups of connected Lie groups or virtually connected Lie groups. * Discrete subgroups of p-adic groups. * Bolic groups (a certain generalization of hyperbolic groups). * Groups which admit an amenable action on some compact space. The simplest example of a group for which it is not known whether it satisfies the conjecture is SL_3(\\\\Z). References *. *. External links *On the Baum-Connes conjecture by Dmitry Matsnev.

Vega was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico to Jos√© Vega Serrano and Aida Esther Col√≥n Rivera. He studied in Santurce public schools, graduating from Central High School in 1964. That year he entered the University of Puerto Rico, where he completed undergraduate studies in social sciences. He subsequently began studies in philosophy, then left them to pursue a specialization in Hispanic studies. He completed a master's degree in art in 1975, with a thesis on the poetry of C√©sar Vallejo. In 1982, he completed a Ph.D. with the dissertation La poes√≠a de Oliverio Girondo: Vanguardia y tradici√≥n. Collections of Vega's poetry include: * Comienzo del canto (1969) * Signos vitales (1974) * Las natas de los p√°rpados (1976) * La naranja entera (1983) * Tiempo de bolero (1985) * Bajo los effectos de la poes√≠a (1986) * Solo de pasi√≥n/Teor√≠a del sue√±o (1996) In 2002, the Spanish publishing house Visor published an anthology of Vega's poetry entitled Letra viva. His book of poems, S√≠nsoras (2013) was published in Mexico by Seix Barral. Madrid's Estampa Gallery published Botella al mar (2013), an artist's book illustrated by Oscar Lagunas. In 2014, Vega published El arpa olvidada: Gu√≠a para la lectura de la poes√≠a (Pre-Textos, Spain), an essay on poetry that can be considered Vega's poetic creed. In 2016, the same Valencian publisher released M√∫sica de fondo, Vega's most recent collection. In the prologue to Letra viva, Julio Ortega considers Jos√© Luis Vega as the best poet in his country, the privileged product of the great poetic tradition that has made that island a term of the sums of Spain and America, between classical forms and worldly eloquence. The poetry of Jos√© Luis Vega has been translated into English, French, Portuguese, Romanian and Russian. He is also author of the collection of essays and poems, Techo a dos aguas (Plaza Mayor,1998), and of several literary studies among them C√©sar Vallejo in Trilce (1983), La visi√≥n tr√°gica en la poes√≠a de Pablo Neruda, essay that forms part of The Commemorative Edition of the work of the Chilean poet published by the Real Academia Espa√±ola (Royal Spanish Academy) and the Asociaci√≥n de Academias de la Lengua Espa√±ola (2010) (Association of Academies of the Spanish Language) and Coloquio de los centauros: Po√©tica the Rub√©n Dar√≠o, in Rub√©n Dar√≠o: del s√≠mbolo a la realidad, which also is part of another Commemorative Edition of the Real Academia Espa√±ola (2016). For his cultural achievements, Vega has been distinguished with the Order of Isabel the Catholic (Grade of Commander), with the Medal of the Foundation Ricardo Alegr√≠a and with the Order to the Educational and Cultural Merit Gabriela Mistral (Grade of Commander). He is a corresponding academic of the Real Academia Espa√±ola and the academies of the Spanish language of the United States, Dominican Republic and Bolivia. Jos√© Luis Vega's poems have been included in important anthologies of poetry in Spanish, among others Los 100 grandes poemas de Espa√±a y Am√©rica, compiled by Julio Ortega and published by the publisher Siglo XXI. His poetry has been translated into English, French, Portuguese, Romanian and Russian. On the poetry of Jos√© Luis Vega two books have been published: Tiempo de poes√≠a: La palabra de Jos√© Luis Vega, by Mar√≠a Teresa Bertelloni and La experiencia cu√°ntica en la poes√≠a de Jos√© Luis Vega, by Bruno Rosario Candelier. Jos√© Luis Vega is the current director of the Academia Puertorrique√±a de la Lengua Espa√±ola (Puerto Rican Academy of the Spanish Language), he has been a professor at the University of Puerto Rico, director of the Department of Hispanic Studies, dean of the Faculty of Humanities and director of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture.

It is located on a rise, directly north of Ludwigsburg Palace and connected via an avenue to it. Details of the front  History  Schloss Favorite was built from 1717 to 1723 for the sovereign Duke of W√ºrttemberg, Eberhard Ludwig, to a design by Donato Giuseppe Frisoni. The model was the Gartenpalais in Vienna. The original plan provided for combining the functions of a hunting castle, surrounded by a vast park and hunting grounds, and a country villa with a beautiful view. In 1748, it served as a backdrop for a grandiose firework display arranged on the occasion of the wedding of Charles Eugene, Duke of W√ºrttemberg and Princess Margravine Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. From 1806, King Frederick I of W√ºrttemberg converted the park into a m√©nagerie, containing wild boar, deer and chamois, and the house was used as a hunting lodge. At much the same time, the architect Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret renovated the building's interior in the neoclassical style. With the fall of the monarchy in the 20th century, the house was little used, neglected and fell into disrepair. It was restored from 1980 onward, and it opened to the public in 1983. The park has been transformed into a landscape garden, which has since served as an animal park. Today, the originally furnished castle rooms give an insight into courtly life. Modern use Schloss Favorite is state-owned, under the control of the State Castles and Parks of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. It is open to the public, included with a guided tour of the main palace. Starting in 1987, Schloss Favorite has been used for the filming of the weekly evening talk show \\"NACHTCAF√©\\" produced by the television and radio company SWR. In 2003, a two-part film ‚ÄúPride and Passion‚Äù (German: Das unbez√§hmbare Herz) was shot here, in which Bettina Zimmermann, Stefan J√ºrgens and Sonja Kirchberger played the main roles.

A Romantic nationalist and Freemason, he was an associate of the liberal faction in both Wallachia and Moldavia, as well as a collaborator of Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu, Ion C√¢mpineanu, MiticƒÉ Filipescu, and Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu. A tutor and later teacher at the Saint Sava School in Bucharest during the 1830s, he rose suspicions for his involvement in political conspiracies and was ultimately banned from Wallachia. Vaillant advocated the unification of the Danubian Principalities and other Romanian-inhabited areas, an ideal he notably expressed in his 1844 work La Roumanie. Credited with having publicized the Romanian cause in his native country during the 1850s, and with having introduced the modern references to \\"Romania\\" in international discourse, he briefly returned to Bucharest and was naturalized by the new Romanian state in 1864. The state of the Roma community was another one of Vaillant's interests, and the practice of Roma slavery led him to express support for abolitionist goals. Career Private tutor Stavropoleos Church in an 1868 watercolor by Amedeo Preziosi Vaillant arrived in Bucharest on November 4, 1829, being first employed as a French language tutor by the Great Ban George Iordachi, a member of the Filipescu family of boyars.Ursu, p.14 Joining a sizable community of French and other European expatriates,Giurescu, p.274; Iorga, La Monarchie de juillet... he was, according to historian Nicolae Iorga, \\"the only one [of them] whose literary activity was able serve the rapprochement between distant France and this Latin country on the Danube\\".Iorga, La Monarchie de juillet... He terminated his contract in spring of the following year, and decided to open of school for boys aged 12 to 15; the initiative was publicized by Heliade RƒÉdulescu's magazine Curierul Rom√¢nesc. Vaillant's school was located in buildings owned by Serdar Popa, in the vicinity of Stavropoleos Monastery.Djuvara, p.211; Ursu, p.14 Together with the similar activities of F√©lix Colson (who was tutoring young members of the VƒÉcƒÉrescu family), and those of the Moldavian- based Cu√©nim and the abb√© Lhomm√©,Djuvara, p.211 this brought an important step in the Westernization of Romanian society, while contributing to enforcing admiration for France among young boyars.Drace-Francis, p.105; Djuvara, p.211; Giurescu, p.274 It also signified a breaking point with education in Greek, which had been the norm before and during the Phanariote age (ever since the 17th century initiatives of Prince Matei Basarab).Djuvara, p.211-212 The memoirist Ion Ghica later noted that, among Vaillant's pupils, were scions of the Filipescu family, as well as those of the GrƒÉdi≈üteanus, BƒÉlƒÉceanus, Rosettis, Golescus and his own family (the Ghicas). Another of his pupils was the future radical politician and historian Nicolae BƒÉlcescu. Vaillant was also a teacher at a school for girls, which functioned without tuition.Drace- Francis, p.104; Iorga, La Monarchie de juillet... Saint Sava professor In 1832, he was appointed French-language teacher and head of the boarding house at the prestigious Saint Sava School,Drace-Francis, p.104; Iorga, La Monarchie de juillet...; Polet, p.953; Ursu, p.14 which he had been commissioned to modernize.Polet, p.953 This came upon the end of the Russo- Turkish War of 1828-1829, when Imperial Russian troops had taken over administration of Wallachia, without removing it from Ottoman tutelage. Vaillant was able to persuade the new authorities after authoring a poem in honor of Governor Pavel Kiselyov.Drace-Francis, p.104 The high standards he endorsed earned him even more popularity, as well as a salary worth twice that of local staff. Nevertheless, his contract was terminated in 1833 or 1834. The reason for this is unclear: some sources have attributed it to Vaillant's advocacy of nationalist tenets in front of his students, which reportedly rose suspicions from Russia, who was overseeing administration of the country under the Regulamentul Organic regime; others still indicate that he was involved in a conflict with Inspector Petrache Poenaru (in turn, this clash was attributed to Valliant's activities as Freemason or to him having continued to teach privately, thus competing with his state employers). Vaillant also published a concise textbook of Romanian language and grammar (1836), intended as a learning instrument for French people (Grammaire valaque √† l'usage des fran√ßais). It featured a glossary, as well as a historical overview and translations of poems (notably, Vasile C√¢rlova's Ruinurile T√¢rgovi≈ütii and Heliade RƒÉdulescu's Visul). In the preface to this work, Vaillant stressed the Latin origin of the Romanian language (in relation to other Romance languages), and, elaborating, argued that \\"Wallachian is nothing less than a dialect of the Roumannesque language, a name which in itself serves to indicate its descent\\". Conspiracies and return to Paris By the late 1830s, Jean Alexandre Vaillant became involved with the liberal trend in opposition to the Regulamentul Organic regime, engaging in conflict with Prince Alexandru II Ghica. As such, he first associated with Ion C√¢mpineanu, who stood out in the Wallachian Assembly in opposition to Ghica's policies.Iorga, La Monarchie de juillet...; Ursu, p.15 According to Iorga, he was also sympathetic to the cause of other Balkan peoples in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire (including the rebellious activities of Bulgarian activists in BrƒÉila and the plans devised by the former Prince of Serbia, Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá, who was residing in Bucharest at the time). By that time, he was a noted figure in Wallachian Freemasonry, which reportedly owed inspiration to a conspiratorial system first applied by the Filiki Eteria during the early stages of the Greek Independence War; other people involved in this subversive movement were, among others, C√¢mpineanu, Heliade RƒÉdulescu, MiticƒÉ Filipescu, Nicolae BƒÉlcescu, Eftimie Murgu.LƒÉzƒÉrescu After C√¢mpineanu was defeated, Vaillant rallied with a conspiracy formed around Filipescu; on November 18, 1840, as authorities clamped down on Filipescu's movement, he fled Bucharest, heading for the Moldavian capital of Ia≈üi.Ursu, p.15 According to Iorga, Vaillant's involvement with the revolutionary milieu, and especially with Filipescu and Heliade RƒÉdulescu, had made him the object of suspicion. It was in Ia≈üi that he became an associate of KogƒÉlniceanu, after taking an interest in Moldavian chronicles which the latter was reviewing and publishing; later, it was proposed that Vaillant's 1844 volume, La Roumanie, featured sections of text actually contributed by the Moldavian writer. On June 19, 1841, the Wallachian Assembly voted to expel him indefinitely from the country for his role in Filipescu's revolutionary attempt. Vaillant returned to Paris, where he continued publicizing his arguments in favor of Wallachian and Moldavian causes. On August 2, 1844, he spoke in front of the Soci√©t√© Orientale, of which he had been made a member, protesting against censorship imposed by Russia in the Danubian Principalities (he expanded on this perspective in La Roumanie). At the time, he became close to √âdouard Drouyn de Lhuys, President of the Soci√©t√© Orientale, whose support for the cause of ethnic Romanians he consequently enlisted. He also contacted the poet Alphonse de Lamartine, who, in 1846, became head of Societatea Studen≈£ilor Rom√¢ni (the Society of Romanian Students). Vaillant continued to publish various works by Romanian writers, this time in the Revue de l'Orient -- among its contributors were Vasile Alecsandri, Nicolae BƒÉlcescu, Cezar Bolliac, KogƒÉlniceanu, and Costache Negruzzi (the latter notably sent his novella Alexandru LƒÉpu≈üneanu). He would later publish a volume grouping several of Bolliac's works. Vaillant also welcomed Romanian students into any of three Parisian Lodges he had helped create: La Loge du Parfait Silence (\\"The Lodge of Perfect Silence\\"), La Loge de la Bonne Amiti√© (\\"The Lodge of Good Friendship\\"), and La Loge de l'Ath√©n√©e des √âtrangers (\\"The Lodge of the Atheneum of Foreigners\\"). Later activism and naturalization After 1848, when the Wallachian Revolution ended in occupation by Ottoman and Russian troops, and until the Crimean War, Vaillant continued to print pamphlets supporting the Romanian cause.Iorga, La R√©volution de 1848...; Ursu, p.15 As Russian troops retreated, to be replaced by a provisional Austrian administration, in turn superseded by a protectorate of powers (including the French Empire), he issued text supporting a Moldo-Wallachian union and emphasizing the two countries' autonomy in respect to the Porte. In 1857, he authored an appeal to Count Colonna-Walewski, the French Foreign Minister, in which he called for \\"France's sympathies\\" in respect to \\"the Moldo- Wallachians\\", based on \\"their magnificent past and the hope of their future\\". At the time, he made several references to Romania as la langue d'or (\\"the golden language\\"), a name notably featured in the title of a Romanian literature collection he printed in 1851. Vaillant also wrote pieces criticizing Moldavian separatists.Iorga, La R√©volution de 1848... The union he supported was accomplished in 1859, through the election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza as ruler of both countries. Three years later, Vaillant was back in Bucharest for a few months, giving free lectures on ancient history.Polet, p.953; Ursu, p.15 He was naturalized Romanian in 1864, at the same time as his compatriots and fellow pro-Romanian activists Paul Bataillard and Jean Henri Abdolonyme Ubicini. In addition, Domnitor Cuza awarded him a pension worth 4,000 French francs. Jean Alexandre Vaillant died in Paris 22 years later, and was buried with full honors at the expense of the Romanian Kingdom. The Romanian Legation, headed by its secretary George Bengescu, and other members of the Romanian community in the city accompanied the hearse. Bengescu spoke at the ceremony, referring to Vaillant as \\"a brother\\", he noted that he had been one of \\"the courageous and enthusiastic pioneers of the Romanian people's political and national regeneration\\". Views La Roumanie Front page of La Roumanie, 1844 Vaillant's 1844 La Roumanie (in its long version, the title was given as La Roumanie, ou Histoire, langue, litt√©rature, orogrphie, statistique des peuples de la langue d'or, Ardialiens, Vallaques et Moldaves, r√©sum√©s sur le nom de Romans) was notably reviewed by Nicolae Iorga in his 1918 essay on French-Romanian relations). He noted that Vaillant extended the scope of his researches into Romanian history out of Wallachia and Moldavia, and into Austrian-ruled Transylvania: \\"He preoccupied himself [...], for the first time, with the Romanians in Transylvania, [a region] which he named, taking in view the national [Romanian] term serving to designate this enslaved land, Ardeal (Ardial), whence Ardialiens (in Romanian: Ardeleni)\\". Iorga also concluded that Vaillant was among the first persons to use the terms \\"Romania\\" and \\"Romanian\\" in the modern sense, after they had been in circulation for some time as designations of Wallachia and its citizens (commonly known in Romanian as ≈¢ara Rom√¢neascƒÉ, the latter principality had, Iorga contended, come to adopt the term Rom√¢nia as self-reference by the time Vaillant was writing his essay). The names were subsequently adopted by Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu, Vasile Alecsandri and other Romanian revolutionaries. The French versions of the names \\"Romania\\" and \\"Romanians\\", in the form supported by Vaillant, were to be Romanie and roma[i]n, both alluding to Ancient Rome -- these were not received as neologisms, and the enduring names in became Roumanie and roumain, probably based on the Romanian folk references to rum√¢n. La Roumanie provided a detailed account of the region's history, highlighting Vaillant's arguments in various controversial aspects. It began with an account of Dacia and Roman Dacia, which detailed the impact of Romanization, as well as the eventual retreat of Imperial Roman administration to the south of the Danube under Aurelian by 270. Commenting at length on the origin of the Romanians, he stressed that the Roman colonists had stayed behind during the Migration Period. Arguing that these had come from a latifundia-dominated Italian Peninsula to Dacia \\"as if to an El Dorado\\", he elaborated that it was impossible for them to have forsaken their property and become nomads (as suggested by various other historians). Vaillant notably drew comparisons with the end of colonial rule over New France, as well as with Early Modern Romanian history (noting that, during the Russo-Turkish Wars and related incursions, while the boyars and other notabilities took refuge in various regions, \\"the proletarians did not follow suit\\"). Thus, he claimed, when Transylvania was taken over by the Hungarians in the 9th century, Romanians were the main presence in the area; he believed that the Hungarian-language name for Transylvania, Erd√©ly, was borrowed from Romanian, and had its origins in the Latin name Jupiter (see Historical names of Transylvania). Vaillant also supported the view that Walachia had been established by Romanian Transylvanians who wanted to preserve their Eastern Orthodox faith in front of Roman Catholic pressures stemming in the Kingdom of Hungary -- Iorga disagreed with this thesis, stressing his own (according to which Wallachia was created through the union of several local polities). Vaillant gave a summary of subsequent developments in Transylvanian history, making references to the Budai Nagy Antal Revolt, to the careers of John Hunyadi, his son Matthias Corvinus, and Nicolaus Olahus (viewing all three as Romanians, he erroneously argued that John was a native of Oltenia), and to the Transylvanian conquests of the Moldavian Prince Petru Rare≈ü (who, he believed, had been assigned the Transylvanian throne by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent). The account he gave of Michael the Brave's rule, during which Wallachia, Transylvania, and Moldavia were first gathered under one rule, was to inspire his pupil Nicolae BƒÉlcescu (who was to author an entire volume on this period, titled Rom√¢nii supt Mihai-Voievod Viteazul). He attributed Michael's expedition in Transylvania to him having \\"seen his brothers treated like serfs by the Magyar conquerors and the Saxon foreigners\\", and deplored his \\"cowardly assassination\\" on the orders of the Imperial general Giorgio Basta. He notably attributed the policy failures of Wallachian Prince Radu ≈ûerban to Imperial opposition, claiming that he could have otherwise reestablished Michael's domain. In reference to the 18th and early 19th centuries, Vaillant mentioned in passing the start of Habsburg rule in Transylvania, the Greek-Catholic conversions among Romanians in exchange for the unfulfilled promise of political rights, and the interest Moise NicoarƒÉ had taken in the French Revolution. Quoting George Bari≈£, a major figure of the Transylvanian School, he noted that most Transylvanians were Romanian (1.2 million, as opposed to the 900,000 members of all other ethnicities), and recounted his own dissemination of unification ideals among Transylvanian expatriates in Wallachia. Roma slaves in Bucharest In addition to these tenets, La Roumanie provided details on the history of Bucharest during the 1830s, including the number and type of wagons and carriages (70 hansom cabs, 1,775 phaetons and 7,502 wagons),Giurescu, p.282 and that of inns and hotels (he calculated that there were 20 of each).Giurescu, p.314 On Roma slavery Vaillant also authored a work on the history of the Romani people, to whom he referred as Romes or \\"the actual Boh√©miens\\".Iorga, La R√©volution de 1848...; Polet, p.953; Pons, passim Centered on the Roma community in Wallachia and Moldavia, the work was an investigation of slavery, to which Roma people were subjected in both lands. Making reference to the corv√©es required from peasants, Vaillant stressed: \\"if the peasant is a serf, the Gypsy is entirely a slave\\", while noting the prevalence of slavery among in Romanian society, the Orthodox Church included (\\"the state sells them, the private entrepreneurs buy them, and the monks also sit around with their palms exposed\\").Pons, p.16 He noted that the institution relied on Roma settlement, indicating that most members of the ethnic group had abandoned their semi-nomadic lifestyle, commenting that the remaining few \\"do not pay taxes, but neither are they worth more than the wolves in the forest to their country\\".Pons, p.15 Reflecting on the status of slaves involved in manual labor, he provided an indignant account of the way in which they were chained.Pons, p.18 Vaillant's abolitionist views were probably an influence on his students, and arguably contributed to the proclamation ending slavery that was issued during the Wallachian Revolution of 1848.Pons, p.21 Selected works *Grammaire valaque √† l'usage des fran√ßais (\\"Wallachian Grammar for French People\\"), 1836 *Grammaire roumaine (\\"Romanian Grammar\\"), 1840 *Vocabulaire roumain-fran√ßais et fran√ßais-roumain (\\"Romanian-French and French-Romanian Vocabulary\\"), 1840 *La Roumanie, ou Histoire, langue, litt√©rature, orographie, statistique des peuples de la langue d'or, Ardialiens, Vallaques et Moldaves, r√©sum√©s sur le nom de Romans (\\"Romania, or The History, Language, Literature, Orography, Statistics of the People with a Golden Language, Ardialians, Wallachians and Moldavians, Concisely Referred to as Romans\\"), 1844 *Les Romes, histoire vraie des vrais Boh√©miens (\\"The Rom, the Actual History of the Actual Bohemians\\"), 1857 Notes References *Neagu Djuvara, √éntre Orient ≈üi Occident. ≈¢ƒÉrile rom√¢ne la √Ænceputul epocii moderne, Humanitas, Bucharest, 1995. *Alex Drace- Francis, The Making of Modern Romanian Culture: Literacy and the Development of National Identity, I.B.

Instead he would wear a mask (like a Mexican Lucha Libre/Luchador wrestler) with a red nose, A golden brown wig, a red round hat and a red suit coat with golden flap. History In 1954 at the age of 14, Antonio Gaytan started working at XEJ-TV performing multiple tasks like working the door to the studio, operating cameras, accommodating the audiences, answering phone calls, etc. One day in 1973, Pedro Meneses Hoyos, owner and general director of XEJ 5 asked Antonio Gaytan to fill in right after clown Bim-Bon decided to quit the show at XEJ-TV. After struggling with his own limitations as he had not received any proper training as an entertainer, Niko Liko was born to delight hundreds of kids who would tune in from Monday through Friday, or visit the studio with the hope of getting a prize such as a cake a toy or tickets for the circus that was performing in town. At first, the show consisted of only thirty minutes with a brief introduction by Niko Liko for one minute followed by cartoons including The Real Ghostbusters and Once Upon a Time... Man until the end of the show where Niko Liko appeared again to wrap up. Later the show was expanded to 2 hour program which now included a talent showcase spotlight featuring youngsters from the El Paso-Las Cruces-Ciudad Juarez area.

Employee at Sure We Can redemption center - Bushwick, Brooklyn - holds a piece of upcycled plastic film Description Upcycling is the opposite of downcycling, which is the other part of the recycling process. Downcycling involves converting materials and products into new materials, sometimes of lesser quality. Most recycling involves converting or extracting useful materials from a product and creating a different product or material. The terms upcycling and downcycling were first used in print in an article in SalvoNEWS by Thornton Kay quoting Reiner Pilz and published in 1994.Thornton Kay, Salvo in Germany - Reiner Pilz, p14 SalvoNEWS No99 11 October 1994 Upsizing was the title of the German edition of a book about upcycling first published in English in 1998 by Gunter Pauli and given the revised title of Upcycling in 1999. The German edition was adapted to the German language and culture by Johannes F. Hartkemeyer, then Director of the Volkshochschule in Osnabr√ºck. The concept was later incorporated by William McDonough and Michael Braungart in their 2002 book Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things. They state that the goal of upcycling is to prevent wasting potentially useful materials by making use of existing ones. This reduces the consumption of new raw materials when creating new products. Reducing the use of new raw materials can result in a reduction of energy usage, air pollution, water pollution and even greenhouse gas emissions. This is a significant step towards regenerative design culture where the end products are cleaner, healthier, and usually have a better value than the material inputs. For example, during the recycling process of plastics other than those used to create bottles, many different types of plastics are mixed, resulting in a hybrid. This hybrid is used in the manufacturing of plastic lumber applications. However, unlike the engineered polymer ABS which hold properties of several plastics well, recycled plastics suffer phase-separation that causes structural weakness in the final product. In 2009, Belinda Smith from Reuters wrote that upcycling had increased in the rich countries but observed that upcycling was a necessity in poorer ones: > Supporters of the environmentally friendly practice of upcycling say people > in developing countries have effectively been upcycling for years, using old > packaging and clothing in new ways, although more out of need than for the > environment. But upcycling is now taking off in other countries, reflecting > an increased interest in eco-friendly products, particularly ones that are > priced at an affordable level and proving profitable for the manufacturers. > \\"If upcycling is going to become mainstream, then the corporate world needs > to see that it can be profitable,\\" said Albe Zakes, spokesman of U.S. > company TerraCycle which specializes in finding new uses for discarded > packaging. A growing number of companies are focusing on upcycling although > the trend is still in its infancy with industry-wide figures yet to be > produced. Upcycling has shown significant growth across the United States and the World. For example, the number of products on Etsy, Pinterest or Upcycle Studio tagged with the word \\"upcycled\\" increased from about 7,900 in January 2010 to nearly 30,000 a year later‚Äîan increase of 275%. , that number stood at 263,685, an additional increase of 879%. Material downcycling occurs when it is either not possible or uneconomic to restore materials to their original quality, for example, when wrought aluminium alloys are melted to produce lower-grade casting alloys. Material upcycling, in the thermodynamic sense, is only possible if even more energy is added to upgrade the material quality. Two guiding questions to ask when assessing recovering for waste materials or products are: How much energy is required to restore the recovered material back to the desired material or product?, and, How does this quantity compare with obtaining the desired material or product from virgin or primary sources? In some cases, little energy is required to reuse a discarded product, for example, secondhand clothing. In other cases, the energy required to recover the materials is more than the energy required to process virgin material. Applications  Art  Johann Dieter Wassmann (Jeff Wassmann), Vorwarts! (Go Forward!) , 1897 A toy from Southern Mount Hebron, on loan to Israel Museum from a private collection The tradition of reusing found objects (objet trouv√©) in mainstream art came of age sporadically through the 20th century, although it has long been a means of production in folk art. The Amish quilt, for example, came about through reapplication of salvaged fabric. Simon Rodia's Watts Towers (1921‚Äì1954) in Los Angeles exemplifies upcycling of scrap metal, pottery and broken glass on a grand scale; it consists of 17 structures, the tallest reaching over 30 meters into the Watts skyline. Intellectually, upcycling bears some resemblance to the ready-made art of Marcel Duchamp and the Dadaists. Duchamp's \\"Bicycle Wheel\\" (1913), a front wheel and fork attached to a common stool, is among the earliest of these works, while \\"Fountain\\" (1917), a common urinal purchased at a hardware store, is arguably his best-known work. Pablo Picasso's \\"Bull's Head\\" (1942), a sculpture made from a discarded bicycle saddle and handlebars, is the Spanish painter's sly nod to the Dadaists.Gibson, Eric, \\"A Magical Metamorphosis of the Ordinary\\", The Wall Street Journal, April 16, 2011. Throughout the mid- century, the artist Joseph Cornell fabricated collages and boxed assemblage works from old books, found objects and ephemera. Robert Rauschenberg collected trash and disused objects, first in Morocco and later on the streets of New York, to incorporate into his art works. The idea of consciously raising the inherent value of recycled objects as a political statement, however, rather than presenting recycled objects as a reflection or outcome from the means of production, is largely a late 20th-century concept. Romuald Hazoum√©, an artist from the West African B√©nin, was heralded in 2007 for his use of discarded plastic gasoline and fuel canisters to resemble traditional African masks at Documenta 12 in Kassel, Germany. Hazoum√© has said of these works, \\"I send back to the West that which belongs to them, that is to say, the refuse of consumer society that invades us every day.\\" Jeff Wassmann, an American artist who has lived in Australia for the past 25 years, uses items found on beaches and junk stores in his travels to create the early Modern works of a fictional German relative, Johann Dieter Wassmann (1841‚Äì1898). In Vorwarts (Go Forward) (pictured), Wassmann uses four simple objects to depict a vision of modern man on the precarious eave of the 20th century: an early optometry chart as background, a clock spring as eye, a 19th-century Chinese bone opium spoon from the Australian gold fields as nose and an upper set of dentures found on an Australian beach as mouth. Wassmann is unusual among artists in that he does not sell his work, rather they are presented as gifts; by not allowing these works to re-enter the consumer cycle, he averts the commodification of his end product.Crawford, Ashley, \\"Hoax Most Perfect\\", The Age, October 11, 2003. Max Zorn is a Dutch tape artist who creates artwork from ordinary brown packaging tape and hangs pieces on street lamps as a new form of street art at night. By adding and subtracting layers of tape on acrylic glass with a surgical scalpel, the artwork can only be visible when light is placed behind it, mimicking the effects similar to stained glass window methods. His technique with pioneering upcycling with street art has been featured at Frei-Cycle 2013, the first design fair for recycling and upcycling in Freiburg, Germany.  Music  A prominent example is the Recycled Orchestra of Cateura in Paraguay. The instruments of the orchestra are made from materials taken from the landfill of Asunci√≥n, whose name comes from the Cateura lagoon in the area. A limited part of its real history is narrated in the film Landfill Harmonic.  Industry  Many industrial processes, like plastic and electronic fabrication, rely on the consumption of finite resources.Martin, M. and Parsapour, A. 2012. \\"Upcycling wastes with biogas production: An exergy and economic analysis\\". Venice 2012: International Symposium on Energy from Biomass and Waste (2012).Zhuo, C. and Levendis, Y. A. 2014. \\"Upcycling waste plastics into carbon nanomaterials: A review\\". Journal of Applied Polymer Science. 131, 4 (2014) Furthermore, the waste may have an environmental impact and can affect human health. Within this context, upcycling describes the use of available and future technologies to reduce waste and resource consumption by creating a product with a higher value from waste or byproduct streams. In consumer electronics, the process of re-manufacturing or refurbishment of second-hand products can be seen as upcycling because of the reduced energy and material consumption in contrast to new manufacturing. The re-manufactured product has a higher value than disposing or downcycling it.Steinhilper, R. and Hieber, M. 2001. \\"Remanufacturing-the key solution for transforming downcycling into upcycling of electronics\\". Electronics and the Environment, 2001. Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE International Symposium on (2001), 161‚Äì166. The use of Brewer's spent grain, a waste product of brewing processes, as a substrate in biogas processes eliminates the need for disposal and can generate significant profit to the overall brewing process. Depending on the substrate's price, a profit of approximately 20% of the operational costs is possible. In this process, the biogas plant acts as an \\"upcycler\\".  Libraries  Roses made from upcycled library books. ScrapDC led upcycling classes at the District of Columbia Public Library, more specifically their Southeast Neighborhood Library. One of their more popular projects was turning old books into boxes. The Jerry Falwell Library at Liberty University holds an annual Creative Upcycling Contest for their students. The first contest had 44 submissions of ‚ÄúArt Made from Books‚Äù. These submissions were three-dimensional upcycles.  Clothes  Designers have begun to use both industrial textile waste and existing clothing as the base material for creating new fashions. Upcycling has been known to use either pre-consumer or post-consumer waste or possibly a combination of the two. Pre-consumer waste is made while in the factory, such as fabric remnants left over from cutting out patterns. Post-consumer waste refers to the finished product when it‚Äôs no longer useful to the owner, such as donated clothes. Often, people practice linear economy where they are content to buy, use, then throw away. This system contributes to millions of kilos of textile waste being thrown away and makes fashion is the second-most polluting industry after oil. While most textiles produced are recyclable, around 85% end-up in landÔ¨Ålls in the USA alone. To live a sustainable life, clothing options opposite to the \\"throw away\\" attitude encouraged by fast fashion are needed. Upcycling can help with this, as it puts into practice a more circular economy model. A Circular Economy is where resources are used for as long as possible, getting the most value out of them while in use, then restored and repurposed when their use is over. Popularized by McDonough and Braungart, this has also been known as the cradle-to-cradle principle. This principle states a product should be designed either to have multiple life cycles or be biodegradable.  Food  Billions of pounds of food are wasted every year around the world, but there are ways that people reuse food and find a way to upcycle. One common method is to feed it to animals because many animals, such as pigs, will eat all the scraps given. Food waste can be donated and restaurants can save all the food customers don't eat. Donations can also be made by contacting local agricultural extension offices to find out where to donate food waste and how often and how much one can donate. Another form of upcycling food would be to break it down and use it as energy. Engineers have found a way to break the food down into a reusable bio-fuel by pressure cooking it and then they are able to make methane out of the remains which can be used to produce electricity and heat. When the food isn't used in those ways, another way is to just break it down and use it in compost, which will improve the soil. Many types of food waste, such as fruits, vegetables, egg shells, nuts, and nut shells, can be used in compost to enrich soil.  Design processes  Tonnes of wastes are produced every day in our cities, and some educators are attempting to raise citizens' awareness, especially the youth. To redefine the concept of recycling previously confined to trash categorization, groups of young designers have attempted to transform \\"trash\\" into potentially marketable products such as backpacks made of waste plastic bags and area rugs created by reusing hides. One relevant book published by Community Museum Project in Hong Kong in 2010, was the first experiment on upcycling systems design. Spanning across material collecting, upcycling design, local production and public dissemination, it provides proposals towards a sustainable system that will cast impact on our strategies of waste handling and energy saving. Hong Kong local inventor Gary Chan is actively involved in designing and making 'upcycling' bikes by making use of waste materials as parts for his bikes. He invented at least 8 bikes using wastes as a majority of the materials. Gary and his partners at Wheel Thing Makers regularly collect useful wastes such as leather skin from sofas, hardwood plates of wardrobes, or rubber tires from vehicle repair stores in the waste collection station on streets.  Potential technologies  The worldwide plastic production was 280 million tons in 2011 and production levels are growing every year. Its haphazard disposal causes severe environmental damage such as the creation of the Great Pacific garbage patch. In order to solve this problem, the employment of modern technologies and processes to reuse the waste plastic as a cheap substrate is under research. The goal is to bring this material from the waste stream back into the mainstream by developing processes which will create an economic demand for them. One approach in the field involves the conversion of waste plastics (like LDPE, PET, and HDPE) into paramagnetic, conducting microspheresMondal, M., Gohs, U., Wagenknecht, U. and Heinrich, G. 2013. \\"Polypropylene/natural rubber thermoplastic vulcanizates by eco-friendly and sustainable electron induced reactive processing\\". Radiation Physics and Chemistry. 88, 0 (2013), 74‚Äì81. or into carbon nanomaterials by applying high temperatures and chemical vapor deposition. On a molecular level, the treatment of polymers like polypropylene or thermoplastics with electron beams (doses around 150 kGy) can increase material properties like bending strength and elasticity and provides an eco- friendly and sustainable way to upcycle them.Czvikovszky, T. and Hargitai, H. 1997. \\"Electron beam surface modifications in reinforcing and recycling of polymers. Nuclear Instruments and Methods\\" in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms. 131, 1‚Äì4 (1997), 300‚Äì304. Active research is being carried out for the biotransformation upcycling of plastic waste (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate and polyurethane) into PHA bioplastic using bacteria. PET could be converted into the biodegradable PHA by using a combination of temperature and microbial treatment. First it gets pyrolized at 450 ¬∞C and the resulting terephthalic acid is used as a substrate for microorganisms, which convert it finally into PHA.Kenny, S.T., Runic, J.N., Kaminsky, W., Woods, T., Babu, R.P., Keely, C.M., Blau, W. and O‚ÄôConnor, K.E. 2008. \\"Up-Cycling of PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) to the Biodegradable Plastic PHA (Polyhydroxyalkanoate)\\". Environmental Science & Technology. 42, 20 (2008), 7696‚Äì7701. Similar to the aforementioned approach is the combination of nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes with powdered orange peel as a composite material. This might be used to remove synthetic dyes from wastewater.Jain, N., Basniwal, R. K., Suman, Srivastava, A. K., & Jain, V. K. (2010). \\"Reusable nanomaterial and plant biomass composites for the removal of methylene blue from water\\", Environmental Technology, 31(7), 755-760. Biotechnology companies have recently shifted focus towards the conversion of agricultural waste, or biomass, to different chemicals or commodities. One company in particular, BioTork, has signed an agreement with the State of Hawaii and the USDA to convert the unmarketable papayas in Hawaii into fish feed. As part of this Zero Waste Initiative put forth by the State of Hawaii, BioTork will upcycle the otherwise wasted biomass into a high quality, omega- rich fish feed.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago Cubs, Detroit Tigers, Texas Rangers, Seattle Mariners, New York Yankees, and Cleveland Indians. He is currently the pitching coach for the Augusta Greenjackets, a single A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. He has appeared in 152 major league games but has pitched only 93 innings in that time, averaging about 2/3 of an inning per appearance. He does however hold a unique major league record. He has a career won loss record of 8-0 for a winning percentage of 1.000. This marks the most wins for a pitcher without ever being charged with a loss, presuming he doesn't resume his playing career and records a future loss at the major league level. He is not credited for his win percentage in the official baseball records because that required a minimum of 1,000 innings pitched. Early life Rapada was born in Chesapeake, Virginia to a Filipino father whose roots traces to Cabangan, Zambales and an American mother. and graduated from Deep Creek High School of Chesapeake, Virginia in 1999. He then attended Virginia State University and played on the NCAA Division II Trojans baseball team. Career Chicago Cubs Rapada started in the Chicago Cubs organization pitching for the Single-A Boise Hawks from 2002‚Äì03. At the beginning of 2003, he was promoted to the Single-A Lansing Lugnuts, where he posted a 4.96 earned run average (ERA) and recorded 27 strikeouts over 45‚Öì innings pitched, primarily in relief. In 2004, Cubs coaches suggested that Rapada try a sidearm delivery. Rapada showed improvement that season for the Lugnuts, going 6‚Äì6 with an ERA of 2.33 in 57 appearances. In 2005, the Cubs moved Rapada up to the Single-A Daytona Cubs, where he went 1‚Äì3 with an ERA 3.83 in 27 appearances. 2006 saw Rapada progressing through the Cubs minor league organization, and he pitched for both the Double-A West Tenn Diamond Jaxx and the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. Between the two teams, he appeared in 61 games and posted an ERA of 1.59. Rapada made his major league debut with the Chicago Cubs on June 14, 2007, against the Seattle Mariners. He faced one batter, Ra√∫l Iba√±ez, who lined out to Cubs right fielder Cliff Floyd. Rapada was sent back to the Iowa Cubs on June 19, 2007, without making another appearance. Detroit Tigers On August 30, 2007, Rapada was announced as the player to be named later in the trade between the Tigers and Cubs involving outfielder Craig Monroe. Rapada made his Tigers debut on September 9, 2007. In a coincidence, he faced Ib√°√±ez again, giving up a three-run home run. He was pulled immediately after, giving him the distinction of facing the same batter (and only that batter) twice in his first two major league appearances; one while pitching for a National League club and the other with an American League club. He earned his first major league victory on April 15, 2008 as the Tigers beat the Minnesota Twins 6‚Äì5. Rapada did not make the Tigers 25-man roster and began the 2009 season playing for the Toledo Mud Hens. Texas Rangers Rapada with the Orioles in 2011 On December 7, 2009, Rapada was traded to the Texas Rangers for a player to be named later or cash considerations. On December 16, Rapada was outrighted off the 40-man roster to Triple-A. Rapada played most of the 2010 season with the minor league Oklahoma City RedHawks. On September 3, 2010, Texas called up Rapada to the major league roster. Rapada was listed as an alternative during the postseason when the Texas Rangers would make it to the World Series for the first time in franchise history. The Rangers would eventually lose the 2010 World Series against the San Francisco Giants. Baltimore Orioles On January 14, 2011, Rapada was placed on release waivers by the Rangers. On January 25, 2011, Rapada was signed by the Baltimore Orioles and invited to spring training to compete for a roster spot. After being sent to the minors after spring training, Rapada was called up by Baltimore on April 17. He made his Orioles debut on April 18 with two outs in the seventh inning against the Minnesota Twins. He was designated for assignment on June 29. In 16‚Öì innings with Baltimore, Rapada had a 6.06 ERA. After being designated for assignment on February 6, Rapada was released by the Orioles on February 15. He leads the major leagues in left-handers' batting average who face him since 2010. New York Yankees Rapada signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees on February 18, 2012 with an invitation to spring training. Rapada made the Yankees Opening Day roster. He had a 2.82 ERA in 70 appearances. After 2013 Spring Training, he was designated for assignment. He cleared waivers and was released on April 3. He was re-signed to a minor league deal on April 9 and released on June 3. Cleveland Indians Rapada signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians on June 13, 2013. After spending most of the season with the AAA Columbus Clippers, he was added to the Indians' major-league roster as a September call-up. He was designated for assignment on October 2, 2013. After being outrighted to Triple-A Columbus on October 7, Rapada elected free agency on October 16. Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Rapada signed a minor league deal with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in December 2013. He was released before the end of Spring Training. Seattle Mariners Rapada signed a minor league deal with the Seattle Mariners in April 2014, and was assigned to Triple-A Tacoma. He pitched in 14 games, going 4-1 with a 4.12 ERA before his release on June 16.Pacific Coast League Transactions Return to the Orioles That day, he signed a minor league deal with the Baltimore Orioles. He reported to Triple-A Norfolk. On August 5, 2014 he was released. San Francisco Giants On February 5, 2015, Rapada signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants.http://bleedingyankeeblue.blogspot.com/2015/02/clay-rapada-signs-with- giants.html Philippine national team Due to his Filipino heritage, Rapada is eligible to play for the Philippine national team. He was to participate for the Philippines at the 2013 World Baseball Classic qualifiers in 2012 but did not participate citing personal reasons. Rapada led the Philippines at the 2017 World Baseball Classic qualifiers in February 2016.

It reached number 52 in the UK albums charts. This was the last Fairport album to feature vocalist Sandy Denny. Historical perspective During this period, the band was dubbed by some fans‚Äîin a tongue-in-cheek manner‚Äîas \\"Fotheringay Convention\\" and \\"Fotheringport Confusion\\", as the core of Fotheringay (Denny, her husband Trevor Lucas, and Jerry Donahue) joined the remaining members of the early 1970s version of Fairport (Dave Pegg, Dave Mattacks and Dave Swarbrick) for this version of the band. Lucas, an Australian, and Donahue, an American, joined Pegg, Swarbrick, and drummer Mattacks in 1973 for the recording of the album Rosie. Denny travelled with the band while they toured in 1974 and began performing with them on stage. This was the first Fairport Convention album not to involve John Wood in the production, and the only one not to feature any traditional material. With a number of solid songs penned, they entered the studio for recording sessions. Although still firmly rooted in the folk- rock vein, producer Glyn Johns brought a more polished and pop-influenced sound to the recording. Mattacks left midway through the sessions and was replaced by drummer Bruce Rowland. This was the last Fairport record to reach the UK charts prior to Red & Gold in 1989; it entered the chart on 12 July 1975, and stayed just one week, reaching no. 52. The band (especially Denny) pinned their hopes on Rising For The Moon to finally be their breakthrough album; that level of popularity never materialized and, in December 1975, after touring in support of the album, Donahue left the band, followed shortly by Denny and Lucas. Carrying on as Fairport Convention, Pegg, Swarbrick and Rowland recruited several short-term replacements before persuading founder member Simon Nicol to return.

Having originally studied mathematics, Bouyain later shifted her attention to cinematography, studying at the Louis Lumi√®re School of Cinematography. She went on to work as a camerawomen for several films, and eventually directed several of her own. In 2000, she created the documentary film Les enfants du Blanc. She wrote her book Metisse fa√ßon in 2003 after researching her African heritage in Burkina Faso. She learned of the history of Upper Volta (as Burkina Faso was known in colonial times) and of children who were born to African women and French soldiers only to be forced to leave their mothers to live in orphanages. The characters in Metisse fa√ßon are based on these children.

In 1954 she was converted into a cable repair ship to support Project Caesar, the unclassified name for installation of the Sound Surveillance System SOSUS. Aeolus was the first of two ships, the other being USS Thor (ARC-4), to be converted into cable ships. Aeolus performed cable duties for nearly thirty years, from 1955 to 1973 as a commissioned ship and from 1973 until 1985 as the civilian crewed USNS Aeolus (T-ARC=3) of the Military Sealift Command (MSC). The ship was retired in 1985 and sunk as an artificial reef in 1988. USS Turandot (AKA-47  USS Turandot was decommissioned on 21 March 1946, struck from the Navy list on 17 April 1947, and placed in the reserve fleet on 25 June. USS Aeolus (ARC-3) On 4 November 1954 the ship was removed from the reserve fleet for conversion to a cable repair ship. The conversion was performed at the Key Highway yard of the Bethlehem Steel Co. in Baltimore, Maryland. The ship was renamed Aeolus, designated ARC-3, on 17 March 1955 and commissioned on 14 May 1955. The Navy crew consisted of nine officers and 196 enlisted personnel with civilian cable or survey personnel as required.  Function  Aeolus was converted to support the installation of the Sound Surveillance System and other defense cable projects. The system and name were at the time classified with the unclassified name Project Caesar being given to the installation and support of the system. The ship was principally used to transport, deploy, retrieve and repair cables and to conduct acoustic, hydrographic, and bathymetric surveys under Project Caesar. Civilian specialist are involved during cable or surveying operations for the technical work.SOSUS and both operations and actual linkage of Project Caesar to SOSUS was at the time classified and tightly controlled. The system was covered as \\"oceanographic research\\" and the cable operations were not associated with undersea surveillance systems. Thus any public information, such as the referenced All Hands articles, did not describe the true nature of the operations. The All Hands January 1964 article emphasizes the cover story with the purpose being to connect remote ocean observation centers with shore stations. Aeolus cable tank, 1953.} The Aeolus and Thor had three diameter cable tanks each with a capacity of about of five inch armored cable or of coaxial cable.See USS Aeolus Association's photo of Caesar cable types. Cable being laid was under constant test by civilian experts in the ships cable test room. Cable ships with bow sheaves only required towing astern for some long runs of cable resulting in the unusual feature of two sets of running lights suitable for the stern becoming the effective bow. By the late 1970s the two Artemis class transports converted to cable ships were in need of modernization or replacement. Some shortcomings in design worked against modernization even though two other ships of the same age were slated for major modernization. The class had been designed with a relatively shallow draft of , least draft of the attack transports that had drafts from to .A lesser draft might have some advantages in an attack transport allowing closer approach to beaches. Compared to the draft of the smaller and , designed as an Army cable layers late in World War II and the only Navy ships designed as cable ships, this was a disadvantage in a cable ship's loading and operations. Both of those ships, built the same year and as old, were essentially rebuilt to extend their service life but the two larger ships were not going to be modernized. The shallow draft, which also hindered bathymetric survey work due to shallow transducer depth, and large sail area of the exposed hull and superstructure made stopped or very low speed cable operations hazardous. Thrusters could not be built into the shallow draft hulls and tugs had to be used for some operations. The ships had no stern cable capability and could not effectively be modernized for that capability. Finally, the ships could not carry a full load of cable and a full load of fuel without exceeding maximum draft limits and modernization would only add to that limitation by adding weight. Service history Aeolus viewed from bow sheaves. Aeolus worked in the Atlantic and Caribbean during 1955‚Äì56; in the Pacific during 1956‚Äì59; and returned to the Atlantic and Caribbean during 1959‚Äì62. During 1962‚Äì73 she worked principally in the Atlantic, with occasional temporary assignments to the Pacific. In early 1973 the ship underwent a ten month refit at the Boston Naval Shipyard in anticipation of transfer to the Military Sealift Command (MSC) later that year. new, up to date, cable machinery along with ship's service generators and auxiliary equipment was installed. The distilling plant was replaced by a new, larger capacity, system. The engineering plant and boilers were overhauled. Changes to both ship's work and habitable spaces addressed work and habitability issues. On 23 November 1969 the ship began recovering the SNAP-7E nuclear power source off Bermuda. The ship had deployed the nuclear powered acoustic source, built for the Navy by the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), in 1964 in of water with two anchors (one the other ) connected to the device by of line. SNAP-7E had failed prematurely and the AEC had requested recovery for examination to identify the failure. Aeolus, on the third pass over the line connecting the lighter anchor to the device, began retrieval. The heavy lift was successful with a maximum tension of . The device was checked for radiation leaks before being secured on board for transport to a facility in Rhode Island. After returning from European waters on 21 September 1973 the ship was prepared for decommissioning and turn over to the MSC. On 1 October 1973 Aeolus was transferred to MSC operating with a civilian crew as USNS Aeolus (T-ARC-3) until May 1985 when deactivated for lay up in the Maritime Administration's National Defense Reserve Fleet in the James River near Ft. Eustis, Virginia. During her career, Aeolus received three Meritorious Unit Commendations (in 1970, 1971, and 1973). Artificial reef On 28 January 1987 the ship was transferred to the State of North Carolina for sinking as an artificial reef. On 29 July 1988 the ex-Aeolus was sunk to form an artificial reef located about 22 miles from Beaufort Inlet in of water, is often visited by divers. The ship was intact lying on its starboard side until Hurricane Fran in 1996 when the wreck was shifted and broken into three major pieces with scattered wreckage.

History Towards the end of the seventh century, Saint Mederic, abbot of Saint-Martin d'Autun, set off on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Saint Denis and Saint Germain, in Paris, in the company of a young monk named Frodulphe. The road was long because the abbot, aging and tired, had to stop often to take rest. It was thus that Mederic and Frodulphe halted at a deserted spot near Paris, where a chapel was then erected to commemorate the pilgrim abbe, whose charity, piety, and miracles had struck the people.

Soult followed up his success by storming the city. It is estimated that 8,000 soldiers perished in the attack and that a great number of civilians were killed. Soult's invasion of Portugal Troop movements After the Battle of Corunna, Napoleon ordered Marshal Nicolas Soult to invade Portugal from the north. He was to seize Porto by 1 February and Lisbon by 10 February. Napoleon failed to take into account both the wretched condition and the roads or the fact that a full-scale guerrilla war had broken out in Northern Portugal and Spain. Battle of Porto reenactment, in 2009. Soult's II Corps had four infantry divisions, commanded by Generals of Division Pierre Hugues Victoire Merle, Julien Augustin Joseph Mermet, √âtienne Heudelet de Bierre, and Henri Fran√ßois Delaborde. Merle had four battalions each of the 2nd Light, 4th Light and 15th Line Infantry Regiments and three battalions of the 36th Line. Mermet's division included four battalions each of the 31st Light, 47th Line, and 122nd Line, and one battalion each of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Swiss Regiments. Heudelet led two battalions each of the 22nd Line and 66th Line, one battalion each of the 15th Light, 32nd Light, 82nd Line, L√©gion du Midi, Paris Guard, and Hanoverian Legion. Delaborde's command comprised three battalions each of the 17th Light, 70th Line, and 86th Line.

The French then moved northeast to Ourense in Spain, seized an unguarded bridge and marched south. On the way, Franceschi's cavalry overran Major General Nicolas Mahy's Spanish brigade at La Trepa on March 6, inflicting 700 casualties. The French crossed into Portugal and occupied Chaves on 9 March. From Chaves, Soult moved west to P√≥voa de Lanhoso where he was confronted by Baron Christian Adolph Friedrich von Eben's 25,000-man army composed mostly of Portuguese militia armed with muskets, pikes, and agricultural implements. After waiting several days for all his troops to arrive, Soult went over to the attack. On 20 March 1809 in the Battle of Braga the French veterans butchered their adversaries. The outmatched Portuguese lost 4,000 killed and 400 captured. The French, who lost 40 killed and 160 wounded, also seized 17 Portuguese cannons.

Generals Lima and Parreiras commanded two battalions, each of the 6th, 18th and 21st Infantry Regiments, and one battalion of the 9th and other units. The 4,500 Portuguese regulars were supported by 10,000 ordenan√ßas (militia) and 9,000 armed citizens. When Soult hurled Merle, Mermet, Heudelet, Franceschi and Lahoussaye at the Portuguese deployed north of the city, on the weakest part of the Portuguese line of defence, Castro's force soon dissolved and the battle became a massacre. The Portuguese tried to escape from the French in the city but were chased by the French cavalry throughout the streets, and their regular units were annihilated. Thousands of fleeing civilians drowned when a bridge of boats across the Douro River (as soon as some Portuguese units started to sabotage the bridge to prevent the French from crossing the river) collapsed because of their weight and of Portuguese artillery fire (coming from the left side of the Douro) who were aiming at the French cavalry behind the Portuguese soldiers and citizens. In the roadstead, Soult captured a squadron of Spanish naval vessels and 30 merchant ships. The French also found large stockpiles of British military stores. In the battle and storming of the city, the French lost 72 officers and 2,000 rank and file casualties. The Portuguese lost about 8,000 killed and 197 cannons captured. Soult did not have very long to enjoy his success. Almost at once, the ordenan√ßas cut his communications with Spain and a 1,800-man garrison was gobbled up by Francisco Silveira's Portuguese force in the Siege of Chaves. The French marshal started planning a retreat. The next action was the Battle of Grij√≥. The city was retaken on 12 May by the British and Portuguese under Wellesley in the Second Battle of Porto.

It was signed for France by the Marquis d'Argenson and for James's son, Charles Edward Stuart, \\"Prince Regent of Scotland\\", by Colonel Daniel O'Brien.

Bond later died in prison awaiting trial when a bomb he built to use for an escape detonated prematurely. Brandeis In February 1970, Bond enrolled at Brandeis University as part of a government sponsored program for ex-convicts out on parole. There he became involved with the National Student Strike Force. This organization advocated strikes across the country by students as a protest to the Vietnam War. It also supported the Black Panthers. While involved with the anti-war movement Bond met Susan Saxe and Katherine Ann Power, becoming involved with Power romantically. Robbery and death These three, along with ex-convicts William Gilday and Robert Valeri, made plans to rob a bank in order to finance the activities of the Black Panthers. First the group burglarized and torched a Massachusetts National Guard armory on September 20, 1970, stealing ammunition. Then, on September 23, in order to finance their anti-war activities, the five robbed a Brighton, Massachusetts bank of $26,000. During the holdup, Gilday shot police officer Walter A. Schroeder in the back and killed him. Following the robbery, Bond subtracted $2,500 from the loot, considering it a \\"payment\\". He divided that among each participant to get $500 in spending money, then donated the rest to various left-wing groups. Bond, Gilday, and Valeri were all captured soon after the robbery.

She currently lives and works in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Work Like the works of other contemporary Dutch photographers, such as Rineke Dijkstra, Hellen van Meene and Desiree Dolron, her works show influences of Dutch Golden Age painting in their composition, use of light and color, and rendering of textures and surfaces. To achieve her photographic effects, she utilizes film , but in more recent years also uses digital photography. Most of her works are untitled, enhancing the effect of alienation, while retaining a strong element of eroticism. Recognition Carla van de Puttelaar won several prizes and awards, including the Dutch Prix de Rome. She gained international recognition following exhibitions in New York, Paris and Brussels. Her works have been published as book covers and in magazines like The New Yorker and The New York Times Magazine.

Today there is a permanent fence from ocean to sound to keep vehicles from crossing but, more importantly, to keep the wild horses from migrating to the Virginia side of the border. To reach Carova, four-wheel drive vehicles must drive north along the beach from Corolla into the community, as access from Virginia is limited to pedestrians and bicyclists. The community's name derived from the combination of the first syllables of Carolina and Virginia since the coastal community lies just south of the North Carolina-Virginia state line. Thus, it is the northernmost of the Outer Banks communities of North Carolina. Historically the Currituck Inlet which served as the boundary between Virginia and North Carolina existed where the community of Carova now stands. The inlet closed in 1730s. Banker horses and other wildlife roam freely on the beaches of Carova. There is an enforced law on the beach that states that no one is to get within of the horses. Carova only has approximately 50 year-round residents and commercialism is absent from this section of the Outer Banks; there are no restaurants, shops, or other attractions that often accompany beach communities. There are approximately 740 beach homes, many of which are weekly rentals and otherwise only a fire/ems station and a refuse station; developers continue to build in the area. Flooding is a continual problem that worsens with each bad storm in Carova Beach, where summer tourist traffic is heavy on roads that are little more than uneven sand paths through the dunes. Sandfiddler Road and Sandpiper Road, the two primary routes through the community, become nearly impassable after heavy rains, when large potholes fill with water. During hurricanes and tropical storms the community can become inaccessible when the beach is awash due to storm surge. Although some residents of Carova are opposed to a paved road being built to the community, the Currituck County Commission is in favor of constructing a paved road to Carova. They say a road is essential for the county to continue providing services like garbage collection, housing inspections, and emergency response. A road to connect Carova to the rest of Currituck County would have to cut through the 8,316 acre Currituck National Wildlife Refuge that stretches for 11 miles along the Currituck Banks between Corolla and Carova and any effort to build a road through the refuge would likely face stiff opposition from environmentalists.http://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=93-P13-00044&segmentID;=3 Climate According to the Trewartha climate classification system, Carova Beach, North Carolina has a humid subtropical climate with hot and humid summers, cool winters and year-around precipitation (Cfak). Cfak climates are characterized by all months having an average mean temperature > 32.0 ¬∞F (> 0.0 ¬∞C), at least eight months with an average mean temperature ‚â• 50.0 ¬∞F (‚â• 10.0 ¬∞C), at least one month with an average mean temperature ‚â• 71.6 ¬∞F (‚â• 22.0 ¬∞C) and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. During the summer months in Carova Beach, a cooling afternoon sea breeze is present on most days, but episodes of extreme heat and humidity can occur with heat index values ‚â• 100 ¬∞F (‚â• 38 ¬∞C). Carova Beach is prone to hurricane strikes, particularly during the Atlantic hurricane season which extends from June 1 through November 30, sharply peaking from late August through September. During the winter months, episodes of cold and wind can occur with wind chill values < 10 ¬∞F (< -12 ¬∞C). The plant hardiness zone at Carova Beach is 8a with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 14.1 ¬∞F (-9.9 ¬∞C). The average seasonal (Dec-Mar) snowfall total is < 2 inches (< 5 cm), and the average annual peak in nor'easter activity is in February. Ecology According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Carova Beach, North Carolina would have a dominant vegetation type of Northern Cordgrass (73) with a dominant vegetation form of Coastal Prairie (20).

It later became a legally recognised station. In 2007, Radio Avalon was replaced with Worthy FM. The beginning The idea of launching a radio station at the Glastonbury Festival was coined at the festival in 1982 by Lawrie Hallett and Norman McLeod. Radio Avalon was launched the next year (1983) operating from a tent and a red VW camper van. Norman McLeod and Lawrie Hallett were joined by Alan Brown, Paul Garner and others. The crew in these early years came from Wireless Workshop in Brighton, Phoenix Communications in London and Sheffield Peace Radio. The transmission equipment used was built by the members and much of the outboard equipment came from the founders' domestic hi-fi, reflecting the DIY ethic that characterised much of the Radio Avalon approach for several years. At this time, the station's programme was a very free format, with one show flowing into another depending on which crew member was available and who wanted to do a show. For several years, these pioneering broadcasts came from a tent near to Goose Hall and the signal very occasionally made it as far as Glastonbury town, a distance of 5 miles away. The presenters from midnight to daybreak were known as \\"The Dead Heads\\"‚Äîthey played mainly Grateful Dead records mixed with other late night tracks. By the mid-1980s the team was joined by a number of volunteers from Ireland and in particular from Bray Local Broadcasting. A regular feature of these early broadcasts were various outside broadcasts from backstage and or from the top of Glastonbury Tor, looking down across the festival site just visible several miles away. Radio Avalon remained a pirate radio station for the first 7 years of its life. It was always the aim of its members that it would become a legal broadcaster and following changes to government legislation in 1988 and again in 1991, Radio Avalon applied for and was awarded a Restricted Service Licence (RSL). Middle years By 1992, the station had become a legal and recognised RSL station. The station had a loose format, with named presenters doing regular shows. Over the years, many guest presenters have huddled inside the Radio Avalon cabin, situated near the farmhouse at the top of Big Ground; such names include BBC Radio 2's Janice Long, Radiohead and a programme in 1995 hosted by John Peel. After a classic three night tenure from The Orb in 1992, the night-time sessions were steered in a more dance and ambient orientated direction. Later years Radio Avalon continued to gain new support throughout the 1990s. The station became fully self funding, having relied in the early years on support from the Glastonbury Festival organisation. Radio Avalon now played host to a new generation of younger broadcasters who saw the station as a great opportunity to be heard. It was sponsored by various organisations and gained support from record labels and emerging dot com companies. The new century saw divisions begin to assert themselves within the membership. Following the death of Fred Williams in 2004, station manager since 1992, an internal struggle arose that resulted in personnel changes. 2002 Radio Avalon returned after a year off with some new personnel and a fresh relationship with the festival. A year off gave impetus to the year's broadcasts, with an aerobics session for the radio, live from the roof of the main studio (portable cabin) courtesy of Marilyn Michaels. 2003 The station built on previous successful years and made the most of a dry festival. Artists that visited the station including Glenn Tilbrook, Simon Friend of The Levellers among others. 2004 Radio Avalon celebrated 21 years of broadcasting to the Glastonbury Festival in 2004. As car drivers neared the site they tuned their radio to 87.7 MHz FM, and received all the festival information they could want (including essential details for drivers on the state of the roads, gates, car parks, camping fields and where to pitch their tents). The festival station brought accurate and useful festival information throughout the day as well as talking to festival goers, performers and workers alike, profiling every aspect of the festival. Presenters Marilyn Michaels & Daddy Teacha enjoyed an exclusive interview with the legendary James Brown. They played the best music from every area and hosted exclusive live performances by some of the biggest artists on-site, from their very own Wireless Stage including Damien Rice, Michael Franti, Dr Hook's Dennis LeCorriere, Suzanne Vega and Hazel O'Connor amongst many more. In 2004 Radio Avalon made a welcome return to the Greenfields area with a dedicated solar powered studio centrally based in the Green Futures field. They hosted a regular hour-long show every day showcasing some of the entrants of the Festival's unsigned bands competition. At lunchtimes they delved deep into the archives to celebrate 21 years of festival broadcasting, bringing all the best bits from shows such as \\"The Pilton Breakfast Show\\", including a tribute to station manager Fred Williams, who had died in April. There was also regular news and travel updates keeping listeners informed, including regular welfare announcements and festival advice. 2005 Broadcasting from two studios at the Glastonbury Festival, one at the Greenfields area and the other at the top of the hill near the main farmhouse, Radio Avalon was kept busy as torrential rains and flash floods made its broadcasts a vital part of the official festival information network. Thousands of festival goers tuned in for updates on weather conditions, traffic redirection, changes to performance times (as stages dried out) and to learn which campsites were less muddy than others. Once the sun came back out, The Wireless Stage was a great success, broadcasting live acoustic sets performed by the finalists of the festival's Best Unsigned Bands competition from small stages set up alongside the broadcast studios. 2007 In 2007, Radio Avalon was replaced with Worthy FM.

Its name comes from the Irish Machaire Cluana which means 'plain of meadow'. This is a strange name for such a hilly parish; it is derived from its most important place in ancient times; a flat area of land in the townland of Camaghy, on which the sports ground and ancient church of St. Molua were located. The parish covers 12,952 statute acres in area, making it the largest parish in South Monaghan. The parish borders three neighbouring counties; Cavan, Louth and Meath. (Magheracloone is the only parish in Monaghan to border Meath). The parish contains numerous natural resources such as gypsum, which is mined locally. During the 1840s, the population numbered approximately 9,000; today, it is approximately 2,000, but is again growing as a result of economic growth and construction, among other factors. The parish is located on the commuter belt, within 50 statute miles of Dublin (approximately 80 minutes' driving time), and 20 minutes from the M1 motorway.  History  The absentee 'Shirley Family' landlords once owned the majority of land in the parish. Their holdings have since been reduced to include a 4000-acre walled estate, just outside Carrickmacross, where the family seat, Lough Fea house, is located. They also technically own the west side of Carrickmacross Main Street, and continue to collect ground rents from most businesses located there, much to the ire of locals (the case for ground rent has been upheld in the Irish courts).  The Battle of Magheracloone  Ss. Peter & Paul Roman Catholic church (1825), Magheracloone, Co. Monaghan, Ireland The 'Battle of Magheracloone' occurred in 1843 at Ss. Peter & Paul's Roman Catholic church. The text now follows of a plaque recently erected there in memoriam: \\" In 1843 the tenants on the Shirley estate, of which Magheracloone was a part, refused to pay their rent until their complaints had been addressed by the landlord. Attempts by the bailiffs to seize cattle or goods from the tenants who would not pay were stopped by the activities of 'The Molly Maguires'. The centre of British rule in Ireland, Dublin Castle, agreed to provide troops to protect the agents who were serving notices of eviction to tenants. On 5 June 1843, a bailiff from the Shirley Estate along with a company of troops marched toward the church of Saints Peter and Paul (this very church) in Magheracloone. The intention was to post a notice of eviction to several tenants in the area, on the door of the church. They were met by a large, howling and hooting crowd who blocked their path. The troops fixed their bayonets and moved forward, only to be met with a shower of stones. Several of the troops were hit with stones and at the same instant the entire company discharged one round each from their guns into the crowd. The crowd backed off. The Company Commander, fearful of a greater slaughter, called his troops back to their carriages and they beat a speedy retreat, followed all the way by angry remnants of the crowd. However, back on the road in front of the church a young servant boy lay dead. Peter Agnew from Lisnaguiveragh, Carrickmacross was at service with Owen Smith of Corrybracken Two days later the coroner's jury (composed of six Protestants and thirteen Roman Catholics) held that as it was not known whose shot had killed the boy, no responsibility could be assessed. But the jury pointedly commented that 'it has not been sufficiently proved to us that at the time of the firing the party of Constabulary were in imminent risk of their lives'. (Outrage Papers). While this incident may be described as a mere skirmish with one fatality, reporting of the event in the local, national and international newspapers prompted questions to be raised in the House of Commons \\".  Faith  Ss. Peter & Paul church by day thumb Father Eugene McCabe celebrates mass at the splendid pre-Vatican II high altar, Ss. Peter & Paul Church, Magheracloone The people of Magheracloone worship in three churches; two Roman Catholic (Ss. Peter & Paul, and St. Patrick's) and one Church of Ireland (St. Molua's). St. Molua's is located on the site of the original Roman Catholic church, from which Catholics were barred during the penal laws. At that time, Catholics attended school and worshipped outside at 'hedge schools' and 'mass rocks', as they were barred from having suitable buildings for these purposes, speaking Irish was banned, and the people were required (in public office and many professions) to take an oath citing the supremacy of the monarch over the Roman Pontiff - an oath which Catholics obviously could not take. A mass rock exists on private property along the River Glyde in Tonaneave; a long stone crosses the river to form a bridge; the priest would stand on one side, and the congregation on the other; the river served both to separate the people from the sacrament (the function performed by a redoros in a church) and to drown out their prayers, for fear of being heard by British soldiers. It is said that, during the Penal Laws, local Protestants kept watch on the hills above to ensure the safety of their Catholic neighbours hearing mass by the river in the valley below. Another example of such kindness comes from the story of a woman who was to be evicted from her home in the parish by bailiffs because she could not pay her rent; one of the soldiers took pity on her and passed around an iron cooking pot, collecting money from the other soldiers until enough was donated such that the woman's rent could be paid. Mass was most recently celebrated at this mass rock in the Jubilee Year 2000; it was concelebrated by PP Fr. Tom Finnegan, Canon Mohan and Fr. Michael J. Gilsenan and attended by a large congregation. The ceremony served to memorialise the victims of the penal laws, which climaxed in the tragedy of The Great Famine. Catholic Emancipation saw an explosion in the number of Roman Catholic churches and schools built in Ireland. Mass Rock Mass Rock & Long Stone River Glyde St. Molua's cemetery contains the remains of both Protestants and Catholics and was cleared from its overgrown condition in the 1980s, to much acclaim. (All cemeteries in the parish are immaculately maintained). In the 1970s, however, both the interior and exterior of Ss. Peter & Paul church (a 'barn church' constructed in 1825) were extensively damaged as a result of perhaps well-meaning but nonetheless gravely ill-conceived 'renovations' by then parish priest, Canon Drum, much to the consternation of locals who wished to continue worshiping at the altar built by their ancestors as an expression of their civic pride in the climate of Catholic Emancipation. Sanctuary and high altar The Ss. Peter & Paul church still includes an intricate wooden ceiling. Constructed on an east‚Äìwest axis, facing the rising sun (a symbol of Christ - The Celtic cross features the rising sun, a Celtic symbol, fused with a cross, as a symbol of the new Christian faith conquering the ancient pagan one), the building is renowned for its light and spaciousness. Its Turnerelli altar and side altars, redoros, mosaics, galleries and pipe organ, were all lost. Two stone crosses were also removed from the pinnacles of the exterior gables and replaced with iron crosses. Stained glass, Ss. Peter & Paul Interior woodwork In 2000, the bell was electrified and the wheel and chain of this Victorian cast iron bell were removed and have since disappeared.  Music  The nineteenth century harper Patrick Byrne was a native of the parish. Born and raised in the town-land of Greaghlone, he went on to achieve international fame, becoming the first person ever photographed while playing a harp. He retired to the townland of Beagh at the end of his life and is buried in Carrickmacross.M√≠che√°l Mac Diarmada, (2005) Mr. Patrick Byrne ‚Äì The Blind Irish Harper, The Northern Standard 14 April, p.40. A monument to the blind harper was recently erected by Magheracloone Heritage Group at the Ball Alley junction along the Carrickmacross-Kingscourt road (which passes through Magheracloone). A GAA sports ground and community centre are located next to this monument. Local harpist and All-Ireland medal winner, Rosey McCabe, played some traditional tunes at the unveiling.  Amenities  Magheracloone is also home to several businesses, shops (including O'Rourke's service station and McGrane's 'Country Store') and numerous schools including Drumgossatt National School (formerly a barn church until Ss Peter & Paul was constructed); it has recently been extended to accommodate a significant increase in numbers.  Sport  The local Gaelic football team Magheracloone Mitchells won the Monaghan Senior Football Championship in 2004. They have achieved runner-up status three times; in 2002, 2005 and 2006. Their colours are those of the parish, being simply black and white. Senior Gaelic footballer Thomas Freeman was presented with a GAA All Star award in 2007 and his brother, Damien Freeman is a former captain of county Monaghan's Gaelic football team. The parish also boasts under-14 boys' & girls' Olympic Handball teams. The boys' team achieved all- Ireland runner-up and the girls' team came 1st in Ireland in 2006. Sinkholes In September 2018 a sinkhole made the local GAA pitch subside and Dromgossatt National School was evacuated. It happened in land over an old gypsum mine. In April 2020 a crown hole appeared in land over the mine.

Quickella arenaria)Quickella arenaria. AnimalBase. is a species of land snail in the family Succineidae, the amber snails. It is known commonly as the sandbowl snail. Catinella arenaria genitalia in Danmarks Fauna Description The shell is 5 to 8 millimeters widea and red-brown in colour. It is fragile, short, turreted, and conical with large body whorl, three whorls and an almost circular aperture. The aperture is about 50% of the shell height, the spire is very short and the whorls are convex with deep sutures. Surface moderately shiny with relatively coarse growth lines. In life the dark digestive gland shows through the spire making it seem very dark compared to the body whorl. The animal is dark grey to black. The shell is very similar to Succinella oblonga. Identification requires dissection. The genitalia differ in these respects: \\"Penis short with a black spot at vas deferens and retractor insertion, vas deferens inserts directly into penis, epiphallus absent, penis without envelope (S. oblonga has a long penis with epiphallus and a long vas deferens).\\" Habitat This snail lives in wet hollows among sand dunes. In the British Isles these areas are known as \\"dune slacks\\", and when in pristine condition, these hollows provide a specialized habitat for an unusual group of fauna and flora, which includes this species.Also on shallow flooded sandy or muddy and calcareous soils. In Switzerland, it occurs up to an altitude of 2200 meters above sea level. Distribution The range is Suboceanic Boreo-temperate (Confined to western Europe and distributed mainly near coasts from France to south-east Sweden).

Early life and education  Biondi was born in New York City, to Virginia Willis and Frank Biondi Sr., and was raised in Livingston, New Jersey. His father was a former executive at Bell Telephone Company. Biondi graduated from Livingston High School in 1964 and was inducted into the school's hall of fame in 1994. He graduated with an A.B. in psychology from Princeton University in 1966 after completing an 81-page long senior thesis titled \\"The Use of a Biographical Inventory for Junior Executive Recruitment in a Large Retail Firm.\\" He later received a M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.  Career  In 1968, Biondi got his start as a financial analyst and investment banker on Wall Street for Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt. There, he met Clarence B. Jones, who recommended him for a consulting job at TelePrompTer Corporation, one of the largest cable companies at the time. However, TelePrompTer had defrauded its investors by misrepresenting their cash flow. In response, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission placed a trade block on their stock for around 100 days, which tanked its valuation. Biondi was let go as a result of corporate restructuring. He later found employment with the nonprofit, Children‚Äôs Television Workshop (CTW), who produced Sesame Street and The Electric Company, in 1974. After a tumultuous time at TelePrompTer, he cites the relatively \\"nice, safe\\" environment of a non-profit as the reason he chose the job at CTW. Michael J. Fuchs recruited Biondi to HBO in 1978 as head of co-productions. Biondi initially expressed disinterest in joining and rejected their initial offer. He later became the president and CEO in 1983. Fuchs replaced him as HBO CEO the following year. In 1985, Biondi went on to serve as external vice president for Coca-Cola's entertainment business sector. In 1986, Coca Cola consolidated its television companies ‚Äî Columbia Pictures Television, Embassy Communications, and Merv Griffin Enterprises ‚Äî into Coca Cola Television, and Biondi was tapped to serve as its CEO. Coca-Cola Television was eventually spun off and sold to TriStar Pictures in 1987. TriStar subsequently renamed itself Columbia Pictures and its founder, Victor Kaufman, continued his role as CEO of the merged company. Biondi was the president and CEO of Viacom from 1987 to 1996 and the chairman and CEO of Universal Pictures from 1996 to 1998. Afterwards, he co-founded the media and technology focused investment firm WaterView Advisors in 1999. Biondi was an avid tennis player and helped finance the creation of the Tennis Channel with fellow former Viacom CEOs Philippe Dauman and Thomas E. Dooley in 2001. Together they are known as the \\"Viacom mafia\\". At his summer residence in Martha's Vineyard, he was a board member for the Vineyard Family Tennis Foundation. In the later part of his life, Biondi was a director of RealD, Amgen, Cablevision, Caesars Entertainment Corporation, Hasbro, Yahoo!, Viasat, and Seagate.Forbes - Frank Biondi Jr Profile.

In the tumultuous atmosphere of the revolt against Ferrante, the Aragonese King of Naples by the local lords who supported the claims of the House of Anjou, which broke out anew in 1460, Francesco Sforza had induced the Pope, Pius II to support Ferrante in the Neapolitan War of 1460-61. The strife in the Kingdom of Naples was reflected in Rome. In the absence of the Pope, who was taking the waters for his gout in the neighborhood of his native Siena in the aftermath of the disappointing Council of Mantua, two bands of youthful thugs competed for territory in the city of Rome. The Conservatori were inactive and the disturbances grew so great by the end of March that the Governor was forced to vacate the Lateran Palace and call on Pius for military support. The perennial anti-Papal party in Rome, at this time headed by the Savelli,Jacopo Savelli offered secure asylum to the Roman banditti at Palombara, at the foot of Monte Gennara (Pastor 107). the Colonna and the Anguillara, made overtures to the condottiero Jacopo Piccinino, son of Niccol√≤ Piccinino, who was fighting for Ren√© d'Anjou. Violence erupted in Rome over the rescue from the law of an abductor of a young woman, by a gang headed by the brothers Tiburzio and Valeriano di Maso, whose father, brother-in-law to Stefano Porcari, had been executed for his complicity in Porcaro's plot against Nicholas V in 1453 . The brothers, announcing that they were \\"throwing off the yoke of the priests\\" according to Stefano Infessura, and restoring the Roman Republic, barricaded themselves in the Pantheon, and then, driven from stronghold to stronghold, fortified themselves in Palazzo Capranica. Jacopo Piccinino was plundering in the Sabine Hills and threatened Rome, according to an informant who identified as Piccinino's supporters the Prince of Taranto, Everso di Anguillara, Jacopo Savelli and the Colonna, and that Tiburzio's gang would open the gates of Rome to the condottiero. Pius finally left Siena; he gathered together at Orvieto representatives of the contending houses of Aragon and Anjou preparatory to making peace, gathered five hundred horseman at Viterbo and set out for Rome where he arrived 6 October, to public expressions of joy and relief. In mid-October, with rumors rife of an assault on the city by Piccinino, Tiburzio made an attempt to rescue a captured ally, calling fruitlessly on the city to rise up, and was captured with some of his comrades as they attempted to flee to Palombara. On the scaffold he acknowledged that he had intended, with the aid of the Ghibelline barons and Piccinino, to overthrow the papal government, made bold by the predictions of a fortune-teller. He was hanged on the Campidoglio, 31 October 1460. In March 1461, eleven other members of Tiburzio's gang ventured to Rome from Palombara and were captured and hanged. On 10 July 1461, Jacopo Savelli, the last genuine threat, threw himself at Pius' feet and was granted mercy.

Markey was hired as a staff assistant to the vice president for development and planning at American University in 1981. Markey completed a Masters of Public Administration in 1983 from American University. Public service career In 1983 Markey was selected as a Presidential Management Fellow, a competitive two-year management program track in the federal government. Markey went on to hold positions in the United States Treasury Department as budget and program analyst, as human resources specialist, and as staff assistant to the deputy commissioner of the Customs Service. In 1984, during the Reagan Administration, she was recruited by the U.S. Department of State to develop computer security policies for the newly formed Office of Information Systems Security. Markey served as director of computer security policy and training and worked with all bureaus to craft computer security policy. She created the department‚Äôs first comprehensive computer security training program for management, security personnel and support staff globally.

She quickly garnered numerous key supporters including many past and present elected officials. The 4th District had been in Republican hands since 1973, and had long been reckoned as a safe Republican district. However, Democrats thought Musgrave was vulnerable. The three-term incumbent had never been able to establish a secure footing in the district, in part because her Democratic opponents attacked her for her focus on social issues (such as the Federal Marriage Amendment) and her allegedly poor constituent services. After winning the open 4th District seat fairly easily in 2002, Musgrave barely held on in 2004 and 2006. Another factor that made Democrats hopeful of defeating Musgrave was the district's demographics. The 4th is a large and mostly rural district. While the rural counties are some of the most Republican counties in Colorado, the district's politics are dominated by two counties--Larimer and Weld‚Äîhome to Fort Collins and Greeley, respectively. These two counties have only a third of the district's land, but cast 85 percent of its vote. In the past two elections, Musgrave had only been able to stay in office by running up the votes in Weld County. In the 2008 election, Markey won by an unexpectedly wide margin, taking 56 percent of the vote to Musgrave's 44 percent‚Äîthe third largest margin of victory for a congressional challenger in the 2008 cycle. While Markey lost most of the rural counties in the district by margins of 2-to-1 or more, she crushed Musgrave in Larimer County, winning it by 36,500 votes. She also won Weld County by seven points.Fender, Jessica. Markey's double-digit win stunned own staff. The Denver Post. 6 November 2008.Whaley, Monte.

As of 2019, no Democrat has crossed the 40 percent mark in the district since Markey left office.  Post-congressional career  After her defeat, Markey became Assistant Secretary for Intergovernmental Affairs in the United States Department of Homeland Security. She resigned that position in January 2013. In June 2013, she announced that she was running for Colorado State Treasurer in the 2014 elections.

Dated 1510, this is the earliest full-length portrait in Western painting‚Äîon the assumption that it is a portrait, as seems likely. It is characteristic of Carpaccio that apart from this important innovation, the style of the work seems in other respects to look back to the previous century. From some date until the 20th century the painting had been given the monogram of Albrecht D√ºrer, and Carpaccio's signature overpainted. The realism and detail of Carpaccio does in fact show Northern influence. Composition The painting shows a young knight, surrounded by a rather crowded series of symbols. The heron caught in the sky by a hawk might hint at this knight's death in battle, also alluded to by his posture, which recalls that of a funerary statue; an alternative theory is that this is a memorial portrait of a person already dead. The other knight with a lance might then be the same person during his life. Alternatively, the figure on horseback might be his page; the page of a knight occasionally appears in portraits wearing his master's helmet and having his gauntlets on his person, ready to supply both when called upon, which seems to have been an actual practice. Two later examples are Titian's portrait of Alphonso D'Avalos, and a portrait by Paris Bordone of a man in armour with two pages (now Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). In the left lower corner is a white ermine and a scroll stating \\"I prefer to die rather than to incur dishonour\\" (malo mori quam foedari). The symbolism of these and the other animals and plants have been much discussed by art historians. Subject identity For centuries the identity of the knight has been a subject of discussion among the most renowned art historians, including Bernard Berenson and Lionello Venturi. The portrait is now considered most likely to show Francesco Maria I della Rovere, the Duke of Urbino and nephew of Pope Julius II, during whose reign it was painted. Nevertheless, a more recent interpretation identifies the knight as the Venetian patrician Marco Gabriel, who was rector of the fortress of Methoni, in Greece, during the Ottoman siege of 1500. His family would have commissioned the painting as a tribute to his memory, as, being the only Venetian survivor of the siege, he had been accused of cowardice. Taken by the Ottomans to Constantinople, he was beheaded there on 4 November 1501. Owners The painting was sold by the heirs of the American collector Otto Kahn after his death and bought by Heinrich Thyssen in 1935.

The \\"rockumentary,\\" as producers Bill Drake and Gene Chenault called it, features hundreds of interviews and comments from numerous rock artists and people involved with rock and roll. Notable features introduced in the 1978 edition of this documentary include the \\"chart sweep,\\" featuring a montage of #1 songs and notable hits from a given year or artist, a \\"time sweep\\" for each one-hour segment providing a montage of the major hits for each year or individual artist, and closing with a special climactic time sweep featuring a montage of every #1 hit from 1955 to the year of the latest version. While the documentary focuses on Rock & Roll and its variants, some songs and artists from other genres are also represented as they also became major hits on stations that primarily played Rock & Roll. A revised version of the series is currently syndicated to internet networks as a short-form segment hosted by Gary Theroux, writer of the 1978 and 1981 editions.

Later that year, with slight modifications to the script, another version was aired hosted by Humble Harve Miller. The program was then syndicated nationally in the fall of 1969 by parent company RKO General. KHJ repeated this in 12-hour blocks. This version was syndicated throughout the early 1970s, and was sent to stations on large 10\\" reels of 1/4\\" tape, in full-track mono. Stations were required to return the tapes immediately after airing, though (surprisingly) several stations offered copies of the show as prizes. The original KHJ show also carried promos awarding copies of the show as prizes to a handful of listeners, on reel-to- reel tape AND a tape recorder to play it on. Writer Pete Johnson said that \\"I included nearly every record I ever rem[em]ber hearing\\". The History of Rock and Roll billed itself as \\"modern music's first rockumentary\\" when it first aired on February 21, 1969. However, it had some competition for that title from the Pop Chronicles which began airing on February 9, 1969, on rival Los Angeles AM station KRLA. But since The History of Rock and Roll completed its first broadcast that weekend, it was the first of these rockumentaries to be broadcast in full.  1978  In 1975, Drake-Chenault began the process of updating the documentary. Finding that the 1969 script contained inaccuracies and omissions, programmer/DJ/music historian Gary Theroux researched, rewrote, and rebuilt the program entirely from scratch. The new version expanded the story with fresh interviews, insightful narration, more music, and a host of innovations‚Äîall in a modular format which allowed stations more programming flexibility. Drake knew that the rising popularity of stereo FM rock stations made it necessary to redo the show in stereo. The revised show was also completely remixed and re-edited from scratch, using a homebuilt control room assembled together by engineer Mark Ford at the company headquarters in Canoga Park, California, and a library of thousands of LPs and 45 singles. The program employed a systematic approach covering each year with a focused half- hour as well as separate segments devoted to key artists or trends. The result, hosted by Bill Drake, was an enormously successful ratings hit. Drake replaced previous host Humble Harve Miller. Since the documentary was in development at the time Elvis Presley died in August 1977, Drake-Chenault was able to quickly produce and distribute material from the documentary as \\"Elvis: A Three Hour Special\\". Among other things, Theroux had Drake-Chenault chief engineer Mark Ford assemble two kinds of annual montages: one of each chart-topping hit of a given year (in sequence) and the other of other key songs there was no time to play in full. Those #1 hit montages were reprised for the climactic final hour of the show‚Äîedited together back to back to create a fast-moving 45-minute medley of every chart-topping hit from 1955 to the fall of 1977. The riveting nature of Theroux's much-bootlegged ending later inspired a series of hits medleys by many artists including Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Stars on 45, and Jive Bunny & the Mixmasters. The 1978 edition of \\"The History of Rock & Roll\\" debuted as a marathon broadcast over more than 400 domestic stations and another 400 overseas, and won Billboard magazine's \\"Top Special Program of the Year\\" award. That led Theroux to host his own version of \\"The History of Rock 'n' Roll\\" as a syndicated daily 2-minute feature. Following the success of the 1978 release, Drake-Chenault created a shorter, edited version, marketed as \\"The History of Rock & Roll: The Early Years.\\" It featured only the years through 1971 and was targeted to oldies stations.  1981  The final Drake-Chenault version was released in the spring of 1981, named the Silver Anniversary Edition of the History of Rock & Roll, so-called as it was released 25 years after Elvis Presley's first #1 hit. Not wishing to increase the size of the program, and with an attempt to place greater emphasis on the current musical trends, the controversial decision was made to severely cut back the sections devoted to the 1950s and early 1960s (prior to the advent of the Beatles). All of the pre-1978 content in the \\"Silver Anniversary Edition,\\" therefore, was actually a recycled cut- down of Theroux, Ford and Drake's award-winning work. Only their two-hour profile of Elvis Presley remained relatively intact. The half-hour recaps of chart highlights from each year between 1956 and 1963 were condensed into a single half hour, while new chart sweeps for 1978, 1979, and 1980 were expanded to a full hour each. The final hour, the \\"time sweep\\", brought the number one song montage up to date through Eddie Rabbitt's \\"I Love a Rainy Night\\", the song that was number one in early 1981, at the time this version was prepared. The program closed with The Beatles' version of \\"Rock and Roll Music\\".  1997-  Westwood One, successor-in-interest to the Drake- Chenault company, is believed to own the rights to the 1978 and 1981 editions, with no current plans to produce a revised version of the series in the model of the Drake-Chenault incarnations. Such an undertaking would require 35-plus additional years of the rock era to be covered (including new interviews, updates, and a new narrator brought in to supplant the existing pre-1981 material, since Bill Drake died in 2009. The climactic \\"Time Sweep\\" would have to be expanded to two hours in order to bring the montage current. The documentary would likely run 150 to 200 hours. The likelihood of a revised documentary is diminished further by the fact that rock has lost much of its dominance over the music industry since 1981 as hip hop and electronic music have grown in popularity. However, the series does continue in a daily short- form \\"micro-series\\". In 1997, Gary Theroux revived ‚ÄúThe History of Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll‚Äù as a daily 2 ¬Ω minute syndicated radio feature which he hosted, wrote and co-produced with Jeremy Goldsmith and Elliot Peper at Tabby Sound Studios in New York. (Later installments were produced with Peter Gould at The Intervale Group in Connecticut.) Nearly every fast-paced episode interweaves three key hits by a spotlit artist with comments by that star and whatever minimal narration is needed to complete each story. The Gary Theroux-hosted current version of ‚ÄúThe History of Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll‚Äù can still be heard worldwide over rewoundradio.comhttp://www.streamlicensing.com/stations/rewound/home.html and supernovaradio.co as of 2014, the year the series was honored as the world‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest Online Radio Program‚Äù at the New York Festivals International Radio Programming Awards. The Drake-Chenault and Gary Theroux Productions' \\"History of Rock 'n' Roll\\" programs are not to be confused with other productions with similar names, such as the ABC Rock Radio Network's \\"The Official History of Rock & Roll.\\" Hosted by a team of disc jockeys including Tony Pigg, Meg Griffin, Jimmy Fink and Mike Harrison, it otherwise bore little resemblance to the Drake-Chenault version. Country music edition Based on the success of The History of Rock and Roll, Drake-Chenault created a country music version called The History of Country Music. Produced and syndicated to radio stations in 1982, this 52-hour radio documentary was hosted by Ralph Emery and had features similar to the Rock and Roll version. The final hour is a time sweep of all of the country No. 1 songs from 1944 to late 1981/early 1982 (approximately 650 individual songs) according to the Billboard country charts.\\"Drake-Chenault History Of Country Music - FOUND!!!\\" Charis Music Group. Accessed 07-07-2017. Name Despite the program's popularity, the name \\"History of Rock & Roll\\" was not trademarked for more than 30 years‚Äîuntil the U.S. Patent and Trademark office finally granted the rights in 2014 to Gary Theroux Productions (producers of the current daily 2 1/2 minute feature version). As a result, various items came on the market that bear the name which had no connection to the radio program. These included various oldies compilations (such as a set of LP albums from Pickwick Records), books (such as a History of Rock and Roll college textbook, written by Tom Larson) and videos and DVDs (like a Time Life History of Rock and Roll DVD set). In addition, Rolling Stone magazine not only released a book with this phrase (The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll), but also had an early-1980s weekly radio series with some similarities to the classic 1978 special (Rolling Stone's Continuous History of Rock & Roll). Contents The award-winning 1978 version of the show opened with a quick reverse \\"Time Sweep\\", featuring clips from selected songs from the 1970s backwards to the 1950s. The 52-hour documentary covered the origins and development of the rock and roll genre through the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, culminating in a \\"Top Ten of Rock & Roll.\\" The program concluded with The History of Rock and Roll Time Sweep, a 45-minute collage of number one hits from January 1956 (Dean Martin's Memories Are Made Of This) to November 1977 (Debby Boone's \\"You Light Up My Life\\").

It is subdivided into 100 centimes. Since 1945, it has been part of the CFP franc. History Until 1873, the French franc circulated on New Caledonia. That year banknotes were issued specifically for use on the island which circulated along with French coins. In 1945, the CFP franc was introduced, with coins issued for New Caledonia from 1949. The CFP franc is also issued in French Polynesia and was used in the New Hebrides until 1983. Since 1985, banknotes have been issued common to both New Caledonia and French Polynesia, although separate coinages continue. Coins In 1949, aluminium 50 centimes, 1 and 2 francs were introduced, followed by aluminium 5 francs in 1952. The 50 centimes was only issued in 1949. In 1967, nickel 10, 20 and 50 francs were introduced, followed by nickel-bronze 100 francs in 1976. The overall design of the coins has not changed since their introduction and the obverse has always been identical to that of the coins of the French Polynesian franc. The only notable changes were the removal of the text \\"Union Fran√ßaise\\" after 1952 and the addition of the initials \\"I.E.O.M\\" (Institut d'√©mission d'Outre-Mer) to the obverse in 1972. There are currently seven denominations in circulation. Only the 50 centimes has ceased to circulate. The 1, 2 and 5 francs all feature the national bird, the kagu. The 10 francs features a boat of the indigenous tribes. The 20 francs features the heads of three cattle facing left. The 50 and 100 francs feature the same design. They have a hut of the indigenous peoples, with a palm tree behind it, and three palm leaves surrounding. Banknotes New Caledonia emergency stamp currency, 25 centimes (encapsulated, 1922) Between 1873 and 1878, the Compagnie de la Nouvelle Cal√©donie introduced 5 and 20 franc notes. These were followed in 1875 by notes of the Banque de la Nouvelle Cal√©donie in denominations of 5, 20, 100 and 500 francs. From the 1890s, the Banque de l'Indochine issued banknotes from Noum√©a in denominations of 5, 20, 100 and 500 francs. Between 1914 and 1923, postage stamps were used to make emergency issue currency.Cuhaj, 2010, p. 893. The first issues were pieces of cardboard to which stamps were affixed in denominations of 25 and 50 centimes, 1 and 2 francs, with the 50 centime denominations made from either a single 50 centime stamp or a 15 and a 35 centime stamp. The second issue from 1922 consisted of 25 and 50 centime stamps encapsulated in aluminum. Between 1918 and 1919, the Noum√©a Treasury introduced 50 centime, 1 and 2 franc notes. The Treasury again issued 50 centime, 1 and 2 franc notes in 1942 in the name of the Free French, with 5 and 20 franc notes added in 1943. In 1969, the Institut d'Emission d'Outre- Mer, Noum√©a took over the issuance of paper money, introducing notes for 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 francs. The 100 and 1000 franc notes have two variants. The earlier issue lacked the state title \\"R√©publique fran√ßaise\\". The 500 and 5000 franc notes have had the state title since their introductions. The 100 franc notes were replaced by coins in 1976. In 1985, 10,000 franc notes common to all the French Pacific Territories were introduced. These were followed, between 1992 and 1996, by 500, 1000 and 5000 franc notes for all of the French Pacific Territories. New banknotes were adopted from 20 February 2014, replacing the old notes that had been in use since 1969, which were finally phased out of circulation on 30 September 2014.http://en.visitnewcaledonia.com/new-cfp-franc-banknotes See also *CFP franc *French Polynesian franc *New Hebrides franc Notes References  * External links Category:Currencies of Oceania Category:Fixed exchange rate ","title":"New Caledonian franc"},{"id":"11775658","text":"A beitass, or a stretching pole, is a wooden spar used on Viking ships that was fitted into a pocket at the lower corner of the sail.

Today, he is probably best known as being one of the owners of the famous clipper ship, Flying Cloud. Family Anna Mary Wendell Minturn He was born to a family long prominent in New England and New York shipping circles. His father was William Minturn (Jr.) (1776‚Äì1818); his mother was Sarah Bowne, a descendant of John Bowne. William was \\"a well-known merchant shipper\\" and was one of the founders of the Mutual Fire Insurance Company of New York.Minthorn He is reported to have spent several years in the China trade, where there were enormous profits to be made. He was at various times in partnership with his brother Jonas and in the firm of Minturn and Champlin. After the failure of Minturn & Champlin, he took ill and died soon after, when Robert was in his early teens. It appears that Robert Minturn's grandfather, William Minturn (Sr.) (born Rhode Island, 18 March 1738; died Newport, Rhode Island, 23 August 1799), was one of the residents of Rhode Island who feared that the British would attempt to re-take their lost colonies after the American Revolution and moved his family and business to New York, believing it would be more protected from seaborne attack. He was one of the founders of Hudson, New York. In 1791 William again moved, this time to New York City, where the opportunities were greater (and shipping distances shorter). Soon he became wealthy: he, his son, grandson, and great grandson all garnered listings in the Encyclopedia of American Wealth. In 1799, his health failing, William Minturn returned to Rhode Island to retire but he died within the month. His widow (Penelope Greene, born 21 August 1746; died 6 April 1821, the daughter of Benjamin Greene and Niobe Paul and a third cousin once removed of General Nathanael Greene) returned to New York where she lived among her sons on Pearl Street.Poppino/Popenoe/Popnoe & Allied Families; [www.popenoe.com/Minturn-RI.htm II: The Rhode Island/NYC Minturns]. August 2007. Robert B. Minturn married Anna Mary Wendell (born ca. 1811) in June 1835. She was the daughter of John Lansing Wendell, a partner in Grinnell, Minturn & Co. Robert's sister Sarah married Henry Grinnell, who later became Robert's business partner.Poppino/Popenoe/Popnoe & Allied Families; [www.popenoe.com/Minturn-RI.htm II: The Rhode Island/NYC Minturns], No. 1143. August 2007. Career Robert Minturn received an English education, but he was forced by the death of his father to leave school; at the age of fourteen, he began work in a counting-house. He was received into partnership in 1825 with Charles Green, whose clerk he had been. In 1830, he entered the firm of Fish and Grinnell; his sister Sarah had married partner Henry Grinnell in 1822. In 1832, the firm was reorganized as Grinnell, Minturn & Co., or simply Grinnell & Minturn. That company was already established in the transatlantic packet trade, but it grew tremendously as the Great Irish Famine (1845‚Äì1849) led many to emigrate to North America. When the California gold rush caused a large increase in traffic to that state, Grinnell & Minturn established a shipping line to serve the market, and bought the Flying Cloud for that line; Robert Minturn actually owned a portion of the ship in his personal capacity. The success of Grinnell & Minturn made Robert Minturn a wealthy man, and his son Robert, Jr., joined the firm as well. Other activities In May 1848 (according to a memoir published by his son), an overworked Robert Minturn and his family took an eighteen-month grand tour of England, France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Jerusalem, and Egypt. He was inspired by both the beauty of the cities and the charitable efforts of their citizens in this regard. Robert Minturn declined all offers of public office, except the post of commissioner of emigration, which he accepted from a wish to secure the rights of emigrants. It seems unsurprising that his business prospered from the transportation of many immigrants to the United States. He was an active manager of many charitable associations in New York city, aided in establishing the Association for improving the condition of the poor, and was a founder of St. Luke's hospital. He was the first president of the Union League Club, which was formed when the Union Club membership was divided over support for President Lincoln and the Civil War. Robert Bowne Minturn and his wife donated land for the establishment of New York's Central Park, having been inspired by the beauty of foreign cities and their parks, as seen during his family's trip abroad in 1848‚Äì1849. Like his Quaker forebears, he was opposed to slavery. He is reported to have purchased a number of slaves for the purpose of setting them free,Kelley, Rev.

He was born around 1551, in Derbyshire. His father was a yeoman. He matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, in 1575, and remained there for two or three years, but left without taking a degree. He was admitted to the English College at Rheims on 25 November 1580, and the following September, he was ordained as a priest.Connelly, Roland. The Eighty- five Martyrs. Essex.

He was a very mild man, did much good in the country; for that he did much travel, and was beloved.

The raid was made for the purpose of arresting Fitzherbert; the finding of two priests was an unexpected bonus.Connelly, p. 37.

Whether or not Simpson was wavering, it is certain that he remained firm after his meeting with Garlick and Ludlam. The three priests were tried on 23 July 1588, were found guilty of treason, and were sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. The sentence was carried out the next day, at St Mary's Bridge, in Derby. Ludlam was the last of the three to be executed, and, according to eyewitnesses, stood smiling while the execution of Garlick was being carried out, and smiled still when his own turn came.Challoner, p. 131.

Although the primary motivation of salvage logging is economic, it has also been suggested that salvage logging may reduce erosion, reduce intensity of future wildfires, and slow buildup of pest insects. However, there is little evidence to support such claims, and most evidence supports the view that salvage logging is harmful to forest health and function. As with other logging operations, the harvesting may be either by selection, thinning or clearcutting, and a regeneration plan may be put in place after the logging. Salvage logging may include removal of remaining live trees in predominantly dead stands. Examples One highly publicized instance of salvage logging followed the Biscuit Fire in Oregon and California in 2002. Since the fire, the United States Forest Service has been salvaging burned timber in the area. The process was expedited when President George W. Bush signed the Healthy Forests Restoration Act allowing salvage logging to occur more quickly and with reduced threat of lawsuits.16 U.S. Code Chapter 84. Healthy Forests Restoration Acthttps://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/chapter-84 President Bill Clinton signed an earlier piece of legislation promoting salvage logging (commonly referred to as the Salvage Rider) as part of the Omnibus Rescissions Bill on July 27, 1995.Public Law 104-19 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Additional Disaster Assistance, for Anti-terrorism Initiatives, for Assistance in the Recovery from the Tragedy that Occurred at Oklahoma City, and the Rescissions Act 1995 http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ19/html/PLAW-104publ19.htm Forests across western North America impacted by recent mountain pine beetle infestations are currently being salvage logged. Salvage logging after windthrow is also common.  Ecological Impacts  Salvage logging is of particular concern ecologically because disturbed landscapes tend to be under appreciated and undervalued, and therefore more imperiled than other successional stages on the landscape. Concerns include simplification of forest structure, degradation and destruction of wildlife habitat, little or no impact to future fire risk, changes in nutrient cycling, and increased erosion. Salvage logging operations generally take the largest snags and surviving trees, leaving lower density stands dominated by small-diameter snags. Bird species diversity is negatively impacted by this structural change because cavity nesters preferentially nest in larger trees. Impacts on diversity of insect communities are mixed. While proponents of salvage logging argue that it reduces the harmful effects of future fires in the logged area, opponents maintain that the costs and benefits of salvage logging have not been scientifically studied, and that there is evidence the practice actually increases damage from future fires and reduces natural regeneration due to soil disturbance and the addition of logging slash. Erosion has not been shown to increase in salvage logged sites as compared to other burned areas except in extremely wet years. There is little evidence that nutrient loss is increased by salvage logging despite the removal of organic matter from the site. Controversy In the United States, salvage logging is a controversial issue for two main reasons. First, legal provisions for salvage logging can be used to justify cutting down damaged trees in areas that are otherwise protected from logging. Salvage logging may be exempt from most environmental laws including the Endangered Species Act, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, the National Forest Management Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Salvage logging may also encourage arson, either after a failed lumber sale or to gain permission to log in protected areas, such as old growth forest or regions set aside for the protection of endangered species.

The paper discussing their work was voted in 2006 as one of the five most important papers published by the American Institute of Physics since its founding 75 years ago. In addition to the invention of transistor laser, he is also well known for inventions of other \\"major breakthrough\\" devices, including the world's fastest transistor and light-emitting transistor (LET). As of May, 2009 he is a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign and holds the Nick Holonyak Jr. Endowed Chair Professorship. Feng was born and raised in Taiwan. Inventions World's fastest transistor In 2003, Milton Feng and his graduate students Walid Hafez and Jie-Wei Lai broke the record for the world's fastest transistor. Their device, made of indium phosphide and indium gallium arsenide with 25 nm thick base and 75 nm thick collector, marked a frequency of 509 GHz, which was 57 GHz faster than the previous record. In 2005, they succeeded in fabricating a device at Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory to break their own record, reaching 604 GHz. In 2006, Feng and his other graduate student William Snodgrass fabricated an indium phosphide and indium gallium arsenide device with 12.5 nm thick base, operating at 765 GHz at room temperature and 845 GHz at -55 ¬∞C. Light-emitting transistor Reported in the January 5 issue of the journal Applied Physics Letters in 2004, Milton Feng and Nick Holonyak, the inventor of the first practical light-emitting diode (LED) and the first semiconductor laser to operate in the visible spectrum, made the world's first light- emitting transistor. This hybrid device, fabricated by Feng's graduate student Walid Hafez, had one electrical input and two outputs (electrical output and optical output) and operated at a frequency of 1 MHz. The device was made of indium gallium phosphide, indium gallium arsenide, and gallium arsenide, and emitted infrared photons from the base layer. Transistor laser Described in the November 15 issue of the journal Applied Physics Letters in 2004, Milton Feng, Nick Holonyak, postdoctoral research associate Gabriel Walter, and graduate research assistant Richard Chan demonstrated operation of the first heterojunction bipolar transistor laser by incorporating a quantum well in the active region of a light-emitting transistor. As with a light-emitting transistor, the transistor laser was made of indium gallium phosphide, indium gallium arsenide, and gallium arsenide, but emitted a coherent beam by stimulated emission, which differed from their previous device that only emitted incoherent photons. Despite their success, the device was not useful for practical purposes since it only operated at low temperatures - about minus 75 Celsius degrees. Within a year, though, the researchers finally fabricated a transistor laser operating at room temperature by using metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), as reported in the September 26 issue of the same journal. At this time, the transistor laser had a 14-layer structure including aluminium gallium arsenide optical confining layers and indium gallium arsenide quantum wells. The emitting cavity was 2,200 nm wide and 0.85 mm long, and had continuous modes at 1,000 nm. In addition, it had a threshold current of 40 mA and direct modulation of the laser at 3 GHz. Recognition *In 2006, Transistor laser was the most popular Top 10-Science Story (rank #4) on EurekAlert by American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). *In 2006, American Institute of Physics selected \\"Room Temperature Continuous Wave Operation of a Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor Laser\\" as top 5 paper published in the 43 years history of Applied Physics Letters. *In 2005, Discover Magazine selected Transistor Laser as top 100 most important discovery.

It was the first plane of Polish design put into production. Design and development The aircraft was designed by Ryszard Bartel in the Samolot factory in Pozna≈Ñ. It was a development of the Bartel BM.2, which did not advance beyond the prototype stage. Thanks to a lower weight than the BM.2, it could use lower-powered engines, so its performance was actually improved. Its performance was also superior to the Hanriot H.28, used by the Poles and licence-built by Samolot. The BM.4 prototype was flown on 20 December 1927 in Pozna≈Ñ. It had good handling and stability and was resistant to spinning. A distinguishing feature of all Bartels was an upper wing of a shorter span, because lower and upper wing halves were interchangeable (i.e. the lower wingspan included the width of the fuselage). The first prototype was designated BM.4b and was fitted with Walter Vega radial engine. The second prototype, flown on 2 April 1928, was designated BM.4d and fitted with the Polish experimental WZ-7 radial engine, then refitted with Le Rh√¥ne 9C rotary engine and redesignated BM.4a. The BM.4a became a production variant, because the Polish Air Force had a store of Le Rh√¥ne 9C engines. 22 aircraft were ordered and built in 1928‚Äì1929 with cowled engines which made it different from all other BM.4s with radial engines. Three BM.4a's were converted to BM.4e of 1930 with the Polish experimental Peterlot radial engine, the BM.4f of 1931 with the Polish experimental Skoda G-594 Czarny Piotru≈õ radial engine, and the BM.4g of 1931 with a de Havilland Gipsy I inline engine, which competed against the RWD-8 in a search for a standard trainer aircraft, but was not selected. After tests in 1932, all three reverted to Le Rh√¥ne 9C engines. Due to the Samolot factory's closure in 1930, the BM.4h was developed at the PWS (Podlaska Wytw√≥rnia Samolot√≥w) and built there in 1932 in a series of about 50 aircraft. Description Wooden construction biplane, conventional in layout. Fuselage rectangular in cross- section, plywood covered (engine section - metal covered). Rectangular two- spar wings, plywood and canvas covered. Crew of two, sitting in tandem in open cockpits, with individual windshields. Cockpits with dual controls, instructor's at rear. Fixed landing gear, with a rear skid. Operational history BM.4a's were used in the Polish Air Force from 1929 - in pilots' school in Bydgoszcz. 6 burnt in September 1929 in the Samolot factory. BM.4h's were used in the Polish Air Force from 1932, in schools in Bydgoszcz and Dƒôblin. They only partly replaced Hanriot H.28s and were themselves replaced with the RWD 8. They had military numbers starting with 33. In 1936 the Polish Air Force handed over their remaining 23 BM.4h's to civilian aviation - most to regional aero clubs, some to the Ministry of Communication. They received registrations SP-BBP - BBZ and from a range SP-ARB to ARZ.

Ewing; and commissioned on 5 September 1944 with Lieutenant Franklin J. Ewers, USCGR, in command. Service history During World War II, LST-762 was assigned to the Asiatic-Pacific theater and participated in the assault and occupation of Okinawa Gunto in April 1945. Following the war, she performed occupation duty in the Far East until mid-November 1945. The ship was decommissioned in March 1946, and reactivated on 3 November 1950 for service in the Korean War. In 1953-54 LST-762 was assigned to TF-7, providing support for the Castle-series of nuclear weapons tests. LST-762 transported the Castle-Bravo device, the first H-bomb, to the test site on Bikini Atoll, and was moored at Eniwitok Atoll some 38 miles away when the device was detonated on 1 March 1955. On 1 July 1955 she was redesignated USS Floyd County (LST-762). Following the Korean War, she operated with the Pacific Fleet Amphibious Force, including extensive service off South Vietnam from 1965 through 1968. During July 1965 she escorted the 9 Point-class cutters of Coast Guard Squadron One, Division 11, from U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay to An Thoi Naval Base, Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam and served for a short period as their support ship after reaching the island.Larzelere, p 22 Floyd County completed two further deployments to Vietnam 1966-1968 including supplying riverine warfare bases on the Mekong River, serving as mother ship for the pioneer group of 12 PBR gunboats with crews at Cat Lo Naval Base, near V≈©ng T√†u. For a short period in 1966 she was anchored in V≈©ng T√†u Harbor, Vietnam, serving as a base of operations for a U.S. Army gunship fire team from the 197th Armed Helicopter Company. The fire team had been assigned to provide air cover for Navy Swift Boat operations prior to the arrival Navy Seal Wolf gunships. later she provided material support from Da Nang to the U.S. Marine Corps C·ª≠a Vi·ªát Base, immediately south of the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone. Floyd County returned from her final Vietnam deployment November 1968. Floyd County was again decommissioned on 3 September 1969. Laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet, the ship was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 April 1975. LST-762 earned one battle star for World War II service, one for the Korean War, and three battle stars and an award of the Meritorious Unit Commendation for service in the Vietnam War. Commercial career Sold for scrapping on 1 December 1975 by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service, the ship was again sold to Max Rouse & Sons of Beverly Hills, California on 4 December 1975. Taken in hand by Lake Union Dry Dock Company of Seattle, Washington and converted for commercial use, the ship was sold to Landing System Technology Pte.

The virtual carrier-sensing is a logical abstraction which limits the need for physical carrier-sensing at the air interface in order to save power. The MAC layer frame headers contain a duration field that specifies the transmission time required for the frame, in which time the medium will be busy. The stations listening on the wireless medium read the Duration field and set their NAV, which is an indicator for a station on how long it must defer from accessing the medium. The NAV may be thought of as a counter, which counts down to zero at a uniform rate. When the counter is zero, the virtual carrier-sensing indication is that the medium is idle; when nonzero, the indication is busy. The medium shall be determined to be busy when the station (STA) is transmitting. In IEEE 802.11, the NAV represents the number of microseconds the sending STA intends to hold the medium busy (maximum of 32,767 microseconds). When the sender sends a Request to Send the receiver waits one SIFS before sending Clear to Send. Then the sender will wait again one SIFS before sending all the data. Again the receiver will wait a SIFS before sending ACK. So NAV is the duration from the first SIFS to the ending of ACK. During this time the medium is considered busy. Wireless stations are often battery-powered, so to conserve power the stations may enter a power-saving mode. A station decrements its NAV counter until it becomes zero, at which time it is awakened to sense the medium again. The NAV virtual carrier sensing mechanism is a prominent part of the CSMA/CA MAC protocol used with IEEE 802.11 WLANs. NAV is used in DCF, PCF and HCF.

His mother was Louisa Caroline Harcourt, a daughter of Henry Seymour one of the Tory MPs for Taunton. Two of his uncles, Henry Danby Seymour and Alfred Seymour, were also MPs.George Rawlinson, A Memoir of Major- General Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson, p. 243. His older brother became General Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson, who masterminded the Battle of Amiens and the Hundred Days Offensive that brought the fighting of the First World War to a close.

He was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, after which he was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant into the 17th Lancers.Mosley, Charles (Editor), Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th Edition 2003, Volume III , p. 3292 Sportsman Rawlinson was a top-level polo player; he was in the winning teams for the inter-regimental tournament in India in 1889, the Hurlingham Champion Cup in 1896 and 1902, also the Ranelagh Open Cup, the All Ireland Open Cup and others. In the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, he was a member of the Foxhunters Hurlingham polo team which won the Olympic gold medal. He retired from the sport in 1911. Rawlinson was also a keen motor racing driver, resigning from the army to concentrate on the sport. He took part in the 1908 Isle of Man RAC Tourist Trophy (\\"TT\\") race, driving his Darracq into 7th place.Results of the Isle of Man 1908 TT race On 5 April 1910 Rawlinson became only the third person in the United Kingdom to hold a Royal Aero Club aviators certificate.Flight 9 April 1910 France, 1914‚Äì15 At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Rawlinson was 47 and too old to be called up as a reservist. He therefore offered himself and his Hudson sports car to the Royal Automobile Club, who were assembling an \\"RAC Corps of Volunteer Motor Drivers\\". Rawlinson was one of twenty-five motorists selected to accompany the British Expeditionary Force to the continent to act as chauffeurs and dispatch carriers for the General Staff. He and the other drivers worked with the British Army in the first battles of the war, his car being adapted by the addition of a machine gun and flying a Union Jack. By October, he had been transferred to a staff position with IV Corps (which was commanded by his brother) and had been given the rank of colonel by Sir John French, despite having left the cavalry as a subaltern. His driving exploits were described in his Adventures on the Western Front, August, 1914 ‚Äì June, 1915 (1925). In the trench warfare that had developed, it became apparent that the British had nothing to match the German Minenwerfer. While an effective British weapon was in development, Rawlinson acquired 40 obsolete Coehorn mortars from the French army which became known as \\"Toby mortars\\" after him; they were first used in action at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915. On 9 May 1915, Rawlinson was injured by a German heavy shell at the Battle of Aubers Ridge and returned to England.Rawlinson, Alfred, Sir, The Defence of London, 1915‚Äì1918, 1923 (p.3) While recovering at home on 20 June, he was visited by a staff officer from the War Office with a message stating that commissions could not be issued in the field and that he could not consider himself a serving officer. Despite being \\"hurt to the very soul\\" by the manner of his dismissal, Rawlinson went straight to the Admiralty and volunteered his services.Rawlinson 1925, pp. 314-315 Air defence of London, 1915‚Äì17 Rawlinson (extreme left) with one of the anti-aircraft guns of the Royal Naval Anti-Aircraft Mobile Brigade, a towed QF 3-inch 20 cwt. On 20 June 1915, Rawlinson was appointed a lieutenant-commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and tasked with raising a new squadron of the RNAS Armoured Car Section. However, in August, he was interviewed by Commodore Murray Sueter RN, who was the commander of London's anti-aircraft defences. Owing to previous experience in the air defence of Paris, Rawlinson was \\"invited\\", in his spare time, to suggest improvements to the weapons and ammunition in use, as they had proved ineffective in the first Zeppelin attacks on London in the previous weeks.Rawlinson, The Defence of London, pp.6‚Äì8) In September, he was placed under the direct command of Admiral Sir Percy Scott, who had been ordered to establish the London Air Defence Area. Rawlinson was tasked with forming a mobile anti-aircraft battery, using picked men from his armoured car squadron. He set off at once for France, in the hope of obtaining an example of the lorry-mounted Autocanon de 75 mm 1913 anti-aircraft gun and returned to London with one within 72 hours.Rawlinson, The Defence of London, pp.9‚Äì19 This weapon became the nucleus of the Royal Naval Anti-Aircraft Mobile Brigade, under Rawlinson's personal command; it was first used in action against a Zeppelin on 13 October at Moorgate in the City of London.Rawlinson, The Defence of London, pp.30‚Äì31 Eventually, the brigade was armed with four French 75mms, two QF 3 inch 20 cwts, and eight QF 3 pounder Vickers with four powerful searchlights, all mounted on lorries.Rawlinson, The Defence of London, pp.44‚Äì4 Operating from the stables at Kenwood House, the guns could be rushed to prepared positions around the capital at very short notice. When the army took over the air defence of London in February 1916, the RNVR continued to operate the mobile guns under Army command.Rawlinson, The Defence of London, p.57 In August 1916, the brigade relocated to Norfolk, with the intention of intercepting the Zeppelins as they crossed the coast.Rawlinson, The Defence of London, pp.88‚Äì89 Throughout this time, Rawlinson was continually refining the techniques of anti-aircraft gunnery, and claimed to have pioneered the use of acoustic location in detecting aircraft hidden by cloud. Rawlinson, The Defence of London, Rawlinson, pp. 110‚Äì114 In January 1917, the brigade moved to the coast of Essex to counter the threat from German aeroplanes. In May 1917, Rawlinson was offered command of the newly created Western Sub-Command of the London defences, which required a transfer back to the army, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. His new command consisted of 19 gun and 36 searchlight positions. He commanded these assets during the heavy air raids of late 1917. Intelligence Corps In January 1918, Rawlinson tendered his resignation and sought a post in pursuance of \\"an ardent desire to once more get a little closer to the enemy\\". In February, he obtained a transfer to the Intelligence Corps with the rank of colonel.Rawlinson, The Defence of London, pp.238‚Äì242 Assignments include tours of duty in the Caucasus and Eastern Anatolia during 1918‚Äì1922. His mission was to guard the Tiflis-Baku railway, and to oversee the demobilizing of Turkish forces.Merrill D.

Under Lionel Dunsterville, he was sent on a mission to the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus.Moshe Gammer, The Lone Wolf and the Bear: Three Centuries of Chechen Defiance of Russian Rule, p. 127. On his last assignment, to establish whether Turkey was obeying the armistice conditions, Rawlinson and his party were held prisoner in Erzurum by the Turkish authorities, placing the British Government in an awkward position, because his elder brother was a high-ranking military officer.Gary Jonathan Bass, Stay the Hand of Vengeance: The Politics of War Crimes Tribunals, p. 139. He was eventually released in a prisoner exchange in 1921. His book Adventures in the Near East (1923), chronicles the state of affairs during the armistice days at the end of World War I. In particular, he gives accounts of the landscape after the Russian withdrawal and the beginnings of the Turkish nationalist movement.Rawlinson, Adventures in the Near East (London: Andrew Melrose, 1923) Private life On 25 June 1890, Alfred Rawlinson married Margarette Kennard, the 6th daughter of William Bunce Greenfield DL. They had four children; twins Alfred Frederick and Honour Louisa were born on 23 August 1900. Honour died aged 12. They had a second daughter, Irene Margarette (died 1974) and a third, Mary, who also died in infancy. Margarette Rawlinson died on 18 September 1907 aged about 49. On 13 December 1913, Rawlinson married secondly Jean Isabella Griffin Aitkin, an actress also known by her stage name of Jean Aylwin. They were divorced in 1924; the composer Hubert Bath was named as co-respondent in the case.Burke's Peerage 2003 When Rawlinson‚Äôs older brother died on 28 March 1925, he became the 3rd baronet, but did not inherit the peerage created for his brother, which became extinct.

He was the first surgeon to perform a successful internal fixation of proximal femur fractures. In 1887, he published a paper on the cause of loose bodies in the joint. In his paper, K√∂nig concluded: # That trauma had to be very severe to break off parts of the joint surface. # That lesser degrees of trauma might contuse the bone to cause an area of necrosis which might then separate. # That in some cases, the absence of trauma worth mentioning made it likely that there existed some spontaneous cause of separation.

He recorded for various labels, including Sun, Chess, and Vee-Jay before forming his own, Tarpon Records, where he recorded Denise LaSalle and Matt \\"Guitar\\" Murphy. He has worked with blues musicians, such as Earl Hooker, Lonnie Brooks, Sonny Boy Williamson II, and Robert Knighthawk. Life and career Emerson, who is African American, was born in Tarpon Springs, Florida on December 21, 1925. He learned the piano in church, playing in various local bands. In 1943, he joined the United States Navy. After World War II he began resumed playing around Tampa with acts such as Ivory Mitchell, the Billy Battle Band, and Alfonso Brown Band. Following a spell in one group where the members dressed as outlaws, he picked up the nickname \\"Billy The Kid\\". Emerson received an athletic scholarship to attend Florida A&M; University, but left to joined the United States Air Force during the Korean War in 1952. While stationed in Greenville, Mississippi, he met bandleader Ike Turner, who recruited him into his Kings of Rhythm. Turner, a talent scout for Sun Records, arranged a session for Emerson. His first single, \\"No Teasing Around\\" / \\"If Lovin' Is Believing\\" was released in February 1954. He released another single backed by Turner on guitar before leaving his band and joining a group led by Phineas Newborn. He stayed with Sun as a songwriter, writing and recording \\"When It Rains, It Really Pours\\", later recorded by Elvis Presley, and \\"Red Hot\\", which later became a hit for both Billy Lee Riley and Bob Luman but was not a commercial success for Emerson. In late 1955 he joined Vee-Jay Records in Chicago, making records such as \\"Every Woman I Know (Crazy 'Bout Automobiles)\\", released a year later but with little commercial success. The song was subsequently covered in 1965 by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs on their Wooly Bully album and by Ry Cooder on his 1980 album Borderline. Soon afterwards Emerson joined Chess Records as the recording manager. On the Chess label he recorded \\"Holy Mackerel Baby\\" and a remake of \\"Woodchuck\\" which was an earlier Sun single. He also released a single with Willie Dixon's band. As a songwriter, Emerson wrote dozens of songs for artists such as Junior Wells, Willie Mabon, Wynonie Harris, and Buddy Guy. After recording for several smaller labels, he formed his own Tarpon Records in 1966, releasing Denise LaSalle's debut single as well as his own records. He also continued to play in clubs and on European blues tours. In the late 1970s, Emerson decided to dedicate himself to his religion and compose gospel music. In 2005 he was reported as having a church in Oak Park, Illinois, as Rev. William R. Emerson. In 2009, Bear Family Records released a 33-track compilation album of Emerson's Sun recordings, Red Hot: The Sun Years, Plus. The plus includes his Vee Jay and Chess singles.

The team's colors were red and blue. History The Hustle played in all three WBL seasons and led the league in attendance each year. The WBL's inaugural game was played on Dec. 9, 1978 in Milwaukee, with the Hustle defeating the Milwaukee Does 92-87 before a crowd of 7,824. In their first season, the Hustle tied the Iowa Cornets for the Midwest Division title, but Iowa had home-court advantage for the playoffs and won the series 2 games to 1. Rita Easterling was the WBL's Most Valuable Player that first year and led the league in assists. Debbie Waddy-Rossow (cousin of Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Billy Waddy) was the league's leading scorer. Easterling was voted MVP of the league's first All-Star Game in 1979, which was played at Madison Square Garden. In their second year, the Hustle missed the playoffs. Coach Doug Bruno left to become an assistant to Gene Sullivan for Loyola University of Chicago's men's team and is now the DePaul women's team coach. In the third and final season, the Hustle added Inge Nissen from Old Dominion University and veteran Donna Geils (now Orender), who from 2005-10 served as president of the WNBA. The team's play-by-play announcer for all three seasons was Les Grobstein, who is now is the radio voice of the WNBA's Chicago Sky. End of WBL The WBL disbanded in 1981 because of financial problems throughout the league, mostly due to owners who did not pay their bills and who bounced several payroll checks to players and other employees. In 1981, the Minnesota Fillies players who were promised paychecks by Commissioner Sherwin Fischer, only to have him not follow through, walked off the court in Chicago ten minutes before a scheduled game with the Hustle. The game was not played despite a full house at DePaul Alumni Hall, and before long it became clear that the WBL was doomed.

It was a development of the Bellanca CH-200, fitted with a more powerful engine and, like the CH-200, soon became renowned for its long-distance endurance. Design and development Bellanca further developed the earlier CH-200 to create the CH-300 Pacemaker. The CH-300 was a conventional, high-wing braced monoplane with fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Like other Bellanca aircraft of the period, it featured \\"flying struts\\". While the CH-200 was powered by 220 hp Wright J-5 engines, the CH-300 series Pacemakers were powered by 300 hp Wright J-6s. Late in the series, some -300s were fitted with 420 hp Pratt & Whitney Wasps, leading to the CH-400 Skyrocket series. Operational history Hawaiian Airlines restored their first Bellanca, NC-251M, seen flying over Honolulu International Airport Pacemakers were renowned for their long- distance capabilities as well as reliability and weight-lifting attributes, which contributed to their successful operation throughout the world. In 1929, George Haldeman completed the first nonstop flight from New York to Cuba in 12 hours, 56 minutes, flying an early CH-300 (c. 1,310 miles, 101.3 mph). In 1931, a Bellanca fitted with a Packard DR-980 diesel, piloted by Walter Lees and Frederick Brossy, set a record for staying aloft for 84 hours and 33 minutes without being refuelled. This record was not broken until 55 years later. In Alaska and the Canadian bush, Bellancas were very popular. Canadian- operated Bellancas were initially imported from the United States, but later, six were built by Canadian Vickers in Montreal and delivered to the RCAF (added to the first order of 29 made in 1929), which used them mainly for aerial photography. In May 1964, Capt. A.G.K.(Gath) Edward, a senior Air Canada pilot, and Ken Molson (the then curator of the Aviation Museum of Canada based at Rockcliffe) traveled to Juneau Alaska to ferry Bellanca Pacemaker NC3005 back to the museum which had obtained the aircraft. Edward had flown a similar model of the Pacemaker floatplane for General Airways starting in June 1935 during his bushflying days. He and Molson delivered it to its final resting place in the museum on May 30, 1964, after a trip taking five days and just over 30 hours of flight time. The aircraft was reregistered CF-ATN as the original registered a/c was destroyed in an accident in June 1938. Record attempts One of the first records set by a Bellanca CH-300 series aircraft occurred on July 28‚Äì30, 1931, when Russell Norton Boardman (age 33) and John Louis Polando (age 29) flew from Floyd Bennett Field ‚Äî a famous New York City-area early airport on western Long Island from which many record flights originated ‚Äî to Istanbul, Turkey aboard an earlier model of the Wright R-975-powered CH-300, a Bellanca \\"Special J-300\\" high-wing monoplane named Cape Cod, registration NR761W, making it safely to Istanbul nonstop in 49:20 hours, establishing a distance record of , the first known nonstop record flight in aviation history whose distance surpassed either the English (5,000 mi) or metric (8,000 km) mark. On June 3, 1932, Stanislaus F. Hausner, flying a Bellanca CH Pacemaker named Rose Marie, powered by a 300-hp Wright J-6, attempted a transatlantic flight from Floyd Bennett Field, New York, to Warsaw, Poland. The attempt failed when he made a forced landing at sea; he was rescued by a British tanker eight days later.\\"The Golden Age of Aviation at Floyd Bennett Field: The 1930s.\\"Gateway National Recreation Area, September 11, 2007.

It serves the Franklin Line, and is located slightly south of downtown Norwood. It is a major park-and-ride location for Boston's southwest suburbs; with 1,041 daily riders it is the busiest station on the line outside Boston. Norwood Central has two side platforms, each with a mini-high section making the station accessible. History Norwood Central station in 1906 The Norfolk County Railroad opened from to Walpole on April 23, 1849. South Dedham was originally the only station in what is now Norwood (then part of Dedham). Dedham Middle station, a small wooden building, was added around 1852. It was renamed Norwood Central in 1872 when Norwood separated from Dedham. A new one- story brick station building was constructed by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1899. It was similar to no-longer-extant stations built around the same time at Forest Hills, Atlantic, Quincy, and Warren. Unusually, the downspouts are built into the brickwork rather than affixed internally. Norwood Central is still served by the MBTA Commuter Rail Franklin Line, but the station building is now occupied by businesses. An MBTA project around 1990 included reonvation of the station building and acccessible mini-high platforms. When Boston‚Äì service for Gillette Stadium events was moved to the Franklin Line in 1994, Norwood Central and stations were intermediate stops. Norwood Central was dropped from these trains beginning with the 2011 season.

Their three subjects are the Ascension of Christ (86 by 42.5 cm), Adoration of the Magi the largest and central panel (76 by 76.5 cm) and the Circumcision of Christ (86 by 42.5 cm). They were gathered as a trio in the 19th century, although some art historians doubt that they were created as a triptych set in the way they are now arranged. They are now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. History Most scholars agree the three works were commissioned in the 1460s for Ludovico III Gonzaga's private chapel in the Castle of St. George in Mantua (together with the Death of the Virgin, now in the Museo del Prado, and Christ Bearing the Soul of the Virgin, now in Ferrara). The paintings for the chapel are mentioned in two letters from Mantegna to Ludovico dated April 1464 and in Vasari as \\"a painting [by Mantegna], in which are scenes with small but very beautiful figures ... in the castle at Mantua, for the chapel\\". Other scholars such as Fiocco argue that there is no evidence for how the three works got from Mantua to Florence and that they were instead produced in Tuscany during one of Mantegna's two trips there in 1466 and 1467. Stylistic reasons, however, link the work to Mantegna's final period in Padua, which ended in 1459, rather than to his maturity in Mantua. The first secure reference to the three paintings dates to 1587, when it was found cut up in Valle Muggia near Pistoia among the belongings of Don Antonio de' Medici. They were inherited before in 1632 entering the collection of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, where the Adoration was misattributed to Botticelli. The three works were exhibited together from 1827, with a gilded new neo-Renaissance intaglio frame which compensated for the differing sizes of the central work and the side panels. Most modern critics note the differences between the three works, including their form, format, setting and quality, especially between the Circumcision and the other two works. Roberto Longhi doubted that the three works were conceived as a single unified triptych and theorised that instead they all came from different locations in the same chapel, as did Death of the Virgin and Christ Bearing the Soul of the Virgin. According to Longhi, Circumcision replaced Death of the Virgin when it was decided to limit the scheme solely to scenes from Christ's life. Adoration The Adoration The panel was probably located in the chapel's apse. The Magi are depicted while descending to the Child's grotto from a path carved out in the rock. The Virgin is portrayed with a crown of angels, according to a Byzantine model.

Sculpture to Elcano in the Plaza de Cuba near the Guadalquivir. Los Remedios is a district of Seville, the regional capital of Andalusia, Spain. It is located on the Isla de La Cartuja, south of the district of Triana, between two forks of the Guadalquivir river. It is linked by bridge to the city centre (Casco Antiguo) and the districts of Distrito Sur and Bellavista-La Palmera. From the western side of the island, it is linked by road bridge to the city of San Juan de Aznalfarache and shares a boundary in the Guadalquivir with the city of Gelves. The southern tip of La Cartuja is opposite the municipality of Dos Hermanas. Los Remedios takes its name from a Carmelite convent of the same name found in the district. Before urban development in the latter half of the 20th century, the convent was one of the few structures in what is now Los Remedios. The Port of Seville has been located in this district since silting forced it to leave the El Arenal neighbourhood in the city centre. History In 1945 the Avenida de la Republica Argentina was built and was to become, in the next two decades, the district's main artery into the centre of Seville. The avenue runs like a dividing line between Triana and Los Remedios, ending at Plaza de Cuba, where the Puente San Telmo carries traffic over to Puerta de Jerez on the other side of the Guadalquivir. In the 1960s a large-scale urbanization took place, and the new residential construction led to the city's first planned neighbourhood. It is overwhelmingly residential in character, and when it was built it attracted many upper-middle class residents. Today the main commercial thoroughfares are the Avenida de la Republica Argentina and Calle Asuncion. Sites The Recinto Ferial, where Seville's Feria de Abril is held, is located in Los Remedios, outside its street grid near its southwestern end. A new fairground is being developed, however, in Charco de la Pava in La Cartuja. The Seville Metro currently has 2 stations along the periphery of Los Remedios. Line 1 serves the Parque del Principe and Plaza de Cuba stations, also Line 4 will serve the Virgen de Oliva station. Line 1 runs in a SW-SE arc from one suburb to another, running through central Seville. Line 4 will be the sole circular line and is expected to open in 2017.

Landis about an expedition to Mars, published by Tor Books in 2000.Macmillan U.S., Mars Crossing, Tor Books 2000 (accessed March 14, 2013) The novel was a nominee for the Nebula award, and won the Locus Award for best first novel in 2001. The characters in the novel are members of the third expedition to Mars, following the failures of earlier Brazilian and American expeditions. The mission plan is based on the Mars Direct concept, where fuel is manufactured from the Martian atmosphere; the Brazilian Mars expedition selected a polar landing. The book was released by Tor Books, a division of Macmillan USA, as a hardcover in December 2000, with the Science Fiction Book Club edition published in 2001.

Reception Locus reviewer Jonathan Strahan praised the book as \\"a strong first novel,\\" saying \\"the real strength of Mars Crossing has less to do with realistic portrayals of science at work, though there is plenty of that, and more to do with Landis's characters and the drama they face.\\"\\"Locus Looks at Books: Reviews by Jonathan Strahan\\", Locus, December 2000, p.59 Kirkus Reviews expressed the opposite opinion, however, saying, \\"When focused on the planet, the engineering, and the epic trek, Landis writes evocatively and with authority; the melodramatic baggage‚Äîdark pasts, evil deeds, sinister plots‚Äîjust drags along behind, raising the dust.\\"Mars Crossing, Kirkus, December 2000 (accessed March 14, 2013).

In his extended essay \\"The Renewal of Hard Science Fiction\\", David M.

The Norwegian heritage of the ELS is evident in this hymnal, although a broader ethnicity is clearly represented. From the indexes located in the back of the hymnary, on pages 926ff entitled \\"Translated Hymns\\", it is clear that the majority of the hymns come from German, Scandinavian and Latin sources, however Greek, Czech, French, and other sources are also present. The cover of this hymnary is black with a gold imprinted logo on the front cover. The logo used is a Latin cross with budded arms superimposed over a lyre, on a diamond-shaped background. Inside these covers one finds more than hymn texts: The Church Year is summarized; followed by the full texts of the Augsburg Confession; the texts of the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed; and the Small Catechism by Dr. Martin Luther. Prayers are included as well as four different rites of The Divine Service. The Divine Service: Rite One is based on the Danish Ritual of 1685; The Divine Service Rite Two is from the Common Service from 1888; The Divine Service: Rite Three is a new setting by Dr. Alfred Fremder; and The Divine Service: Rite Four is the Lutheran \\"Chorale Mass\\". Other services included here are The Office of the Prime, Matins, Vespers, Compline, and others. A Service of Private Confession and Absolution is also included. Psalms, canticles, and other resources are also found here. While most American Lutherans are familiar with a joint confession of sins followed by a spoken absolution from the pastor, this hymnary features an optional Individual Absolution (on page 43). Before each worshipper hears the word of absolution, the pastor says, \\"Upon this your confession, come forward to the altar of the Lord and receive the declaration of the forgiveness of all your sins. The communicants come forward and kneel at the altar rail.\\" A total of 602 hymns appear in this work. Some appear merely as lyrics with only a suggested tune listed, others include musical notation. The text is enriched by language like that in the New King James Version.

History The school is named for John Coffee Hays, a frontier defender, Texas Ranger and hero to those he fought to protect. He achieved fame after leaving Texas in 1849 for California, where he became the first elected sheriff of San Francisco and helped found the city of Oakland. Hays High School was formed by the consolidation of Buda, Kyle and Wimberley high schools in 1968. In 1986, the Wimberley community was released from the Hays Consolidated School District and reformed Wimberley High School. A further split occurred with the opening of Lehman High School in neighboring Kyle in the fall of 2004. Mascot The school mascot is a Yosemite Sam-like character dressed in the standard gray uniform of the Army of the Confederate States of America known as \\"Colonel Jack\\". While \\"Colonel Jack\\" formerly wielded dual revolvers and a confederate flag belt buckle, he is currently shown with a Texas flag in his left hand and a white flag bearing an H in his right with a script R on his belt buckle. As with other institutions which draw upon confederate imagery, Hays High School encountered controversy on and off for years before ultimately discarding the confederate flag as an official symbol in 2000 and banning it from official functions entirely in 2012, followed by retiring Dixie as a fight song in 2015 and replacing it with the school's original fight song, On, Wisconsin!.

Plot As the U.S. Subic Bay naval base's operations slowly wind down and naval manpower begins to dwindle, Commander Hamilton (Wolfgang Bodison) relies on three U.S. Navy SEALs to help keep the base secure. William Hawk (John Haymes Newton), a longtime American sailor nearing the end of a tour of duty, is involved with a Filipina, Lisa Velasquez (Nanette Medved), a representative of the mayor's office in nearby Olongapo City. Lisa has to deal with the economic crisis that the base's closing will bring to her community, as well as her own personal problems brought on by Hawk's imminent departure and the strained relationship of her mother, Anna (Daria Ramirez), and stepfather, Ed (James Brolin). Paul Bladon (Alexis Arquette), another Navy SEAL at the Subic Bay base, is the son of a U.S. Senator (Michael York), who will be visiting Subic Bay for the base's closing ceremonies. Senator Bladon is bringing along Paul's American girlfriend Angela (Maureen Flannigan), though Paul has fallen in love with a Filipina, Emma (Alma Concepcion), a former prostitute who now plans to marry Paul. The third Navy SEAL, John Stryzack (Corin Nemec), is furious over what he sees as America's betrayal of its responsibilities in the Philippines; he winds up behind bars after a violent incident, but he plans to escape to assassinate Senator Bladon, whom he believes is responsible for the closing of the base.

It began as a catalog of sexual aids for people with disabilities at a time when the disability rights movement was in its infancy. Xandria was also one of the first companies to sell sex-related items online. The business closed in 2016 when Lawrence Research Group, Inc., which operated the business, filed for dissolution with the Nevada Secretary of State. Xandria History Xandria was founded in 1974 by Gaye Raymond, a San Francisco physical therapy professor, and her husband, Victoria's Secret founder Roy Raymond.Roy Raymond, 47; Began Victoria's Secret The New York Times, Obituaries, 2 Sept. 1993. Gaye Raymond's philosophy was that people with disabilities should be able to enjoy as much of life as possible, including an active sex life. Xandria began as a catalog-based distributor of sexual aids for people with physical and developmental disabilities. The original Xandria Collection offered mostly educational adult videos and books, as well as vibrators and sex toys that were easier to grasp and maneuver by people who had physical impairments due to an amputation or illness. The company's guarantee of privacy, product quality and personal satisfaction helped it develop a following among the general public, especially among those who didn't want to be seen entering their local porn shop.The Kathy and Judy Show on Chicago's 720 WGN Radio Xandria's products were shipped in discreet packages that did not bear the company's name. Customers could request a refund within 60 days if they were not satisfied with their sex toys for any reason.Xandria‚Äôs 3-Way Guarantee Gaye and Roy Raymond sold the Xandria Collection in 1984 and the company's inventory was expanded to appeal to the general public. In addition to a catalog for people with disabilities, the company began selling condoms, erotica, dildos, lubricants, vibrating cock rings, triple crowns, penis pumps, lingerie, masturbation aids and other sex-related products. In 1999 it also began carrying explicit sex videos distributed by sister company 1st Skin. The company's new owners also created an advisory board of health and sex experts.

Located in the Fishlake National Forest, Delano Peak, 12,174 ft (3,711 m) NAVD 88, is the highest point in both Beaver and Piute counties and has a prominence of 4,689 ft (1,429 m). Delano Peak is named for Columbus Delano (1809‚Äì1896), Secretary of the Interior during the Grant administration. The Tushars receive an ample amount of snow annually even though they are situated within the rainshadow of the Sierra Mountain Range located in California and the Snake Range located in Nevada. The main part of the range is in Beaver, Piute and Sevier counties. The northwestern corner extends into the southeastern corner of Millard County and the southern end extends into the corners of Garfield and Iron counties.Utah Dept. of Transportation, 2011, Utah Official Highway Map The Tushars are bounded roughly by I-15 to the west, I-70 to the north, US‚Äì89 to the east and U‚Äì20 to the south. U‚Äì153 crosses the southern part of the range between Beaver and Junction. Prominent peaks * Mount Belknap * Mount Baldy * Mount Brigham * Edna Peak * Copper Belt Peak * Circleville Mountain Geology and landforms The peaks of the Tushars were formed between 22 and 32 million years ago by volcanic activity that included a calamitous explosion that blew off the top of a massive peak. At the cusp of the Great Basin, the range also shares characteristics of the Colorado Plateau Province to the east. Geologically complex, this area dominated by past volcanism, is composed of lava flows, ash flow tuffs from calderas, volcanic domes, cinder cones, rhyolite, basalt-like rocks, conglomerate, and metals such as gold, molybdenum and uranium. The area contains developed and undeveloped geothermal activity, fluorite, and the hydrothermally-altered rocks of Big Rock Candy Mountain. The Tushars have at least seven high alpine glaciated canyons, Cottonwood Canyon, North Fork of Cottonwood Canyon, South Fork Basin, The Pocket Basin, Bullion Basin, Beaver Basin and City Creek Basin. All were heavily glaciated during the last ice age. Watershed The Tushars contain a variety of annual and perennial streams that receive their flow from annual snowpack. The entire watershed region is divided into two main watershed locations: Beaver River originates in the Tushar Mountains east of Beaver at the confluence of the South Fork and several other creeks and springs. It drains west past Beaver and Milford and the southern end of the Mineral Range then turns north and disappears into the ground at the Beaver Bottoms near Red Rock Knoll and Black Rock in Millard County. In earlier days it was known for its large number of beaver colonies. Jedediah Smith called it \\"The Lost River\\" and Dominguez and Escalante called it \\"El Rio de Tejedor\\" (The Beaver River). The Sevier River, extending 383 miles (616 km), is the longest Utah river entirely in the state and drains an extended chain of mountain farming valleys to the intermittent Sevier Lake. The Upper Sevier is used extensively for irrigation, and consequently Sevier Lake is now essentially dry. Sevier Lake is a remnant of Lake Bonneville, a freshwater lake that covered much of the western and north western portions of Utah. Some of the more prominent creeks and streams are: Clear Creek, Pine Creek, Beaver Creek, Cottonwood Creek and various other small steams which drain into the Sevier River. All the watershed from the Tushars has a final terminus in Sevier Lake located in western Utah and is part of the Great Basin. No water reaches any ocean from the Tushars. Ecology The Tushar Mountain range is part of a temperate coniferous forest ecoregion. Common trees include ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, trembling aspen, and Gambel oak. The Tushars contain several old growth stands of pine, some of which are the oldest in the state of Utah. Plant Communities Diverse due to elevation change, the Tushars support alpine and sub-alpine vegetation, mountain meadows, dense aspen, sub-alpine fir, Engelmann spruce, five needle pine and some Douglas fir, mountain brush, sagebrush steppe, pinion-juniper woodlands, oak, mountain mahogany, and upland mountain grasslands. The area contains endemic species such as the Tushar paintbrush, as well as rare and sensitive plants. Recent fires in the area, both natural and prescribed, have been of great benefit to vegetation, causing regeneration of Aspen and other species. Recreation Eagle Point ski resort is located on the western slopes and accessed from Beaver. The Tushar range is home to a host of other outdoor pursuits as well. Hundreds of miles of mountain biking and hiking trails wind through the canyons and alpine valleys of the Tushar Range offering back country access. The Tushars are also host to a vast portion of the Paiute ATV Trail system, one of the longest ATV trails of its type in the United States. Naturalness and other unique features The area possesses a very high degree of naturalness, palpable solitude, and nearly unlimited opportunities for primitive and unconfined recreation. The area contains a number of unique and special features. The Big Rock Candy Mountain Altered Zone, a site that is of truly national significance and are either unique to or distinctive of the Colorado Plateau. The Altered Zone unexcelled in the Colorado Plateau for showing the effects of hot water or hydrothermal alteration of igneous rocks and the development of clays in the weathering process associated with the late phases of igneous activity. The highly altered, brightly colored rocks associated with a variety of igneous intrusions and extrusions make the area distinct and virtually unique in the Colorado Plateau. Also found are outcrops of strongly jointed volcanic glass in Clear Creek Canyon along the I-70 corridor called the Skinner Canyon Ignimbrites a spectacular development and exposures of columnar joints in the rewelded ash flow tuffs here are almost unique in the Colorado Plateau because of the limited exposures of these types of volcanic rocks. The Tushars can be easily accessed from several different locations: U.S. 89 through Marysvale, Junction and Circleville; I-15, through Beaver, Utah and from I-70 in Clear Creek Canyon.

His brother, Leopold Hasner von Artha (1818‚Äì1891), was an influential Austrian politician. He studied medicine at the University of Prague, and subsequently worked at the local general hospital (1842). In 1843 he was an assistant at Johann Fischer's eye clinic. In 1848 he gained his habilitation, and in 1852 he became an associate professor. From 1856 he was a \\"full professor\\" of ophthalmology and a primary physician in Prague. Starting in 1869 he was an editor of the Vierteljahrsschrift f√ºr die praktische Heilkunde (from 1880- Zeitschrift f√ºr Heilkunde). Hasner is remembered for the discovery of plica lacrimalis, which is a fold of mucous membrane that guards the lower opening of the nasolacrimal duct. This membrane goes by other names, including \\"Hasner's valve\\" and \\"Hasner's fold\\". Also, he put forth the theory that myopia was caused by stretching of the eyeball -- this being due to pulling on the posterior pole by the optic nerve.

It entered phase I human clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma, only three years after its discovery in 2003. This marine natural product is produced by the obligate marine bacteria Salinispora tropica and Salinispora arenicola, which are found in ocean sediment. Salinosporamide A belongs to a family of compounds, known collectively as salinosporamides, which possess a densely functionalized Œ≥-lactam-Œ≤-lactone bicyclic core.  History  Salinosporamide A was discovered by William Fenical and Paul Jensen from Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, CA. In preliminary screening, a high percentage of the organic extracts of cultured Salinispora strains possessed antibiotic and anticancer activities, which suggests that these bacteria are an excellent resource for drug discovery. Salinispora strain CNB-392 was isolated from a heat-treated marine sediment sample and cytotoxicity-guided fractionation of the crude extract led to the isolation of salinosporamide A. Although salinosporamide A shares an identical bicyclic ring structure with omuralide, it is uniquely functionalized. Salinosporamide A displayed potent in vitro cytotoxicity against HCT-116 human colon carcinoma with an IC50 value of 11 ng mL-1. This compound also displayed potent and highly selective activity in the NCI's 60-cell-line panel with a mean GI50 value (the concentration required to achieve 50% growth inhibition) of less than 10 nM and a greater than 4 log LC50 differential between resistant and susceptible cell lines. The greatest potency was observed against NCI-H226 non-small cell lung cancer, SF-539 brain tumor, SK-MEL-28 melanoma, and MDA-MB-435 melanoma (formerly misclassified as breast cancer ), all with LC50 values less than 10 nM. Salinosporamide A was tested for its effects on proteasome function because of its structural relationship to omuralide. When tested against purified 20S proteasome, salinosporamide A inhibited proteasomal chymotrypsin-like proteolytic activity with an IC50 value of 1.3 nM.K. Lloyd, S. Glaser, B. Miller, Nereus Pharmaceuticals Inc. This compound is approximately 35 times more potent than omuralide which was tested as a positive control in the same assay. Thus, the unique functionalization of the core bicyclic ring structure of salinosporamide A appears to have resulted in a molecule that is a significantly more potent proteasome inhibitor than omuralide. Mechanism of action Salinosporamide A inhibits proteasome activity by covalently modifying the active site threonine residues of the 20S proteasome. Biosynthesis Salinosporamide A and B building blocks Proposed biosynthesis of the nonproteinogenic amino-acid beta-hydroxycyclohex-2'-enylanine (3) (R = H or S~PCP) via a shunt in the phenylalanine biosynthetic pathway Biosynthesis It was originally hypothesized that salinosporamide B was a biosynthetic precursor to salinosporamide A due to their structural similarities. It was thought that the halogenation of the unactivated methyl group was catalyzed by a non-heme iron halogenase. Recent work using 13C-labeled feeding experiments reveal distinct biosynthetic origins of salinosporamide A and B. While they share the biosynthetic precursors acetate and presumed Œ≤-hydroxycyclohex-2'-enylalanine (3), they differ in the origin of the four- carbon building block that gives rise to their structural differences involving the halogen atom. A hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) pathway is most likely the biosynthetic mechanism in which acetyl-CoA and butyrate-derived ethylmalonyl-CoA condense to yield the Œ≤-ketothioester (4), which then reacts with (3) to generate the linear precursor (5). Total synthesis The first stereoselective synthesis was reported by Rajender Reddy Leleti and E. J.Corey. Later several routes to the total synthesis of salinosporamide A have been reported. Clinical study In vitro studies using purified 20S proteasomes showed that salinosporamide A has lower EC50 for trypsin-like (T-L) activity than does bortezomib. In vivo animal model studies show marked inhibition of T-L activity in response to salinosporamide A, whereas bortezomib enhances T-L proteasome activity. Initial results from early-stage clinical trials of salinosporamide A in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients were presented at the 2011 American Society of Hematology annual meeting. Further early-stage trials of the drug in a number of different cancers are ongoing.ClinicalTrials.gov: Marizomib See also *Salinosporamide B References External links * Category:Lactams Category:Lactones Category:Antibiotics Category:Proteasome inhibitors Category:Experimental cancer drugs Category:Total synthesis Category:Secondary alcohols Category:Cyclohexenes Category:Organochlorides Category:Halogen-containing natural products ","title":"Salinosporamide A"},{"id":"11777014","text":"Close as You Get is sixteenth solo album by Northern Irish blues guitarist and singer Gary Moore.

Biography  Kirkbride was born in Illinois to British parents and grew up in Egypt. He began his military career as an officer in the army of General Allenby from 1916 to 1921. In 1920, after the Battle of Maysalun and the fall of Faisal's government of Syria left Transjordan with no central authority, he was dispatched by the British government to Transjordan to help maintain order during this interregnum. \\"With a fine sense of history\\" he established the ephemeral but whimsically named \\"National Government of Moab\\" in Kerak with himself as President, which lasted until Abdullah took control of the country. (His younger brother Alan similarly formed the \\"Ammonite Government\\" in Amman.) From 1922 to 1927 and from 1937 to 1939, he was governor of Acre and of the district of Galilee in Palestine. He was Deputy Resident in Transjordan from 1927 to 1937 and Resident from 1939 to 1946, and was one of Abdullah's leading British advisors. In 1946 Transjordan gained independence. Kikrbride was then appointed ambassador of the United Kingdom to The Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan (which became The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1949) and played an important diplomatic role during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. From 1952 to 1954, he was ambassador to Libya. He was appointed KCMG in the 1949 Birthday Honours. He ended his career as director of the British Bank of the Middle East, later writing academic books and articles on the Middle East, including two volumes of memoirs.

The station is owned by Cumulus Media and the broadcast license is held by Cumulus Licensing LLC. By day, it broadcasts at 10,000 watts, covering parts of Alabama, Mississippi and the Florida Panhandle. But at night, it reduces power to 850 watts to avoid interfering with other stations on 660 kHz, a clear-channel frequency. WXQW studios are on Dauphin Avenue in Midtown Mobile, and its transmitter is in Daphne, Alabama. On January 20, 2016 WXQW was granted an FCC construction permit to decrease the night power to 180 watts.Application for Construction Permit for Commercial Broadcast Station - Federal Communications Commission On January 4, 2017 WXQW filed an application for a construction permit to decrease night power to 19 watts. The application was accepted for filing on January 20, 2017.Application for Construction Permit for Commercial Broadcast Station - Federal Communications Commission Programming WXQW airs mostly nationally syndicated talk shows from Westwood One, a subsidiary of Cumulus Media. They include Phil Valentine, Chris Plante, Mark Levin, John Batchelor and Red Eye Radio. Mornings begin with two Westwood One news shows, America in The Morning and First Light, followed by the syndicated Good Day program with Doug Stephan. National news is heard at the beginning of each hour from Westwood One News. The station began as a country & western outlet in 1964, later broadcasting contemporary Christian music, children's radio, urban contemporary gospel, all-news radio from CNN Headline News, blues music, and syndicated talk formats in its nearly 50 years on the air. History Launch In the early 1960s, Springhill Broadcasting, Inc., applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a new AM radio station to be licensed to broadcast with 50,000 watts of power on 1550 kHz as a daylight- only station serving the community of Mobile, Alabama. The FCC granted the company a construction permit to build this new station and assigned call letters \\"WMOE\\" while construction was under way. Springhill Broadcasting was initially led by Marvin Burton as president and Samuel R. David as both vice president and general manager. Assigned new call sign \\"WMOO\\", the station began licensed broadcast operations in 1964 with a country & western music format. By 1969, Samuel R. David would take over as president of license holder Springhill Broadcasting. Under his leadership, Springhill Broadcasting reached a deal to sell WMOO to Trio Broadcasters, Inc. (George Beasley, president) which was consummated on December 17, 1969. The new owners flipped the format from country to contemporary Christian music and maintained it through the 1970s and into the 1980s. Move to 660 kHz Early WMOO branding In March 1981, Trio Broadcasters, Inc., applied to the FCC to make extensive changes to their broadcast license for WMOO. The company applied to change the community of license from Mobile to Fairhope, Alabama, to convert from daytimer status to a 24-hour operation with reduced daytime power plus nighttime service at 1,000 watts, to change broadcast frequency from 1550 kHz to 660 kHz, and to move the reconfigured antenna system to a new location just outside Daphne, Alabama. The FCC accepted the filing on May 15, 1981, and finally granted a construction permit for these changes on September 26, 1984. This permit was scheduled to expire one year later, on September 2, 1985. After a long series of modifications and extensions, the station completed construction and applied for a license to cover these changes in August 1988. The FCC granted this request and the station began licensed operation on the new frequency from the new location with the new operating hours and power levels on November 10, 1988. As part of these changes, the station requested a new call sign from the FCC and was assigned \\"WLIT\\" on January 24, 1988. That change proved short-lived as the station became \\"WBLX\\" on July 4, 1988. The new WBLX was sold shortly after it was completed. Trio Broadcasters, Inc., reached a deal to sell the station to Central Life Broadcasting of Alabama, Inc., in September 1988. The FCC approved the sale on November 2, 1988, and the transaction was formally consummated on May 11, 1989. 1990s Less than a year later, in April 1990, a deal was reached to sell WBLX to April Broadcasting, Inc. The FCC approved the sale on July 23, 1990, and the transaction was formally consummated on October 31, 1990. On October 4, 1996, the station's call sign was changed to \\"WHOZ\\" when the station flipped to children's radio as an affiliate of Radio AAHS. The new format made its formal debut with a promotion at Bayfest on October 5, 1996. WHOZ became the first radio station in the Mobile metropolitan area to air a radio format designed for children. Unable to compete with Radio Disney, the entire Radio AAHS network discontinued programming in January 1998. Cumulus era On January 21, 1998, the FCC assigned this station the \\"WDLT\\" call sign. Cumulus Media agreed to purchase WDLT from April Broadcasting, Inc., in November 1999. After a legal challenge to the sale was dismissed, the FCC approved the sale on November 30, 1999, and the transaction was formally consummated the same day. Nine years later, the station was briefly assigned \\"WWFF\\" on September 21, 2007, before switching to the current \\"WXQW\\" on December 31, 2007. This WXQW call sign was most recently assigned to a sister station (now WHRP, 94.1 FM) in the Huntsville, Alabama, market. On October 12, 2015, WXQW changed its format from black gospel (simulcasting WGOK 900 AM in Mobile) to news/talk.

There have been periods of persecution, but for the most part the Jews of Gibraltar have prospered and been one of the largest religious minorities in the city, where they have made contributions to the culture, defence, and Government of Gibraltar. Significantly, the Jews of Gibraltar have faced almost no official anti- Semitism during their time in the city. During Gibraltar's tercentenary celebration, Jonathan Sacks, the Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Commonwealth, was quoted as saying, \\"In the dark times of expulsion and inquisition, Gibraltar lit the beacon of tolerance,\\" and that Gibraltar \\"is probably the community where Jews have been the most integrated.\\" History Early history to 1492 The first record of Jews in Gibraltar comes from the year 1356, under Muslim rule, when the community issued an appeal asking for the ransom of a group of Jews taken captive by barbary pirates. In 1474, twelve years after the Christian takeover, the Duke of Medina Sidonia, sold Gibraltar to a group of Jewish conversos from Cordova and Seville led by Pedro de Herrera in exchange for maintaining the garrison of the town for two years, after which time the 4,350 Jews were expelled by the Duke. Their fate is unknown. It is likely that many returned to Cordova where they had to face the persecution of the Inquisition under the infamous Torquemada from 1488. Jews were expelled from Spain under the Alhambra decree of 1492 and from Portugal by order of King Manuel I in 1497, effectively ending all Jewish activity there, except in the cases of conversos or possible Crypto-Jews. British rule Typical dress of a Jew in Gibraltar in the 19th century 1826 ketubah from Gibraltar After the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, Gibraltar came under the rule of the Kingdom of Great Britain, which made the area a British dependency. In the Treaty, the Spanish added the following clause barring Jews and Moors from the city: However, the British ignored this provision. Although the Jews had been expelled from England in 1290, Oliver Cromwell had consented to their readmission in 1655. The admission of Jews was one of the infractions against the Treaty of Utrecht that the Spanish used (others were the admission of Moors, the extension of fortifications and the alleged smuggling from Gibraltar) to consider that the British had abrogated the Treaty. In 1727, the Spanish unsuccessfully laid siege to the city. In 1729, the British and the Sultan of Morocco reached an agreement whereby the sultan's Jewish subjects were legally permitted to reside in the colony. Jews were given the right to permanent settlement in 1749, when Isaac Nieto, the new community's first Rabbi, came to the colony from London and established congregation Sha'ar HaShamayim, the oldest synagogue in Gibraltar, otherwise known as the Great Synagogue. At that date there were already 600 Jews in Gibraltar, who constituted one third of the civilian population.Jewish Encyclopedia Three more synagogues, all of which still function on Shabbat and feast days, were built as years went by: Nefutsot Yehuda and Ets Hayim in 1781, as well as the Abudarham Synagogue in 1820, named after Solomon Abudarham.http://www.jewishgibraltar.com/synagogues.php The Jewish population continued to grow, reaching its peak in the mid-19th century. The Ark in a Gibraltar synagogue, showing a large number of Sefer Torahs The Jews of Gibraltar initially preserved some old customs. For example, in 1777, Issac Aboab, a Gibraltarian Jew born in Tetuan, was listed as having two wives, Hannah Aboab and Simah Aboab. Bigamy was illegal in the Kingdom of Great Britain at the time, but the law was apparently not fully operative in Gibraltar, and though polygamy had been banned by Rabbenu Gershom Meor Hagola since approximately 1000 CE, this ban was only accepted by Ashkenazi communities.Is polygamy still allowed today?|Rabbis Answer Torah Questions 24/6 During the sieges of the city by the Spanish and during the Peninsular War, Jewish civilians helped defend Gibraltar from invaders. Twentieth century and today Memorial commemorating Gibraltarian evacuees in Madeira Tito Benady, a historian on Gibraltar Jewry, noted that when some 200 Jews of the 2000 evacuees from Gibraltar were evacuated as non combatants to Funchal, Madeira, at the start of World War II, they found a Jewish cemetery (Jewish Cemetery of Funchal) that belonged to the Abudarham family. The same family after whom the Abudarham Synagogue in Gibraltar was named. On the 28 May 1944 the first repatriation party departed Madeira for Gibraltar and by the end of 1944 only 520 non-priority evacuees remained on the island.Garcia, pp. 20 In 2008, a monument was made in Gibraltar and shipped to Madeira where it has been erected next to a small chapel at Santa Caterina park, Funchal. The monument is a gift and symbol of ever-lasting thanks given by the people of Gibraltar to the island of Madeira and its inhabitants.www.love-madeira.com (accessed 13 December 2010) The city of Funchal and Gibraltar were twinned on 13 May 2009 by their then Mayors, the Mayor of Funchal Miguel Albuquerque and the mayor of Gibraltar who had been an Evacuee from Gibraltar to Madeira Solomon Levy, respectively. The mayor of Gibraltar then had a meeting with the then President of Madeira Alberto Jo√£o Jardim. Most of Gibraltar's Jews evacuated to the United Kingdom during the Second World War, when the Allies used Gibraltar as a base of operations. Some Jews opted to stay in the United Kingdom, but most returned, although there was a slackening in some of their religious practices. The efforts of the Spanish sephardic Italian born Rabbi Josef Pacifici,http://www.rabbini.it/joseph-pacifici/ who assumed the Gibraltar rabbinate and took control of Jewish education in Gibraltar, helped reverse this tendency. In 1984 Rabbi Ron Hassid became Chief Rabbi. Several Gibraltarian Jews have served in important positions in the Government there in the 20th century, particularly Sir Joshua Hassan, who served as Chief Minister of Gibraltar for two separate terms before his death. Solomon Levy served in the ceremonial role of Mayor of Gibraltar from 2008 to 2009. The city maintains five kosher institutions, a Jewish primary school and two Jewish secondary schools. In 2004, at a celebration of the 300 years since the British takeover, the congregants at the Great Synagogue (Shaar Hashamayim) performed the anthem \\"God Save the Queen\\" in Hebrew, the first time that has occurred officially.\\"Jews Thriving on Peace of the Rock ,\\" by Hilary Leila Krieger, Jerusalem Post, 2 December 2005 Adi Schwartz, \\"Gibraltar Jews feature a mix of ultra-Orthodoxy and modernism\\", Haaretz, 27 September 2007 Historical demographics In 1753, when the first census was taken, the Jewish population of Gibraltar was 575 out of about 1,800 civilian inhabitants. The count had risen to 863 by 1777. In 1787 the population had fallen to 776. By 1830 the civilian population was evaluated to 1,900, of which 1,300 were \\"native\\" Jews and 600 recent Jewish immigrants, and by 1878 the community counted 1,533 members. In 2001, there were 584 Jews (roughly 2% of the total population), of whom 464 were self-described Gibraltarian, 63 were \\"Other British\\", 4 were Moroccan and 18 Spanish. Five Jews came from other European Union countries, and 39 did not hail from Gibraltar, the United Kingdom, Morocco, Spain, or any other countries in the European Union. Presently a large percentage of Gibraltar's Jews are Sephardic, but there are a number of British Jews as well. Language Languages spoken in the Jewish community include English, Spanish, Ladino (spoken by the large Sephardic population) and Arabic (traditionally spoken by some of the population which traces its origins back to Morocco). Llanito, the vernacular language for the majority of Gibraltarians, has significant Jewish influence. Some 500 words are of Hebrew origin, and the language also has features of influence from Haketia, a Judeo-Spanish language spoken by the Sephardic communities of Northern Morocco and the Spanish exclaves of Ceuta and Melilla.

It is found in warm temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean; in the western Atlantic, it ranges from Brazil to the New England states. It is found regularly in offshore and inshore waters, and is classified as a highly migratory species by UNCLOS. Occurring in large schools and weighing up to 36 lb, it is one of the smaller members of the tuna family (Scombridae). Commonly called bonita, false albacore, or little tuna, it resembles the Atlantic bonito, skipjack tuna, and species of mackerel. The little tunny feeds primarily on pelagic fish. It is best identified by the dark spots appearing between its pectoral and ventral fins and \\"worm-like\\" markings on its back. Commercially, the fish is used as bait for sharks and marlin due to its high oil content and hook retention. It is considered by many to be a trash fish because it has a darker and stronger taste than that of the other tunas. However, the little tunny is commercially important in many locations, including the West Indies. It is marketed fresh, dried, canned, smoked, and frozen. It is sought-after as a sport fish due to its line-stripping runs and hard fighting ability when hooked. By trolling with lures near reefs, it can be caught on hook and line. Taxonomy Constantine Samuel Rafinesque identified the little tunny in 1810 and gave the fish its current name: Euthynnus alletteratus. Synonyms for used for the name include E. alleteratus alleteratus, E. alliteratus, E. thunina, and E. alletteratus aurolitoralis. The little tunny is not part of the genus Thunnus like many tuna, but it is part of the tribe Thunnini. Etymology The genus Euthynnus is derived from the , and ('), \\"tunny-fish\\" ‚Äì which is in turn derived from , \\"to rush; to dart\\". Description The little tunny is small in body size compared to other tuna species. It has a compact and stream-lined body built to facilitate bursts of speed, as well as endurance while swimming. Its torpedo-shaped, robust body is made for powerful swimming. It has a large mouth with rigid jaws and a slightly protruding lower jaw, with a single row of small, inwardly curved, cone-shaped teeth on the palatines. Teeth are absent on the vomer, the small bone in the roof of the mouth, and the tongue has two longitudinal ridges. A little tunny The snout is shorter than the rest of the head. The little tunny has a dorsal fin with 10 to 15 tall, descending spines, as well as a much smaller second dorsal fin followed by eight finlets. At the base, the two dorsal fins are separated by a small interspace. The anal fin has 11 to 15 slightly defined rays, and is followed by seven finlets. The pectoral fins are short and do not reach the end of the first dorsal fin and are joined to the pelvic fins by interpelvic processes. There are 37-45 gill rakers, bony projections off the gills, on the first arch. There are no scales on the body of the little tunny except along the lateral line and on the corselet: a thick band of scales circling the body. The coloration of the little tunny is typically metallic blue or blue-green with dark, wavy stripes above the lateral line. These \\"worm-like\\" lines are within a well-marked border that never extends farther forward than the middle of the first dorsal fin. The belly is bright white with three to seven dark, fingerprint-like spots around the pectoral and pelvic fins. The little tunny is commonly confused with the Atlantic bonito because of coloration, but the two fish differ in their color patterns and overall body size. The little tunny's markings allow it to easily be distinguished from similar species. It is often confused with the skipjack tuna, the frigate tuna, the Atlantic bonito, and the bullet tuna. Close relatives also include the kawakawa and the black skipjack. The scattering of dark, fingerprint-like spots between the pectoral and pelvic fins cannot be found on any related Atlantic species. The first dorsal fin of the Atlantic bonito is also lower and sloping. Its lack of teeth on the vomer can set it apart from its close Pacific relatives, the kawakawa and the black skipjack. The dorsal fins of the bullet and frigate mackerel are set apart. Unlike the little tunny, the skipjack tuna lacks markings on the back and has broad, straight stripes on the underside. The little tunny reaches a maximum weight of in the Mediterranean, and averages about through its entire range. Its maximum fork length (distance from the tip of the snout to the fork of the tail) in the Mediterranean is about and in the Atlantic is about a . Average fork length for an adult fish throughout the entire range is about . Some fish may reach a length of or more, but most commonly they are around . The largest little tunny on record is and . Females reach sexual maturity at in fork length, while males mature at about . Anatomy The little tunny has some anatomical variations when compared to other species of Euthynnus. E. alletteratus lacks a swim bladder, like most other tuna, so it must constantly keep moving to stay afloat. The pectoral fins are crucial to the little tunny in maintaining its position in the water column. Its liver is very disproportionate, with the right lobe much longer than the left or middle lobes. The stomach of the little tunny is a long sac that stretches almost the entire length of its body. The intestinal tract is fairly short, coming from the left and right sides of the stomach, and extending without looping down the length of its body. The different sections are characterized by their diameter and color. The ventral vertebral column of the little tunny has unique trelliswork, which is important to its family (Scombridae). Divided haemapophyses, or parts of the vertebrate forming a long canal, enclose the large ventral blood vessel. Feeding habits A school of little tunny feeding In coastal waters along the North American eastern seaboard, little tunny are carnivorous, and primarily feed on small fish and invertebrates that occur in schools. Its diet consists mostly of fish; it particularly likes the Atlantic bigeye and largehead hairtail. Second to fish, the little tunny consumes crustaceans, and lastly cephalopods and gastropods make up a small part of its diet. Sardines, scad, and anchovies are common in the diet along with squid, stomatopods, and organisms from the family Diogenidae. The diet of the fish is also relative to its size. A smaller fish's diet typically consists of clupeiforms, and larvae, while the larger fish mostly eat Maurolicus muelleri. The typical diet is very similar to that of the king mackerel because the fish are of a similar size and live in the same area of the water column. It mostly feeds on pelagic fish. The little tunny is an opportunistic predator, feeding on crustaceans, clupeid fishes, squids, and tunicates. Its diet also responds to seasonal changes in food availability. It has nocturnal feeding habits, and is a specialist feeder. It often feeds on herring and sardines in inshore waters near the surface of the water. The little tunny commonly feeds in large schools because their primary food sources (small fish and the larval forms of crustaceans) are typically in schools, as well. Distribution and habitat The little tunny is found in the neritic waters of the temperate and tropical zones in the Atlantic ocean. It can also be found in the waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. In the eastern Atlantic, the little tunny has been found from Skagerrak to South Africa. Although found it this broad range of latitudes, it is rare north of the Iberian Peninsula or farther south than Brazil. On the Atlantic coast of the United States, they can be caught as far north as Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and as far south as the tip of Florida, as well as throughout the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The little tunny's habitat tends to be near- shore waters, much closer to shore than most other tunas. They live in and around inlets, points, jetties, and sandbars. All of these places are where bait fish like sardine and menhaden, both favorites of the little tunny, form large schools, which are very helpful to the little tunny's feeding style. While the little tunny is abundant in offshore ocean waters, it is unusual to find it in brackish water of estuaries. The very young will enter estuaries in South Africa. The little tunny prefers relatively warm water, from 24¬∞ to 30¬∞ Celsius. The little tunny migrates south in the winter and fall, and northward in the spring, through coastal waters. It is not as migratory as other tuna species. The little tunny is typically a schooling species. It lives in schools based primarily on fish size rather than species, so other members of the family Scombridae, like the Atlantic bonito, may be present. These schools cover areas up to 3.2 kilometres long. Little tunny that have not yet reached adulthood form tight schools offshore. Larger schools are more common offshore whereas smaller groups may wander far inshore. Reproduction Little tunny spawn in water that is at least in the months of April through November in the Atlantic Ocean. The spawning season of the little tunny in the Mediterranean is generally between May and September, but the most intensive spawning occurs between July and August. The major spawning areas are offshore, in waters that are 30 to 40 metres deep. The females are prolific fish, and can release 1.75 million eggs, in multiple clutches over a mating season. The eggs are fertilized in the water column after the males release sperm. The eggs are buoyant, spherical, transparent, and pelagic. A droplet of oil within the egg adds to its buoyancy. The diameter of the eggs can be anywhere from 0.8 mm to 1.1 mm, and they are light amber. Larvae are released 24 hours after fertilization and are approximately 3 mm in size. Pigmentation in the eyes appear 48 hours after hatching. The teeth and fins develop at sizes of 3.7‚Äì14 mm. Once the larvae are 14 mm to 174 mm long, they take on the adult appearance; the body becomes more elongated. Studies have found that it takes approximately 3 years for the little tunny's gonads to reach sexual maturity. The average size of a sexually mature individual is in fork length. Predators and parasites Bony fish, Marlins, sea birds, sharks, and rays prey on the little tunny. Other tunas, including conspecifics and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) are predators of the little tunny. Fish such as the dolphin fish (Coryphaena hippurus), wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri), Atlantic sailfish (Istiophorus albicans), swordfish (Xiphias gladius), and various sharks as well as other large marine carnivores all prey on the little tunny. Among those sharks is the whale shark, which feeds on the little tunny's recently spawned eggs. Seabirds prey on small little tunny. Parasites of the little tunny include the copepods Caligus bonito, Caligus coryphaenae, and Caligus productus, all found on the body surface as well as on the wall of the branchial cavities. Another copepod, Pseudocycnoides appendiculatus, has been documented as parasitic on the gill filaments. Other parasites include digenea (flukes), monogenea (gillworms), cestoda (tapeworms), and isopods. Fishing As with many inshore gamefish like bluefish and striped bass, schools of little tunny are usually indicated by flocks of birds diving in coastal waters. Fishermen targeting them often troll bait, cast lures, and float fish. When trolling for Little Tunny, fishermen often use small lures baited with either mullet or ballyhoo or lures dressed with colored feathers. When float fishing, popular baits are Spot, Bluefish, or Pinfish. Popular lures include deadly dicks, maria jigs, and other slender-profiled, brightly colored metal lures that can be cast far and retrieved quickly that imitate the small baitfish the little tunny are often feeding on. It is not uncommon for little tunny to be taken while shore fishing in the northern states along the East Coast of the United States, especially during late summer when the water near beaches is generally clear and easy for the fish to hunt in. Some anglers use little tunny for strip bait to catch other species, but most fish are released as the Little Tunny is not commonly thought of as a food fish. There is little regulation of the fishery, no size or bag limits, and no closed season. The flesh of the Little Tunny is coarse in texture, strong in flavor, and dark in color if compared to bluefin or yellowfin tuna. The little tuna is also native to the entire Mediterranean , especially around Sicily and the Ionian Sea. They love warm waters and cover long distances during the spring and summer mating season. The tuna is caught with longlines, containment nets and drift nets. The highest catch quota is achieved from April to September. Before overfishing, large schools migrated to the upper Adriatic, where they were observed from the karst. The last major catch in this regard was made in 1954 in the Trieste area by fishermen from Santa Croce and Barcola.Andrea Di Matteo \\"Santa Croce, 1954: ultima grande pescata di tonni\\", Il Piccolo, 23. August 2014. Consumption In preparing Little Tunny for consumption, it should be bled and iced as soon as possible after being caught. There are many ways to eat the Little Tunny, such as Tuna Salad. To do this, the fillets are first baked, then chilled and flaked, then mixed in with the salad. Removing the dark strips of meats that extend the length of each fillet helps to reduce the naturally fishy flavor. Another way to prepare the Little Tunny is first to bleed it, barbecue it in foil, remove the meat from the bone, and then let it chill overnight. Various seasonings can be used to enhance the flavor. Fresh steaks can be quite good if seasoned with salt, pepper and lemon, and thinly sliced tunny makes good sashimi. It is commonly eaten as such in Japan.

The station, established in 1960, is currently owned by the Black Crow Media Group and the license is held by BCA Radio LLC. Black Crow Media Group owns two other Huntsville stations, WAHR and WLOR. Its studios are located off University Drive (U.S. 72) in Huntsville, and its transmitter is located north of the city. Programming WRTT-FM focuses on active rock releases since 1990, supporting various subgenres such as mainstream rock, grunge rock, and the like. More recently, though, it has begun to rotate in songs from the classic rock canon, to widen its appeal to somewhat older listeners. After seven years in mornings on WRTT-FM, The Rick and Bubba Show began airing on crosstown WQRV starting January 2, 2008. The syndicated hosts were replaced on WRTT-FM as of December 3, 2007, by radio personalities Jerome \\"Fish\\" Fisher and Ken Harron. These two were replaced sometime in 2010 by Jimbo and Casio who currently run the morning show. http://therocket951.com/?page_id=4 History WHBS-FM The 95.1 frequency was home to the first FM radio station in Huntsville as \\"WHBS-FM\\", which began broadcasting December 21, 1947. It was mainly a simulcast of WHBS (1490 AM) which was owned by The Huntsville Times. WHBS-AM moved to 1550 AM and increased power to 5,000 day/500 night watts in 1952 (they were 1,000 day/250 night on 1490 AM) The FM station broadcast from a transmitter near Bankhead Parkway/Tollgate Road until around 1957 with 10,000 watts. The station had about a 150-mile coverage area with a good antenna. The AM station was sold to Smith Broadcasting in 1958 and became WAAY radio (now licensed as \\"WLOR\\".) WNDA On October 8, 1960, a new radio station licensed as \\"WNDA\\" began broadcasting with 3,100 watts of effective radiated power on a frequency of 92.9 megahertz. Under the ownership of Hughey Broadcasting Company, WNDA served Huntsville and surrounding communities with an easy listening music format. In 1964, the station shifted to the current 95.1 MHz frequency. On May 1, 1970, WNDA was purchased by Wells Broadcasting Company, Inc., and its format shifted from easy listening to Christian spirituals and teaching programs. This format would endure on WNDA for nearly 30 years. WRTT-FM In January 2000, Wells Broadcasting Company, Inc., agreed to sell WNDA to a company called STG Media, LLC. The FCC approved the deal on March 7, 2000, and the transaction was consummated on May 1, 2000. While the sale was in progress, the station's call sign was changed to \\"WRTT- FM\\". The station dropped its longtime Christian radio format in favor of a classic rock format branded as \\"Rocket 95.1\\". In November 2001, due to a proposed refinancing of its parent company, STG Media, LLC, applied to the FCC to transfer the licenses of WAHR, WLOR, and WRTT-FM to Black Crow Media Group subsidiary BCA Media, LLC. Just two days later, another application was filed to shift the licenses to BCA Radio, LLC. The FCC approved the moves on November 15, 2001, and the consummation of the transaction occurred on November 19, 2001. In January 2010, Black Crow Media Group and its subsidiaries filed for \\"Chapter 11\\" bankruptcy, seeking to reorganize rather than be broken up. Their filing with the FCC notified the Commission of the involuntary transfer of the license from BCA Radio, LLC, to an entity known as BCA Radio, LLC, Debtor-In-Possession. In November 2011, Black Crow Media Group announced that it was reorganizing its radio holdings and consolidating the four subsidiaries acting as debtors in possession (including BCA Radio, LLC) into a new company named Southern Stone Communications, LLC. The FCC approved the transfer on December 19, 2011. The station received a construction permit to boost power from 12 kW to 13.5 kW, while remaining at the same location and antenna height, in December 2016. A license to cover for this power boost was filed in February 2017.

It contains laboratories, classrooms, a greenhouse, and an amphitheater-style lecture hall with 404 seats. Architecture The Ruskin Street side of Clapp Hall Clapp Hall was designed by Trautwein & Howard, a successor to architectural firm of Charles Klauder who designed the university's gothic Cathedral of Learning, Stephen Foster Memorial, and Heinz Memorial Chapel. Clapp Hall's exterior and interior spaces have been described as a mix of Collegiate Gothic and Art Deco. The building features a diagonally-positioned entrance that creates a direct axis with the Cathedral of Learning which is framed in Clapp Hall's stone portal entryway. The building is clad in textured Indiana limestone to match the stone used on the Cathedral of Learning. The building's use of aluminum windows has been suggested to be a quiet homage to the work of aluminum magnate George Hubbard Clapp, the building's namesake. The lobby of Clapp Hall is streamlined Art Deco in character, with terrazzo flooring and stainless steel doors, and is thus more stylistically modern than its exterior which is meant to reflect the Cathedral of Learning. It has been suggested that the lobby reveals a struggle in the design process to find a balance between the traditional gothic and more contemporary design elements. History George Hubbard Clapp Original plans slated Clapp Hall to be built adjacent to the Cathedral of Learning facing the Masonic Temple, on the south side of Fifth Avenue, between the Cathedral and Heinz Memorial Chapel. Concerns over adding more buildings to the Cathedral of Learning lawn and impinging on the lawn's rare open space prompted a change to its current site across Fifth Avenue and effectively ended above-ground development of the Cathedral lawn space.http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer- idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;q1=Clapp%20Hall;rgn=full%20text;idno=00c50130m;didno=00c50130m;view=image;seq=220;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset; The plot of land that Clapp Hall was constructed on was purchased for $675,000 ($ million today) as a gift for the university by the A.W.

The Gendercator controversy The Gendercator is a 2007 short film described as \\"a satirical take on surgical body modification and gender. The story uses the 'Rip Van Winkle' model to extrapolate from the feminist 1970s to a frightening 2048 where politics and technology have conspired to mandate two gender 'choices': Macho male or Barbie babe.

Crouch was invited to screen her film in San Francisco in the fall of 2007 by Ondine Kilker, co-chair of community initiative Center Women Present (CWP). In a 2008 interview for Sinister Wisdom, Crouch stated that her film spoke to an intracommunity queer issue where an over-reliance on gender norms was fast becoming a popular and too narrow way to interpret the vast diversity of queer gender and sex expressions. The Gendercator is the first film pulled by Frameline from its festival due to controversy. Crouch maintains that gender pluralism was the core gender message, and that she was representing a lesbian and queer perspective about binary gender roles rather than a phobic response to the lived experiences of transgender and transsexual people. Aside from The Gendercator, other films by Crouch have been shown at the Frameline Film Festival.

It was later included in King's Just After Sunset collection in 2008. \\"The Gingerbread Girl\\" was also released as an audiobook, read by Mare Winningham, by Simon & Schuster Audio on May 6, 2008. The title is an allusion to the fairy tale \\"The Gingerbread Boy\\" (also known as \\"The Gingerbread Man\\"). Plot summary After her only daughter, Amy, suffers a crib death, Emily takes up running as a way to deal with her pain. She believes that \\"only fast running will do\\"‚Äîshe pushes her body to its limits, often vomiting and sweating profusely. Her husband, Henry, finds out about this habit, and treats it as a psychological reaction to grief. Emily is hurt and runs out of the house, down to a local Holiday Inn. She contacts her father and explains her situation. After their conversation, Emily decides to stay in her father's summer home, near Naples, Florida. She also speaks with Henry, and the two agree that a trial separation is a good idea. Emily's life becomes quite simple. She eats plain meals and runs for miles every day. As her body shrinks, she gets to know the few people that hover around the island (Vermillion Key is mostly devoid of tourists). The only person Emily visits is Deke Hollis, an old friend of her father who runs the drawbridge on the island. During a chance meeting, Hollis tells Emily that Jim Pickering, a man who own an estate on the island, is back. He has brought along a \\"niece\\"‚ÄîHollis's polite name for the young women who Pickering lures to his home. Emily prepares to continue, but Hollis warns her that Pickering is \\"not a very nice man.\\" As Emily continues her daily run, she notices a shiny red car outside a house along the beach that she deduces belongs to Pickering. When Emily approaches the car and discovers a woman whose throat has been slashed, she is knocked unconscious. She wakes up to find herself inside Pickering's house and bound to a kitchen chair with duct tape. Emily realizes that Pickering is insane, and hints that she let someone know where she was going. When Pickering presses her for details, Emily blurts out Hollis's name; Pickering leaves, presumably to murder the old man. Emily knows that she does not have much time, and hears her father's voice in her head, giving her advice. She uses her strong legs to splinter the duct tape and free her lower body. She looks for a knife to release her arms, but settles on the corner of the island in the middle of the kitchen. Now freed, Emily attacks Pickering when he returns. After temporarily knocking him out, Emily escapes from his house and makes it to the beach. She hears Pickering behind her and realizes, in a rather odd coincidence, that she has been \\"training\\" for this moment. Though exhausted from her imprisonment, Emily's months of running serve her well. She keeps well ahead of Pickering, who's armed himself with a pair of scissors. Emily encounters a young Latino man on the beach and begs for help, but he doesn't understand her cries. Pickering appears and tries to use Spanish to convince the man that Emily is with him, but Emily's fearful expression convinces the young man otherwise. Enraged, Pickering brutally slaughters the man with his scissors. Emily, tiring quickly, runs into the ocean. Pickering follows her, but begins to flounder. Emily gasps as she figures out what is happening‚ÄîPickering cannot swim. Emily manages to escape him, and sits on the shoreline to watch as Pickering drowns. When he finally goes under, Emily tells herself that a shark or some other creature attacked him. She wonders why, and guesses that it is a part of the human condition. Her long ordeal over, Emily stands and shouts at the birds flying about, and prepares to go home. Critical reception A review in The Observer says the story is \\"reminiscent of Misery\\". A review in the San Francisco Chronicle calls it \\"a harrowing almost-novella, [which] anchors the book and bridges the inner-psyche thrillers of King's 1990s work with his more recent stories. A story of abuse, psychosis and loneliness, it is physically exhausting to read ‚Äî an astounding thing to say for a short work of fiction.\\" A reviewer in the Toronto Star calls it \\"a flat-out suspense novella that could have been penned by Richard Bachman, King's literary alter ego ...[in which] bloody chaos ensues.\\" Connection to King's other works A man named Charlie Pickering, a relative of Jim Pickering, appears as a minor antagonist in King's 1994 novel Insomnia. A brief reference is made to the Gingerbread Girl in Gerald's Game, where Jessie shows signs of physical abuse from her brother's friend and talks about sexual abuse from her brother.  Film adaptation  In May 2018, it was announced that Brainstorm Media would produce a film adaptation. Craig R. Baxley is set to direct, with the screenplay being written by Baxley and Stephen King.

Holtermann is best known as the commander of Hegra Fortress during the Battle of Hegra Fortress in the Norwegian Campaign of 1940. During the inter-war years Holtermann attended military college in both Norway and France. After the war he continued his military service, among other missions commanding the Independent Norwegian Brigade Group in Germany in 1949-1950. Early and personal life Holtermann was the son of the district physician Sven Ruud Holtermann (1854‚Äì1916) and his wife, n√©e Lehmann. Dr. Holtermann served in Sokndal, and Hans Reidar Holtermann grew up there. He was a nephew of architect Ove Bjelke Holtermann and a grandnephew of architect Peter H√∏ier Holtermann. On 29 November 1926, Holtermann married Helsingborg-born Elisabeth J√∏nsson (b. 25 January 1899) in Stockholm, Sweden. He remarried on 3 October 1947, when he married Maren Louise (\\"Vivi\\") Hertzberg. Studies Having achieved the examen artium in 1914, Holtermann started his military career at Officer's School, and graduated in 1917 from the Norwegian Military Academy with the rank of premierl√∏ytnant (First Lieutenant) and from Military College in 1919.Brox 1988: 14 In the years 1919-1923 he served as an aspirant at the Norwegian General Staff. He graduated from the Royal Frederick University in 1923 with a degree in economics. After leaving university, Holtermann went to France. There he attended the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in France for three years from 1924 to 1926, gaining the French certificate of Brevet d'√©tat-major. He also saw service with French military units. From 1926, he served as a junior officer at the General Staff. Military career After completing his general staff training Holtermann served as Chief of staff for the Inspector General of the Norwegian Army's Field artillery, achieving the rank of kaptein in 1930. He also saw service as a scout in the Norwegian Army Air Service. In 1937 he became a major and second in command of Artillery Regiment no. 3 in Trondheim. He held this position until the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940. Holtermann wrote several books on military topics, with Momenter for utarbeidelse av artilleriets ildplaner in 1930; Kamp om vasdrag in 1936; L√¶rebok i Norges krigshistorie in 1938, and finally the Civil Defence-related Enkelte synspunkter vedr√∏rende nyordning av v√•rt sivilforsvar in 1958. Norwegian Campaign Mobilising A.R.3 As the German Gruppe 2 broke through the Norwegian coastal forts defending Trondheim major Holtermann was ordered to take part in the mobilisation of Artillery Regiment no. 3 at V√¶rnes. As the Germans advanced on this important army camp it became impossible to complete the mobilisation there and Holtermann sought out a new and more secure location to organize the troops. The choice fell on Ingstadkleiva Fort near the village of Hegra in Stj√∏rdal - a fort placed in reserve in 1926, but still largely intact and defensible. The mountain border fort was soon to become internationally known as Hegra Fortress. Hegra Fortress At Hegra Holtermann organised an improvised force of 250 soldiers and one female volunteer auxiliary with the intention to resist the invaders until effective support could arrive from elsewhere. As the tide of war developed unfavorably for the Norwegian forces in the south of Norway major Holtermann made it his main mission to hold the fort until the expected allied thrust from the north reached his area of operation. From its strategic location Hegra Fortress could have played an important role as a junction for the allied offensive. Holtermann also proposed plans to attempt to bombard the German airfields near Trondheim. However, since the artillery pieces at the fortress were intended to fire eastwards towards Sweden, not westwards towards Trondheim, the guns at Holtermann's disposal could not reach the German held air strips. Attempts were made by the besieged garrison to acquire the tools needed to reconfigure the fixed artillery pieces, but without success. For twenty-five days Holtermann and his small force held out under continuous artillery and Luftwaffe bombardment in what became known as the Battle of Hegra Fortress. In the end the fortress' significance consisted mostly of serving as a moral booster for the Norwegian population in a time of mostly bad news. At 05:15 on 5 May 1940, after resisting a steadily tightening siege for nearly a month, Holtermann met the commander of the local German forces and surrendered his troops as the last commander in the south of Norway. PoW After the surrender at Hegra Holtermann and his soldiers marched into captivity at Berk√•k. At Berk√•k the Norwegians were set at work to repair road damage caused during fighting several weeks earlier. The time the defenders of Hegra spent as POWs varied somewhat, with the first being released as soon as 17 May 1940. Another group was let go on 22 May and the final few, including Holtermann, set free on 2 June. Office manager and resistance fighter Following his release in June 1940 Holtermann did not resign and accept the German occupation of his homeland but quickly became active in the fledgling Norwegian resistance movement. While officially spending the years 1940-1942 working as an office manager for Orkla Metall at Orkanger Holtermann continued resisting the Germans by being secretly active in the resistance movement. In 1942 his illegal activities were finally uncovered by the Germans and he was forced to escape across the border into neutral Sweden. Continued service abroad King Haakon VII and Crown Prince Olav in Scotland. Haakon VII is inspecting a Sten gun. Holtermann in Trondheim during the 1945 Constitution Day celebrations From Sweden Holtermann made his way to the United Kingdom where, in 1943, he assumed the rank of Oberst (Colonel) and took command of the Norwegian Army in exile's main unit - the Norwegian Brigade in Scotland. In 1944 Holtermann was transferred to lead District Command Tr√∏ndelag and returned to Sweden where he took part in Norwegian preparations for the coming liberation of Norway. After the German surrender in Norway on 8 May 1945 Oberst Holtermann led District Command Tr√∏ndelag over the border from Sweden on 10 May, together with two reinforced battalions of 2,570 Norwegian police troops, and took part in the disarmament and internment of the German occupation forces.Brox 1988: 17 Post-war After the war Holtermann spent the first five years in Norway. He first commanded the army artillery in 1946-1948, leading the rebuilding of that Combat Arm in terms of training, methods and materiel.Zeiner-Gundersen 1986: 43 Holtermann then moved on to command the army in North Norway (1949-1950). From 1 November 1950 to 30 April 1952 Holtermann, now with the rank of generalmajor (Major General), took part in the occupation of Germany as the penultimate commander of the Independent Norwegian Brigade Group in Germany. After returning home once more Holtermann spent his last years in the active army as Army Staff Commander and Commander of Allied Land Forces in Southern Norway before leaving the army in 1956. After ending his military service, Holtermann worked on as the leader of the Norwegian Civil Defence forces between 1956 and 1962. Honours By 1930, Holtermann had been made a Chevalier of the French Legion of Honour. In the post-war years Holtermann received numerous medals and orders from both Norway and abroad, the most prestigious being the War Cross with sword (awarded in 1942) and the title of first Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St Olav (awarded in 1956). When Generalmajor Holtermann died in 1966 after just four years of retirement he was given a state funeral on 1 December 1966.Soldat 1985: 46 In 1991 a statue of Holtermann was unveiled at Hegra Fortress by King Harald V of Norway. War Cross citation In the citation to the award of the War Cross with sword to Hans Reidar Holtermann the Norwegian Army High Command wrote: :The defence of Hegra Fort in Stj√∏rdalen by the Lieutenant Colonel is one of the actions from the Campaign of 1940 that has become best known and attracted the greatest amount of interest. I have myself had the opportunity in Norway to read the Lieutenant Colonel's concise, level headed and objective report, and through it gained a strong impression of that his efforts must be seen as a military accomplishment of the greatest order. His gathering of forces at V√¶rnes in the confused conditions of the first day of war and his reactivation of the snow-covered Hegra Fort - which had been placed in reserve - testifies strongly of his clarity of mind and forceful energy. And the continued defence - which was only given up when the other forces in Southern Norway had been forced to cease fighting and after the fort had run completely out of food - shows the Lieutenant Colonel as a strong and forceful leader with the distinctive command abilities that are always such a deciding factor with regard to the defence of surrounded fortresses.

The story is also included as the first entry in King's 2008 short-fiction collection Just After Sunset. In the endnotes in the collection called \\"Sunset Notes\\", King writes of this story: \\"This probably isn't the best story in the book, but I love it very much, because it ushered in a new period of creativity for me ‚Äì as regards the short story, at least. Most of the stories in Just After Sunset were written subsequent to 'Willa', and in fairly quick succession (over a period of not quite two years).\\" Plot summary A man finds himself in a train station after an apparent wreck with a few of the other passengers. Unable to locate his fiancee, Willa, he decides to set out to a nearby town‚Äîwhere he knows she would go‚Äîto find her. The others try to convince him that not only is the train going to arrive any minute to pick them up, going to town is dangerous as the almost three-mile hike goes straight through deserted terrain that is inhabited by dangerous wolves. Ignoring their advice, he heads into town and has a close encounter with one of the wolves on the way. Noticing some lights and music at a nearby honky-tonk, he decides to investigate and finds Willa sitting all alone in a corner booth. As he tries to convince her to come back to the station with him, he realizes what they both have known all along: that he and Willa (along with the rest of the passengers at the train station) are actually ghosts‚Äîdead from a train-wreck that happened nearly 20 years before. When they return to the station, he sees a poster saying that the station will be demolished, a poster the other ghosts are unable to see because of their disbelief. He and Willa leave the station for good, pondering what will happen to the ghosts during demolition. Critical reception Several critics, in reviewing Just After Sunset, also included their opinions of \\"Willa\\". In The Washington Times, the reviewer says, \\"\\"Willa\\" is more than just a flirty romance. It's a ghost story, albeit one with a kicker that causes goosebumps of a different order.\\" Carole Goldberg, in the Sun Sentinel, calls the story a \\"wistful love song in a haunting minor key.\\" A review for NPR says that in \\"Willa\\", as well as in another story in the collection, \\"The Things They Left Behind\\", King uses \\"the supernatural as a way to movingly depict life's frailty.\\"  Film  In 2019, Willa was adapted into a short film and stars Kelsi Mayne, Adrian Jaworski, Madison Seguin and Nick Szeman, was produced by Barbara Szeman and directed by Corey Mayne.

It is an omnivore, a scavenger, and a kleptoparasite and will eat nearly anything. It steals regurgitated krill and fish from penguins when feeding their chicks and will eat their eggs and chicks if given the opportunity. Sheathbills also eat carrion, animal feces, and, where available, human waste. It has been known to eat tapeworms that have been living in a chinstrap penguin's intestine.

It is one of the major tourist attractions of the city. It runs longitudinally in the straight line between the Liberty Square (Plac Wolno≈õci) and the Independence Square (Plac Niepodleg≈Ço≈õci). From the very beginning this street was the central axis, around which the city grew bigger, and its development spontaneously gave the present shape to its centre. At first the city was mainly the highway, but later it changed into the city's showcase, the leisure and shopping centre, where the life of growing industrial agglomeration could be observed. The street deteriorated remarkably after World War II. Only after 1990 was it revitalized step by step and changed into a kind of pedestrian precinct. It has a function similar to a market square of old towns in other cities. Nowadays the buildings, town-planning, institutions, restaurants, clubs and pubs situated next to this street, create its specific atmosphere, which is said to have a \\"cult\\" character reaching even outside of ≈Å√≥d≈∫. History The Grand Hotel, Piotrkowska Street 72 The White Factory, Piotrkowska Street 282 A view of the street from 1900 Piotrkowska Street in 1914 In the beginning, the present Piotrkowska Street functioned as a route joining Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski and Zgierz. On this path a small, roadside urban settlement called ≈Å√≥d≈∫ was located. In 1821 Rajmund Rembieli≈Ñski - the president of the Commission of the Province of Mazovia - took some action in order to regulate the building development in the industrial settlement. This settlement was called The New Town and it was situated in the south from the \\"old\\" ≈Å√≥d≈∫. On the street plan of the settlement, the route line was outlined, and along it the cross streets and standard 17,5‚Äì21 meters wide plots with a surface area of one morgen, allotted to weaving craftsmen. Standard houses were built on those plots ‚Äì a workshop, which stood facing the route, whereas the rest of the plot was a \\"garden\\" for the owner's family. At the northern end of the route, the New Town Market was outlined (now the Liberty Square), which had stood in the south from the Old Town Market. At first (around 1815) the name Piotrkowska Street was used to describe the northern part of the route joining both markets, whereas the southern part (the present Piotrkowska Street) didn't have any name. This means that Piotrkowska Street was a kind of courtyard and market for the huge \\"manufacture of ≈Å√≥d≈∫\\", so for the whole New Town. The fact that ≈Å√≥d≈∫ had this function, is the reason why in this city never developed anything like a classical city centre with a centrally situated market and co-centrally expanding commercial institutions and public organizations, and Piotrkowska Street took on this role.  Revitalization  Before 1990 Piotrkowska Street didn't differ much from other streets, although it was the most important street in the city. The plans of changing Piotrkowska Street into a pedestrian zone, resulted only in moving the trams to a horizontal Promenade (today called Ko≈õciuszki Avenue). Before this change the promenade had a function of a pedestrian avenue. In its centre there was a wide green belt, which later on was used as a tram line. There was not enough of political will to change Piotrkowska Street into a real pedestrian precinct, although this idea came back from time to time. The first step was the gradual reduction of street traffic by introducing \\"no parking\\" or \\"you must turn\\" signs on almost every crossroad from Mickiewicza Avenue to the Independence Square. In 1945-1990 the street suffered from the gradual degradation. Until the 1970s the old, eclectic apartment houses weren't considered by the authorities of those days as historic monuments. Several of them were destroyed and in their places office buildings and shopping centers were built, usually in the international style. In the 1980s some falling off decorative elements of the elevation, dangerous for the passers-by, were simply removed from the walls, even though the renovation of some chosen buildings had already begun. The character of the street changed only after 1990. In this year an architect and a member of an artistic group \\"≈Å√≥d≈∫ Kaliska\\", Marek Janiak, came up with the idea of creating the Foundation of Piotrkowska Street. Its goal was to revitalize this street and turning it into a pedestrian precinct. As the first one, a distance between Pi≈Çsudskiego Avenue and Tuwima Street was excluded from traffic. It was covered with colorful cobblestones and equipped with modernistic street lights and other elements of the so-called street furniture. It was strongly criticized by art conservatives and culture historians, because it didn't suit the general climate of the street. The next parts of the street in the northern direction to the Liberty Square were revitalized and excluded from street traffic in 1993-1997. They were paved with black cobblestones imitating the old pavement and equipped with more and more beautiful elements of the so-called street furniture. Every new part, however, has another kind of surface and another style of decorative elements, which is being criticized as well. Even before the last part of the street, which was meant to be a pedestrian precinct, could be given to the public use, the cobblestones on the first part were remarkably destroyed. From 1995 those cobblestones were gradually replaced by the new ones, which were more grey in color and much more solid. That created a perfect opportunity to build the monument Lodz Citizens of the Millennium. Together with the decoration change of Piotrkowska Street, apartment houses and little palaces standing next to it were revitalized. Some pubs, restaurants, shops and caf√©s moved inside them. At first mainly the front elevations of apartment houses were renovated, but as the popularity of the street increased and some of the most attractive buildings in the front were rented, revitalization gradually reached also backyards and back-premises. Nowadays, although not all of them, the huge number of backyards are paved with cobblestones and used for trading purposes.  Today  Modern view of the street with colourful apartment buildings Today Piotrkowska Street is the axis of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ agglomeration. Here, in its proximity, almost all of the most important administrative offices, banks, shops, restaurants and pubs are situated. The most of the events, outdoor parties, marches and official celebrations, organized by the city of ≈Å√≥d≈∫, are taking place here... Piotrkowska, which was called by many people Bigel some time ago, now is more and more commonly described as Pietryna. It is a cultural, political, sentimental, commercial and business centre of Lodz. Between Tuwima Street and Nawrot Street there is the Monument of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Citizens of Millennium Change, which is a nominal surface covering the part of Piotrkowska Street. This is probably the only monument of this kind in the world, consisting of 13.454 nominal cobblestones. Some time ago a huge shopping centre Galeria ≈Å√≥dzka was built next to Piotrkowska Street. This made many shops move from Piotrkowska Street, and that's why we could observe the visible standstill. But after about a year the empty spaces that remained after the previous shops, started to be used again, some of them, however, still stood empty in the beginning of 2006. In this group was one of the most representative- the former Dom Buta. The similar process is being observed after another shopping centre ‚Äì Manufaktura - was opened next to the northern end of the street. The northern part of the street is pedestrianised, although emergency and 'security' vehicles are allowed to speed along it - and do with alarming hostility and frequency, even weaving between the numerous beer gardens in the summer. The width of Piotrkowska Street varies between 17 and 26 meters. OFF Piotrkowska OFF Piotrkowska is an alternative dining and shopping area situated in the former Ramisch factory at 138‚Äì140 Piotrkowska, which operated as Franciszek Ramisch‚Äôs cotton mill until 1990. Food trucks, bars, clubs, alternative music venues, studios, design companies and publishing houses occupy the buildings and open spaces.

George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo, and John Clutchette were alleged to have murdered Mills in retaliation for the shooting deaths of three black prisoners during a prison fight in the exercise yard three days prior by another guard, Opie G. Miller. Soledad Prison George Jackson met W. L. Nolen through the Black Panther Party in Soledad State Prison in 1969. They were transferred together to the O Wing, along with Drumgo and Clutchette, which was considered the worst part of the adjustment center of which Max Row is a part. According to Jackson, in the O Wing \\"the strongest hold out no more than a couple of weeks. It destroys the logical processes of the mind, a man's thoughts become completely disorganized. The noise, madness streaming from every throat, frustrated sounds from the bars, metallic sounds from the walls, the steel trays, the iron beds bolted to the wall, the hollow sounds from a cast-iron sink or toilet. The smells, the human waste thrown at us, unwashed bodies, the rotten food. When a white con leaves here he's ruined for life. No black leaves Max Row walking. Either he leaves on the meat wagon or he leaves crawling licking at the pig's feet.\\" In Jackson's letters from the prison he describes the attitude of the staff toward the convicts as both defensive and hostile, apparently out of pure malevolence. His account of life at the prison was used by the Soledad Brothers Defense Committee. Prison yard riot On January 13, 1970, 14 black inmates and 2 white inmates from the maximum-security section of Soledad Prison were released into a recreation yard. It had been several months since they were last released into the yard. The black prisoners were ordered to the far end of the yard, while the white prisoners remained near the center of the yard. Officer Opie G. Miller, an expert marksman armed with a rifle, watched over the inmates from a guard tower above the yard. A fist fight ensued and Miller opened fire on the prisoners below. No warning shot was fired. Three black inmates were killed in the shooting: W.L. Nolen and Cleveland Edwards died in the yard, while Alvin Miller died in the prison hospital a few hours later. A white inmate, Billy D. Harris, was wounded in the groin by Miller's fourth shot, and ended up losing a testicle. In a letter from June 10, 1970, George Jackson described the scene as seeing three of his brothers having been \\"murdered [...] by a pig shooting from 30 feet above their heads with a military rifle.\\" Following the incident, thirteen black prisoners began a hunger strike in the hopes of securing an investigation. On January 16, 1970, a Monterey County grand jury convened, then exonerated Miller in the deaths of Nolen, Edwards, and Miller with a ruling of \\"justifiable homicide\\". No black inmates were permitted to testify, including those who had been in the recreation yard during the shooting. In Soledad Prison, inmates heard the grand jury's ruling on the prison radio. Thirty minutes later, John V. Mills was found dying in another maximum-security wing of the prison, having been beaten and thrown from a third-floor tier of Y Wing, George Jackson's cellblock, to the television room below. On February 14, 1970, after an investigation into Mills' death by prison officials, George Lester Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo and John Wesley Clutchette were indicted by the Monterey County grand jury for first-degree murder. Soledad Brothers Defense Committee The Soledad Brothers Defense Committee was formed by Fay Stender to assist in publicizing the case and raising funds to defend Jackson, Drumgo, and Clutchette. Among the several celebrities, writers, and left-wing political activists that supported the SBDC and their cause were Julian Bond, Kay Boyle, Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda, Noam Chomsky, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, Tom Hayden, William Kunstler, Jessica Mitford, Linus Pauling, Pete Seeger, Benjamin Spock, and Angela Davis. In June 1970, California State Senator Mervyn Dymally and the California Legislative Black Caucus pursued an investigation of Soledad Prison and released a report that tried to legitimize the committee and give it some credibility. Public reaction was mixed. By the middle of that month, Davis was leading the movement. Stender also arranged the publication of Soledad Brother: The Prison Letters of George Jackson, which was to contain various letters written by Jackson while in prison detailing his time spent in the prison throughout the trial. Jonathan Jackson's attempt to free the Soledad Brothers On August 7, 1970, George Jackson's seventeen-year-old brother Jonathan held up a courtroom during the trial of prisoner James McClain, charged at the time with the attempted stabbing of a Soledad guard at the Marin County Civic Center. Jonathan Jackson, after having armed McClain, temporarily freed three San Quentin prisoners, and took Superior Court Judge Harold Haley, Deputy District Attorney Gary Thomas, and three women on the jury hostage to secure the freedom of the \\"Soledad Brothers\\". Jackson, McClain, Haley, and a prisoner named William Christmas were killed as they attempted to drive away from the courthouse. Haley died due to the discharge of a sawed-off shotgun that had been fastened to his neck with adhesive tape by the abductors. Thomas, prisoner Ruchell Magee, and one of the jurors were wounded. Two days after his brother's death, in George Jackson's last letter in his collection of letters written while in prison, he wrote a letter to his deceased brother, signing it: > Cold and calm though. > 'All right, gentlemen, I'm taking over now.' > Revolution, George\\" Angela Davis, who purchased the guns used in the escape attempt, was later tried on several charges in connection with the escape. A jury found her not guilty on murder, kidnapping, and criminal conspiracy charges.Caldwell. Earl. \\"Angela Davis Acquitted on All Charges\\", The New York Times, June 5, 1972. San Quentin Six On August 21, 1971, days before his trial in the guard's killing, the 29-year-old Jackson allegedly launched a riot at San Quentin with a 9 mm pistol. There is controversy over the course of events that led to Jackson's obtaining of the firearm. Prison officials alleged that Stephen Bingham, the attorney who replaced Fay Stender as Jackson's attorney, visited Jackson. Bingham was alleged to have smuggled Jackson a pistol and an Afro wig. He was purported to have given a wig to Jackson within in which to hide the gun. However, Bingham was found not guilty of this charge in an ensuing trial in 1986. Prison officials had claimed that as Jackson was attempting to leave his meeting with Bingham, a gun protruded from a wig he was wearing and Jackson was asked to show the object. With a gun in hand, Jackson released an entire floor of prisoners from the maximum-security wing, allegedly saying, \\"This is it, gentlemen, the Dragon has come!\\" In the ensuing melee, three guards were killed, as were two prisoners suspected of being snitches, before George Jackson rushed out into the yard where he was shot and killed by a guard. Other people involved in the case believe Jackson's death was a setup by prison authorities, who conspired to supply Jackson with a gun, in the hopes that he would be killed in the ensuing melee, allegedly because they saw his power as a threat to their control and authority. Inconsistencies in the stories, although common among eyewitnesses in many crimes, fueled the controversy and helped to set off an uprising at Attica Correctional Facility in New York three weeks later. Bingham's acquittal in 1986 on charges that he smuggled Jackson a gun and a wig, and was thereby responsible for the escape attempt and murders, occurred after he emerged from hiding for 13 years in order to stand trial. Trial In San Francisco, proceedings were held in the Department 21 courtroom on the third floor of the Hall of Justice, the same courtroom in which Ruchell Magee would later be tried on charges related to the murder of Judge Haley. Spectators, including the press, were separated from the proceedings by a $15,000 floor-to-ceiling barrier constructed of metal, wood, and bullet-proof glass. Throughout the trial, there were attempts to annul the proceedings on technicalities. There were complaints on behalf of the defendants that they were not informed of the scheduled court hearing, specifically in a letter from George Jackson on June 13, 1970. They also claimed the court report stated that 1-48 pages of the testimony were recorded and they were only given 1-46 pages of testimony. After Jackson's death, on March 27, 1972, the two surviving Soledad Brothers‚ÄîClutchette and Drumgo‚Äîwere acquitted by a San Francisco jury of the original charges of murdering a prison guard on the grounds that the state had failed to completely prove its case.\\"Acquit Soledad Brothers\\", Pacific Stars and Stripes, March 29, 1972, p. 1 Notes References Further reading * Soledad Brother: The Prison Letters of George Jackson (1970). * Min S Yee.

The station is owned by the Black Crow Media Group and the broadcast license is held by BCA Radio, LLC. The signal covers most of northern Alabama and southern central Tennessee. WAHR is one of the top-rated radio stations in the Huntsville market. Its studios are located off University Drive (U.S. 72) in Huntsville, and its transmitter is located north of the city. History WAHR was founded in 1959 by Arnold Hornbuckle. It was Alabama's first stand-alone FM radio station. The call letters stood for 'Arnold Hornbuckle Records.' At the time of licensing, he owned Hornbuckle's Record Shop, also in Huntsville, Alabama. Shortly after the station began broadcasting, Bill Lane became the station's manager and a minority shareholder. Lane retired in 1990. In the early 1960s a signature phrase was \\"Broadcasting from the top of the Times Building\\". Some of the station operators were servicemen stationed at Redstone Arsenal and promotional literature included a letter from Dr. Wernher von Braun complimenting the station on its classical music programs. After nearly 40 years serving the Tennessee Valley, Hornbuckle retired, selling the station in July 1999. In 2009, Hornbuckle was inducted into the Alabama Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame. WAHR is currently owned by Black Crow Media Group whose other local radio stations include WRTT-FM and WLOR. In November 2001, due to a proposed refinancing of the parent company, license holder STG Media, LLC, applied to the FCC to transfer the licenses of WAHR, WLOR, and WRTT-FM to Black Crow Media Group subsidiary BCA Media, LLC. Just two days later, another application was filed to shift the licenses to BCA Radio, LLC. The FCC approved the moves on November 15, 2001, and the consummation of the transaction occurred on November 19, 2001. In June 2009, the station transitioned from an adult contemporary music format to a Hot AC music mix. As of May 2013, though, the station had returned to its former mainstream AC format. In January 2010, Black Crow Media Group and its subsidiaries filed for \\"Chapter 11\\" bankruptcy, seeking to reorganize rather than be broken up. Their filing with the FCC notified the Commission of the involuntary transfer of the license from BCA Radio, LLC, to an entity known as BCA Radio, LLC, Debtor-In- Possession. In November 2011, Black Crow Media Group announced that it was reorganizing its radio holdings and consolidating the four subsidiaries acting as debtors in possession (including BCA Radio, LLC) into a new company named Southern Stone Communications, LLC. The FCC approved the transfer on December 19, 2011. Awards In November 2007, WAHR won the American Cancer Society's Mid-South Division award for best radio supporter for 2006-07. The station was cited for having \\"strongly supported\\" the ACS's Relay for Life, gala, golf tournament and other events sponsored by the national and local cancer organizations.

The station originally broadcast a more rock-based classic hits format as The River; eventually, by the late 2000s, it had shifted to pop- based classic hits of the 60s, 70s, and 80s, while still mixing in rock hits. Rick and Bubba relocated from crosstown rival WRTT-FM on January 2, 2008.  HD Radio  On September 13, 2018, after briefly stunting with baseball- related music as \\"Trash Pandas Radio\\", WQRV-HD3 launched an alternative rock format as Alt 92.9. It is carried on translator station W225AH.

As the vast majority of Europeans speak Indo-European languages, a result of the westward portion of the prehistoric Indo-European migrations, the bulk of the indigenous languages of Europe became extinct thousands of years ago without leaving any record of their existence as they were superseded by Celtic, Italic, Germanic, Balto-Slavic, Hellenic, and Iranian Indo-European languages. A small minority of these extinct languages, however, survived long enough to be attested. On the other hand, many European Indo-European languages themselves, such as Gothic, have also become extinct. In some cases however, it is not known whether a language has a spoken descendant or not. For example, because of the uncertain origin of the Albanian language‚Äîaside from its being an Indo-European language‚Äîand because little remains of the ancient languages in question, it is disputed whether Dacian, Thracian or Illyrian have a spoken descendant, Albanian. And because of the scarcity of the evidence, it is not known whether Basque is a descendant of the Aquitanian language. Although the Pomeranian language has a spoken descendant, the Kashubian language, the other dialects of Pomeranian are extinct.

History PhilNITS was initially known as the Japanese IT Standards Exams of the Philippines Foundation, Inc. (JITSE-Phil), and was registered as such with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 10, 2002 and set up its office at the Penthouse of the Prince Bldg, in Rada Street, Legazpi Village, Makati City, A week after its incorporation, the Japan IT Engineers Examination Center (JITEC) represented by its President, Mr. Takao Tominaga, signed a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) with the JITSE-Phil Foundation, represented by its Founding President, Ms. Ma. Corazon M. Akol in ceremonies held at the Makati Shangri-La, Manila Hotel and witnessed by Ambassador Ara of Japan, Secretary Mar Roxas of the Department of Trade and Industry, Chairman Virgilio Pena of Information Technology and E-Commerce Council (now Commission on Information and Communications Technology), Mr. Yoshikai, Deputy Director General of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and Mr. Sakai, Commercial Attache of Japan to the Philippines. DTI started to support JITSE- Phil in 2003 by providing it with its office space at the Oppen Building in Makati City, in 2005, at the WDC Building in Cebu City and in 2007, at the Mintrade Bldg. in Davao City. With the MRA between JITEC and JITSE-Phil, it was able to receive technical support from Japan. JITEC has been providing guidance, training, necessary hardware/software programs, and the documentation required in implementing the Standards on the Fundamentals of IT (FE) and in Software Design and Development (SW). On May 29, 2003, the Bureau of Product Standards (BPS) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), after due consultation with the National Computer Center (NCC), accepted JITSE as the Phil. National Standard - PNS 2030:2003 Information Technology Engineers Skills Standards. On May 30, 2003, after an evaluation of the results of the First Certification Exams conducted by JITSE-Phil on the Fundamentals of IT Engineers (FE), the Ministry of Justice of Japan recognized JITSE as the Philippine Nihon Joho Gijutsu Hyojun Shiken Zaidan. With this official recognition by the Ministry of Justice, the FE Certificate, more popularly called the JITSE Certificate, can be used as a valid document for processing the work visas of IT professionals bound for Japan. With the Asia IT Initiative Program (AITI) of METI, JITSE-Phil was able to receive technical support from Japan through the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), the Association for Overseas Technical Scholarships (AOTS) and the Center of the International Cooperation on Computerization (CICC). JETRO has provided JITSE- Phil since 2003, through the Japan Expert Service Abroad (JEXSA) Project, technical experts and the training facilities in its offices in Makati, Cebu, and Davao. AOTS has provided Training Courses in the Philippines (in the various offices of JITSE-Phil as well as in some schools in provinces where JITSE-Phil has no Training Center) and have awarded scholarships for training in Japan. On August 31, 2004. JITSE-Phil changed its name to PhilNITS Foundation to correct the misconception that the standards being implemented only for the Japanese market but for Asia. In the ITEE Conference held at the AOTS Yokohama Kenshu Center, JITEC and the 6 organizations with mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) with JITEC, decided to form the Information Technology Professional Examination Council or ITPEC. The members of ITPEC are: the Japan Information Technology Examination Center (JITEC) of Japan, the Multimedia Technology Enhancement & Operations Sendirian Berhad (METEOR) of Malaysia, the Myanmar Computer Federation (MCF) of Myanmar, the Japan- Mongolian Information Technology Association (JMITA) of Mongolia, (now replaced by the National IT Park, NITP), the Philippine National IT Standards Foundation (PhilNITS) of the Philippines, the National Electronics and Computer technology Center (NECTEC) of Thailand, and the Vietnam Information Technology Examination and Training Support Center (VITEC) of Vietnam. In this Agreement, the members decided to have a common exam, on the same agreed upon date and time, and to recognize each other‚Äôs Certificate. ITPEC members have been using the same logo to raise public recognition of the examination and have adopted a common marketing strategy. JITEC-IPA expects to establish multi-lateral mutual recognition agreements, and transform ITPEC into a fully Asia-wide organization. Through Grants from AOTS, PhilNITS has trained 8,174 IT Professionals in the Philippines and has sent 197 scholars to Japan. CICC has provided several Training programs as well as an e Learning System consisting of the hardware (2 servers and 4 terminals), the software (that can accommodate a maximum of 2000 users) and contents consisting of 24 modules developed by JITEC and CICC and 1 module developed by the Thomson Learning Center, donated by Fujitsu to PhilNITS. All the modules are made available to the public, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through a subscription fee of ‚Ç±500.00 per month. Current Certifications The ITPEC certification exams (known locally as PhilNITS certification exams) are administered as written below. Currently there are three levels of examination being administered by PhilNITS. Topics covered by the exams are those of technology, strategy and management. IT professionals who pass these certification examinations are certified for life. An IT professional may take directly the certification level he/she would want to take. There is no limit to the number of times you take the examinations until you pass the exams. ITPEC Fundamentals of IT Passport Exam (IP Exam, Level 1) Known locally as PhilNITS IP, the Information Technology Passport Exam is for individuals who have basic knowledge in IT that all business workers should commonly possess, and who are doing information technology related tasks or trying to utilize IT related technology in their tasks. The exam lasts about 165 minutes (conducted during a morning schedule). It consists of 100 questions in multiple choice (one per four choices) broke down into two types: the short question type, one question per item, 88 questions; and medium question type, four questions per item, 12 questions (3 items). The pilot examination was conducted last March 28, 2010. The first regular exam was conducted last October 24, 2010. This exam is conducted twice a year in last Sunday of April and last Sunday of October. ITPEC Fundamentals of IT Engineers Exam (FE Exam, Level 2) Known locally as PhilNITS FE, this exam is conducted twice a year in the last Sunday of April and last Sunday of October.

Biography Born in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, the son of a lawyer, Race learned the piano from the age of five.Spencer Leigh \\"Steve Race: Musician and broadcaster best known for his association with the programme 'My Music'\\", The Independent, 24 June 2009 He was educated (1932‚Äì37) at Lincoln School, where he formed his first jazz group, which included a young Neville Marriner, later a major figure in the world of classical music. At sixteen, he attended the Royal Academy of Music, studying composition under Harry Farjeon and William Alwyn. After leaving the Academy, Race (encouraged by the classical music critic of the News Chronicle, Scott Goddard) wrote occasional dance band reviews for Melody Maker and, in 1939, joined the Harry Leader dance band as pianist, succeeding Norrie Paramour.Leigh, Spenser. 'Race, Stephen Russell' in The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2013) Race joined the Royal Air Force in 1941, and formed a jazz/dance quintet. After the Second World War, he began a long and productive career with the BBC, where his ready wit, musicianship and broad musical knowledge made him much sought after as a musical accompanist for panel games and magazine shows, such as Whirligig and Many a Slip. In, 1949 The Steve Race Bop Group recorded some of the first British bebop records,Bop- In' Britain Volume 1 - The Learning Curve, Jasmine Records JASCD 637 (2003), Discogs.com and he developed a sideline arranging player piano rolls for the Artona company. From the 1950s to the 1980s, he presented numerous music programmes on radio and television. Additionally, in 1955, he was appointed the first Light Music Advisor to the independent television company Associated-Rediffusion. He is probably best known as the chairman of the long- running light-hearted radio and TV panel game My Music which ran from 1967 to 1994. He presented and wrote most of the questions for all 520 episodes broadcast. He also presented Jazz For Moderns on radio and Jazz 625 on television for the BBC in the 1960s. Away from music, for two years from 1970 Race co-presented (with William Hardcastle) the BBC Radio 4 \\"drive-time\\" news magazine PM. Race coined the term Denham Concerto for short romantic film pieces inspired by the success of Richard Addinsell's Warsaw Concerto, such as Hubert Bath's Cornish Rhapsody, Nino Rota's Legend of the Glass Mountain and Charles Williams' The Dream of Olwen, after the Denham Film Studios. Composer As a composer, he produced a number of pieces in the classical, jazz and popular idioms. It is likely that the composer of light Latin American dance tunes known as \\"Esteban Cera\\" was Race hiding behind a pseudonym. One of his better-known compositions is the short instrumental piece Nicola (named after his daughter). His Pied Piper (The Beeje) reached No. 29 in the UK Singles Chart in March 1963. Race wrote (and with the Steve Race Orchestra performed) library music for the Chappell Recorded Music Library, an example being Pacemaker. But his best-known and, according to his autobiography, his most lucrative composition is his music for the Birds Eye frozen peas jingle, \\"Sweet as the moment when the pod went pop\\". In the mid-1970s The Pied Piper was played as Queen's Park Rangers ran onto the pitch at the start of each home game at Loftus Road. Steve Race was a season ticket holder and keen fan of the club. Race also wrote the acoustic guitar jingle which introduced programmes made by Southern Television in the 1970s and early 1980s. In the film Calling Paul Temple (1948) Race (with Sid Colin) wrote two of the songs performed by Celia Lipton, and appeared himself as the pianist/bandleader in the nightclub section. He also wrote the score for the 1962 British B-movie crime film Crosstrap. Personal life Race's autobiography, Musician at Large, was published in 1979, and in 1988 Souvenir Press Ltd published his book about his grandfather's short but interesting life, from lead miner to missionary, entitled The Two Worlds of Joseph Race. Race married Marjorie Leng in 1944 and they had a daughter, Nicola. Marjorie died from cancer in 1969. He married again in 1970, to radio producer L√©onie Mather, who survived him. Race had his first heart attack in 1965. He died of the second attack at his home in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, in June 2009.

Historical background Sacred Heart Church had been better known as White Marsh after the long stretch of sandy loam between the church and the Patuxent River and marsh. This soil contains a significant amount of mica which appears sparkling white. Beginning with the Protestant Revolution in Maryland in 1689, Catholics were prohibited to worship publicly and the Catholic Church was not allowed to own land. The original patent to the \\"White Marsh\\" property was granted by the authority of Charles Calvert II in 1722 to James Carroll. On February 12, 1728, Carroll bequeathed of White Marsh, then known as Carroll's Burgh, to the Jesuits at St. Thomas Manor in the vicinity of Port Tobacco, Maryland. During this time, while Catholics could not worship publicly, they could do so privately and were able to build private chapels on privately held land. To facilitate the construction of a church, Carroll left the land to the individual Jesuits. That allowed them to construct the Mission of Saint Francis Borgia in 1722 on the property, which is considered the founding of Sacred Heart Church. George Thorold assumed ownership of the property in 1729 at the bequest of James Carroll. The property on which Sacred Heart Church would be built was then designated White Marsh Plantation. Jesuits lived on the plantation as private citizens and engaged in missionary work in the surrounding area. Jesuits living at the White Marsh Plantation, including Reverend John Lewis and John Ashton, brought enslaved persons to operate the plantation. The Jesuits did not take up permanent residence at White Marsh until about 1741, when a chapel was constructed. The old chapel  The bell tower was added in 1876 The old chapel is the only Catholic church built before the American revolution in Prince George's County. The current chapel building was built on the hill circa 1827 at the east end of the original chapel and is constructed of undressed stone, with a gable roof. In 1853, a fire destroyed the interior of the building but left the stone walls standing. The interior was rebuilt by 1855. In 1876 a wood-frame bell tower was added to the church at the east end of the gable. Surrounding land Adjoining the chapel is a large cemetery with gravestones dating from 1830. Elm Street Development has a contract to purchase 154 acres of land surrounding the chapel from the Corporation of Roman Catholic Clergymen, which has owned the property since the 1728 land grant of Carroll's Burgh from John Carroll. The developer seeks to change zoning on the parcel and construct 440 single-family homes, but faces local opposition. New church A much larger, modern brick church, was built at the foot of the hill, fronting Maryland Route 450 and dedicated in 1969 to accommodate the growth of Bowie due to the Levitt and Sons development, \\"Belair at Bowie\\", where most of its current congregants live. General Chapters organizing the Catholic Church in the US After the American revolution, Catholics in the newly created United States enjoyed freedom to worship. The Jesuit Fathers, led by John Carroll and five other priests, began a series of meetings at White Marsh beginning on 27 June 1783 called the General Chapters that organized the Catholic Church in the United States. They held a second meeting 6 November 1783, and a third on 11 October 1784, at the same place, when they formulated the draft of the regulations binding all the clergy of Maryland. It was decided at these meetings every priest was maintained and given thirty pounds a year, and each priest agreed to offer ten Masses for every priest who died there. It was at this same meeting that those assembled voted John Carroll's name to be included in a petition sent to the Pope requesting Carroll's appointment to an office that ultimately resulted in Carroll becoming the first Roman Catholic bishop in the United States. On May 18, 1789, during a meeting at White Marsh, he would be confirmed as the first American bishop.

Notes *The Willard Munger Bicycle Trail (63-miles in length) currently begins in the Norton Park neighborhood at 75th Avenue West, near Grand Avenue. There are plans to have the Munger Trail extended to Duluth's Canal Park and connect with the lakewalk. The project was expected to begin in 2011. The Western Waterfront Trail also begins at 75th Avenue West. *This area also contains one of the last community parks maintained by neighborhood residents in the city. This is due in part by the dedication of people such as Charles J. Oliver, a life long resident and Denfeld graduate. *The Norton Park Community Center building was built in 1965 and is made of 18‚Äì20 gauge steel from the Duluth Steel Building Company. The original steel part of the building sits on a 5 inch monolithic concrete slab that is 50 feet by 33 feet. The building is 15 feet tall. A small concrete block addition was added later. *The location of the community park at 81st Avenue West and Coleman Street was once the site of the Norton Park School during the 1920s and 1930s. *Norton Park has two churches.

It teaches children from 11 to 18 - Years 7-13. It is located in Arnold but it serves children from various nearby areas including Killisick, Daybrook, Woodthorpe, Mapperley, Carlton, Sherwood. It is split into 4 buildings (\\"A-Block\\" (previously Upper School), \\"B-Block\\" (previously Lower School), \\"6th Form Centre\\", and \\"Ramsey House\\" (previously Nurture Centre)) and has around 1600 pupils and over 100 teachers. History Grammar school to Comprehensive The original designation was the Arnold County High School, which was opened in 1959 as a grammar school. Pupils came from about a ten-mile (16 km) radius : the county was in an extensive school building programme, to cope with the post-war baby boom. Third year pupils from Arnold Girls Secondary School and Robert Mellors secondary School in Arnold in 1975 heralded the schools new Comprehensive status. Initially, on the site, there was a lower school for first and second year pupils (formerly the girls secondary modern school building), the first batch of 120 third year pupils moved straight into the middle school, which consisted of 6 classrooms, six large house rooms, used for dining and house activities, and between them, three kitchens. The first headmaster was Dr J H Higginson, who wrote a book on the establishment of the school, entitled A School Is Born, ( - published 1987) which covered many aspects of the school. The first deputy head was W T N Thompson. Several of the younger initial teaching staff remained for many years. The school operated a house system where the 'names' were then living international identities - clockwise around the three sided middle school, these were: * Gladys Aylward * Ryder-Cheshire (Leonard Cheshire and Sue Ryder) * Pandit - Anton Makarenko, Eleanor Roosevelt and Albert Schweitzer. Pupils were encouraged to forge links with the countries represented by those houses A new school was built in the mid-1960s on the same site. In 1974, the separate schools occupying these premises were amalgamated to form Arnold Hill Comprehensive School. Lower School fire (2004) In September 2004 the school was forced to close for several months when a large fire destroyed 16 of the recently refurbished classrooms in the Lower School building. The school quickly allowed sixth form students and GCSE pupils (Years 10 & 11) to return, but the reduced number of classrooms - smoke and structural damage meant that the entire Lower School building was uninhabitable, except the reception and hall area - prevented pupils from years 7, 8 & 9 from returning for several weeks. Their return was delayed and rescheduled several times because of delays in the construction of the Portakabins, but eventually they were returned to school. The large array of Portakabin buildings were known officially as \\"The Village\\". Controversy surrounding \\"stripper\\" (2007) On 6 November 2007, a stripper performed at the school for a student's birthday. According to The Daily Telegraph, the student's mother hired the stripper as a birthday gift for her 16-year-old son as a mistake, intending to order a man in a gorilla suit. The stripper undressed to her undergarments before being asked to stop by a faculty member. A spokeswoman has said \\"There was an incident, we are aware of it, and it is being dealt with.\\" Sixth Form Centre fire (2010) On Wednesday April 28, 2010 at 11:30pm a fire broke out in the Sixth Form block. Fire crews spent six hours tackling the fire but the Sixth Form block was completely destroyed by the blaze. Consequently, the building was demolished. As of June 2010 a new Sixth Form building has been constructed using Portakabins. The construction of a new centre began in early 2011, which is now complete. New Upper School building In June 2014, Arnold Hill Academy gained funding from the EFA (Education Funding Agency) to rebuild the Upper School site which had been built in 1959. The whole of the upper school grounds were demolished and remodeled into additional sports pitches and recreational areas. The new upper school building - now referred to as A Block - was established in the place of the old Rugby pitch and consists of three floors of classrooms, an assembly hall, a sports hall, a food servery and 70 individual toilets (arranged into 5 groups of 14).

The film was written by Minghella, his first original screenplay since his 1990 feature debut Truly, Madly, Deeply and his final feature film before his death in 2008. Set in a blighted, inner-city neighbourhood of London, the film is about a successful landscape architect whose dealings with a young thief and his mother cause him to re-evaluate his life. Minghella previously directed the film's stars ‚Äì Jude Law in Cold Mountain and The Talented Mr. Ripley, and Juliette Binoche in The English Patient. In his first major film role, Rafi Gavron portrays Miro, the young traceur burglar, a role requiring several difficult physical feats. The film is a presentation of Miramax and The Weinstein Company and was distributed in the United States by Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer. Breaking and Entering premiered on 13 September 2006 at the Toronto International Film Festival. Plot Will Francis (Jude Law), a young Englishman, is a landscape architect living a detached, routine-based life in London with his Swedish-American girlfriend Liv (Robin Wright) and her autistic daughter Bea. The 13-year-old girl's irregular sleeping and eating habits as well as her unsocial behaviour (she has trouble relating to people and seems only interested in doing somersaults and gymnastics) reach worrying proportions and start to put a lot of strain on Will and Liv's relationship. Complicating the situation further is his feeling of being shut out of their inner circle since Bea is not his biological daughter. He and Liv start relationship counselling, but their drifting apart continues. Simultaneously on the business front, Will's and his partner Sandy's (Martin Freeman) state- of-the-art offices in the Kings Cross area are repeatedly burgled by a group of Slavic-language-speaking thieves. The thieves employ a 15-year-old traceur named Mirsad \\"Miro\\" (Rafi Gavron) whose acrobatic skills allow them to enter the building. Miro is actually a refugee from Bosnia and Herzegovina living with his Bosnian Muslim mother Amira (Juliette Binoche) who works as a seamstress, while his Serbian father got murdered during the war. Though they're puzzled about the burglars' ability to disable the alarm, the two architects are not particularly worried after the first break-in, mostly writing it off to the neighbourhood's dodgy reputation. However, after the second break-in, they decide to stake out the building after hours hoping to find the culprit and alert the police. Being out of the house on nightly stakeouts actually suits Will just fine, allowing him to get away from the cold atmosphere of his household. He even strikes up a strange acquaintance with an Eastern European prostitute named Oana (Vera Farmiga) who hangs around the area every night. Spotting Miro attempting to break in one night, Will attempts to follow him. This pursuit leads Will to the flat where Miro lives with his mother Amira. Realizing their modest living means, he decides not to report his findings to the police, but goes back to Amira's apartment under the guise of having a suit that needs mending. He soon becomes emotionally entangled with her, causing him to re-evaluate his life. Conflict arises when the police close in on the burglars, and Will must make a crucial choice which will affect the lives of everyone around him.

The filming location for Amira's flat is Rowley Way, South Hampstead, London. Since a suitable location near Kings Cross couldn't be found, Will's office was recreated in an old foundry located in Dace Road, by the Old Ford Lock, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

Reception The film received largely negative reviews from film critics, with review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes giving the film a 34% rating based on 127 film critic reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"This class warfare drama feels contrived and superficial: characters don't act logically as the movie manipulates them towards deconstructing various social issues.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a 56 out of 100 rating, based on 27 reviews.

Born in London in 1908, David Franklin was educated at Alleyn's School in Dulwich and at St Catharine's College, Cambridge. He originally trained as a schoolteacher. A bass singing in amateur productions, he was discovered in 1934 by John Christie, the founder of the Glyndebourne festival. In 1936, at the age of 28, he made his professional debut as the Commendatore in Don Giovanni at Glyndebourne. He sang with both the English and Welsh National Opera companies. He was leading bass at Covent Garden from 1947. He created the role of Mars in the world premiere of Sir Arthur Bliss's opera The Olympians in 1949. A throat condition forced his retirement from professional singing in 1951. He taught at St. Albans School in Hertfordshire during the 1940s and early 1950s, directing many School productions during this time. On retirement, Franklin turned to writing and broadcasting. He wrote the libretto for Phyllis Tate's opera The Lodger. An excellent raconteur, Franklin was, from 1966 to 1973, a panellist on the light-hearted radio panel game My Music, chaired by Steve Race. Ill health forced him to retire in early 1973 during the eighth season of the show. He was replaced initially by Owen Brannigan and later, after Brannigan's sudden death, by John Amis. He also became the chairman of the very long running popular BBC radio panel game Twenty Questions from 1970 to 1972, following in the steps of fellow distinguished broadcasters Gilbert Harding, Richard Dimbleby, and Kenneth Horne. He died in 1973 at his home in Evesham, survived by his wife, Hilda (n√©e Bickell) and two daughters.  Literature  *D.

Horrified, she is not quite clear as to the details, but maintains a strict secrecy. On an ocean liner returning to the United States she becomes acquainted with Philip Romilly (Barrie), a playwright, who prepares her for her first stage vehicle. The murderer is also a passenger on the ship, but the trip is made without serious adventure. The play opens and is a success, Elizabeth sharing in the calling. Sylvanus Power (Randolf), whose money made the show possible, lays siege to Elizabeth's affections, but the new star is in love with Philip. Sylvanus then determines to ruin Philip by connecting him to the murder, only to find that the man supposedly killed is alive and well. The film ends with Philip and Elizabeth together.

Life Iseult's mother Maud Gonne had conceived a child, Georges, with her French Boulangist lover Lucien Millevoye. When the baby died, possibly by meningitis, Gonne was distraught, and buried him in a large memorial chapel built for him with money she had inherited. Gonne separated from Millevoye after Georges' death, but in late 1893 she arranged to meet him at the mausoleum in Samois-sur-Seine and, next to the coffin, they had sexual intercourse. Her purpose was to conceive a baby with the same father, to whom the soul of Georges would transmigrate in metempsychosis. Iseult was born as a result on 6 August 1894. Iseult was educated at a Carmelite convent in Laval, France; when she returned to Ireland she was referred to as Maud's niece or cousin rather than daughter. In 1903 Maud Gonne married John MacBride; Iseult's half-brother Se√°n MacBride was born in 1904. The couple separated in 1905. The family mostly lived in France until John MacBride's death in the 1916 Rising, with Gonne fearing that Sean's father would seize him from her. In a separation settlement, MacBride was granted a month's summer custody, however, he returned to Ireland and never saw his child again. Iseult's relationship with her stepfather was tainted by an allegation by William Butler Yeats, who wrote to Lady Gregory in January 1905 (the month MacBride and Maud separated) that he had been told MacBride had molested Iseult, who at that time was ten years old.Foster, 331-2 However, many critics have suggested that Yeats may have fabricated the event due to his hatred of MacBride over Maud's rejection of him in favour of MacBride. The divorce papers submitted by Gonne made no mention of any such incident ‚Äì the only charge against MacBride that was substantiated in court was that he was drunk on one occasion during the marriage and Iseult's own writings make no mention of the allegation. In 1913, Iseult met Rabindranath Tagore. Inspired by his poetry, she began to learn Bengali in 1914, tutored by Devabrata Mukerjea. Together, in France, they translated some of Tagore's The Gardener into French directly from the Bengali. Tagore left it to Yeats' discretion to decide the merit of the work, but Yeats did not feel sufficiently fluent in French to judge them. The translations were never published. Iseult was widely considered a great beauty, and temperate, able to speak her mind. She attracted the admiration of literary figures including Ezra Pound, Lennox Robinson and Liam O'Flaherty. Her most infamous association was with Yeats, who had long been in love with her mother. In 1916, in his fifties, Yeats proposed to the 22-year-old Iseult who refused his advances. He had known her since she was four and often referred to her as his darling child. Many Dubliners suspected that Yeats was her father. In 1920, she eloped to London with 17-year-old Irish-Australian Francis Stuart, who became a writer, and the couple later married. Their first child, Dolores, died in 1921 of spinal meningitis at three months old. The couple had two other children, Ian and Catherine. Iseult made headlines during the Second World War when she was brought to trial for harboring Hermann G√∂rtz, a German parachutist, a crime to which she confessed but was acquitted. Death Iseult was not acknowledged as her mother's daughter in Maud Gonne's will when Gonne died in 1953, possibly due to pressure from S√©an who didn't want to reveal Maud's relation to Millevoye. Iseult died less than a year later from heart disease. Notes References * Foster, R. F. W. B. Yeats: A Life, Vol. I: The Apprentice Mage. New York: Oxford UP, 1997. . * Letters to W.B.

The XO was developed by Nicholas Negroponte, a co- founder of MIT's Media Lab, and designed by Yves Behar's Fuseproject company. The laptop is manufactured by Quanta Computer and developed by One Laptop per Child (OLPC), a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization. The subnotebooks are designed for sale to government-education systems which then give each primary school child their own laptop. Pricing was set to start at $188 in 2006, with a stated goal to reach the $100 mark in 2008 and the 50-dollar mark by 2010. When offered for sale in the Give One Get One campaigns of Q4 2006 and Q4 2007, the laptop was sold at $199. The rugged, low-power computers used flash memory instead of a hard disk drive (HDD), and came with an operating system derived from Fedora Linux as their pre-installed operating system with the Sugar GUI. Mobile ad hoc networking via 802.11s Wi-Fi mesh networking, to allow many machines to share Internet access as long as at least one of them could connect to an access point, was initially announced, but quickly abandoned after proving unreliable. The latest version of the OLPC XO is the XO-4 Touch, introduced in 2012.  History  OLPC XO-1 original design proposal The first early prototype was unveiled by the project's founder Nicholas Negroponte and then-United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan on November 16, 2005, at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in Tunis, Tunisia. The device shown was a rough prototype using a standard development board. Negroponte estimated that the screen alone required three more months of development. The first working prototype was demonstrated at the project's Country Task Force Meeting on May 23, 2006. In 2006 there was a major controversy because Microsoft had suddenly developed an interest in the XO project and wanted the formerly open source effort to run Windows. Negroponte agreed to provide engineer assistance to Microsoft to facilitate their efforts. During this time, the project mission statement changed to remove mentions of \\"open source\\". A number of developers, such as Ivan Krstiƒá and Walter Bender, resigned because of these changes in strategy. Approximately 400 developer boards (Alpha-1) were distributed in mid-2006; 875 working prototypes (Beta 1) were delivered in late 2006; 2400 Beta-2 machines were distributed at the end of February 2007; full-scale production started November 6, 2007. Quanta Computer, the project's contract manufacturer, said in February 2007 that it had confirmed orders for one million units. Quanta indicated that it could ship five million to ten million units that year because seven nations had committed to buy the XO-1 for their schoolchildren: Argentina, Brazil, Libya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Thailand, and Uruguay. Quanta plans to offer machines very similar to the XO-1 on the open market. The One Laptop Per Child project originally stated that a consumer version of the XO laptop was not planned. The project later established, in 2007 the laptopgiving.org website for outright donations and for a \\"Give 1 Get 1\\" offer valid (but only to the United States, its territories, and Canadian addresses) from November 12, 2007 until December 31, 2007. For each computer purchased at a cost of $399, an XO is also sent to a child in a developing nation. OLPC again restarted the G1G1 program through Amazon.com in November 2008, but has since stopped as of December 31 (2008 or 2009). On May 20, 2008, OLPC announced the next generation of XO, OLPC XO-2 which was thereafter cancelled in favor of the tablet-like designed XO-3. In late 2008, the New York City Department of Education began a project to purchase large numbers of XO computers for use by schoolchildren. The design received the Community category award of the 2007 Index: Award. In 2008 the XO was awarded London's Design Museum \\"Design of the Year\\", plus two gold, one silver, and one bronze award at the Industrial Design Society of America's International Design Excellence Awards (IDEAs).  Goals  OLPC XO-1 laptop in e-book mode The XO-1 is designed to be low-cost, small, durable, and efficient. It is shipped with a slimmed-down version of Fedora Linux and a GUI named Sugar that is intended to help young children collaborate. The XO-1 includes a video camera, a microphone, long-range Wi-Fi, and a hybrid stylus/touch pad. In addition to a standard plug-in power supply, human power and solar power sources are available, allowing operation far from a commercial power grid. Mary Lou Jepsen has listed the design goals of the device as follows: * Minimal power consumption, with a design target of 2‚Äì3 W total power consumption * Minimal production cost, with a target of US$100 per laptop for production runs of millions of units * A \\"cool\\" look, implying innovative styling in its physical appearance * e-book functionality with extremely low power consumption * Open source and free software provided with the laptop Various use models had been explored by OLPC with the help of Design Continuum and Fuseproject, including: laptop, e-book, theatre, simulation, tote, and tablet architectures. The current design, by Fuseproject, uses a transformer hinge to morph between laptop, e-book, and router modes. In keeping with its goals of robustness and low power consumption, the design of the laptop intentionally omits all motor-driven moving parts; it has no hard drive, no optical (CD/DVD) media, no floppy drives and no fans (the device is passively cooled). An ATA interface is unnecessary due to the lack of hard drive. Storage is via an internal SD card slot. There is also no PC card slot, although USB ports are included. A built- in hand-crank generator was part of the notebook in the original design; however, it is now an optional clamp-on peripheral.  Hardware  Production version (4th generation): functional survey XO-1 motherboard Marvell's IEEE 802.11 chipset runs an RTOS on an ARM9 and interfaces over a shim with the actual operating system Rotatable display cover of the XO XO-1 clamp charger The latest version of the OLPC XO is the XO-4 Touch.  Display  Comparison of the XO-1 display (left) with a typical liquid crystal display (LCD). The images show 1√ó1 mm of each screen. A typical LCD addresses groups of 3 locations as pixels. The OLPC XO LCD addresses each location as a separate pixel transflective Pixel Qi screen installed in an OLPC XO laptop operating in reflective mode, note that the screen is in grey scale mode and is not retro illuminated * 1200√ó900 7.5 inch (19 cm) diagonal transflective LCD (200 dpi) that uses 0.1 to 1.0 W depending on mode. The two modes are: ** Reflective (backlight off) monochrome mode for low-power use in sunlight. This mode provides very sharp images for high-quality text ** Backlit color mode, with an alternance of red, green and blue pixels * XO 1.75 developmental version for XO-3 has an optional touch screen The first-generation OLPC laptops have a novel low-cost LCD. Later generations of the OLPC laptop are expected to use low-cost, low-power and high-resolution color displays with an appearance similar to electronic paper. The display is the most expensive component in most laptops. In April 2005, Negroponte hired Mary Lou Jepsen‚Äîwho was interviewing to join the Media Arts and Sciences faculty at the MIT Media Lab in September 2008‚Äîas OLPC Chief Technology Officer. Jepsen developed a new display for the first-generation OLPC laptop, inspired by the design of small LCDs used in portable DVD players, which she estimated would cost about $35. In the OLPC XO-1, the screen is estimated to be the second most expensive component (after the CPU and chipset). Jepsen has described the removal of the filters that color the RGB subpixels as the critical design innovation in the new LCD. Instead of using subtractive color filters, the display uses a plastic diffraction grating and lenses on the rear of the LCD to illuminate each pixel. This grating pattern is stamped using the same technology used to make DVDs. The grating splits the light from the white backlight into a spectrum. The red, green and blue components are diffracted into the correct positions to illuminate the corresponding pixel with R, G or B. This innovation results in a much brighter display for a given amount of backlight illumination: while the color filters in a regular display typically absorb 85% of the light that hits them, this display absorbs little of that light. Most LCD screens at the time used cold cathode fluorescent lamp backlights which were fragile, difficult or impossible to repair, required a high voltage power supply, were relatively power-hungry, and accounted for 50% of the screens' cost (sometimes 60%). The LED backlight in the XO-1 is easily replaceable, rugged, and inexpensive. The remainder of the LCD uses existing display technology and can be made using existing manufacturing equipment. Even the masks can be made using combinations of existing materials and processes. When lit primarily from the rear with the white LED backlight, the display shows a color image composed of both RGB and grayscale information. When lit primarily from the front by ambient light, for example from the sun, the display shows a monochromatic (black and white) image composed of just the grayscale information. \\"Mode\\" change occurs by varying the relative amounts backlight and ambient light. With more backlight, a higher chrominance is available and a color image display is seen. As ambient light levels, such as sunlight, exceed the backlight, a grayscale display is seen; this can be useful when reading e-books for an extended time in bright light such as sunlight. The backlight brightness can also be adjusted to vary the level of color seen in the display and to conserve battery power. In color mode (when lit primarily from the rear), the display does not use the common RGB pixel geometry for liquid crystal computer displays, in which each pixel contains three tall thin rectangles of the primary colors. Instead, the XO-1 display provides one color for each pixel. The colors align along diagonals that run from upper-right to lower left (see diagram on the right). To reduce the color artifacts caused by this pixel geometry, the color component of the image is blurred by the display controller as the image is sent to the screen. Despite the color blurring, the display still has high resolution for its physical size; normal displays put about 588(H)√ó441(V) to 882(H)√ó662(V) pixels in this amount of physical area and support subpixel rendering for slightly higher perceived resolution. A Philips Research study measured the XO-1 display's perceived color resolution as effectively 984(H)√ó738(V). A conventional liquid crystal display with the same number of green pixels (green carries most brightness or luminance information for human eyes) as the OLPC XO-1 would be 693√ó520. Unlike a standard RGB LCD, resolution of the XO-1 display varies with angle. Resolution is greatest from upper-right to lower left, and lowest from upper-left to lower-right. Images which approach or exceed this resolution will lose detail and gain color artifacts. The display gains resolution when in bright light; this comes at the expense of color (as the backlight is overpowered) and color resolution can never reach the full 200 dpi sharpness of grayscale mode because of the blur which is applied to images in color mode.  Power  XO-1 multi-battery charger Selfmade laptop charging station in classroom * DC input, ¬±11‚Äì18 V, maximum 15 W power draw * 5-cell rechargeable NiMH battery pack, 3000 mAh minimum 3050 mAh typical 80% usable, charge at 0...45 ¬∞C (deprecated in 2009) * 2-cell rechargeable LiFePO4 battery pack, 2800 mAh minimum 2900 mAh typical 100% usable, charge at 0...60 ¬∞C * Four-cell rechargeable LiFePO4 battery pack, 3100 mAh minimum 3150 mAh typical 100% usable, charge at ‚àí10...50 ¬∞C * External manual power options included a clamp-on crank generator similar to the original built-in one (see photo in the Gallery, below), but they generated 1/4 the power initially hoped, and less than a thousand were produced. A pull-string generator was also designed by Potenco but never mass-produced. * External power options include 110‚Äì240 Volt AC as well as input from an external solar panel. Solar is the predominant alternate power source for schools using XOs. The laptop design specification goals are consumption of about 2 W of power during normal use, far less than the 10 W to 45 W of conventional laptops. With build 656, power consumption is between 5 and 8 watts measured on G1G1 laptop. Future software builds are expected to meet the 2-watt target. In e-book mode (XO 1.5), all hardware sub-systems except the monochrome dual-touch display are powered down. When the user moves to a different page, the other systems wake up, render the new page on the display, and then go back to sleep. Power consumption in this e-book mode is estimated to be 0.3 to 0.8 W. The XO 2.0 is planned to consume even less power than earlier versions, less than 1.0 W in full color mode. Power options include batteries, solar power panels, and human-powered generators, which make the XO self-powered equipment. 10 batteries at once can be charged from the school building power in the XO multi-battery charger. The low power consumption combined with these power options are useful in many countries that lack a power infrastructure.  Networking  XO-1 Internet access through wireless mesh networking An \\"active antenna\\" for extending network reach * Wireless networking using an \\"Extended Range\\" 802.11b/g and 802.11s (mesh) Marvell 8388 wireless chip, chosen due to its ability to autonomously forward packets in the mesh even if the CPU is powered off. When connected in a mesh, it is run at a low bitrate (2 Mbit/s) to minimize power consumption. Despite the wireless chip's minimalism, it supports WPA. An ARM processor is included. * Dual adjustable antennas for diversity reception. IEEE 802.11b support will be provided using a Wi-Fi \\"Extended Range\\" chip set. Jepsen has said the wireless chip set will be run at a low bit rate, 2 Mbit/s maximum rather than the usual higher speed 5.5 Mbit/s or 11 Mbit/s to minimize power consumption. The conventional IEEE 802.11b system only handles traffic within a local cloud of wireless devices in a manner similar to an Ethernet network. Each node transmits and receives its own data, but it does not route packets between two nodes that cannot communicate directly. The OLPC laptop will use IEEE 802.11s to form the wireless mesh network. Whenever the laptop is powered on it can participate in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) with each node operating in a peer-to-peer fashion with other laptops it can hear, forwarding packets across the cloud. If a computer in the cloud has access to the Internet‚Äîeither directly or indirectly‚Äîthen all computers in the cloud are able to share that access. The data rate across this network will not be high; however, similar networks, such as the store and forward Motoman project have supported email services to 1000 schoolchildren in Cambodia, according to Negroponte. The data rate should be sufficient for asynchronous network applications (such as email) to communicate outside the cloud; interactive uses, such as web browsing, or high-bandwidth applications, such as video streaming should be possible inside the cloud. The IP assignment for the meshed network is intended to be automatically configured, so no server administrator or an administration of IP addresses is needed. Building a MANET is still untested under the OLPC's current configuration and hardware environment. Although one goal of the laptop is that all of its software be open source, the source code for this routing protocol is currently closed source. While there are open-source alternatives such as OLSR or B.A.T.M.A.N., none of these options is yet available running at the data-link layer (Layer 2) on the Wi-Fi subsystem's co-processor; this is critical to OLPC's power efficiency scheme. Whether Marvell Technology Group, the producer of the wireless chip set and owner of the current meshing protocol software, will make the firmware open source is still an unanswered question. As of 2011, it has not done so.  Shell  Yves Behar is the chief designer of the present XO shell. The shell of the laptop is resistant to dirt and moisture, and is constructed with 2 mm thick plastic (50% thicker than typical laptops). It contains a pivoting, reversible display, movable rubber Wi-Fi antennas, and a sealed rubber-membrane keyboard.  Input and ports  keyboard * Water-resistant membrane keyboard, customized to the locale in which it will be distributed. The multiplication and division symbols are included. The keyboard is designed for the small hands of children. * Five-key cursor-control pad; four directional keys plus Enter * Four \\"Game Buttons\\" (functionally PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End) modeled after the PlayStation Controller layout (Triangle, Circle, Cross, and Square). * Touchpad for mouse control and handwriting input * Built-in color camera, to the right of the display, VGA resolution (640√ó480) * Built-in stereo speakers * Built-in microphone * Audio based on the AC'97 codec, with jacks for external stereo speakers and microphones, Line-out, and Mic-in * Three external USB 2.0 ports. More than twenty different keyboards have been laid out, to suit local needs to match the standard keyboard for the country in which a laptop is intended. Around half of these have been manufactured for prototype machines. There are parts of the world which do not have a standard keyboard representing their language. As Negroponte states this is \\"because there's no real commercial interest in making a keyboard\\". One example of where the OLPC has bridged this gap is in creating an Amharic keyboard for Ethiopia. For several languages, the keyboard is the first ever created for that language. Negroponte has demanded that the keyboard not contain a caps lock key, which frees up keyboard space for new keys such as a future \\"view source\\" key. Beneath the keyboard was a large area that resembled a very wide touchpad that Jepsen referred to as the \\"mousepad\\". The capacitive portion of the mousepad was an Alps GlidePoint trackpad, which was in the central third of the sensor and could be used with a finger. The full width was a resistive sensor which, though never supported by software, was intended to be used with a stylus. This unusual feature was eliminated in the CL1A hardware revision because it suffered from erratic pointer motion. Alps Electronics provided both the capacitive and resistive components of the mousepad.  Release history  The first XO prototype, displayed in 2005, had a built-in hand- crank generator for charging the battery. The XO-1 beta, released in early 2007, used a separate hand-crank generator. The XO-1 was released in late 2007. * Power option: solar panel. * CPU: 433 MHz x86 AMD Geode LX-700 at 0.8 watts, with integrated graphics controller * 256 MB of Dual (DDR266) 133 MHz DRAM (in 2006 the specification called for 128 MB of RAM) * 1024 kB (1 MB) flash ROM with open-source Open Firmware * 1024 MB of SLC NAND flash memory (in 2006 the specifications called for 512 MB of flash memory) * Average battery life three hours Oberon subsystem in UnixAos on a XO-1.5.

With a price target $75, it had an elegant, lighter, folding dual touch-screen design. The hardware would have been open-source and sold by various manufacturers. A choice of operating system (Windows XP or Linux) was intended outside the United States. Its $150 price target in the United States includes two computers, one donated. The OLPC XO-3 was scheduled for release in late 2012. It was canceled in favor of the XO-4. It featured one solid color multi- touch screen design, and a solar panel in the cover or carrying case. The XO 4 is a refresh of the XO 1 to 1.75 with a later ARM CPU and an optional touch screen. This model will not be available for consumer sales. There is a mini HDMI port to allow connecting to a display. The XO Tablet was designed by third-party Vivitar, rather than OLPC, and based on the Android platform whereas all previous XO models were based on Sugar running on top of Fedora. It is commercially available and has been used in OLPC projects.  Software  mesh network. By clicking on the icon, communication by Wi-Fi is activated Countries are expected to remove and add software to best adapt the laptop to the local laws and educational needs. As supplied by OLPC, all of the software on the laptop will be free and open source. All core software is intended to be localized to the languages of the target countries. The underlying software includes: * A pared-down version of Fedora Linux as the operating system, with students receiving root access (although not normally operating in that mode). * Open Firmware, written in a variant of Forth * A simple custom web browser based upon the Gecko engine used by Mozilla Firefox. * A word processor based on AbiWord. * Email through the web-based Gmail service. * Online chat and VoIP programs. * Python 2.5 is the primary programming language used to develop Sugar \\"Activities\\". Several other interpreted programming languages are included, such as JavaScript, Csound, the eToys version of Squeak, and Turtle Art * A music sequencer with digital instruments: Jean Pich√©'s TamTam * Audio and video player software: Totem or Helix. The laptop uses the Sugar graphical user interface, written in Python, on top of the X Window System and the Matchbox window manager. This interface is not based on the typical desktop metaphor but presents an iconic view of programs and documents and a map-like view of nearby connected users. The current active program is displayed in full-screen mode. Much of the core Sugar interface uses icons, bypassing localization issues. Sugar is also defined as having no folders present in the UI. Steve Jobs had offered Mac OS X free of charge for use in the laptop, but according to Seymour Papert, a professor emeritus at MIT who is one of the initiative's founders, the designers wanted an operating system that can be tinkered with: \\"We declined because it's not open source.\\" Therefore, Linux was chosen. However, after a deal with Microsoft, the laptop will now be offered with Windows XP along with an open source alternative. Activity, home, friends and neighborhood software levels Jim Gettys, responsible for the laptops' system software, has called for a re-education of programmers, saying that many applications use too much memory or even leak memory. \\"There seems to be a common fallacy among programmers that using memory is good: on current hardware it is often much faster to recompute values than to have to reference memory to get a precomputed value. A full cache miss can be hundreds of cycles, and hundreds of times the power consumption of an instruction that hits in the first level cache.\\" On August 4, 2006, the Wikimedia Foundation announced that static copies of selected Wikipedia articles would be included on the laptops. Jimmy Wales, chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, said that \\"OLPC's mission goes hand in hand with our goal of distributing encyclopedic knowledge, free of charge, to every person in the world. Not everybody in the world has access to a broadband connection.\\" Negroponte had earlier suggested he would like to see Wikipedia on the laptop. Wales feels that Wikipedia is one of the \\"killer apps\\" for this device. Don Hopkins announced that he is creating a free and open source port of the game SimCity to the OLPC with the blessing of Will Wright and Electronic Arts, and demonstrated SimCity running on the OLPC at the Game Developer's Conference in March 2007. The free and open source SimCity plans were confirmed at the same conference by SJ Klein, director of content for the OLPC, who also asked game developers to create \\"frameworks and scripting environments‚Äîtools with which children themselves could create their own content.\\" The laptop's security architecture, known as Bitfrost, was publicly introduced in February 2007. No passwords will be required for ordinary use of the machine. Programs are assigned certain bundles of rights at install time which govern their access to resources; users can later add more rights. Optionally, the laptops can be configured to request leases from a central server and to stop functioning when these leases expire; this is designed as a theft-prevention mechanism. The pre-8.20 software versions were criticized for bad wireless connectivity and other minor issues.  Deployment  The XO-1 is nicknamed ceibalita in Uruguay after the Ceibal project.  Reception and reviews  The hand-crank system for powering the laptop was abandoned by designers shortly after it was announced, and the \\"mesh\\" internet-sharing approach performed poorly and was then dropped. Bill Gates of Microsoft criticized the screen quality. Some critics of the program would have preferred less money being spent on technology and more money being spent on clean water and \\"real schools\\". Some supporters worried about the lack of plans for teaching students. The program was based on constructionism, which is the idea that, if they had the tools, the kids would largely figure out how to do things on their own. Others wanted children to learn the Microsoft Windows operating system, rather than OLPC's lightweight Linux derivative, on the belief that the children would use Microsoft Windows in their careers. Intel's Classmate PC used Microsoft Windows and sold for US$200 to $400. The project was known as \\"the $100 laptop\\", but it originally cost US$130 for a bare-bones laptop, and then the price rose to $180 in the next revision. The solid-state alternative to a hard drive was sturdy, which meant that the laptop could be dropped with a lower risk of breaking ‚Äì although more laptops were broken than expected ‚Äì but it was expensive, so the machines had limited storage capacity.

He was Chairman of the National Amnesty Commission of the Philippines from 1996 to 2003, and was the pioneering Chair of the Government Panel to negotiate peace with military rebels who sought to topple the government of Corazon Aquino in various coup attempts.  Education and early career  Tadiar took three degrees from Silliman University, Dumaguete, A.A. (with High Distinction), A.B. (cum laude) and LL.B (cum laude). He began his law degree at the University of the Philippines but completed it at Silliman. He placed 14th in the 1955 Bar Examination, where he obtained a rating of 85.25%.\\"6 to Receive Outstanding Sillimanian Awards\\". SU NetNews. Retrieved 2010-03-29. He was appointed as trial judge at the first level court of San Juan, La Union (1959‚Äì1968) and later promoted to the Provincial Capital Court of San Fernando, La Union (1968‚Äì1976). In 1970 he won a fellowship from the United Church Board for World Ministries to study US juvenile criminal justice at Boston University. He later applied to take his Masters of Law at Harvard and was immediately accepted. His master's thesis entitled \\"The Administration of Criminal Justice in the Philippines: Some Aspects for a Comparative Study with that of the United States\\"\\"Master's thesis\\" Retrieved April 10, 2011 was given a special commendation by Harvard Law School Dean James Vorenberg and was later published in the Philippine Law Journal.Vol 51, No. 4, September 1972, UP Law Publishing House In 1976, after having read his master's thesis, Dean Irene Cortes of the University of the Philippines College of Law invited Tadiar to join the faculty. He accepted. While teaching undergraduate courses on remedial law subjects as well as master level courses on the administration of criminal justice and population law, he was also Director of the Office of Legal aid, a law internship program which provided free legal assistance to the underprivileged. He was the principal proponent of the Petition to the Supreme Court to amend the Rules of Court to allow Supervised Law Student Practice Rule, which became Rule 138-A in 1986. He retired from teaching in 1996.  Katarungang Pambarangay  In 1979, Tadiar's \\"preachings\\" for an ADRM was formally adopted as an adjunct to the legal system when PD 1508, The Katarungang Pambarangay Law, was promulgated. He was a principal author of that law, together with its implementing rules, requiring prior conciliation as a condition for judicial recourse. For 12 years (1980‚Äì1992), he was a member of the Committee of Consultants, Bureau of Local Government Supervision, which oversaw the nationwide operations of the Katarungang Pambarangay Law. He subsequently tested the empirical bases of the legal assumptions underlying that law in a socio-legal research study funded by Asia Foundation (1984) that he conducted in a rural area (San Fernando, La Union) and an urban area (Quezon City). A significant finding of his study was that Filipino people placed a high value on the legal recognition of their customary mode of settling their interpersonal disputes for its own intrinsic worth, while the instrumental value of decongesting court dockets is only of secondary importance.  Advocacy for ADR  From 1991-1993, Tadiar undertook another empirical study (again funded by the Asia Foundation) approved by the Supreme Court for the diversion of pending court cases to mediation. The result of his study entitled \\"Court-Referred Mediation\\" bore legal fruit in 1999 by an official pilot project for such diversion in the cities of Valenzuela and Mandaluyong. The Philippine Judicial Academy, which oversaw the experiment, appointed him as a consultant in the conceptualization of the project and in the training of mediators. The project was later expanded to all of Metro Manila and then to the cities of Cebu and Davao. Subsequently, the court-referred mediation that he pioneered in for trial courts, has been expanded to include the Court of Appeals and most recently, the Supreme Court. This would eventually lead to a formal amendment of the Rules of Court for a nationwide adoption empowering judges to divert pending cases for mediation and eventually, arbitration. Tadiar's bent for law reform, particularly in the judiciary, resulted in his appointment by the Supreme Court as member of the Design and Management Committee of the ADR Model Courts for the two pilot projects (Justice Reforms Initiatives Support Project funded by the Canadian International Development Agency) in San Fernando, Pampanga and Bacolod, Negros Occidental. In 2003, he and the Committee completed a study tour in Toronto to look into their system of mandatory mediation in the courts. He later became a member of the Supreme Court appointed Sub-Committee on Special Rules of Court on ADR. In 2004, he became the first Chairman of the ADR Department of the Philippine Judicial Academy. He engaged in the curriculum revision and re-design of its mediation training programs. He directed the Court of Appeals Mediation Project by training its faculty and mediators, and supervising their internship as a condition to their accreditation by the Supreme Court.

He was the son of John and Margaret Mudie of Forfarshire, Scotland. Life in the military Portsmouth Harbour, present day Mudie's life in the military properly began in 1799, when he was appointed second lieutenant in the 69th company of the Royal Marines at Portsmouth, England. He was a second lieutenant for six years before promotion to first lieutenant in 1805. During those six years, he served on St. Marcouf Island in the English Channel (1800‚Äì1802), and aboard (1803‚Äì1804). After being promoted, Mudie was sent on recruiting service in Scotland where he was placed on half-pay after he got into trouble for reasons which were not clearly specified. This trouble forced him into inactivity within the military until 1808, when he joined a ship, Inflexible, and voyaged to Halifax, Nova Scotia, but he later exchanged with an officer in Samson, a ship which later returned to England. Around this time, Mudie endured periods of bad health and sickness. These waves of illness may have been the reason that Mudie was not further promoted. In 1809, Mudie was forced to answer charges made against him in an anonymous letter sent to an office located in Scotland. He attempted to disprove them, but in the face of irrefutable evidence finally admitted them. He was dismissed from the marines in August the following year, his many appeals in vain. Life as a magistrate After he was dismissed from the military, Mudie found himself without money. Unable to find employment, Mudie successfully enticed a bookselling firm into hiring him. However, due to a certain business venture that proved a failure, Mudie and the bookselling firm became utterly insolvent after a loss of over ¬£10,000. Soon following the bankruptcy, Mudie was forced back into the monetary state he had been in before he joined the bookselling firm. However, Mudie was given the opportunity for a new life when Sir Charles Forbes offered him (and his four children) free passage to New South Wales, Australia. Grateful to Forbes, Mudie accepted the offer willingly, and he and his children arrived in New South Wales in July 1822. Additionally, Mudie had an order for a land grant of roughly 2150 acres (870 hectares approx.) on the Hunter River. He named this land Castle Forbes, after Charles Forbes, as a way of showing his appreciation of his free passage to New South Wales. After Mudie was able to acquire roughly of land (809 hectares) in 1825, an expansion on the land he already owned on Castle Forbes, he ‚Äì with the assistance of numerous convicts and an overseer, John Larnach ‚Äì was able to turn his land into one of the best, most-productive agricultural establishments in the colony at the time. Selling produce and such commodities as meat, wheat and wool, Mudie was often known to boast how well guarded his 'fortress' at Castle Forbes was, and how all of his servants and guards exacted justice with strict adherence to his rules. Sir Richard Bourke, known to the commoners as Governor Bourke Sometime around 1830, Governor Darling appointed Mudie a justice of the peace, and Mudie then served on the bench at Maitland. He was feared among convicts, as he gained a reputation for being particularly severe in his judgement, and flogging criminals and convicts excessively, even for minor offences. Mudie claimed that he dealt these harsh punishments in part to counter the soft and lenient policies that Governor Bourke entertained. Bourke himself had taken the necessary steps, after he arrived in December 1831, to ensure that magistrates' powers were lessened so that petty criminals would receive better treatment. However, many law-abiding citizens and the magistrates themselves did not share Bourke's view, and the Sydney Herald even published articles claiming that Bourke was responsible for an increase in criminal activity in the colony. Mudie ranked among a circle of magistrates along the Hunter River who were secretly, but very passionately, against Bourke's reasoning. This company of magistrates worked towards collecting signatures for a petition, which later became known by their opponents as the 'Hole and Corner Petition'. After a suitable number of signatures had been taken down, the petition was, according to Bourke and some of his associates in 1834, sent to England 'for circulation in quarters where it is hoped an impression unfavourable to my Government may be produced.' During Mudie's absence from Castle Forbes around November 1833, six convicts had revolted, robbing his stores and taking some of his possessions before escaping into the bush. None of the six escaped justice, however; three were executed in Sydney, two were executed at Castle Forbes, and one was exiled to Norfolk Island (a small island off the east coast of Australia). Despite the fact that justice had been served and the matter had been cleared, John Hubert Plunkett and Frederick Hely were dispatched by Governor Bourke to investigate the treatment of the servants at Castle Forbes. While no charges were elicited on Mudie or Larnach, they both were criticised greatly for the amount of rations they supplied to their workers, and the overall treatment of the convicts stationed there. Plunkett and Hely went further, however, and decided to take action against Larnach and Mudie by preparing a protest. After overcoming several complications involving Governor Bourke's refusal to send the protest to London, Plunkett and Hely printed Vindication of James Mudie and John Larnach, from Certain Reflections ‚Ä¶ Relative to the Treatment by Them of Their Convict Servants, a protest against Larnach and Mudie, and the way they treated the workers at Castle Forbes, which they sent directly to the Colonial Office. It soon became apparent that Hely and Plunkett were not the only people opposed to Larnach and Mudie's actions: soon after Plunkett and Hely's protest had been printed, William Watt, a ticket-of-leave convict who was under the employment of the Sydney Gazette, published Party Politics Exposed, a pamphlet attacking Mudie for his treatment of convicts and forcing labour. Mudie responded by attacking and criticising several people: he charged Watt with serious misdemeanours, attacked Roger Therry for defending the mutineers at their trial and criticised Bourke for showing acts of leniency and what Mudie perceived to be favouritism towards convicts. Later life and death Following these events, Mudie was not reappointed to the Commission of the Peace in 1836. Disgusted by these actions and other colonial affairs, Mudie responded by sailing back to England after selling Castle Forbes for ¬£7000. Hungry for vengeance, James Mudie published, in London in 1837, The Felonry of New South Wales, a text that ferociously attacked anyone who Mudie thought had in any way opposed, attacked or infringed upon his rules or ideas in the colony at New South Wales. Mudie returned to Sydney in 1840. Upon his arrival, he found that he was no longer wanted or welcome there; the vindictive and vicious comments in his book had lost him some of the allies he had kept until its publication. He was even horsewhipped in the street in Sydney, by the son of a judge who had been insulted in the text. Once again disgusted by the colony, and unhappy being in Australia, Mudie returned to England two years later where he remained until his death in 1852.

The bicycles were marketed via cold calling, based initially on a list of yacht club members that was purchased from a yacht club. They also used radio ads to encourage people to come into the factory at 363 West Erie St. in Chicago, Illinois to test ride, and order a custom bicycle. Sachs Super-7 rear alloy hub w/. drum brake Sortino hired Mark P. Walker, assembly and shop manager of the bike shop The SkiRack in Burlington, Vermont, and Tim Matthewson, owner of Champion Cycles, also in Vermont, to design a marketable bicycle concept that would appeal to commuters and people wishing to have a practical alternative to the mountain bike and road bike without the complication of derailleurs, and above all, made in the U.S. The bicycles sold for $500‚Äì $1000, depending on hubs, and options chosen by the customer. They used internal gear hubs from Sachs, with drum, or internal brakes, to avoid the complications of vulnerable external mechanisms. The bikes would later become known as \\"comfort cruisers\\", and though CBC was unsuccessful in marketing, famed bicycle maker and MTB pioneer, Joe Breeze later produced his own straight-tubed version. 50 frame-sets were originally fabricated by Tri- Angle Metal Fab in Milton, Vermont, and 50 more were made by Waterford Precision cycles of Waterford, Wisconsin, under the guise of Richard Schwinn (great grandson of Ignaz Schwinn) and Mark Muller. After that, the CBC built their own in a factory on 363 W. Erie in Chicago, Illinois. On the first floor, there was a retail space with representative bicycles, and an indoor track that surrounded the spacious retail floor. The actual factory was on the floor above, and was equipped with lathes, mill, welding stations, and powdercoat booth. A bicycle could be custom built to order inside of a week in most instances. The Design of the bicycles was carried out cooperatively between Mark Walker in Vermont and Patrick Ege, industrial Designer and Joe Ryan, welder, both from Chicago who worked to develop the frame geometries in CAD, welding jig setups, and completed most of final prototyping and testing. Joe Ryan also served as the shop foreman and oversaw fabrication at the facility in Chicago including milling operations, welding, and powder coating. Vincent Delfini, a bicycle technician also from Chicago, oversaw the assembly of the bicycles in the Chicago plant. Approximately only 100 or so were made at the factory before the company went out of business in 1997. The framesets were made from True Temper 4130 CrMo Steel with Reynolds 531 chainstays, and CBC's own CrMo fork. The frames were powdercoated to any color to order, or to any of the several predetermined models. CBC offered Sachs 3,5, and 7 speed hubs, with Sun M25 rims. A selection of handlebars, saddles, mudguards, racks, were added per customer's specs. The headbadge was made in Middlebury, Vermont by Danforth Pewterers, by lost-wax casting method. These badges cost $10 each to produce, and were hand fitted to every frame. Models include the 'Shoreline Cruiser', 'City Attack Cruiser', 'Silver Shadow', and the 'Wonder Bike'. The bicycle shown in three of the photos was one of five, 22\\" frames made for the Burlington Police Department, with the Sachs 7-speed alloy front and rear hubs with dual drum brakes. Chicago Bicycle 7-speed The Chicago bicycle was unfortunately ahead of its time, as many people were unwilling to spend more than $200 for what was perceived as a beach cruiser. The Chicago bicycle was much more than that, intended to become a long-lasting reliable quality tool to be used to get someone to work, or go for a nice ride on weekends on a virtually maintenance-free bicycle. In 1998, Stephen Marmon took over as chairman and CEO at the request of the investors. At that point, the company was suffering substantial losses. \\"I shut down all production within days of becoming CEO,\\" says Marmon.Anatomy of a Start Up at http://www.inc.com/articles/2000/11/21394.html Although he still felt that an expensive cruiser could be a viable business proposition, Marmon says the built-to-order model did not work. \\"The cost of production was too high,\\" he notes. That, coupled with the low number of bikes the company produced, made profitability virtually impossible. CBC was renamed the US Bicycle Corp and Marmon says he is working with investors to turn the company into a roll- up.Anatomy of a Start Up at http://www.inc.com/articles/2000/11/21394.html Today Today there is a new Chicago Bicycle Company, unrelated to the original factory, that is a two store bicycle chain in the city of Chicago and online at chicagobicyclecompany.com The business is owned by long time retailer Denis Smith and his partner Elizabeth Georgescu.

One of the Germanic successor states to the Western Roman Empire, it was originally created by the settlement of the Visigoths under King Wallia in the province of Gallia Aquitania in southwest Gaul by the Roman government and then extended by conquest over all of Hispania. The Kingdom maintained independence from the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire, whose attempts to re-establish Roman authority in Hispania were only partially successful and short-lived. The Visigoths were romanized central Europeans who had moved west from the Danube Valley. They became foederati of Rome, and wanted to restore the Roman order against the hordes of Vandals, Alans and Suebi. The Western Roman Empire fell in 476 AD; therefore, the Visigoths believed they had the right to take the territories that Rome had promised in Hispania in exchange for restoring the Roman order. Under King Euric‚Äîwho eliminated the status of foederati‚Äîa triumphal advance of the Visigoths began. Alarmed at Visigoth expansion from Aquitania after victory over the Gallo- Roman and Breton armies at D√©ols in 469, Western Emperor Anthemius sent a fresh army across the Alps against Euric, who was besieging Arles. The Roman army was crushed in battle nearby and Euric then captured Arles and secured much of southern Gaul. Sometimes referred to as the regnum Tolosanum or Kingdom of Toulouse after its capital Toulouse in modern historiography, the kingdom lost much of its territory in Gaul to the Franks in the early 6th century, save the narrow coastal strip of Septimania. The kingdom of the 6th and 7th centuries is sometimes called the regnum Toletanum or Kingdom of Toledo after the new capital of Toledo in Hispania. A civil war starting in 549 resulted in an invitation from the Visigoth Athanagild, who had usurped the kingship, to the Byzantine emperor Justinian I to send soldiers to his assistance. Athanagild won his war, but the Byzantines took over Cartagena and a good deal of southern Hispania, until Swinthila expelled the last Byzantine garrisons from the peninsula, occupying Orcelis, which the Visigoths called Aurariola (today Orihuela in the Province of Alicante). Starting in the 570s Athanagild's brother Liuvigild compensated for this loss by conquering the Kingdom of the Suebi in Gallaecia (corresponding roughly to present-day Galicia and the northern part of Portugal) and annexing it, and by repeated campaigns against the Basques. The ethnic distinction between the Hispano- Roman population and the Visigoths had largely disappeared by this time (the Gothic language lost its last and probably already declining function as a church language when the Visigoths converted to Catholicism in 589).Strategies of Distinction: Construction of Ethnic Communities, 300‚Äì800 (Transformation of the Roman World) by Walter Pohl, (pp. 119‚Äì121: dress and funerary customs cease to be distinguishing features in AD 570/580) This newfound unity found expression in increasingly severe persecution of outsiders, especially the Jews. The Visigothic Code (completed in 654), abolished the old tradition of having different laws for Hispano-Romans and for Visigoths. The 7th century saw many civil wars between factions of the aristocracy. Despite good records left by contemporary bishops, such as Isidore and Leander of Seville, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish Goths from Hispano-Romans, as the two became inextricably intertwined. Despite these civil wars, by 625 AD the Visigoths had succeeded in expelling the Byzantines from Hispania and had established a foothold at the port of Ceuta in Africa. Most of the Visigothic Kingdom was conquered by Umayyad troops from North Africa in 711 AD, with only the northern reaches of Hispania remaining in Christian hands. These gave birth to the medieval Kingdom of Asturias when a Visigothic nobleman called Pelagius was elected princeps by the Astures, of Celtic origin, who lived in the mountains and by the Visigothic population, who had fled from the Muslims, and took refuge in Asturias, where they joined Pelagius. The Visigoths and their early kings were Arians and came into conflict with the Catholic Church, but after they converted to Nicene Christianity, the Church exerted an enormous influence on secular affairs through the Councils of Toledo. The Visigoths also developed the highly influential law code known in Western Europe as the Visigothic Code (Liber Iudiciorum), which would become the basis for Spanish law throughout the Middle Ages. History Federate Kingdom Visigothic settlement and the Iberian peninsula, circa 418 Gold coin (411‚Äì450 AD) from the Kingdom of the Suebi in the Iberian peninsula From 407 to 409 AD, an alliance of Germanic Vandals, Iranian Alans and Germanic Suebi crossed the frozen Rhine and swept across modern France and into the Iberian peninsula. For their part, the Visigoths under Alaric infamously sacked Rome in 410, capturing Galla Placidia, the sister of Western Roman emperor Honorius. Ataulf (King of the Visigoths from 410 to 415) spent the next few years operating in the Gallic and Hispanic countrysides, diplomatically playing competing factions of Germanic and Roman commanders against one another to skillful effect, and taking over cities such as Narbonne and Toulouse (in 413). After he married Placidia, the Emperor Honorius enlisted him to provide Visigothic assistance in regaining nominal Roman control of Hispania from the Vandals, Alans and Suebi. In 418, Honorius rewarded his Visigothic federates under King Wallia (reigned 415‚Äì418) by giving them land in the Garonne valley of Gallia Aquitania on which to settle. This probably took place under the system of hospitalitas. It seems likely that at first the Visigoths were not given a large amount of land estates in the region (as previously believed), but that they acquired the taxes of the region, with the local Gallic aristocrats now paying their taxes to the Visigoths instead of to the Roman government.. The Visigoths with their capital at Toulouse, remained de facto independent, and soon began expanding into Roman territory at the expense of the feeble Western empire. Under Theodoric I (418‚Äì451), the Visigoths attacked Arles (in 425 and 430) and Narbonne (436), but were checked by Flavius Aetius using Hunnic mercenaries, and Theodoric was defeated in 438. By 451, the situation had reversed and the Huns had invaded Gaul; now Theodoric fought under Aetius against Attila the Hun in the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains. Attila was driven back, but Theodoric was killed in the battle.Cambridge Ancient v. 14, p. 113. The Vandals completed the conquest of North Africa when they took Carthage on October 19, 439 and the Suebi had taken most of Hispania. The Roman emperor Avitus now sent the Visigoths into Hispania. Theodoric II (453‚Äì466) invaded and defeated the King of the Suebi, Rechiarius, at the battle on the river √ìrbigo in 456 near Asturica Augusta (Astorga) and then sacked Bracara Augusta (Braga), the Suebi capital. The Goths sacked the cities in Gallaecia, part of the Suebi Kingdom quite brutally: they massacred a portion of the population and even attacked some holy places, probably due to the clergy's support of the Suebi.David Abulafia et al. The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume 1 c. 500 ‚Äì c. 700, p. 165. Theodoric took control over Hispania Baetica, Carthaginiensis and southern Lusitania. In 461, the Goths received the city of Narbonne from the emperor Libius Severus in exchange for their support. This led to a revolt by the army and by Gallo- Romans under Aegidius; as a result, Romans under Severus and the Visigoths fought other Roman troops, and the revolt ended only in 465.Cambridge Ancient v. 14, p. 24. Kingdom of Toulouse Theodoric I by Fabrizio Castello (1560‚Äì1617) The Iberian peninsula around 476 In 466, Euric, who was the youngest son of Theodoric I, came to the Visigothic throne. He is infamous for murdering his elder brother Theodoric II who had himself become king by murdering his elder brother Thorismund. Under Euric (466‚Äì484), the Visigoths began expanding in Gaul and consolidating their presence in the Iberian peninsula. Euric fought a series of wars with the Suebi who retained some influence in Lusitania, and brought most of this region under Visigothic power, taking Emerita Augusta (M√©rida) in 469. Euric also attacked the Western Roman Empire, capturing Hispania Tarraconensis in 472, the last bastion of Roman rule in Spain. By 476, he had extended his rule to the Rhone and the Loire rivers which comprised most of southern Gaul. He also occupied the key Roman cities of Arles and Marseilles. In his campaigns, Euric had counted on a portion of the Gallo-Roman and Hispano-Roman aristocracy who served under him as generals and governors. The Visigothic Kingdom was formally recognized when the Western emperor Julius Nepos (473‚Äì480) signed an alliance with Euric, granting him the lands south of the Loire and west of the Rhone in exchange for military service and the lands in Provence (including Arles and Marseilles). The lands in Hispania remained under de facto Visigothic control. After Odoacer deposed the last Roman emperor in the West, Romulus Augustulus, Euric quickly recaptured Provence, a fact which Odoacer formally accepted in a treaty.NC Medieval v. I, p. 167‚Äì171. By 500, the Visigothic Kingdom, centered at Toulouse, controlled Gallia Aquitania and Gallia Narbonensis and most of Hispania with the exception of the Suebic Kingdom of Galicia in the northwest and small areas controlled by independent Iberian peoples, such as the Basques and the Cantabrians. Euric's son Alaric II (484‚Äì507) issued a new body of laws, the Breviarium Alarici and held a church council at Agde. Clovis I fights the Visigoths The Visigoths now came into conflict with the Franks under their King Clovis I, who had conquered northern Gaul. Following a brief war with the Franks, Alaric was forced to put down a rebellion in Tarraconensis, probably caused by recent Visigoth immigration to Hispania due to pressure from the Franks. In 507, the Franks attacked again, this time allied with the Burgundians. Alaric II was killed at the Battle of Campus Vogladensis (Vouill√©) near Poitiers, and Toulouse was sacked. By 508, the Visigoths had lost most of their Gallic holdings save Septimania in the south.Cambridge Ancient v. 14, p. 113‚Äì114. Arian Kingdom of Hispania Visigothic pseudo-imperial gold tremissis in the name of emperor Justinian I, 6th century: the Christian cross on the breast defines the Visigothic attribution. (British Museum) Visigothic Hispania and the Byzantine province of Spania, circa 560 AD After Alaric II's death, his illegitimate son Gesalec took power until he was deposed by Theodoric the Great, ruler of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, who invaded and defeated him at Barcelona. Gesalic fled and regrouped, but was defeated again at Barcelona, and was captured and killed. Theodoric then installed his grandson Amalaric (511‚Äì531), the son of Alaric II, as king. Amalaric, however, was still a child and power in Spain remained under the Ostrogothic general and regent, Theudis. Only after Theodoric's death (526) did Amalaric obtain control of his kingdom. His rule did not last long, as in 531, Amalaric was defeated by the Frankish king Childebert I and then murdered at Barcelona. Afterwards, Theudis (531‚Äì548) became king. He expanded Visigothic control over the southern regions, but he was also murdered after a failed invasion of Africa. Visigothic Spain suffered a civil war under King Agila I (549‚Äì554), which prompted the Roman/Byzantine emperor Justinian I to send an army and carve out the small province of Spania for the Byzantine Empire along the coast of southern Spain. Agila was eventually killed, and his enemy Athanagild (552‚Äì568) became the new king. He attacked the Byzantines, but he was unable to dislodge them from southern Spain, and was obliged to formally acknowledge the suzerainty of the Empire. Map showing the conquests of Leovigild, circa 586 The next Visigothic king was Liuvigild (569 ‚Äì April 21, 586). He was an effective military leader and consolidated Visigothic power in Spain. Liuvigild campaigned against the Eastern Romans in the south in the 570s and he took back Cordova after another revolt. He also fought in the north against the Galician Kingdom of the Suebi and various small independent states, including the Basques and the Cantabrians. He pacified northern Spain, but was unable to completely conquer these peoples. When Liuvigild established his son Hermenegild as joint ruler, a civil war ensued between them. Hermenegild became the first Visigothic king to convert to Nicene Christianity due to his ties with the Romans, but he was defeated in 584 and killed in 585.Charles William Previt√©-Orton, The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History, (Cambridge University Press, 1979), 145. By the end of his reign, Liuvigild had united the entire Iberian peninsula, including the Suebic Kingdom which he conquered in 585 during a Suebi civil war that ensued after the death of King Miro. Liuvigild established amicable terms with the Franks through royal marriages, and they remained at peace throughout most of his reign. Liuvigild also founded new cities, such as Reccopolis and Victoriacum (Vitoria), the first barbarian king to do so.NC Medieval v. I, p. 183‚Äì209.Cambridge Ancient v. 14, p. 122‚Äì124.

Senate Palace Spain. fibulae (brooches for fastening garments), Spain On becoming King, Liuvigild's son Reccared I (586‚Äì601) converted from Arian to Chalcedonian Christianity. This led to some unrest in the kingdom, notably a revolt by the Arian bishop of M√©rida which was put down; he also beat back another Frankish offensive in the north. Reccared then oversaw the Third Council of Toledo in 589, where he announced his faith in the Nicene creed and denounced Arian. He adopted the name Flavius, the family name of the Constantinian dynasty, and styled himself as the successor to the Roman emperors. Reccared also fought the Byzantines in Hispania Baetica after they had begun a new offensive.NC Medieval v. I, p. 346‚Äì350. Reccared's son Liuva II became king in 601, but was deposed by the Visigothic noble Witteric (603‚Äì610), ending the short-lived dynasty. There were various Visigothic Kings between 610 and 631, and this period saw constant regicide. This period also saw the definitive conquest of the Byzantine territories in the south. War continued in the north against the Basques and Asturians, as indeed it would continue for the rest of the Visigothic Kingdom's existence. These Kings also worked on religious legislature, especially King Sisebut (612‚Äì621), who passed several harsh laws against Jews and forced many Jews to convert to Christianity. Sisebut was also successful against the Byzantines, taking several of their cities, including M√°laga. The Byzantines were finally defeated by Swinthila (621‚Äì631), who had captured all of their Spanish holdings by 625. Suinthila was deposed by the Franks and replaced by Sisinand.NC Medieval v. I, p. 350‚Äì353. The instability of this period can be attributed to the power struggle between the kings and the nobility. Religious unification strengthened the political power of the church, which it exercised through church councils at Toledo along with the nobles. The fourth council, held during the brief reign of Sisinand in 633, excommunicated and exiled the king, replacing him with Chintila (636‚Äì639). The church councils were now the most powerful institution in the Visigothic state; they took the role of regulating the process of succession to the kingship by election of the king by Gothic noble 'senators' and the church officials. They also decided to meet on a regular basis to discuss ecclesiastical and political matters affecting the Church. Finally, they decided the kings should die in peace, and declared their persons sacred, seeking to end the violence and regicides of the past. Despite all this, another coup took place and Chintila was deposed in 639, and King Tulga took his place; he was also deposed in the third year of his reign and the council elected the noble Chindaswinth as king. C√≥dex Albedense. The reigns of Chindaswinth and his son Recceswinth saw the compilation of the most important Visigothic law book, the Liber Iudiciorum ( Spanish: Libro de los Jueces, English: Book of the Judges), also called Lex Visigothorum or the Visigothic Code promulgated by king Chindaswinth (642‚Äì653 AD), and completed in 654 by his son, king Recceswinth (649‚Äì672), abolished the old tradition of having different laws for Hispano-Romans and Visigoths. The new laws applied to both Gothic and Hispano-Roman populations who had been under different laws in the past, and it replaced all older codes of law. The code included old laws by past kings, such as Alaric II in his Breviarium Alarici, and Leovigild, but many were also new laws. The code was based almost wholly on Roman law, with some influence of Germanic law in rare cases. Among the eliminated old laws were the harsh laws against Jews. The Liber showed the old system of military and civil divisions in administration was changing, and dukes (duces provinciae) and counts (comites civitatis) had begun taking more responsibilities outside their original military and civil duties. The servants or slaves of the king became very prominent in the bureaucracy and exercised wide administrative powers. With the Visigoth law codes, women could inherit land and title and manage it independently from their husbands or male relations, dispose of their property in legal wills if they had no heirs, and could represent themselves and bear witness in court by age 14 and arrange for their own marriages by age 20. Chindaswinth (642‚Äì653) strengthened the monarchy at the expense of the nobility, he executed some 700 nobles, forced dignitaries to swear oaths, and in the seventh council of Toledo laid down his right to excommunicate clergy who acted against the government. He was also able to maneuver his son Recceswinth on the throne, sparking a rebellion by a gothic noble who allied with the Basques, but was put down. Reccesuinth (653‚Äì672) held another council of Toledo, which reduced sentences for treason and affirmed the power of the councils to elect kings.NC Medieval v. I, p. 356‚Äì360. Following Reccesuinth, King Wamba (672‚Äì680) was elected king. He had to deal with initial revolts in Tarraconensis, and because of this, he felt a need to reform the army. He passed a law declaring all dukes, counts and other military leaders, as well as bishops, had to come to the aid of the kingdom once danger became known or risk harsh punishment. Wamba was eventually deposed in a bloodless coup. King Ervig (680‚Äì687) held further church councils and repealed the previous harsh laws of Wamba, though he still made provisions for the army. Ervig had his son-in-law Egica made king. Despite a rebellion by the bishop of Toledo, the 16th council, held in 693, denounced the bishop's revolt. The 17th council in 694 passed harsh laws against the Jews, citing a conspiracy, and many were enslaved, especially those who had converted from Christianity. Egica also raised his son Wittiza as coruler in 698. Not much is known about his reign, but a period of civil war quickly ensued between his sons (Achila and Ardo) and King Roderic, who had seized Toledo.NC Medieval v. I, p. 360‚Äì369. Muslim conquest Copy of a mural from Qusayr Amra, depicting king Roderic In 711, Tariq ibn Ziyad, a Muslim Berber client of Musa bin Nusair, the governor of Islamic Africa, invaded Spain with about 7,000 Berber men, while Roderic was in the north fighting the Basques. The tale that Julian, Count of Ceuta, facilitated the invasion, because one of his daughters had been dishonored by Roderic, is possibly mythical. By late July, a battle took place at the Guadalete River in the province of C√°diz. Roderic was betrayed by his troops, who sided with his enemies, and the king was killed in battle. The Muslims then took much of southern Spain with little resistance, and went on to capture Toledo, where they executed several Visigothic nobles. In 712, Musa, the governor of Ifriqiya, arrived with another army of 18,000, with large Arab contingents. He took M√©rida in 713 and invaded the north, taking Saragossa and Le√≥n, which were still under King Ardo, in 714. After being recalled by the Caliph, Musa left his son Abd al-‚ÄòAziz in command. By 716, most of the Iberian Peninsula was under Islamic rule, with Septimania taken between 721 and 725. The only effective resistance was in Asturias, where a Visigothic nobleman named Pelagius revolted in 718, and defeated the Muslims at the battle of Covadonga; this was the beginning of the Reconquest. According to Joseph F. O'Callaghan, the remnants of the Hispano-Gothic aristocracy still played an important role in the society of Hispania. At the end of Visigothic rule, the assimilation of Hispano-Romans and Visigoths was occurring at a fast pace. Their nobility had begun to think of themselves as constituting one people, the gens Gothorum or the Hispani. An unknown number of them fled and took refuge in Asturias or Septimania. In Asturias they supported Pelagius's uprising, and joining with the indigenous leaders, formed a new aristocracy. The population of the mountain region consisted of native Astures, Galicians, Cantabri, Basques and other groups unassimilated into Hispano-Gothic society. Resistance also continued in the regions around the Pyrenees with the establishment of the Marca Hispanica from 760 to 785. The Berbers settled in the south and the Meseta Central in Castile. Initially, the Muslims generally left the Christians alone to practise their religion, although non-Muslims were subject to Islamic law and treated as second-class citizens.NC Medieval v. I, p. 369‚Äì370.David Abulafia et al. The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume II c. 700 ‚Äì c. 900, p. 256‚Äì258, 275‚Äì276. Visigothic settlements Visigothic settlements were concentrated along the Garonne River between Bordeaux and Toulouse in Aquitaine during the 5th century, according to contemporary sources under the terms of the late Roman Empire as foederatii, or allies, and assigned billeting obligations to provide lodging for Roman soldiers, more or less as the imperial military had previously done in other provinces. Later in the century, following annexations made by king Euric in Gaul and Hispania once the Roman Empire of the West had collapsed, and specially after the Battle of Vouille, many Goths and their federated peoples, such as the Vandals, Ostrogoths, and Sarmatians, moved to settle more freely under their kindred clans' rulers, the reiks, who received dukedom territories or comital offices as counts over smaller territories or key urban locations within the provinces of Hispania and in southwestern Gaul and its Mediterranean coast. Their settlements were made around the Roman cities of Emerita Augusta (M√©rida), Barcino (Barcelona), Hispalis (Seville), Toletum) (Toledo) and Septimanian Narbonne, which would be the main bases of Gothic power politically as well as militarily during the rest of the kingdom's history, as well as other settlements which were dispersed in rural farming areas between the upper reaches of the Douro, Ebro and Tagus rivers, in an area between Tierra de Campos, also known as Campi Gothorum, around Central Castile and Le√≥n and Rioja, and Toledo to the east and south. After the fall of the Galician Kingdom of the Suebi, some further settlements were made along the Tagus river north of Lisbon, by Oporto and Astorga former strongholds of the Suebi. Little Visigothic settlement occurred elsewhere in the kingdom.World and Its Peoples: Europe, Marshall Cavendish 2010, , p. 60 Founding of cities Church of Santa Maria de Lara, most likely built just before the Muslim invasion The Visigoths founded the only new cities in Western Europe between the fifth and eighth centuries. It is certain (through contemporary Spanish accounts) that they founded four, and a possible fifth city is ascribed to them by a later Arabic source. All of these cities were founded for military purposes and three of them in celebration of victory. The first, Reccopolis, was founded by Liuvigild in 578 after his victory over the Franks, near what is today the tiny village of Zorita de los Canes. He named it after his son Reccared and built it with Byzantine imitations, containing a palace complex and mint, but it lay in ruins by the 9th century (after the Arab conquest). At a slightly later date, Liuvigild founded a city he named Victoriacum after his victory over the Basques.Thompson, \\"The Barbarian Kingdoms in Gaul and Spain\\". Though it is often supposed to survive as the city of Vitoria, contemporary 12th-century sources refer to the latter city's foundation by Sancho VI of Navarre. Liuvigild's son and namesake of the first Visigothic city founded his own sometime around 600. It is referred to by Isidore of Seville as Lugo id est Luceo in the Asturias, built after a victory over the Asturians or Cantabri. The fourth and possibly final city of the Goths was Ologicus (perhaps Ologitis), founded using Basque labour in 621 by Swinthila as a fortification against the recently subjected Basques. It is to be identified with modern Olite. The possible fifth Visigothic foundation is Baiyara (perhaps modern Montoro), mentioned as founded by Reccared in the Geography of Kitab al-Rawd al-Mitar.Lacarra, \\"Panorama de la historia urbana en la Pen√≠nsula Ib√©rica desde el siglo V al X,\\" La citt√† nell'alto medioevo, 6 (1958:319-358), in Estudios de alta edad media espa√±ola, p. 48. Culture and classical heritage Elaborate votive crown of king Recceswinth, part of the Treasure of Guarrazar. Spain The Visigothic rule has often been attributed to be a part of the so-called Dark Ages, a time of cultural and scientific decay reversed only by Muslim Andalusia. Through the course of their existence the Visigoths supposedly remained \\"men of the woods never strayed too far from there,\\" as Thomas F. Glick puts it. Remains of the basilica of Reccopolis . Spain However, in fact, the Visigoths were preservers of the classical culture. The bathing culture of Andalusia, for example, often said to be a Muslim invention, is a direct continuation of Romano-Visigothic traditions. Visigothic Merida housed baths supplied with water by aqueducts, and such aqueducts are also attested in Cordoba, Cadiz and Recopolis. Excavations confirm that Recopolis and Toledo, the Visigothic capital, were heavily influenced by the contemporary Byzantine architecture. When the Muslims looted Spain during their conquest they were amazed by the fine and innumerable Visigothic treasures. A few of these treasures were preserved as they were buried during the invasion ‚Äì e.g., the votive crowns from the treasure of Guarrazar. While only the senior monks were allowed to read books of non- Christian or heretic authors this did not prevent the rise of intellectuals such as, most prominently: Isidore of Seville, one of the most quoted scholars of the Middle Ages, known for the breadth of his literary output, highlighted by his Etymologies, an encyclopedia of the knowledge of the epoch that was known and translated throughout medieval Europe; Eugenius I of Toledo, an expert in mathematics and astronomy; or Theodulf of Orl√©ans, a theologian and poet who, after he had fled to the Frankish kingdom, participated in the Carolingian Renaissance. A Muslim source referred to Visigothic Seville as the \\"abode of the sciences\\". The Institutionum disciplinae from the mid seventh/early eight century confirms that Visigothic nobles were not only taught in reading and writing, but also in medicine, law and philosophy. An example of a highly educated nobleman was king Sisebut, who was a patron of learning and writer of poems, one of them about astronomy.

Anthony is responsible for many species descriptions of Caribbean taxa during this period and his field notes record the discovery of the monkey material: > ‚ÄúJanuary 17 ‚Äì Spent all day digging in the long mile cave and secured some > good bones. The most important find was the lower jaw and femur of a small > monkey, found in the yellow limestone detritus. It was not associated with > the human remains but not so far from them that the animal must not be > strongly suspected as an introduced species. It was deeper than any of the > human bones by at least 10‚Äù to 1‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äù (reproduced in Williams and Koopman, > 1952) The eventual species description was not completed until 1952 when two graduate students, Ernest Williams and Karl Koopman, found the associated femur and mandibular fragment forgotten in a drawer at the American Museum of Natural History. They remained circumspect in placing this primate taxonomically as it had shared characteristics with a number of platyrrhine taxa.  Analysis  The small mandible has a dental formula of 2 incisors, 1 canine, 3 premolars and 2 molars ‚Äì a departure from the vast majority of living platyrrhines, with the notable exception of the callitrichines. It is significantly larger than the living callitrichines, and work by Rosenberger has largely eliminated the possibility that these taxa share a close phylogenetic relationship. Rosenberger suggested that the absence of the third molar in Xenothrix was not homologous with this character state in callitrichines. He based his assessment on the length of the molars relative to the molar row, and the inferred retention of hypocones on M1-2, which have been greatly reduced in the marmosets and tamarins. He further suggested that Xenothrix shared a close phylogenetic affinity with Callicebus or Aotus. His conclusions were tentative due to the fragmentary nature of the material. The postcranial remains discovered by Anthony in the 1920s were eventually described by MacPhee and Fleagle who attributed the femur, os coxae, and tibia to the order Primates. MacPhee and Fleagle stated that the primate postcrania bore little resemblance to modern forms, but they interpreted the femur as being indicative of slow climbing. The femur also shares some similarities with Potos flavus, the kinkajou. They provisionally accepted Hershkovitz‚Äôs family Xenotrichidae until further analysis could fully elucidate the relationships of Xenothrix.  Further research  In the 1990s, several expeditions to Jamaican cave sites resulted in the recovery of additional cranial and postcranial material attributed to Xenothrix, including a partial lower face containing the palate with left and right P4-M2, most of the maxilla and parts of the sphenoid. This discovery confirmed that the dental formula of this taxon is 2.1.3.2. With the new partial face, Horovitz and MacPhee were able to further develop the hypothesis, first proposed by MacPhee et al., that all the Antillean monkeys (the others being the two Cuban monkey species of genus Paralouatta and Insulacebus toussaintiana and Antillothrix bernensis of Hispaniola) belonged to a monophyletic group linked most closely with modern Callicebus. Rosenberger has objected to this hypothesis and has suggested that Xenothrix was a Jamaican owl monkey,Rosenberger, A.L. (2002). Platyrrhine paleontology and systematics: The paradigm shifts. In Hartwig, W., (ed.) The Primate Fossil Record. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 151‚Äì159. thus modifying his earlier view. He based his conclusions on the fairly large orbit size as inferred from the preserved orbital rim, large inferior orbital fissure, and the large I1 alveolus as compared to the I2 alveolus. These characters are shared with Aotus. MacPhee and Horovitz tested this alternative phylogeny with extensive anatomical comparisons and by extending their parsimony analysis using PAUP*.Swofford, D.L. (2002) PAUP*: phylogenetic analysis using parsimony (* and other methods) Version 4. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA They maintained that the monophyly of the Antillean monkeys was still supported in the most parsimonious trees, but in slightly less parsimonious trees, Aotus does appear to be linked with Xenothrix. MacPhee and Horovitz assigned the Antillean monkeys to the tribe Xenotrichini ‚Äì the sister group of the tribe Callicebini. DNA analysis indicates that the species is a type of titi monkey, sister to the recently recognized northern South American genus Cheracebus, that colonized Jamaica around 11 million years ago. This is younger than the oldest fossils for monkeys on Cuba, meaning that the Jamaican monkey originated separately from the rest of the group.  References   Further reading Rosenberger, A.L. (1981).

While there were no injuries or deaths reported, the mosque's two ten-story minarets were destroyed in the attacks. This was the second bombing of the mosque, with the first bombing occurring on 22 February 2006 and destroying the mosque's golden dome. By April 2009, both minarets had been repaired. The bombing At around 9 am on 13 June 2007, insurgents destroyed the two remaining ten-story tall golden minarets flanking the ruins of the dome of the Al-Askari Mosque. The mosque compound and minarets had been closed since the 2006 bombing and no fatalities were reported. Iraqi police reported hearing \\"two nearly simultaneous explosions coming from inside the mosque compound at around 9 am\\" Local residents reported blasts that shook the city and sent a cloud of dust into the air. While it has been stated that \\"the collapse of the two minarets appeared to have been caused by explosive charges placed at their bases\\", different reports have caused some confusion as to whether bombs were actually used. A release from state run Iraqia Television stated that \\"local officials said that two mortar rounds were fired at the two minarets\\", in addition \\"a government spokesman claimed the minarets were hit by rockets\\". It has been noted that the attack was one in a string of bombings in 2007 against major Shi'ite shrines, including two car bomb attacks in Karbala: one near the Imam Husayn Shrine (which killed 36 people and wounded 168) and the other near the Imam Abbas shrine, the second-holiest site in Shi'ite Islam, which killed at least 58 people and wounded 169. Events around changing of the guard Since the 2006 bombing of the al-Askari shrine, it had been under protection of local guards who were predominantly Sunni. Both American military and Iraqi security officials were worried that the guards had been infiltrated by Al Qaeda forces in Iraq. To counter this the Ministry of Interior in Baghdad were bringing in a new guard unit ‚Äì predominantly Shiite. This changing of the guard is believed to have had some role in the timing of the attack. Abdul Sattar Abdul Jabbar, a prominent Sunni cleric, told Al Jazeera television that local Sunnis may have been provoked as he claimed \\"the new guards had arrived at the shrine shouting sectarian slogans\\". Gunfire was reported around the shrine before the attack, \\"which may have been related to the change of guards.\\" Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated that Policemen at the shrine (15 of them according to US military sources) had been detained for questioning along with \\"an unspecified number of other suspects.\\" It was confirmed that \\"the entire Iraqi security force responsible for guarding the mosque, the 3rd Battalion of the Salahuddin province police, was detained for investigation.\\" The Interior Ministry would only tell reporters that agents of \\"a terrorist group\\" had been arrested and were under interrogation. On Sunday 17 June 2007 Iraqi forces captured four additional suspects and their raid \\"also turned up a compact disc showing attacks on U.S.-led troops, blasting caps and detonation wire, identification cards for access to al-Askari mosque and photographs depicting terrorist training exercises.\\" Reactions in Iraq Nouri al-Maliki's address and the U.S. military response In the afternoon after the attack Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki addressed Iraqi national television. Standing before the flag of Iraq he said \\"I call on all civilians and believers and clergy to talk to people about the necessity of self-control and wisdom to foil the scheme of those evil ones who want to make use of this crime for political reasons.\\" He then read a quote from a prayer of Abraham found in the Qur'an \\"God, make this country safe and send its people your blessed rewards.\\" The day of the attack al-Maliki asked Gen. David Petraeus, and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker to send American reinforcements to Samarra, and to put U.S. troops in Baghdad on heightened alert. Both American officials issued a joint statement saying \\"This brutal action on one of Iraq's holiest shrines is a deliberate attempt by al-Qaeda to sow dissent and inflame sectarian strife among the people of Iraq.\\" Petraeus told reporters that al- Qaeda's agents probably acted because they \\"are under a fair amount of pressure. I think they know that we are going to contest some of the areas in which they have had sanctuaries in the past.\\" There were already a few hundred U.S. troops stationed around Samarra before the attack, though they rarely entered the shrine's perimeter leaving its protection to Iraqi forces. After making his request Al-Maliki traveled to Samarra accompanied by U.S. troops under Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno to visit the ruins of the mosque. General Petraeus later stated that they were also \\"helping to move reinforcements to Samarra from the Iraqi national police.\\" U.S. military spokesman Lt. Col. Christopher Garver stated that the US military in Iraq is \\"obviously very concerned about this and our primary goal is to prevent any violence of the kind that broke out after the last bombing.\\" Presidential spokesman Tony Snow said \\"there will be aggressive outreach on all sides\\" by American officials to try to head off any further violence. Ali al-Sistani's call Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani condemned the bombing but called on ‚Äúbelievers to exercise self-restraint and avoid any vengeful act that would target innocent people or the holy places of others.‚Äù Sistani later condemned reprisal attacks on Sunni mosques in the southern city of Basra (see below), demanding a halt to such violence. His spokesman Hamed al-Khafaf stated ‚ÄúHe heavily condemns the attacks against the mosques of Talha ben Obaida Alla and al-Eshra al Mubashera in Basra. He calls on believers to prevent, as much as they can, such attacks from taking place on mosques and shrines.‚Äù Sadrist reactions Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr called for peaceful demonstrations and three days of mourning. He stated that he believed no Sunni Arab could have been behind the attack. He ruled out the possibility that it was done by Muslims, declaring that it was \\"done at the hands of the occupation.\\" He said \\"We declare a three-day mourning period . . . and shout Allahu Akbar from Sunni and Shiite mosques.\\" Sadr criticized the Iraqi government for failing to protect the site, and said the U.S. occupation is \\"the only enemy of Iraq\\" and \\"that's why everyone must demand its departure\\". Sadr called the attack part of a \\"U.S. and Israeli plan to split Iraq's unity.\\" Throughout Baghdad and across much of Iraq, loudspeakers from Shiite mosques called for demonstrations. At Najaf over 3,000 al-Sadr loyalists staged a protest, shouting \\"No, no to America!\\", \\"No, no to Israel!\\" and \\"No, no to sedition!\\" Sadr's 30-member bloc immediately suspended any participation in parliament out of protest to the bombing, and resolved to not participate \\"until the government takes realistic steps to rebuild the Askariya shrine\\" (they also called for the rebuilding of all damaged Shiite and Sunni mosques). This action by the Sadrists is seen as a further blow to the already weakened al- Maliki government and will further impede the legislative process towards national reconciliation in Iraq. Maliki had just the day before been visited by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John D. Negroponte who pressured him for quicker results against sectarian violence, and on Sunday 10 June 2007 Admiral William J. Fallon told al-Maliki that an increasing number of U.S. Congressmen were opposed to continuing to give aid to Iraq, and also opposed to maintaining the American military presence there, and that if the Iraqi government wanted to counter that mounting opposition, it needed to be making progress, by July. Sadr's position has been viewed as one of the reasons that the spiraling violence that followed the 2006 bombing was not immediately repeated. His Al Mahdi militia was largely blamed for much of the 2006 violence but it has followed his line in blaming US and Israeli agents for the 2007 bombing. One of Sadr's spokesmen Salman Fraiji repeated such claims of conspiracy, saying \\"To split the [Suni and Shiite] Muslims is a card that the occupation is playing. The ill-intentioned colonizers have an old saying: 'divide and conquer.'\\" Many experts see Sadr's increase of anti-American rhetoric as \\"an effort to position himself for a powerful political role when U.S. forces leave Iraq.\\" Vali Nasr, a Middle East expert at the Naval Postgraduate School expanded on this saying \\"Since the start in February of the U.S. military crackdown in Baghdad and environs, Sadr has been uncharacteristically subdued, an indication that he is waiting for U.S. forces to leave before reclaiming a prominent role. Definitely there is a sort of strategy in play, which is 'wait and see.' Sadr, unlike the U.S. troops, faces no deadline pressure.\\" Under the curfews On the day of the bombing an indefinite curfew was placed on Samarra by the Iraqi police. Samarra's streets were emptied by mid-afternoon after the arrival of more police and American troops. For the remainder of the day Iraqi security forces patrolled Samarra \\"firing in the air and announcing the curfew from loudspeakers mounted on jeeps. ... Members of the Iraqi security forces, which are dominated by Shiites, yelled threats at Samarra residents, blaming them for the destruction of the mosque and threatening revenge. Some citizens, meanwhile, hurled remarks back, asking how anyone could destroy the minarets when the entire religious complex was being so carefully guarded by Iraqi security forces.\\" Beginning at 3 pm of the same day, a curfew was also placed on vehicle traffic and large gatherings in the capital Baghdad. The Baghdad curfew had originally been set to expire on Saturday 16 June 2007, it was lifted at 5 am (0100 GMT) on Sunday 17 June. Retaliatory attacks According to Iraqi police, on the day of the bombing before the curfew in the capital could take hold, arsonists set a Sunni mosque ablaze in the neighborhood of Bayaa in western Baghdad. A Shiite shrine was also bombed north of Baghdad and four Sunni mosques near Baghdad were also attacked or burned. In Iskandariyah, south of the capital, two Sunni mosques were bombed (one being demolished the other losing its minaret) In the city of Basra four people were slain and six wounded in attacks with rocket-propelled grenades on the Kawaz, Othman, al-Abayshi and Basra Grand mosques. Visitors to the Talha Ibn Obeidallah mosque in Zubeir, west of Basra, got past Iraqi police by claiming they wanted to film the mosque but placed bombs instead and then detonated them after leaving. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki upon learning of events in Basra placed the city under indefinite curfew, and arrested a number of Iraqi security forces from there. He later fired Basra's police chief after witnesses reported local police did little to stop the attacks on the mosques. There were also reports that within the capital, in the New Baghdad neighborhood, a local Shiite mosque loudspeaker issued calls to Mahdi Army guerrillas and blamed U.S. troops for the attack. The Mahdi guerrillas then cleared a marketplace and called for reinforcements to fight nearby American soldiers. Witnesses told of explosions and smoke coming from the highway. In the upscale Mansour neighborhood, consisting predominately of Sunnis, gunfire was heard coming from an Iraqi army checkpoint set up to safeguard an often targeted Sunni mosque. A Sunni mosque that had been attacked on 13 June was targeted again on 14 June 2007. The Hateen mosque in Iskandariyah, which had only been partly destroyed was broken into around 4 am by assailants who planted bombs. The resulting explosion demolished most of the building and wounded a woman and child in a nearby apartment building. An assault by gunmen against the nearby al-Mustafa mosque also occurred early that day but they were repelled by Iraqi soldiers. In the town of Mahaweel, south of Baghdad, gunmen opened fired on the al-Basheer mosque at dawn. They drove off the guards and set fire to the building, causing partial damage. To the south of Baghdad, a mosque in the city of Tunis came under attack and Iraqi police found explosives in a mosque in Jabala. The Washington Post stated that during the time of the curfews \\"At least 13 Sunni mosques came under attack in Iraq\\". While five bodies were found in Baghdad on Thursday the 14th, \\"presumed victims of sectarian death squads\\", the curfew was credited with causing a reduction in killing as the usual number is five times that. The worst violence reported on Thursday in Baghdad was the seven mortar rounds fired against the Green Zone which killed three civilians. Protests in Iraq On Thursday 14 June 2007, hundreds of people marched in non-violent demonstrations in the Baghdad neighborhood of Sadr City, and in the Shiite dominated cities of Kut, Diwaniyah, Najaf and Basra. Lifting of the Baghdad curfew At the lifting of the Baghdad curfew the U.S. military reported it had captured 20 suspected insurgents and killed 14 others in separate operations over the weekend. It was noted that the curfew was lifted a day after Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno admitted that security forces have full control of only 40 percent of the capital, which is now in the fifth month of the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. When the Baghdad curfew was lifted at 5 am (0100 GMT) on Sunday, 17 June, residents traveling on the streets were caught in a huge traffic jam ‚Äúspawned by hundreds of new police and army checkpoints.‚Äù The ban on vehicle traffic had also led to a lack of delivery trucks moving within the city causing steep price hikes in everything from fuel to fresh food. There were also increased power outages as the large number of people confined to their homes increased electrical usage, resulting in power for only four hours of the day. The lines for gasoline to run vehicles and generators \\"stretched for a mile or longer, in some cases weaving around several blocks, stretching from main roads deep into side streets. Black marketeers, some of them boys as young as 10, positioned their jerry cans of gas near the lines, charging three times the pump price.\\" Accusations of price gouging were made by many citizens. \\"Vendors weaved between cars waiting in traffic, selling paper fans, soft drinks and tissues to mop brows dripping in temperatures that hit 112.\\" While police commandos on \\"pickup trucks mounted with machine guns\\" speed through the streets \\"with sirens blaring and headlights flashing\\", they did follow government orders \\"to stop shooting in the air to clear traffic or warn motorists coming too close.\\" As several bridges to the Sunni-dominated Karkh area and the Shiite majority Rusafa neighborhood have been targeted in the recent past, security was especially stiff on bridges where Iraq forces searching for truck bombs. In some areas, like Karkh, where al-Queda is believed to be active police and military checkpoints were just 100 yards apart or less. In often-targeted neighborhoods, like Mansour and Yarmouk, Iraqi soldiers were present behind concrete blast barriers. In the Sunni-dominated neighborhoods within the Azamiyah area in northern Baghdad, which are known for insurgent activity, \\"Iraqi troops in combat gear patrolled the streets in armored cars. Soviet-era tanks were stationed on major roads and intersections. Much of Azamiyah was almost deserted, with most stores shuttered and little traffic on the streets.\\" By contrast the Shiite dominated enclave of Kasrah within that same area \\"was buzzing with shoppers in open-air markets. Kebab stands were doing a big business.\\" Drastic differences were evident throughout Baghdad from one neighborhood to the next. For while in Karkh there were \\"stores shuttered and barbed wire or tree trunks blocking access to residential side roads. Row after row of houses seem abandoned and, in some parts, snipers fired randomly at pedestrians and cars\\", by contrast the streets of the heavily Shiite Karradah district in central Baghdad were crowded with shoppers and everything \\"appeared back to normal\\". While the government ordered higher security around the mosques of Baghdad a lack of increased security was reported around the major Sunni mosque al-Nidaa in northern Baghdad. Nor was there any noticed increase in security around Abdul-Qader al-Jilani mosque, which is \\"one of Iraq's holiest Sunni sites and the target of a recent bombing ... [and is] located in a small Sunni quarter surrounded by Shiite neighborhoods where the Mahdi Army militia, blamed for much of the sectarian violence, is active.\\" Thirty-seven bodies slain by sectarian violence were reported in Baghdad on the day of the lifting of the curfew. Two days after the curfew was lifted the Al-Khilani Mosque bombing took place in Baghdad. Relaxing of Samarra curfew The 24-hour curfew in Samarra was relaxed on Saturday, 16 June but movement was restricted from 8 pm until 7 am On the afternoon of Monday 18 June 2007 four people were slain in the city when a suicide bomber drove his explosive laden car into a school being used to house police officers. International reaction United Nations United Nations Secretary- General Ban Ki-Moon called on \\"all Iraqis to avoid succumbing to the vicious cycle of revenge and to exercise maximum restraint while demonstrating unity and resolve in the face of this terrible attack.\\" Iran On the day of the bombing, in predominantly Shia Iran, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad blamed the U.S. for failing to prevent the bombing. He threatened to halt regional cooperation which many see as integral to ending the spiraling violence in Iraq. Bahrain Also on the 13th in the nearby nation of Bahrain members of the Shiite ethnic majority marched through the streets of the capital Manama in protest of the bombing. In two back to back marches, demonstrators blamed both al-Qaeda and the U.S. shouting \\"Death to America\\" and \\"No to Terrorism.\\" After the 2006 bombing more than 100,000 Bahrainis also demonstrated. India Syed Ali Nasir Saeed Abaqati a leading Shia cleric from Lucknow, India held al-Qaeda responsible for destruction of the Al-Askari Mosque in Samarra, Iraq.Sadiq, Jawad blame US; Abaqati puts it on Qaeda. The Hindustan Times, 15 June 2007 On 14 June 2007 in the Indian administrated territory of Kashmir over 500 Shiite demonstrators demonstrated in response to the bombing by marching in the city of Srinagar. They carried black flags, copies of the Qur'an, shouted anti-American slogans, such as \\"Down with Bush, down with US\\", and burned effigies of President George W. Bush. Demonstrator Haidar Ali told reporters \\"Our protest is against the bombing, against the American occupation of Iraq which has led to bombing.\\" There were further demonstrations in other towns across Kashmir. Perpetrators The U.S. military announced on 14 June 2007 that it had \\"detained 25 suspects in raids against al-Qaida in Iraq over the past two days.\\" This included a suspect \\"believed to be a close associate of Omar al-Baghdadi, who headed al-Qaida's Islamic State in Iraq.\\" On 16 June 2007 three American troops were killed by explosions near their vehicles ‚Äì two in Baghdad and one at Kirkuk province.

Egbert was a son of Dirk II, Count of Holland. After being trained in Egmond Abbey, founded and controlled by his family, and at the court of Bruno I, Archbishop of Cologne, he became the chancellor of Otto II in 976. The following year he was appointed to the archdiocese of Trier, still probably in his twenties. He accompanied Otto II on visits to Italy in 980 and 983, and may have made other trips there. After Otto II's death in 983, he joined the party supporting the succession of Henry the Quarrelsome, Duke of Bavaria, rather than Otto III, but returned to supporting Otto in 985.Head, 76; Lasko, 95 Egbert was a significant patron of science and the arts, who established one or more workshops of goldsmiths and enamellers at Trier, which produced works for other Ottonian centres and the Imperial court. Beginning with his tenure, Trier came to rival Mainz and Cologne as the artistic centre of the Ottonian world. These were the three most important episcopal sees in Germany, who at this period disputed the primacy of the emerging German (East Frankish) kingdom between them.Lasko, 95; Dodwell, 134;  Efforts to secure the primacy of Germany  To be established as the Primate of Germany would bring important political advantages, and increasing the prestige of his see through cultural means was probably an important element in Egbert's presumed role in establishing or encouraging artists and craftsmen to settle there. When Otto II was crowned in Aachen in 961, all three archbishops had performed the ceremony together.Head, 65 In the traditional account, the battle for the primacy was in fact effectively lost in 975, two years before Egbert acceded to Trier, when Willigis, the new Archbishop of Mainz, Egbert's predecessor as chancellor, where Egbert worked under him, obtained privileges from Pope Benedict VII that amounted to a primacy which later developments would confirm and formalize. There were also earlier privileges from 969 and 973. But as archbishop Egbert seems to have still been fighting a rearguard action, building on developments by his predecessor of the story of the origins of the see, in which a staff given by Saint Peter to Eucharius, the supposed first bishop, played a large role. Trier was also the old Roman northern capital, still with abundant Roman ruins. However the authenticity of the Mainz privileges has recently been questioned, with some scholars now arguing that they were forgeries produced not long after Egbert's lifetime, so the question may have been more open.Head, 65‚Äì68 The appearance, not recorded before Egbert's episcopy, of an actual staff alleged to be that Saint Peter gave to Eucharius, certainly deserves to be treated with great suspicion as a \\"brazen\\" fabrication.Head, 71‚Äì73, 72 quoted Though apparently smoothed over, Egbert's initial support for Henry the Quarrelsome as successor to Otto II (who Willigis of Mainz had supported throughout) may have put paid to any chances he had of succeeding in his ambitions for primacy.Head, 76  Patron of the arts  So-called \\"Egbert shrine\\" in the Treasury of Trier Cathedral Detail of the Trier enamels and gold reliefs on the treasure binding for the Codex Aureus of Echternach Egbert was one of the most important Ottonian clerical patrons, and though he also built churches and monasteries, and no doubt commissioned wall-paintings and works in other media, the surviving pieces are in the form of metalwork with enamel and illuminated manuscripts.Dodwell, 134‚Äì144, especially 134; Beckwith, 96‚Äì104, 133‚Äì134 The manuscripts were both inscribed and illuminated by monks with specialized skills, some of whose names are preserved, but there is no evidence as to the artists who worked in metal, enamel and ivory, who are usually assumed to have been laymen,Metz, 47‚Äì49 though there were some monastic goldsmiths in the Early Medieval period, and some lay brothers and lay assistants employed by monasteries.An area where evidence is generally thin across Europe, see Cherry, Chapter 1 While secular jewellery supplied a steady stream of work for goldsmiths, ivory carving at this period was mainly for the church, and may have been centred in monasteries.  Metalwork  The workshop Egbert is presumed to have established at Trier is the only Ottonian workshop producing enamels that can be clearly located. There are three main survivals of metalwork pieces certainly commissioned by Egbert, though contemporary literary references make it clear there was originally a large production, and both the three clear survivals and a larger group of objects often related to Trier both show \\"astonishingly little unity\\" in style and workmanship, which makes the confident attribution of other pieces such as the Cross of Otto and Mathilde very difficult. The three clear survivals are the so-called \\"Egbert shrine\\", a reliquary casket and portable altar for a sandal of Saint Andrew and other relics, still in the Treasury of Trier Cathedral, the staff-reliquary of St Peter, now in Limburg Cathedral Treasury, and the metalwork on the treasure binding reused for the Codex Aureus of Echternach some fifty years later, having been donated by Empress Theophanu. This last had possibly been given to Theophanu and Otto III to mark Egbert's reconciliation with them in 985.Head, 76 Of these three pieces clearly attributable to Trier, Peter Lasko wrote: \\"Each seems to have been made in a totally different workshop, using different sources, techniques, and principles of composition, and indeed, if the evidence for Archbishop Egbert as the donor for all three pieces were not so overwhelming, no one would have dared to attribute them all to one centre.\\"Lasko, 95‚Äì99, 96 quoted; Head deals with the first two objects; Beckwith, 133‚Äì135 for the book cover; Image of the foot reliquary. Elements such as enamel plaques were probably produced at Trier for patrons in other centres, as some surviving correspondence as well actual pieces suggest.Metz, 45‚Äì46; Lasko, 95 It has been suggested that, as there is little evidence of the Trier workshop after Egbert's death, Mathilde, Abbess of Essen recruited it for Essen. The staff-reliquary now in Limburg uses iconography to promote the claims of the see of Trier, with sets of enamel plaques with portraits of the Apostles paired with those of the earliest bishops of Trier, and other sets matching popes with later bishops. There is evidence that \\"Egbert put the reliquary to frequent use\\" to relieve droughts and the like, and very likely to also to \\"brandish\\" it to increase his authority in synods and other important meetings.Head, 71‚Äì73, 72 quoted  Manuscripts  The presentation miniature of the Codex Egberti, with Egbert's portrait Egbert's major commissions of manuscripts seem to date from about 980 onwards, and it is unclear where they were produced; monastic scribes and illuminators may have been rather mobile between the major centres. Egbert commissioned the compilation of the Registrum Gregorii from the letters of Pope Gregory the Great, and produced a magnificently illuminated copy. The finest painter of this manuscript worked on a number of other books, probably at Trier and later Reichenau, and is known as the Gregory Master, whose work looked back in some respects to Late Antique manuscript painting, and whose miniatures are notable for \\"their delicate sensibility to tonal grades and harmonies, their fine sense of compositional rhythms, their feelings for the relationship of figures in space, and above all their special touch of reticence and poise\\".Dodwell, 141‚Äì142, 141 quoted Egbert was also the recipient of the illuminated manuscript Codex Egberti, showing an early form of Romanesque style, which was probably produced at the up-and-coming centre of Reichenau, though the manuscripts associated with Egbert and with Reichenau at this period show something of the same confusing diversity of style as the metalwork.Dodwell, 134‚Äì144 and see index, gives extended coverage; Beckwith, 96‚Äì104 The Egbert Psalter, which he commissioned for his own use in Trier Cathedral, was used a number of times after his death as a diplomatic gift, travelling as far as Russia and Hungary, and has been in Cividale del Friuli in northern Italy since 1229.Beckwith, 97‚Äì98; Dodwell, 134‚Äì139 A number of other manuscripts survive.Dodwell, 135, 139‚Äì144 The miniatures in Egbert's manuscripts repeat many of the themes promoting the claims of the see of Trier that are found in the metalwork; in the psalter miniatures show the scribe (named as Ruodpreht) presenting the book to Egbert, who in turn presents it to Saint Peter. The square halos (for a living person) given to Egbert in both the portraits illustrated here are one of the elements showing Italian influence on Trier miniatures.Beckwith, 98 A well-known miniature in the Registrum Gregorii of Gregory writing probably represents Egbert also, and the pairing of portraits of popes and bishops of Trier found on the Limburg staff also appears.Dodwell, 135 Notes References *Beckwith, John.

His mother had been previously married and widowed, after which she entered a convent. Because she left the convent to marry Henry, her second marriage was considered invalid and the couple split. Thankmar's legitimacy was, therefore, in question. In 929, Henry I arranged for his succession and had the arrangement ratified by an assembly at Erfurt, just before his death. After his death, his lands and wealth were divided between his four sons: Thankmar, Otto, Henry, and Bruno.Bernhardt, 3. Otto, however, was designated by his father to receive the crown. The only succession dispute was between Otto and his younger full brother Henry, who was kept under house arrest in Bavaria during Otto's coronation.Reuter, 149, based on Flodoard and Widukind of Corvey. After the death of his cousin, Siegfried, Count of Merseburg (they were related in the maternal line), in 937, Thankmar claimed Merseburg.Bernhardt, 18. Otto, however, appointed Gero, Siegfried's brother. During this dispute, Eberhard of Franconia and Wichmann the Elder revolted against Otto and Thankmar joined them.

They are famous for incorporating cajun and swamp rock elements into their music. Its members included cajun fiddler Gib Guilbeau, John Beland, before either of them joined The Flying Burrito Brothers, with Stan Pratt, Thad Maxwell, and Eric White (Clarence White of The Byrds' brother). Swampwater would go on to back Ronstadt in 1971 on TV's The Johnny Cash Show, and their appearance on the show would help Swampwater secure a recording contract with RCA. They combined California country rock with influences from bands such as The Byrds, The Dillards, Hearts & Flowers, the Beach Boys and the Everly Brothers. Their stylized guitar riffs would coincidentally be influential in the early records of the Eagles.  Career  Guilbeau and Gene Parsons had released a few early country-rock singles in the late 1960s, as well as an album which was released in 1970, although recorded in 1968. The two recruited Clarence White in 1968 to record the Nashville West album. Eric White was also in the band and, prior to forming Swampwater, had been in the Kentucky Colonels. Swampwater made two albums in the early 1970s without Linda Ronstadt's involvement. Swampwater's first album, titled Swampwater, was released on Starday King Records in 1971. The album was recorded in four days in New Mexico, at a four track studio owned and operated by the record producer, John Wagner. The band was in between touring with Ronstadt. The band's second album was also titled Swampwater, but this time was released by RCA. The album was recorded in Hollywood, California as well as in Nashville, Tennessee. In Nashville, Swampwater used steel guitarists, Curly Chalker and Jimmy Day. Reviewing the 1971 Swampwater LP, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): \\"On their own Linda Ronstadt's backup boys prove honest country-rockers, which is like (and probably is) honest folkies with more chops. Very tuneful in a variety of styles, with Gib Guilbeau's fiddle pushing toward the bayous and John Beland's guitar pulling 'em back to L.A. But their best lyric is about a dancing bear, and their version of 'Headed for the Country' is less bathetic than Johnny Darrell's only because they couldn't project big emotions if they wanted to.\\" Swampwater can be heard on Larry Murray's Verve debut album, Sweet Country Suite. After leaving Ronstadt, the band went to work with the singer- songwriter, Arlo Guthrie, touring the country and appearing with him at the Hollywood Bowl. Beland left the group to embark on a solo career, and was signed to Apple Records while on tour in the UK in 1972. The band continued on for a few months with Guthrie, but soon disbanded. Guilbeau went on to join the Flying Burrito Brothers, as well as a brief stint with the New Riders of the Purple Sage. A reunion was attempted in 1979 with Mickey McGee on drums. This resulted in the album Reunion that was not released until 1987. By 1980, both Beland and McGee joined Guilbeau in the Flying Burrito Brothers. This re- union led to nine hit country singles in the 1980s. In 2016, a possible reunion funded by a kickstarter campaign began but has since gone dormant.

Origin Tonto Basin is the original version of the shorter novel To The Last Man (1921). Grey submitted the manuscript of Tonto Basin to the magazine The Country Gentleman, which published it in serialization as To the Last Man from May 28, 1921 through July 30, 1921. This was a much shorter version of the original leaving out much of the backstory and character development. This shorter version was published as a book by Harper Brothers in 1921. Plot introduction A story of a feud between two families, the evil it causes, and the power of love to transcend all. Plot summary The story begins with 24-year-old Jean Isbel in the last stages of a multi-week trip from Oregon to the frontier in Arizona where his family had moved four years earlier to start a cattle ranch. As he nears his destination he meets a woman in the woods, and falls in love at first sight. As they part they learn that they are mortal enemies. She is Ellen Jorth, and her family is locked in a deadly feud with his. Jean dreads the part his father, Gaston, wants him to play in the feud. He can‚Äôt get Ellen out of his mind. They meet again and his words awake in her doubt and fear that her father, Lee Jorth, is not an honorable man but in fact a horse thief and cattle rustler. As events unfold her fears are proved true. Through thick and thin Jean Isbel defends Ellen‚Äôs honor and believes the best of her. The feud erupts into fatal gun battles, first at the Isbel ranch house, and then at the general store in the nearby town. Most of the Isbel and Jorth clans are killed, with several of their allies. The remnant of the Jorths flee with Ellen in tow to a hide-out hidden in a deep box ca√±on. Jean and his allies track them and there is a deadly gun battle in the woods nearby. Ellen is forced by one of the three remaining Jorth allies to flee once again. During their flight their horse is shot out from under them. Ellen now on foot meets one of the dying Isbels and finally learns the certain truth that her father, family, and their allies were horse thieves and cattle rustlers as she feared. When she finally makes her way back to the hide-out, she arrives just after Jean has been forced to take refuge in the loft, unknown to her. One of the two remaining rustlers attacks her with rape in mind but is interrupted by the arrival of the other rustler. Ellen discovers Jean during this interruption. When the rustler returns a few minutes later, Ellen is forced to kill him to protect herself and Jean. A minute later Jean kills the last rustler. The story ends with Jean and Ellen declaring their love for each other. Themes The book is concerned with the destruction deadly violence wreaks on those family members who survive. Grey writes about the intense concern Jean feels for the impact the violence will have on the wives and children whose husbands and fathers will die in the feud. The feud is caused by a love triangle between Gaston Isbel, Lee Jorth, and Ellen the woman both love, and the mother of Ellen Jorth. The story explores how love, betrayal, and jealousy can engender a hate which leads two men to destroy their families, without a thought to the pain and suffering of those relatives who will be left to bury the dead. Ellen grows from a na√Øve girl to a woman of understanding under the severe trial of the events which overtake her. She begins to examine critically her own behavior with wisdom and insight. She grows and matures emotionally and psychologically, becoming aware that her father whom she had supported with unquestioning trust, is in fact a scoundrel, a thief, and a thoroughly dishonorable rogue. At the end she acts decisively and fatally to protect herself, her virtue, and the man she loves.

Publication In the early 1990s, Jon Tuska, was researching the filmography of Zane Grey. During this research he discovered that Last of the Duanes and Rangers of the Lone Star were much altered from the holograph found \\"in the bottom drawer of a file cabinet in the Zane Grey, Inc. room where it had survived for eighty years.\\".Grey, Zane: \\"Tonto Basin\\", (quote from the Foreword by Jon Tuska) page 8. Five Star, 2004. This caused him to request that they \\"tell me of any other manuscripts...that had met a similar fate.\\"Grey, Zane: \\"Tonto Basin\\", (quote from the Foreword by Jon Tuska) page 9. Five Star, 2004. The result was the discovery of the complete holographic manuscript of the novel To the Last Man. A comparison of the holograph with To the Last Man revealed that the holograph was much longer, and contained detail which altered the meaning of the story. The complete uncut version was published in 2004.

It is used to induce experimental sterile inflammation. In macrophages, zymosan-induced responses include the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, arachidonate mobilization, protein phosphorylation, and inositol phosphate formation. Zymosan A also raises cyclin D2 levels suggesting a role for the latter in macrophage activation besides proliferation. It potentiates acute liver damage after galactosamine injection suggesting that certain types of nonparenchymal cells other than Kupffer cells are involved in zymosan action.http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/search/ProductDetail/SIGMA/Z4250 References External links * Category:Polysaccharides ","title":"Zymosan"},{"id":"11778809","text":"Porcelain is Fuel's third EP.

He currently oversees his international business interests from Brussels. Business career After passing his 11+ examination in 1959, McCabe attended Rowlinson Technical School, Norton, Sheffield. 1964 saw the start of McCabe's career in the construction and property industry, initially based in Sheffield where he qualified as a Quantity Surveyor becoming an associate member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. In his early days, he worked as a project manager for a subsidiary of Bovis Group involved in a number of commercial developments located in the North of England, Aberdeen and central belt Scotland. In 1971 Kevin joined Teesland and was appointed a Director some two years thereafter, where his primary responsibilities were for the promotion expansion of the companies activities throughout Scotland. In 1976 Kevin established his own corporation, County Properties Limited, to carry out a variety of property transactions in various areas of the UK. He merged County with a public quoted corporation in 1980 and continued to lead and run the company in the position of Deputy chairman and chief executive until 1987. At that time Kevin departed to expand his private family company, Scarborough Property Group plc which was formed since 1980. The activities of this company involved development and management work undertaken for certain properties, which were owned by the Bank of Scotland and thus this liaison eventually formed the basis Scarborough Property Company plc established in the late 1980s. At or about the same time, Kevin assisted in the management buy out of Teesland from the previous owners and helped to re-organise the structure of the Group. Initially he took on board the role of Non-Executive chairman but after a period of re-organisation Teesland Group was then incorporated into Scarborough Property Company in 1996. Scarborough Group A native of Sheffield, Kevin McCabe set up the property company Scarborough Group in 1980. Since then McCabe and his family's ownership of the Scarborough group has branched out into the Far East and China. The group owns Forsyth plc, which runs serviced office operations across the UK including the Blades Enterprise Centre at Sheffield United F.C ground, the Blades' home in Sheffield, and also a 20% stake in both Frasers Property (UK) Ltd and FairBriar Holdings Ltd. In June 2007, McCabe sold his entire 60 per cent stake in Scamp Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary company of his Scarborough group which owned a real estate investment management operation, together with a significant portfolio of real estate across Europe, to the Australian company, Valad for ¬£850 million. Following the deal McCabe retained a position on the board until his resignation in October 2009 after receiving the final $56.5 million payment for the European property assets. The Scarborough Group has actively invested in the property sector in China since 2003 with the most high-profile project being the partnership with Top Spring Group in which Scarborough has a substantial stake and McCabe is vice-Chairman. Scarborough also has a significant stake in Rainbow Department Stores, following its demerger from Top Spring in 2009. On 12 February 2010 Kevin was honoured with an international fellowship award for his outstanding contribution to building business and sporting relations between China and Britain.

The station's studio and transmitter is located at the UMBN Media Center, C. Bangoy corner Palma Gil Streets, Davao City. It broadcast 24 hours daily (except Holy Week of each year where it closes down at midnight of Maundy Thursday and lasts until 4:00 AM of Easter Sunday) with a Contemporary MOR, CHR, Dance and OPM format. History As DXMC In 1949, businessman Atty. Guillermo Torres founded the first radio station in Mindanao and in Davao City under the callsign DXMC, named after Mindanao Colleges and was originally broadcast at 740 kilocycles. Back then, it broadcasts news and music programming. In 1957, Torres founded the University of Mindanao Broadcasting Network after its Congressional franchise was amended. The station was shut down during Martial Law, but resumed its operations alongside DXUM but not DXMM. In November 1978, due to the switch of the Philippine AM dial from the NARBA-mandated 10 kHz spacing to the 9 kHz rule implemented by the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975, the station's frequency was transferred to 819 kHz. Conversion into FM broadcasting In July 1988, about 2 years after the \\"EDSA People Power Revolution\\", UMBN converted DXMC into the FM frequency under the new callsign: DXWT-FM. With this conversion, UMBN launched a new FM brand now known as Wild FM. Under the leadership of Willie Torres, DXWT-FM was formatted as dance-leaning Contemporary Hit Radio-Dance (CHR), capitalizing on Dance Re-Mixes and the so-called EPs (Extended Play), normally played only in Disco Clubs. Wild FM transformed radio programming by putting these re-mixes and EPs in 20-minute un-interrupted non-stop sweeps over the airwaves. Wild FM also revolutionized radio promotions and events by organizing Street Discos and Disco sa Barangays. In less than a year, Wild FM became no. 1 in Davao City, and a by-word in the industry.

In all types of weather for 30 years, he attended every home game at both Mile High Stadium and INVESCO Field at Mile High wearing nothing but an orange barrel that covered his torso and a cowboy hat and boots. His costume was reminiscent of rodeo clowns (or barrelmen) who serve as a distraction to animals in the rodeo arena in order to protect riders who have been thrown and of the stereotype of the miner who lost his stake and had nothing left to wear but a barrel. He was the first Broncos fan inducted into the VISA Hall of Fans Hall of Fans at the Pro Football Hall of Fame. McKernan began attending Broncos games in 1967, eventually missing only four of them. He first wore a barrel in 1977 after making a $10 bet with his brother over whether wearing one would get him on television. He won, wearing one painted to resemble an Orange Crush can. The soft drink brand was also the nickname for the defensive unit of the orange-jerseyed Broncos who won the American Football Conference Championship that season. McKernan also showed up at games for the Denver Gold of the short-lived United States Football League in the mid-1980s, wearing a gold-painted barrel. McKernan retired his act after the 2007 season at the age of 67, but announced that he would continue attending games in normal dress. McKernan had serious health issues in 2003, after an abdominal aneurysm ruptured. After that time he was restricted by doctors to wearing his barrel for one half of play, and then only when the temperature was above freezing. These health issues were a major reason behind McKernan's deciding to give up the barrel in 2007. Retired after 40 years as a mechanic for United Airlines, McKernan and his wife were based in Gunnison, Colorado, but spent their offseasons traveling in their recreational vehicle. Due to the space constraints of living in an RV, McKernan sold his Super Bowl XXXII barrel for $30,000. The barrel, autographed by 49 Broncos from their first Super Bowl winning team, was sold to Nicholas Martinez of Las Animas Colorado. McKernan gave 10% of his profits to Jubilee House, battered women's shelter in Gunnison. McKernan died on December 5, 2009, of respiratory failure caused by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at age 69. The last Broncos game before his death was a rout of the Giants on Thanksgiving Day. In November 2012, the History Colorado Center honored the Barrel Man as part of an exhibit called Denver A to Z: Adrenaline to Zombies and (almost) Everything in Between. A statue of McKernan epitomizes D for Devoted.

He was a member of the team that played Derbyshire's first match in May 1871. Platts was born to Robert and Alice Platts (n√©e Dumelow) in Chellaston, Derbyshire. In his youth, he worked in the local gypsum mines, and in his spare time would pretend to play cricket by bowling stones at imaginary batsmen.John Dallison Platts, John: Life and career blighted by tragedy Retrieved 10 April 2009 An early game was for Hallam and Staveley in 1861 against an All England Eleven. He was a wheelwright by trade, but by 1868 was a professional at Ipswich School.Don Ambrose ‚Äì Profile at Cricket Archive In 1869 he played for Dudley and also for the Gentlemen of Worcester when he took 8 wickets in an innings. In 1870, Lord Coventry helped raise a subscription for Platts to join the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Platts played a single first-class game for MCC against Nottinghamshire in June 1870 which resulted in tragedy. He was fast bowling on a badly laid wicket at Lord's when the ball struck the batsman George Summers on the head. Summers retired hurt and appeared to recover, but died four days later. W. G. Grace was also playing for MCC in the match and commented on the incident \\"...the bowler was not in the least to blame for the catastrophe, but he was terribly cut up, and I shall never forget his mental distraction.\\" Platts later turned out against All England XI's, first for Lichfield when he took 10 wickets in the match, and then for Wirksworth where he was upstaged by another future Derbyshire player Dove Gregory. After Derbyshire County Cricket Club was established, Platts played in the club's first match in the 1871 season against Lancashire in May, and for thirteen years thereafter. Although undistinguished in the first game, he came in to bowl in the second match that season and took 5 for 34. During the 1872 season he took 5‚Äì51 in the first innings of the second match against Lancashire. He took four wickets in the 1873 season, while his batting scores improved significantly in the 1874 season. All through these early years Platt appeared in matches involving All England XIs and United South of England XIs sometimes for them and sometimes against them. He was usually against the side in which W. G. Grace was playing. At Birmingham in 1874 he was bowled by Grace, but in 1876, turning out for an assortment of clubs including Swansea, Barrow, Birmingham and Stockport, he took Grace's wicket twice. For Derbyshire in the 1876 season he was top scorer with 235. His first-class bowling took a step forward and he took 6‚Äì68 for Derbyshire against Kent. In the 1877 season he made his top score of 115 against Hampshire, which was the club's first century, and topped the scoring for Derbyshire again with 432. He took 5‚Äì18 against Lancashire that year. He continued playing other matches for and against other clubs, although this tailed out in the early 1880s. By 1881 he was running the \\"Rose and Crown\\" public house at Chellaston as well as being a professional cricketer.British Census 1881 RG11 3387/48 p16 In the 1880 season he took 5‚Äì26 against Yorkshire, in the 1881 season 6‚Äì39 against Lancashire and in the 1882 season 5‚Äì48 against Lancashire. Platts played against a line-up of Australians several times during the early part of the decade, fixtures intended to help the young members of the international side do their homework for possible upcoming Test fixtures against England. After the final one of these in which he participated, Platts played one final game, and, having continued steadily up the order during his career, played his penultimate game in the 1884 season as an opener.John Platts at Cricket Archive Platts was a left-handed batsman and a right-arm round-arm slow bowler, with the added bonus of some occasionally fiendish pace to his straight-arm action. Platts started umpiring in 1885 immediately after he stopped playing and took 69 first-class games until 1896. Later, John Platts was diagnosed with tuberculosis and died at his home in August 1898, at the age of 49.

The first 29.7 MW phase of construction called Peetz Table Wind, also known as Ridge Crest Wind, became the largest wind farm in the state upon its completion in 2001. A second 400.5 MW construction phase, including the 201 MW Logan Wind Energy Center and the 199.5 MW Peetz Table Wind Energy Center, reclaimed the distinction upon its completion in 2007. Facility details The Peetz Table is a plateau which provides access along its southern edge in Colorado to some of the best wind resources on the High Plains, according to data from the United States Department of Energy. The first phase was developed by the European firm EDF Energy in 2001. It occupies farmland about two miles southwest of the small town of Peetz. It consists of 33 NEG Micon NM52/900 wind turbines that are each rated at 0.9 MW. At a total capacity of 29.7 MW, it was the largest wind farm in the state, surpassing the 25.3 MW Ponnequin Wind Farm which had been previously built up starting in the late 1990s. NextEra Energy Resources developed and constructed the second phase in 2007 as one of the largest wind projects in the United States. The twin 200 MW units occupy the remainder of the plateau to the west of Peetz and south of the Nebraska border. It consists of 267 GE Energy 1.5SLE turbines rated at 1.5 MW.

He was the son and successor of Margrave Gero II. His mother was Adelaide. In 1028, the Ostmark, with the rest of the eastern marches of the Duchy of Saxony fell under attack from Mieszko II of Poland. The Emperor Conrad II rushed from central Saxony and trekked over very wild terrain to besiege the Poles in Bautzen. Meanwhile, Bretislaus, son of Oldrich of Bohemia, invaded and conquered the March of Moravia, which had been lost to Bohemia since 1003. Conrad, however, failed to take Bautzen (1029) and returned to the Rhineland by wintertime, leaving the defences of the realm in the hands of Dietrich II of Wettin and Thietmar, who died early in January. On his death, Mieszko attacked and destroyed some hundred German villages. The setback was severe: the east of the Ostmark was lost. He was buried in Helmarshausen. Thietmar was succeeded by his son Odo II. He left a daughter, Oda, who married William III of Weimar and then Dedo II of Wettin, who succeeded her brother Odo. References *Thompson, James Westfall.

The movie was produced by S. Shankar's banner S Pictures and the story was based on the college campus featuring debutant Akhil and Tamannaah. Audio was released under Shankar's own audio company S Musics; Promote by Softment.https://www.facebook.com/Softment/ music was scored by Joshua Sridhar and lyrics were written by Na. Muthukumar. The film was dubbed in Telugu language as Kalasala.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv7hTZerPKg The film received positive reviews from the critics as well as audience and become a superhit. The film was inspired on a real-life incident of three college girls of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University being burnt alive in the 2000 Dharmapuri bus burning incident.  Plot  The film begins with group of students clearing weeds near a roadside tree. The scene flashes back a few years earlier in a bus with a lot of college students heading towards Government Arts College in a small town. A set ‚Äì Muthuchelvan, Ramesh, Kayalvizhi, Adhilakshmi, Nagarani, Albert, Kaamatchinathan, Salima, Iyanar ‚Äì are introduced as friends since high school. There is a small build-up to the introduction of the hero (Muthu played by newcomer Akhil), who is part and parcel of the circle, a well-talented athlete; Ramesh- a big flirt and movie buff; Kayalvizhi- a strong-willed and courageous woman who hates the ideas of falling in love within friends; Adhilakshmi- a food lover; Nagarani- a Telugu speaking girl who gets fits when she is frightened; Albert- a Christian, always get abused by his drunkard father; Kaamatchinathan- a rich, yet timid person who even gets very shy to introduce himself to his classmates at the first day of college; Salima- A Muslim girl and very intelligent in both studies and talented in dance and Iyanar- a quirky guy. All are studying in the same class. They enter into the college for the first time. In the classroom they see a beautiful girl Shobhana (played by Tamannaah), who is strikingly different. She looks depressed and sad and aloof. The friends are puzzled by her in the beginning and later they learn she lost her mom recently in an accident. The group sympathizes for her and brings her into its fold. Shobhana soon becomes a member of their group and ditches her plans to pursue her course in Delhi. She simply does it to be with these friends during college. The movie goes on to narrate the college life with fun and colour. It shows the strength of the friendship and the backgrounds of the friends; most of them are from poor families. Muthu has an aim in his life. Being an athlete, he wants to excel in sports and get a good job through sports quota to give his poor family a new lease of life. Shobhana, who is from wealthy family background, feels sympathy for Muthu after she sees the conditions he and his family live in and is really moved by his perseverance and helps him achieve his goal by encouraging him in every chance. In fact as true friend many do the same and so does Shobhana. She even advises him that there is more he has to and capable of achieving in life so he should take her encouragements as a way to improve his career and nothing else. But eventually, her encouraging stance turns into some sort of special attachment with him. Slowly love develops in the minds of both but they chose to put it on the back seat for the sake of the larger friendship they share with the group. In fact, poor lovers don't even share their feelings. Eventually, they take a college trip to Andhra. On the way, they stop at a hotel but there is only non-vegetarian food being served so Muthu volunteers to run to the nearest vegetarian restaurant a few km away to bring food for Shobhana who is a vegetarian. Shobhana confessed her love for Muthu to Kayalvizhi which she accepts it wholeheartedly and says that even though she hates the concept of love between best friends, she doesn't want to spoil Shobhana's happiness and true love. This conversation was overheard by Adhilakshmi. The latter says this to the rest of the gang, to their surprise and delight. But fate has other plans, the hotel they were initially eating at is urgently closed because some politician or another has been arrested. The group board the bus urgently and try to go to a collector's office or a police station to keep safe while two classmates wait for Muthu to come back. On the way, however, the bus is stopped by the protestors and despite pleas to allow them to pass, the protestors light the bus on fire. In a frenzy, everyone tries to evacuate the bus and Nagarani gets fits and has an attack. In a scramble to safely get off the bus, the rest of the group fail to realize that some students are still trapped. After the fire trucks finish putting out the fire, they bring out the burnt bodies of Kayal, Adhilakshmi and Shobhana, who have embraced each other in their final moments together-Kayal having stayed back to help Shobhana who's chudi had gotten caught in the bus. The last scene flashes back to the beginning of the movie where a group of people are clearing the weeds. It has been eight years since the incident and every year the group of friends come to pay respects to their lost friends and Muthu still keeps the handkerchief of Shobhana's in the remembrance of their love.

Muthukumar's lyrics evoked a nostalgic feeling.  Release  The satellite rights of the film were sold to Kalaignar.  Critical reception  Behind woods stated that the movie works but its lack of action and dance numbers might affect its prospects at the box office. Indiaglitz said out that the climax scene was credibly portrayed but didn't fit well into the script. After the film was released, Sakthivel changed the climax because of the negative reaction to a scene in the film which was reminiscent of a real-life incident where girls were burned on a bus.

He attended the University of Sydney and graduated in economics and arts including theology. After university he was ordained, becoming minister of the Reid Methodist Church in Reid, Australian Capital Territory, before serving in World War II with the RAAF as a chaplain. From early 1942 he served part-time as the chaplain of RAAF Station Canberra (now known as Fairbairn, Canberra) before being called up for full-time service in July 1943, becoming chaplain with No. 8 Squadron RAAF, with which he served in Queensland and New Guinea until his tour ended at the end of May 1944. He later served with No. 8 Operational Training Unit RAAF at Parkes, New South Wales and No. 58 Operational Base Unit RAAF in the Northern Territory. He was discharged in December 1945.RAAF service record, A9300, TRATHEN D A, National Archives of Australia, Canberra. After the war, Trathen resumed his responsibilities as a Methodist minister, moving with his wife to Wingham, New South Wales in 1946. The following year, Trathen was transferred to a church at Corrimal, New South Wales. Headmaster In January 1950, Trathen accepted his first school leadership position, when he was approached to become the Principal of Wolaroi College in Orange. He was described at the time as \\"a young man of fine gifts and extensive experience. He will bring to his new position a keen interest in Christian education, and qualifications that should make him a worthy successor to ... the retiring Principal.\\" Trathen House, a boarding facility, is named in his honour at Kinross Wolaroi School.Boarding Handbook ‚Äì Kinross Wolaroi School Retrieved 7 December 2018. In 1963, Trathen commenced duties as Headmaster of Newington College. His obituary in the Sydney Morning Herald states that: \\"At Newington, he quickly clashed with the establishment ... he sought to broaden the macho sports- oriented base of the school. His ideals were worthy, but his dogmatism alienated many. Interested in philosophy, he did not fit the image of a man's man.\\" In June 1970, at the height of the political crisis about Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, Trathen wrote a letter to the Herald speaking out against conscription and calling on young men to defy the National Service Act. He wrote: \\"I am loth indeed to be forced publicly to advocate (non- violent) civil disobedience ... As an ex-serviceman, a private citizen and a man of law and Law, I publicly encourage 20-year-olds, in good conscience and in loyalty to God rather than Caesar, to defy the National Service Act.

His brothers were Archbishop Gero of Cologne and Margrave Odo of the Saxon Ostmark. Thietmar strengthened the ties with the mighty Billung dynasty by marrying Swanehilde (d. 1014), daughter of Margrave Hermann Billung, acting Duke of Saxony from 961. The couple had one son: Gero II, who in 993 would succeed Thietmar's brother Odo as Margrave of the Saxon Eastern March. In 951, he was first recorded when he succeeded his father as margrave in the Gau Serimunt. Between 951 and 978, he was also count in the Saxon Schwabengau. After the death of his uncle Gero the Great in 965, Thietmar inherited large parts of whose vast Marca Geronis and upon the death of Margrave Wigbert (before 976) received the Margraviate of Meissen from the hands of Emperor Otto II. On 29 August 970, Margrave Thietmar and his brother Gero of Cologne founded the abbey of Thankmarsfelde, which between 971 and 975 became a royal monastery. It was moved to Nienburg at the confluence of the Saale and Bode rivers in 975.

A strain of bacterium or fungus will not grow near a concentration of antibiotic or antifungal if it is sensitive; the results can be used to determine a Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Etest is a proprietary system manufactured by bioM√©rieux. It is a laboratory test most commonly used in healthcare settings to help guiding physicians in treatment of patients by indicating what concentration of antimicrobial would successfully treat an infection. Use Etest is a quantitative technique for determining the antimicrobial sensitivity (AST) and Minimum inhibitory concentration (in ¬µg/mL) of some bacteria and fungi including Gram-negative and Gram-positive aerobic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus species and fastidious bacteria, such as anaerobes, N. gonorrhoeae, S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus and Haemophilius species. Next to bacteria it can also be used to determine the MIC for certain fungi. Procedure Etest is a pre-prepared non-porous plastic reagent strip with a predefined gradient of antibiotic, covering a continuous concentration range. It is applied to the surface of an agar plate inoculated with the test strain, where there is release of the antimicrobial gradient from the plastic carrier to the agar to form a stable and continuous gradient beneath and in nearby to the strip. The time taken for a plate to be ready depends on the bacterium that is being tested, and the conditions of the agar plate. The predefined Etest gradient remains stable for at least 18 to 24 hours; that is, a period that covers the critical times of many species of fastidious and non- fastidious organisms. After the test, the bacterial growth becomes visible after incubation and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along the strip is seen. The MIC value is read from the scale in terms of ¬µg/mL where the ellipse edge intersects the strip. After the required incubation period, the minimum inhibitory value is read where the edge of the inhibition ellipse intersects the side of the strip. The plate should not be read if the culture appears mixed or if the lawn of growth is too light or too heavy. Etest MIC endpoints are usually clear-cut although different growth/inhibition patterns may be seen depending on the antifungal or antibiotic used.https://techlib.biomerieux.com/wcm/techlib/techlib/documents/docLink/Package_Insert/35904001-35905000/Package_Insert_-_9305056_-_D_- _en_-_Etest_-_AFST_WW.pdf E-test Caspofungin against Candida albicans Selection of agar medium Etest can be used with many different kinds of AST agar medium as long as the medium supports good growth of the test organism and does not interfere with the activity of the antimicrobial agent. However, to maximise reproducibility, the medium chosen should fulfil the basic requirements for a susceptibility test medium. The following AST mediums are recommended for use with Etest: * Aerobes: Mueller Hinton agar such as MHE (bioM√©rieux) * Anaerobes: Brucella blood agar with appropriate supplements These media may require supplemental nutrients to obtain enhanced growth of nutritionally fastidious organisms such as pneumococci, streptococci, Abiotrophia, Haemophilus, gonococci, meningococci and Campylobacter. In general, media recommendations from the CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) and the EUCAST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) are considered appropriate for Etest. Availability Etest products for more than 100 antimicrobial agents, including antibiotics, antifungal agents and antimycobacterial agents are available. In addition, specific Etest products are available for the detection of specific resistance mechanisms [e.g. ESBL (Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase), MBL (Metallo Beta- Lactamase), AmpC Beta-Lactamase and VISA/h VISA]. Etest has been FDA cleared and CE marked for many organisms by comparing to conventional broth/agar dilution reference methods and shown to have excellent correlation. Etest equipment The Etest family of instruments is designed to simplify the daily use of Etest. Simplex C76, Nema C88, and Retro C80 are easy to use, reducing operator fatigue, saving time and improving the quality of results by increasing reproducibility. Etest and related instruments offer one of the most efficient methods for generating on-scale MIC values across 15 doubling dilutions for susceptibility testing of a wide range of drug-bug combinations, including fastidious organisms. *Simplex C76 automates the placement of 1 to 6 different Etest strips to simplify the setup of MIC panels. Application of up to 6 strips for large agar plates or up to 2 strips on small plates takes <12 seconds. *Retro C80 is a rota-plater that simplifies and standardizes the inoculation of small and large agar plates making Etest¬Æ easier to read when compared to manual streaking. *Nema C88 is a vacuum pen that simplifies the application of Etest¬Æ strips. The applicator is held like a pen and the evacuation hole is covered with the fingertip to create suction. The suction cup is placed on the strip to lift it up and then position onto the agar surface. The strip is released by removing the finger tip from the evacuation hole. History The Etest strip was first described in 1988 and was introduced commercially in 1991 by AB BIODISK. bioM√©rieux acquired AB BIODISK in 2008 and continues to manufacture and market this product range under the mark Etest. During the 1950s, Hans Ericsson (Professor of microbiology at the Karolinska Hospital and Karolinska Institute, Stockholm), the scientific founder of AB BIODISK, developed a method to standardize the disc diffusion method and to improve its reproducibility and reliability for clinical susceptibility predictions. The inhibition zone sizes from disc test results were compared to Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values based on the reference agar dilution procedure. The correlation between zone sizes and MIC values was then assessed using regression analysis and regression lines were used for extrapolating zone interpretive limits that corresponded to the MIC breakpoint values that defined susceptible, intermediate and resistant categorical results. Etest was first presented at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in Los Angeles in 1988 as a novel gradient concept for MIC determinations. In September 1991, Etest was launched globally as a MIC product after receiving the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance.

Their modern name is derived from the personal name which many members of the family bore, and which is seen as a Leitname of the family. At least two Dukes of Lotharingia in the 10th century belonged to this family. After a period of exile and rebellion, the two brothers who returned to power founded the first dynasties of the County of Hainault and County of Louvain. The latter were ancestors of the House of Brabant, Landgraves and later Dukes of Brabant, Lothier and Limburg. The Reginarid Brabant dynasty ended in 1355, leaving its duchies to the House of Luxembourg which in turn left them to the House of Valois-Burgundy in 1383. Junior branches of the male line include the medieval male line of the English House of Percy, Earls of Northumberland, and the German House of Hesse which ruled Hesse from 1264 until 1918 and still exists today. History The first probable ancestor known with any confidence is Gilbert, Count of the Maasgau (mentioned in 841) who served King Lothair I, but defected to Lothair's half-brother Charles the Bald during the civil war of 840‚Äì843. In 846 Gilbert abducted an unnamed daughter of Lothair and married her in an attempt to force Lothair to reinstate him. Reginar, Duke of Lorraine (c. 850‚Äì916) is believed to be Gilbert's son. Following the death of Charles the Fat, the Reginarids began a long fight with the Conradines for supremacy in Lotharingia.Reuter, 135. When they triumphed, in 910, it was in electing Charles the Simple as king. It was the combined forces of Bruno I of Lorraine and the Carolingians of West Francia that finally broke the Reginarids' hold on power.Reuter, 168. In 958, Reginar III had his lands confiscated and redistributed to Gerard, Count of Metz, of the Matfridings, enemies of his family since the reign of Zwentibold.Reuter, 159. The Reginarids supported Lothair of France against Otto II, but they made a deal with the latter in 978.Reuter, 176. The Reginarids were no longer a unified family by the end of the tenth century.Reuter, 192. Their descendants in Mons and Louvain continued their spirit of opposition to the king.Reuter, 201. The house also produced a queen-consort of England in the form of Adeliza of Leuven, who married Henry I of England.

When Rachel leaves Chloe alone in the hotel room to go dancing at a club, Chloe goes looking for her, but gets dognapped as she tries to find Rachel and is sent to the dog fights in Mexico City. There, she meets a street-smart German Shepherd named Delgado. Rachel comes back to the hotel and is frantic when she finds Chloe missing. Chloe is picked to fight in the pit against El Diablo, a fierce Argentinean- Bolivian Doberman Pinscher. Delgado helps her escape the dog fights, unleashing the other dogs from their cages and unlocking the ring to allow both Chloe and himself to flee. After several arguments, he then decides to return her to Beverly Hills safely. Meanwhile, Rachel and Sam go to the Mexican police and offer rewards in an effort to find Chloe. El Diablo is sent by the dog fight ringleader, Vasquez, to capture Chloe and obtain the reward. The dogs reach the border by train, but they're caught when the conductor wanders back to the place they and the other dogs are hiding. They're forced to jump out, eventually arriving in the barren deserts of Chihuahua, where Delgado explains that he was a former police dog; he was retired after he lost his sense of smell during a raid and a sneak attack from El Diablo. Rachel and Sam are in Puerto Vallarta and find that Chloe was spotted in the state of Chihuahua. After tracking Chloe and Delgado from Mexico City, El Diablo arrives in Chihuahua and attempts to capture Chloe. Papi saves her and ends up getting captured in a cage inside an abandoned Aztec temple. Delgado comes to rescue the two and is briefly defeated. Chloe then rescues Papi, but Delgado discovers that El Diablo had vanished. Rachel finds Chloe, and Vasquez is arrested by the police.

Walter Addiego of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a positive review, writing, \\"the film combines the themes of dignity and empowerment'We are tiny, but we are mighty', says the leader of a vast Chihuahua packwith a story of a spoiled rich canine who learns not to be so high and mighty, the film hits all the typical Disney notes.

For many years it occupied the purpose- built Hannah Playhouse building. Former directors include Mervyn Thompson, and Colin McColl.  History  The Downstage Theatre Company was established in 1964 as a professional theatre company. The founders at the inaugural meeting in the Wellington Public Library on 15 May 1964 were actors Peter Bland, Tim Eliott and Martyn Sanderson, and restaurateur Harry Seresin. Sanderson believed in a small professional company in Wellington performing challenging works in an intimate venue. Seresin owned the Walkabout coffee bar on the corner of Courtenay Place and Cambridge Terrace in Wellington, and the upper floor of the Walkabout is where the first Downstage Theatre productions were performed. The first locally-written production, in 1966, was Father's Day a dark social comedy by Peter Bland starring Pat Evison as the eccentric mother with two pregnant daughters. In 1968 the company took over the whole upper storey of the Walkabout coffee bar building with a remodelling that was designed by B. Woods as the major project in his final year at the Wellington School of Design. It was a theatre restaurant, where people dined and saw a show in the same space. The Downstage Theatre Company continued to operate from the Walkabout coffee bar building until plans for a purpose built theatre building were finalised. They moved to the Star Boating Club building in the early 1970s while the Hannah Playhouse was being built. Raymond Boyce MBE, a leading theatre set and costume designer, was on the board of Downstage when the playhouse was built, Boyce became design consultant to the architects Ron Parker and James Beard, influencing the design of the flexible stage area and auditorium. The Hannah Playhouse (seating) approximately 250 people was completed in 1973. The first play in the new building was Shakespeare's As You Like It directed by Sunny Amey. Downstage published a quarterly magazine Act about theatre that included publishing play scripts. In 1973 Downstage supported the beginning of Playmarket, New Zealands agent for playwrights by allocating some staff time of Nonnita Rees plus office space. Act magazine continued with Playmarket picking it up in 1975 after Downstage decided they could no longer fund this activity. Downstage Theatre closed in 2013, citing a lack of adequate and stable funding.  Leadership  Founding artistic directors Martyn Sanderson, Tim Elliott, Peter Bland.
