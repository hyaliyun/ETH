He is suspected of being a member of the \\"Paxton Boys\\" ‚Äì a group of Scots-Irish militants who massacred the Conestoga Indians in 1763 ‚Äì and was a prominent commander on the Yankee (i.e. Connecticut) side in the Pennamite Wars. He met his death in battle with the Loyalists and Iroquois at the Wyoming Massacre, in an attack precipitated by his own rashness. Early life Stewart was born in Hanover, Lancaster (now Dauphin) County, Pennsylvania. He was well-educated for the time and place, and was raised as a farmer. Pontiac's War and massacre During the summer of 1763, Indian raids fell heavily upon the western settlements of Pennsylvania. \\"Carlisle was become the barrier not a single Individual beyond it.\\" In the crisis, the response of the State government was singularly dilatory. There had long been friction between the Presbyterian settlers of the frontier and the Quaker-dominated government, and the damage done by the Indians rankled. Colonel Rev. John Elder raised two companies of militia, known as the Paxton Boys, in Paxton Township, captained by Stewart and Asher Clayton. Several enclaves of Indians existed to the east of the frontier, among the Moravians near Bethlehem and elsewhere. The nearest of these were the Susquehannock tribe at Conestoga Town. To the north, such anger was directed by the settlers against the Moravian Indians, for their suspected part in abetting Indian raids, that the Moravians were sent to be kept in protective custody in Philadelphia. In Lancaster County, feelings were very much aroused against the Susquehannocks, the more so after the Moravians were protected by the Commonwealth ‚Äî whose authority the frontiersmen doubtless felt should be exerted for their protection against Indians and not vice versa. Col. Elder wrote to the government in September 1763, urging for the Susquehannocks to be removed to Philadelphia as well, but the proposal was declined. In December 1763, Matthew Smith, one of the Paxton Boys, took a small scouting party to Conestoga Town to investigate reports of a hostile Indian being sheltered there. The party returned with tales of dozens of strange Indians occupying the town, and began to assemble a more substantial force. Col. Elder heard of the expedition, and sent a written message dissuading it, to no effect. On the morning of December 14, 1763, just before dawn, fifty armed and mounted Paxton Boys descended upon Conestoga Town, killed the six Indians they found there, and burned the town. While the Susquehannocks were probably in communication with hostile Indians on the frontier, the results of the Rangers' attack are hardly consonant with their supposed justification of harboring numerous hostile Indians. Fourteen of the Susquehannocks had been elsewhere when the massacre occurred, and were removed to the workhouse in Lancaster for protection. Lazarus Stewart and Smith, asserting that one of those fourteen was known as a murderer, assembled the Paxton Boys again. Ignoring Col. Elder, who now remonstrated with them in person, they descended upon Lancaster on December 27, 1763 and broke into the workhouse. Matthew Smith later claimed that the intent of the raid had been to carry off the single murderous Indian, but the Paxton Boys, in short order, butchered the fourteen unfortunate Susquehannocks. These incidents became known as the Conestoga Massacre. The shocked government ordered the arrest of those who took part in the massacre, but to no avail. Even those who had opposed the massacres, such as Col. Elder (who was removed from his command and replaced by Maj. Asher Clayton), did not volunteer the names of the ringleaders to the government. The Paxton Boys capped their efforts with a march to Philadelphia (whence the remaining Indians in the state had been removed) in January 1764. While they obtained few concrete concessions, neither Stewart nor any of the other participants in the massacre were prosecuted for their deeds. Yankee-Pennamite War Stewart had no love for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and in January 1770, he led thirty-nine militiamen from Lancaster County to the Wyoming Valley. At the time, settlers from Connecticut were contesting the possession of the area with the Pennsylvanians, in a struggle that became the first of the Pennamite Wars. Captain Zebulon Butler was able to recruit Stewart and his men for the Connecticut, or Yankee, side, encouraging them with the promise of land in Hanover Township. Stewart's band, reinforced by ten Yankees, recaptured Fort Durkee from the Pennamites on February 12, 1770. One of his soldiers, Baltzer Stage or Stagard, was the first man to be killed in the conflict, when the Pennamites under Captain Ogden unsuccessfully attempted to retake the fort in March. On September 24, 1770, a surprise assault by the Pennamites retook Fort Durkee, but Stewart escaped and fled southward. He was arrested two weeks later in York, Pennsylvania, but escaped at night. He returned to Lancaster County and assembled twenty-five of the Paxton Boys, who retook Fort Durkee by ambush on December 18, 1770. On January 21, 1771, a Pennamite force led by Ogden returned to construct Fort Wyoming and besiege Fort Durkee, but their demand that Fort Durkee be surrendered was met with gunfire. There was one casualty, Ogden's brother Nathaniel. Fearing arrest for murder, and outnumbered by the Pennamites, Stewart and his troops slipped away in the night and fled to Connecticut. The victorious Pennamites destroyed Fort Durkee and took possession of the area. In July 1771, one hundred men under Captains Butler and Stewart returned to the Wyoming Valley to lay siege to Fort Wyoming. Captain Ogden slipped through the lines at night to raise a relief column in Philadelphia. The relief force was ambushed by the Yankees and lost their baggage and supplies. After a month-long siege, Fort Wyoming capitulated on August 15, 1771, and there would be peace in the Wyoming Valley for the next four years, in which Stewart and his militiamen could enjoy the cultivation of the lands granted them for their military services. He and his wife, Martha Espy raised a family of seven children here. The war resumed in August 1775, when a strong Pennsylvania force of seven hundred men under Colonel William Plunkett was dispatched to the area. They defeated the outnumbered Yankees in September, and drove out the settlers on the west bank of the Susquehanna River. Connecticut was able to raise four hundred men, under Zebulon Butler (now a colonel), and the confrontation took place at Christmas in conditions of heavy snow. Captain Stewart, with twenty men, ambushed the Pennsylvania column at Rampart Rocks on December 24, 1775 and caused them to flee back to their camp. The next day, he and his company attacked the Pennamites as they attempted to cross the river into Wilkes-Barre under cover of darkness, and broke up their attack. After an unsuccessful attack by the Pennamites on the Yankee positions at Rampart Rocks, Plunkett's column withdrew. By now, the attention of both parties was fixed upon a greater theater of war, the American Revolution. Revolutionary War In July 1778, a strong force of Loyalist troops and Iroquois under Colonel John Butler approached the Wyoming Valley. Colonel Zebulon Butler, home on leave from the Continental Army at the time, was chosen to lead the militia which assembled at Forty Fort. Colonel Butler favored delay, as reinforcements might be expected from Philadelphia and other local forts. However, Captain Stewart (who commanded the company of men from Hanover Township) and others argued that they should immediately attack and drive off the enemy before they could be besieged in Forty Fort. Their counsel carried the day, and the militia marched out on July 3, 1778. They encountered the Loyalist and Indian forces a few miles away. Getting into bad order as they attacked the Loyalists, an onset by the Iroquois panicked the militia as they attempted to dress their lines, and utterly routed them. Captain Stewart and his cousin, Lieutenant Lazarus Stewart, Jr. were both killed in the fight. The troops wounded and taken prisoner were tortured and killed in what became known as the Battle of Wyoming. After hearing of the defeat, Stewart's wife and children fled down the Susquehanna, and remained in Lancaster County until the close of the war.

Its slogan was \\"None shall starve or freeze\\". The drive was originally set up under the government of Heinrich Br√ºning in 1931, though Adolf Hitler would later claim sole credit.Michael Burleigh (2000). The Third Reich: A New History. New York City, New York: Hill and Wang, p. 223. It ran from 1933 to 1945 during the months of October through March and was designed to provide food, clothing, coal and other items to less fortunate Germans during the inclement months.  Background and foundation  As part of the centralization of Nazi Germany, posters urged people to donate, rather than give directly to beggars.Claudia Koonz (2003). The Nazi Conscience. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press. p. 71. . The Hitlerjugend and Bund Deutscher M√§del (boys' and girls' associations, respectively) were extremely active in collecting for this charity. As part of the effort to place the community over the individual, totals were not reported for any individuals, only what the branch raised.Richard Grunberger (1971). The 12-year Reich: A Social History of Nazi Germany, 1933-1945. p 79. .  Operation  A semi-postal stamp in aid of the 1943 Winterhilfswerk Certain weekends were assigned to all of the different Nazi associations, each with their own special Abzeichen, or badges, to pass out in exchange for a pfennig or two. The highly-collectible items were made of many different materials, such as wood, glass, paper, terra cotta, metal and plastic. Over 8,000 different pieces had been produced by the end of the war, and some of the rarer ones sell for quite a lot of money today. A collection tin from the Winterhilfswerk The Can Rattlers, as they became known, were relentless in their pursuit of making sure every good German citizen gave their share to the WHW. In fact, those who forgot to give had their names put in the paper to remind them of their neglect. Neighbors and even family members were encouraged to whisper the names of shirkers to their block leaders so that they could persuade them to do their duty. On one occasion, a civil servant was prosecuted for failure to donate, and his argument that it was voluntary was dismissed on the grounds it was an extreme view of liberty to neglect all duties that were not actually prescribed by law and therefore an abuse of liberty.Mark Mazower (1998). Dark Continent: Europe's 20th Century. p. 36. . It was not unheard of for workers to lose their jobs for not donating to Winterhilfe or not giving enough. For instance, when a worker was fired for not donating to Winterhilfe, the firing was upheld by a labour court on the grounds that it was \\"conduct hostile to the community of the people [...] to be most strongly condemned\\".William Shirer (1990). The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. Touchstone Edition. New York City, New York: Simon & Schuster. Large donations were also a means to establish oneself as a loyal supporter of the Nazi Party without the commitment of joining it.Milton Mayer (1995). They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-45. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press. p. 90. A greatly encouraged practice was once a month to have a one-pot meal (eintopf), reducing all the food to one course and the money thus saved was to be donated. During autumn and winter months from 1933 onward, the Eintopfsonntag (One-Pot Sunday or Stew Sunday) was officially scheduled by the WHW. Restaurants were required to offer an eintopf meal at one of several price points. Households were reminded of the occasion, although it has been noted that the authorities did not investigate whether the one-pot meal was actually served. Collection drives were a mainstay of the Winter Relief and those who did not give, or gave little (such as one pair of boots to a clothing drive), were sometimes the victims of mob violence and needed to be protected by the police.Richard Grunberger (1971). The 12-year Reich: A Social History of Nazi Germany, 1933-1945. p 79‚Äì80. . Similar initiatives were started in countries in German-occupied Europe, known in French as the Secours d'Hiver in Belgium\\"Seconde Guerre mondiale : les archives du Secours d‚ÄôHiver ouvertes √† la recherche\\" (in French). and in Dutch as the Winterhulp Nederland and Winterhulp Belgi√´.

Some depicting occupational types or geographic areas of the Reich, others animals, birds and insects, nursery rhyme and fairy tale characters, or notable persons from German history (including Hitler himself). They were made from a variety of materials. Each individual miniature book, badge, badge set or toy set was only available for two or three days of a particular collection drive. The populace would be encouraged to donate the following week and thereby collect the latest in the series. There could also be consequences such as nagging by the appropriate official if your local Blockleiter saw that you were not wearing the current, appropriate pin by about Tuesday of the week.

Stoddard described visits to a Winterhilfswerk facility where he was shown winter clothing and other items meant for distribution. Few others describe the charitable work of the WHW and the historical record contains many details on the collection of money and goods, but little about what was done with either. William Russell's book Berlin Embassy surmises that the entire program was a sham and that all proceeds were used to produce armaments. The 1933‚Äì1945 collection drives issued a large number of themed ceramic medallions and other badges given to donators.Collections: * Rainer Baumann (1973).

The mountain is typical of the region in that geologically it is made up of a mixture of sandstone and quartzite, it has a steep flanks and is rock-strewn. The dome shaped summit is littered with red sandstone boulders and lacking in vegetation making its translated name of ‚ÄúBald Red Head‚Äù especially appropriate. The mountain is not to be confused with Maol Chinn-dearg, another Munro on the south Glen Shiel ridge. Ascent Maol Cheann-dearg is one of the few Scottish hills which is encircled by good stalkers paths, being located on the Beinn Damh deer estate, these paths can be utilised to do an attractive circuit of the mountain to examine the sandstone cliffs and the picturesque lochs of Loch an Eion, Loch Coire an Ruadh-staic and Loch Coire Fionnaraich which surround the mountain and are frequented by some interesting wild birds. For strong walkers the mountain can be ascended with the neighbouring Corbett of An Ruadh-stac (892 metres) which lies two kilometres to the south. Although it is possible to start from Annat at the head of Upper Loch Torridon, Maol Cheann-dearg is usually ascended from Coulags on the A890 road in Glen Carron where it is possible to park in a disused gravel pit. The valley of the Fionn-amhainn is followed northerly passing the MBA bothy at Coire Fionnaraich, a fine shelter with a lone ash tree outside the front door. 500 metres further on a curious upstanding stone is encountered, this is the Clach nan Con-fionn (The Stone of Fingal‚Äôs Dog) where the legendary Fionn mac Cumhaill reputedly tethered his hounds while hunting. Another 500 metres further on a path leaves the valley and goes west to the top of the Bealach a' Choire Ghairbh from where the south east ridge can be followed over broken quartzite and awkward boulders to reach the summit.

Taking place in the future where seven races have colonized and destroyed multiple planets due to their actions, the leaders of each race send their best pilots into an inclosed region of space called BattleSphere to either gain privilege of occupy the remaining habitable stars or return to their original dying planets. Originally conceived in 1993 before the Jaguar was officially released to the market, BattleSphere is heavily influenced by multiple science fiction works and video games, most notably Star Raiders. Initially released in 2000, a second version of the game was released in 2002 under the title BattleSphere Gold, which added new features and improvements compared to the original version and in 2006 a third, one-of- a-kind version titled BattleSphere Trio was auctioned on eBay and has additional features not available on the Gold version. The first copy of the original version was sold on eBay for over US$1500, with the auction proceeds going to diabetes research, while all after-tax profits from subsequently sold copies of every version of the title were invested into diabetes charity. Despite being published after the platform was discontinued by Atari Corporation in 1996 and being declared as open platform by Hasbro Interactive one year prior to release, BattleSphere received positive reception from reviewers when it launched with praise towards the graphics, music, gameplay, replay value and multiplayer modes, with several publications such as GameFan, Next Generation and Retro Gamer referring it as one of the best games released for the Jaguar. Plans of porting the game to other systems were in consideration but none ever entered into development after several unsuccessful attempts to various publishers.  Gameplay  HUD displays several elements such as score, number of kiils, front and aft (back) radars, velocity and thrust meters, reticle, shield and laser energy meters, current weapon selected and integrity of the hull. When playing, types of ship can be identified by their icon along with their appointed identification number and this is also applied during multiplayer. BattleSphere is a first-person shooter with space combat simulation elements similar to its main inspiration, Star Raiders, where players assume the role of a pilot representing either of the seven alien races in a fight against each other for the right to control and colonize the galaxy. Every race has three types of ships that players can take control of, each one with their own advantages and weakness. When playing on a single console, the game features four selectable gameplay modes, each one with their own ruleset but players can configurate and adjust options such as the difficulty level of the enemy AI, respawning time, number and types of ships to fight against and more depending on the chosen mode. The network mode features three game modes, with one of the two being only exclusive to this mode and supports up to 16 consoles, each with a pilot and an optional gunner for a potential total of 32 players but the claimed network capability has not been tested, due to the release of the game after Atari Corp. merged with JT Storage in a reverse takeover and the discontinuation of the Jaguar in 1996. The game has 21 ships to choose from, but two other alien races that has their own set of ships, can only be unlocked with cheat codes for a total of 27 ships and each released version of the game features secrets and hidden modes that are also accessed with the same process. Progress, high-score and other settings done by the player are saved automatically via the cartridge's EEPROM. The game also features support for the ProController. During gameplay and similarly to Descent, players are given full control of their ship in a three-dimensional environment featuring six degrees of freedom on zero gravity, with battles taking place in real-time. Throttle is executed by either holding C and pushing up or down, while pressing 1, 4, 7, or * on the controller's keypad also gives the same result, but holding only C allows the ship to either spin to the left or right. Radar lock-on is done by pressing A and the ship's two radars will keep track of the chosen target until is destroyed and the same process can be done by pressing 3, 6, or 9 on the keypad as well. If either the player or enemy craft is destroyed, their debris can damage or potentially destroy any ship caught in the explosion range. In some cases when a ship is destroyed, the pilot is ejected from the seat and while still capable of fighting against enemy ships, can only withstand one hit before being killed and after being destroyed/killed, players have to wait a set period of time in order to respawn on the playfield. The main weapon on each ship are lasers that can be fired multiple times by pressing B or set their firing function by pressing 2 on the keypad, while other weapons can be toggled by pressing 5 or 8 depending on the type of ship chosen. Every ship also has a MAW sensor, emitting a beeping sound if enemy missiles are approaching.  Modes  There are five game modes to be found in the game: Alone Against the Empire is an exclusive mode to Single Console inspired by Star Raiders, where players has to command allied spacecrafts and protect their starbases in a set of 64 hexagonal quadrant sectors from attacks by an armada of enemy fighters, bombers, superships and obliterate enemy starbases in higher difficulties. In this mode, the 0 and # buttons on the keypad are used for repairing the ship and jump into hyperspace respectively. Gauntlet is an endless mode similar in structure to Missile Command, where the main objective is to defend six starbases in a single sector from a wave of enemies trying to destroy them with each wave increasing in difficulty. Free-For-All is an arcade-style deathmatch mode in vein of Doom and Quake, where players attempts to destroy a set number of starships in order to either reach a fixed number of kills or high score. Pilot Training is a practice mode recommended for beginners and it is a series of 20 training missions in order to be familiarized with the controls and the type of enemies in the game but increases in complexity as players move forward. Battle Sphere is a capture the flag mode exclusive to Network Mode similar to Netrek, where two opposing teams divided across eight consoles attempt to capture or destroy each other's starbases. In addition, there is also a Demo Mode for demonstration purposes.  Plot  In the future, seven alien races have colonized planets as a necessity rather than choice after exploiting and polluting their original home planets, with war erupting when any of the races meet each other and as result, habitable planets became increasingly rare. Panic between each leader of the seven races led to the decision of confining the hostilities of each other into a small and closed region in space called Sector 51, also known as Battle Sphere, where the seven races send their best pilots to fight in order to claim the right of colonizing planets freely or being confined to their original dying homeworld.  Races  ; O'Catanut : A feline race that keeps track of the Slith, with rumors of an alliance existing between them that has been suspended for the sake of the event. Their ships focuses on stealth and speed, with one of them resembling the Starfury fighter used by EarthForce, the military branch of the Earth Alliance in Babylon 5 while another is named after the cat from one of the developers. ; Oppressors : They resemble the concept of demons by the human race and previously controlled most of the galaxy. Most of their ships are designed to reflect that they are an all-male race, with one particular ship bearing resemblance to sperm. ; Se'Bab : An all-female race that were previously slaves of the Oppressors until the sudden arrival of the Telchines race 50 years ago weakened their hold, as a result, their extreme xenophobia against the other races translates into extremely aggressive and suicidal battle tactics. Some of their ships are named to symbolize their hatred against the Oppressors. ; Slith : Lizard-like beings and rumored allies of the O'Catanut race, whose ships appear to be alive as some of them are named and based on reptiles, though one of them resembles the Colonial Viper from Battlestar Galactica physically. ; Smg'Heed : Last surviving descendants of the human race, who were almost wiped out by a scourge of retroviruses and accumulated debt from placing their entire GPP in creating extremely powerful weaponry. As such, all of their fighter crafts are based on previously existing technology from the 20th century. ; Telchines : A mysterious race who appeared 50 years ago and are presumed to originate from a neighboring galaxy. The name of their ships always starts with \\"tri\\" as the first three letters. ; Thunderbirds : They are hawk-like predators and rivals of both the O'Catanut and Slith races, blending both speed and firepower into their spacecrafts. Their ships are named after birds with one named after the claw of a Bird of prey.  Production   Background  BattleSphere was originally pitched under the name Singularity to Bill Rehbock, then vice- president in third-party development at Atari Corporation, after Scott Le Grand and Douglas Engel were invited to play some of the first titles for the then-upcoming Atari Jaguar at Glendale, California on September 23, 1993 with Scott suggesting to Bill if they could rename the project to Star Raiders 2000 but he told them that the name was already taken. In October of the same year, Scott and Douglas reached Tom Harker at GEnie, who was looking for programmers to write titles for the upcoming system, to act as an intermediary between them and Atari Corp. Scott convinced his then-fiance Stephanie Wukovitz to compose music for the game and as result, 4Play was formed as a partnership group. 4Play renamed Singularity to Star Battle, in honor of a mainframe computer game Scott wrote during his high school period in the 1980s.  Development  BattleSphere was conceived in 1993 before the Atari Jaguar was officially released to the market, but it was not published until 2000, four years after the system was discontinued in 1996 and one year after being declared as an open platform. Development of the game was being handled during the team's leisure, in addition to their full-time jobs and without financial support, estimating that the project would be completed in between 12 and 18 months but encountered several issues along the way, such as the lack of development support from Atari themselves. Star Battle was first showcased to the public at SCES '94 in a non-playable state, with the team originally targeting to release it during Christmas 1994. It was then showcased six months later at WCES '95 in a semi-playable state, under its final name BattleSphere. The game made its last trade show appearance at E3 1995, where 4Play demonstrated the network mode working alongside ICD's CatBox to positive reception, however, it barely made its appearance on the showfloor due to a hardware bug that involved a last-minute rewrite. The game was then slated for a Q2 1995 release and later for a September 1995 release. From July to September of the same year after being showcased at E3 1995, 4Play went full- time on the development of BattleSphere and at one point, Atari requested a working demo of the game for a focus group session in order to be put in comparison with another upcoming game for the Jaguar, Space War 2000, with Atari shelving the latter in favor of the former after the results from the session. In October of the same year, Atari also requested the team a working network code to be implemented into Iron Soldier 2 for multiplayer, however, this feature was shelved in the final version of the game. It was last previewed by both GamePro and ST Format in 1996. Although 4Play began working on the game modes, Atari folded in January 1996 and the Jaguar was also discontinued, in addition to merging with JT Storage on April 8 of the same year and filing a 10-K405 SEC Form four days later. Even after this event, BattleSphere continued to be developed and was showcased to the public for the first time since 1995 at JagFest '97, a small festival dedicated to the system in Chicago, and in October 1997 the last single-player gameplay mode was implemented into the game. A group of volunteers tested the game on their free time and as such, BattleSphere was finished in July 1998, almost five years after its conception and was showcased once more at both JagFest '98 in Corfu, New York and World Of Atari in Las Vegas in August of the same year. Though development on the game was completed, 4Play encountered several issues in releasing it with both JT Storage and later Hasbro Interactive, who purchased the remaining brands and other intellectual property rights of Atari Corporation from JT Storage before their bankruptcy in 1999. On May 14, 1999 Hasbro Interactive declared the Atari Jaguar as an open platform and released all the rights to the console into public domain, allowing BattleSphere to be encrypted and released on February 29, 2000, two years after the game was completed. Prior to release, composer Stephanie Wukovitz was interviewed in a 1999 episode of Computer Chronicles, with the game being showcased in the background. It was also briefly mentioned in a special feature article dedicated to the system by German magazine Video Games.  Influences and references  BattleSphere is influenced by various video games besides Star Raiders such as Doom, Iron Soldier, Netrek, Quake and Star Wars: TIE Fighter. It is also influenced by many science fiction works such as Babylon 5 and Star Trek, with the latter being one of the main sources for the storyline found in the game. In addition, it also features references from other science fiction- based works such as Futurama, The Last Starfighter,, Red Dwarf, among others.  Technical information  BattleSphere features two-dimensional bitmaps for static images, in addition of using a proprietary polygon rendering engine written by both Scott Le Grand and Douglas Engel, displaying between 10,000-15,000 polygons on-screen alongside its own networking code supporting up to 16 players. The game also uses a graphical technique created by 4Play dubbed \\"Decal-Mapping\\" for all the gouraud shaded 3D models consisting of 256 polygons each one, in addition of featuring very minimal texture mapping dedicated to the alien races' symbols and identification numbers for multiplayer. It also runs at 60 frames per second, though performance can vary depending on the number of objects displayed on-screen. The game uses a proprietary audio engine featuring six stereo channels for sound effects and four mono channels that are used for in-game music. All of the game's graphics and sound were created on the Atari Falcon. BattleSphere also makes full use of the processors found within the Jaguar for various tasks such as handling of the game's enemy AI and physics engine, with Scott stating that the game was made possible due to the system's multi-chip architecture.  Release  BattleSphere was first released on February 29, 2000. The first copy of the original version was sold for US$1500 in eBay, with the auction proceeds going to diabetes research. Although the original release and subsequent versions of the game did not originally came bundled with a keypad overlay, they were later produced and released with permission from both co-programmers of the title by community members Gaztee and rubixcube6 at AtariAge forums. Profits from the original and every subsequent version released were invested into charity for diabetes research.  BattleSphere Gold  A second version of the game, titled BattleSphere Gold, was first released on March 15, 2002. This release came in a transparent cartridge, featuring several updates and additions not found within the original version such as new animations, a reworked menu screen system, bug fixes and more, in addition to containing the JUGS (Jaguar Unmodified Game Server) to aid in homebrew development for the system.  BattleSphere Trio On June 9, 2006, a third one-of-a-kind version titled BattleSphere Trio was auctioned on eBay, featuring all the previously released content from BattleSphere Gold. Reception Before being officially released to the public, Christian Svensson of Next Generation praised the graphics, music, gameplay, controls and multiplayer, stating that \\"in the end, the wait was worth it. It's too bad that the game will not receive the large audience it deserves.\\" After it was released long after the system was discontinued, no contemporary reviews of BattleSphere were realized with the exception of a brief article by Eric C. Mylonas from GameFan, who pointed the graphics, modes, gameplay and network play as the game's strong points. However, online publications have rated the game positively. Gregory D. George of The Atari Times rated the game positively and praised the graphics, music, sound effects, gameplay and replay value while criticizing the menu and ship selection screens for being hard to read, but he states that \\"it's a fabulous game and one of the Jaguar's Top 5. I'd even go so far as to say it's one of the Top 20 games of all time.\\" German website neXGam also gave a positive review to the title.  Legacy  4Play had plans to port BattleSphere into other systems such as the PlayStation and PC if any publisher was interested in backing the project but the idea never happened after several unsuccessful pitches to multiple companies. Scott Le Grand, who later became an employee at VM Labs, also pitched a port of the game to the Nuon but the proposal was rejected.

It concerned land use planning, and was voted down by 59% in the 2006 elections.2006 General Election Results The controversial initiative pitted the interests of real estate developers against environmental protection and preservation of natural resources.Seattle Times July 7 2006 The initiative is also known as I-933, titled \\"Property Rights\\" by the Secretary of State, \\"The Property Fairness Initiative\\" by its supporters, and the \\"Developers Initiative\\" by its opponents. Content of the proposal I-933 called for government agencies in the State of Washington to evaluate the effects directly on private real and personal property when implementing regulations or ordinances. It called for these government agencies to follow certain policies: either pay compensation when \\"damaging\\" property, to consider \\"less restrictive means,\\" or to waive the implementation of the regulation.Full text of Ballot Initiative 933 (.pdf) Cost According to a study conducted by the University of Washington The impacts of proposed Initiative 933 on real property and land use in Washington State the initiative would have cost taxpayers an estimated $7.8 Billion during the first five years after enactment. The same study also found that \\"Virtually every county would likely be faced with claims, yet none have a tax revenue source in place for paying them.\\" Other effects I-933 would have impacted critical areas that are protected to prevent flooding and protect fish, wildlife and groundwater. Though it was described as establishing a \\"pay or waive\\" system, I-933 did not have the power to permit waivers in most relevant cases. This would have resulted in a \\"stymied decision\\" and uncertainty for both landowners and local governments, with the result of slowing down development permits. I-933 would likely have led to a greater role for federal government in the region. The initiative would have had implications not only for real estate, but on intellectual property rights, water rights, motor vehicles, securities and intangible commercial assets. People and organizations involved Supporters Supporters of I-933 argued that the proposal would have protected private property owners from \\"excessive land-use regulations or proposed regulations that damage the use and value of private property.\\" Property for Sale A significant portion of the financial support for the campaign came from Americans for Limited Government, a libertarian-oriented group based in Illinois. Other supporters of the measure included: *Bainbridge Citizens United *Spokane Pro-America *Washington Cattleman's Association *Washington Contract Loggers Association *Farm Bureaus from Washington State Opponents Opponents of the initiative questioned why taxpayers should have \\"to pay some land owners to follow laws already on the books or waive those protections for the community\\".www.noon933.org [2] I-933 required taxpayers to pay legal fees for all claims, including retroactive claims. Opponents of the proposal also pointed out that the Washington Farm Bureau represents primarily large corporations and has an established record of supporting Republican candidates with PAC money.Washington State Farm Bureau The Voice of Family Farms The Association of Washington Cities argued the Initiative would have cost taxpayers 4.5 billion dollars a year in claims against municipalities. Environmentalists claimed \\"Initiative 933 would dismantle ... (environmental) protections, making it extremely difficult to enforce the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.\\" Moreover, I-933 allocated no funding for the payments it required, raising fears that taxes would have been increased and/or that funding to key infrastructural programs would have been cut. Lobbyists in favor of the bill dismissed these accusations as scare tactics.http://www.seattlepi.com/local284357_property08.html On October 10, 2006, all six of Washington's living former governors joined current Gov.

From December 30, 1845 to January 2, 1846 he served as interim president of Mexico. He was the President of the Chamber of Deputies in 1843. Valencia joined the Spanish colonial army before Mexican independence, but transferred his allegiance to the Mexican army in 1821. He made friends in the military and government, becoming a power in Mexican politics. He forged an uneasy alliance with Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, a powerful figure repeatedly in and out of the presidency during this period. The Plan de la Ciudadela, 1841 In 1840 and 1841 there were several related rebellions against Anastasio Bustamante, then in his third period as president of Mexico. Bustamante was an adherent of the centralist party. On July 15, 1840, soldiers led by rebellious General Jos√© Urrea and Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as took the presidential palace and captured President Bustamante, later releasing him. The chief of the general staff, General Gabriel Valencia, helped subdue the revolt. Shortly thereafter, Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga rose against Bustamante in Guadalajara, Juan N. √Ålvarez in the south, and L√≥pez de Santa Anna in Perote, Veracruz. This time, on September 4, 1841, Valencia joined the rebellion by publishing the Plan de la Ciudadela. The situation was now serious for Bustamante, himself a general. He took the field to fight the rebels, but was defeated. Bustamante went into exile in Europe for a second time (in Italy). The generals arrayed against him then reached a political agreement proclaimed as the Plan de Tacubaya. This plan proclaimed the presidency vacant and named a provisional president to call elections for a constituent congress. This provisional president was, once again, L√≥pez de Santa Anna. This was his sixth term as president. Overthrow of President Herrera, 1845 After several other changes in the office of president (including two more intervals by Santa Anna), Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Herrera became interim president on December 17, 1844. He became constitutional president on September 16, 1845. Two days before, General Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga again revolted, in opposition to Herrera. In December 1845 Herrera announced he was setting out at the head of an expedition to repel North American invaders, who had reached Saltillo. General Paredes used this opportunity to seize power. On December 30, 1845, General Valencia, now in charge of the garrison of Mexico City, announced his support for Paredes. Out of options, Herrera turned power over to Valencia. As interim president of Mexico By operation of law, Gabriel Valencia, as chairman of the Governing Council is who should assume the presidency following the resignation of President Jose Joaquin de Herrera. This was a temporary appointment, meant only to serve the transfer of power. A junta, led by the archbishop of Mexico City, Manuel Posada, was convoked. On January 2, 1846 this junta elected General Paredes interim president. Valencia's term had lasted three days.https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/humberto_2000_mx/BHMI16.htm&date;=2009-10-26+00:16:11 Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War In 1847 General Valencia was among the Mexican forces opposing General Winfield Scott's advance from Veracruz to Mexico City in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. On August 19, 1847, Scott's forces attacked those of Valencia in the town of Contreras, near Mexico City. Because of rivalry between Valencia and L√≥pez de Santa Anna, Valencia had advanced beyond his assigned position. Santa Anna could not send reinforcements. The Mexicans were badly defeated on August 20. The remnants of Valencia's forces fell back to Churubusco, joining Santa Anna's forces there. Scott continued his advance, and the Mexicans were defeated again at Chapultepec (September 13), leaving the way open to Mexico City, that finally was occupied on September 16.

She traveled west in the early 1880s to teach school in Ojai, California; her letters about the trip were later published in the California Historical Quarterly (1937‚Äì1938). She was a Protestant Christian missionary in Northern China and belonged to the so-called \\"missionary generation\\" of Americans born between the years 1860 - 1885. Early years and children To honor the example of a beloved cousin who had died in mission work in China, Anna Seward decided to travel there as a Presbyterian missionary and settled in Huang Xian, Shandong province in North China, where she met Cicero Washington Pruitt. They married on February 16, 1888, and had five children: Ida (1888‚Äì1985), John (1890‚Äì1912), Ashley (1892‚Äì1898), Virginia (died in infancy, 1894), Robert (1897‚Äì1961), and Dudley McConnell \\"Mac\\" (1902‚Äì1967). The death of Ashley and Virginia inspired Southern Baptists to send money to start a hospital in Huang Xian. The famous missionary Lottie Moon apparently babysat the children on some occasions. Ida was one of the few Westerners that remained influential in Chinese Aid and Development throughout much of the century even after the communist take over. While stationed in Huangxian, the children attended school at the Chefoo School operated by the China Inland Mission. Anna Seward began a missionary school for boys, and by 1904 C.W. Pruitt had organized the Baptist Theological Seminary for Central China. Writings and later years Anna wrote two books about missionary life in China: The Day of Small Things (Foreign Mission Board, Southern Baptist Convention, 1929) and Up from Zero: In North China (Broadman Press, 1939). She also wrote two children's books set in China: The Chinese Boat Baby (Rice Press, 1938) and Whirligigs in China: Stories for Juniors (Broadman, 1948). After C.W. retired in 1936, they returned to the United States and settled in Atlanta where he became the dean of the Baptist Foreign Missions of North America. Anna spent the last years of her life traveling and lecturing on China and mission work. Anna Seward died on June 20, 1948. Most of this article is taken from the Radcliffe Finding Aid.

Wolverley is a village; with nearby Cookley (1 mi northeast), it forms a civil parish in the Wyre Forest District of Worcestershire, England. It is 2 mi north of Kidderminster and lies on the River Stour and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. At the time of the 2001 census, it had a population of 2,096. Notable features There are 13 Listed Buildings within Wolverley, three of which are grade II*. One of the unusual features of the area are rooms cut into the sandstone cliffs behind some of the houses. In the centre of the village, next to the Queen's Head Public House car-park are some caves which reflect this usage. Wolverley has one of the few remaining animal pounds in the area. St. John's Church Woverley's Church of England and parish church is dedicated to St. John. It is claimed as a tradition that there has been a church or chapel on the site since Anglo-Saxon times. The first documented evidence of a church was the mention of a parish priest in the village in the Domesday Book (1086). A church on the site of the current parish church site has been in deanery of Kidderminster since the 13th Century. The current building was consecrated on 20 September 1772, and belongs to the Church of England. History Wolverley was recorded in the Doomsday Book (1086) under an ancient spelling of Ulwardelie. John Atte Wode is recorded as holding land at Wolverley prior to 1357.Driver, J. T. Worcestershire Knights of the Shire 1377‚Äì1421 Transactions of the Worcestershire Archaeological Society.

William Sebright Wolverley was the birthplace of William Sebright, who as a Town Clerk of London accumulated an estate in Bethnal Green, which he left in his will of 1620 for the foundation of a grammar school in Wolverley.\\"Bethnal Green: Estates\\", in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11, Stepney, Bethnal Green, ed. T F T Baker (London, 1998), pp. 155-168. [accessed 15 July 2020] The site of the original Wolverley Grammar School is still in the centre of the village: the grammar school changed its name to Sebright School in 1931 when it moved to a new site. The new school was opened by Bewdley-born Stanley Baldwin.\\"Arrangements for to-day\\", The Times, London, 10 October 1931, p. 15. Between 1948 and 1970 Sebright was a public school, and from 1965 to 1969 the sculptor Fritz Steller was the Head of Art. Sebright School closed in 1970\\"School to close\\", The Times, London, 21 February 1970, p. 3. and reopened as Wolverley High School, now called Wolverley C E Secondary School, a state run secondary school. However, the junior wing, Heathfield Knoll School, continued in existence and now includes pupils up to 16. Over the years the endowment left by William Sebright has grown to millions of pounds, and the original scope of the educational foundation he set up has been broadened to include grants to local schools, and to former pupils of those schools. Tinplate Industry Wolverley Lower Mill, which was established in 1670 by Philip Foley and Joshua Newborough, helped the village play a key role in the early tinplate industry. Baskerville the printer The village was also the birthplace of John Baskerville, the celebrated printer (1706‚Äì1775).

The band has been Bates‚Äôs main musical outlet since 1990 and has performed on most of his albums. Human Chain has toured in Europe, North America, South America, Japan, China, and India and has also worked in the classical orchestral world for concerts in the UK, Finland, Germany, and Greece (classical music collaborators have included Joanna MacGregor, Britten Sinfonia, London Sinfonietta, and the Duisberger Philharmonic). The band has also sometimes been involved in theatre work. History Origins In 1981, three years into the start of his career, Bates began creating a band called Humans. He would continue with the band in parallel to his larger scale work with the big band Loose Tubes, and both bands would share personnel. By 1983, the band name had morphed into Human Chain, a tribute to the number of musicians who had passed through the band. At this point the list of past members was drummer Dave Trigwell, trumpeter John Eacott, saxophonist Mark Lockheart, double bassists Mick Hutton and Steve Berry, flute player Eddie Parker and guitarist John Parricelli). Bates has also commented \\"I also liked the political implications of the name 'Human Chain': these were the Thatcher years and all kinds of people were forming human chains in order to demonstrate peacefully.\\" Early albums and varying lineups (1986-1990) By 1986, the project consisted of Bates plus drummer Steve Arguelles. It was this lineup which recorded the band‚Äôs debut album, Human Chain which Bates would later describe as \\"fifteen folky miniatures.\\" For 1988‚Äôs Cashin‚Äô In album, multi-instrumentalist Stuart Hall (musician) joined the lineup, expanding the group‚Äôs instrumentation and sonic potential. Bates remembers that \\"during performances in this trio formation, Stuart Hall would often make three instrument changes per tune, sometimes playing steel pan and piccolo flute simultaneously whilst unplugging a violin with his foot.\\" Over the next three years, the lineup continued to alter. Arguelles and Hall both left, saxophonist Steve Buckley arrived and the band also gained a permanent drummer, Martin France . At one point the band featured two bass players, Steve Watts and Tim Harries. Bates admits \\"Neither of them knew why they were both there. I didn't know either; I was still trying to find a band that could be really powerful without being macho, and could be really experimental without being bollocks.\\" Following the collapse of Loose Tubes in October 1990, Bates set up Delightful Precipice to handle his large ensemble music and \\"set about sorting out Human Chain.\\" Stabilising the lineup (1991-1992) With Steve Watts having already departed, Tim Harries left Human Chain in September 1991 to join Steeleye Span. This left the remaining members (Bates, Buckley and France) without a bass player just before the start of a Human Chain tour of South America. Rather than use another of his Loose Tubes colleagues, Bates opted to audition another bass guitarist - Michael Mondesir, brother of Jazz Warriors drummer Mark Mondesir and a collaborator with up-and- coming British pianist Jason Rebello. Bates recalls: \\"I drove to Lewisham to hear him playing with (Rebello). It was a really funky band and gave no clues as to what Michael would do to Human Chain's music. By the end of our tour, I knew... and I was very happy! Michael has an infectious fascination with all things rhythmic: he chewed through pieces like ‚ÄúThree Architects Called Gabrielle... Just What I Expected‚Äù with an extreme verve and assurance that forced the whole band to perform at a new level of energy.\\" Mondesir has remained Bates‚Äôs bass player of choice ever since (and also plays with Delightful Precipice). The Bates-Buckley-Mondesir-France lineup of Human Chain toured Chile, Colombia and Argentina in autumn 1991. They subsequently recorded two pieces (\\"Three Architects Called Gabrielle\\" and \\"Up, Up\\") for a sampler CD called Pyrotechnics. All of the musicians featuring on this album were promised a deal with Blue Note Records. For Human Chain, this deal never arrived. By 1992 Buckley had been replaced by Bates‚Äôs usual saxophone foil, Iain Ballamy, and the long-term quartet was complete. The band played at a number of festivals in Europe including the Belfast International Festival, the Delta International Jazz Festival in the Hague in the Netherlands and the Outside In International Contemporary Music Festival in Crawley, UK. Despite the band having achieved a steady and stable lineup, there would not be another Human Chain record. Instead, they would become Bates‚Äôs most frequent musical outlet both live and on record, releasing all of their recorded output under Bates‚Äôs name. Work as Bates‚Äôs main band (1991-1998) Throughout the 1990s, Human Chain would be the band Bates most frequently played and toured with. In 1993, Human Chain were the central performers on Bates‚Äôs second album Summer Fruits (And Unrest), playing four tracks as themselves and the remaining seven as the core of Delightful Precipice. Also in 1993, Human Chain became involved in the innovative music-theatre piece 'Out There', conceived and directed by Campbell Graham and written by Simon Black with music by Bates. 'Out There' toured on various dates between 1993 and 1995, performing at The Place, Riverside Studios, Manchester Royal Exchange, Tron Theatre, Glasgow International Jazz Festival. Working with a cast including Jason Flemyng, Human Chain provided the live music for the piece and also took on individual acting roles, most notably Bates playing \\"God\\" and Iain Ballamy playing \\"Steve the Prat\\". In 1995, Human Chain were again the main performers on Bates‚Äôs fourth album Winter Truce (And Homes Blaze), this time playing five tracks as themselves and five within Delightful Precipice. In 1996, Human Chain performed on Bates‚Äôs fifth album, the classical/Third Stream-inspired and predominantly orchestral Good Evening... Here Is The News. Human Chain played on four tracks accompanying the London Sinfonietta and also performed one track by themselves (the bizarre \\"City In Euphoria/World In Chaos\\") In 1998, Bates released his sixth album Like Life, which was connected to his winning of the 1997 Jazzpar Award and featured several new pieces plus revisitations of his back catalogue of compositions. Although most of the album was performed by Bates with the Danish Radio Jazz Orchestra, the other three Human Chain members also contributed as part of an altered lineup of Delightful Precipice. Quiet Nights (1998-circa 2000) In 1998, Bates set up a new Anglo-Swedish band called Quiet Nights, which consisted of the four members of Human Chain plus Swedish jazz singer Josefine Cronsholm. This band was to cover an area of jazz which Bates had previously shunned or mocked ‚Äì songs which had become jazz standards. Bates had anticipated this new project with his infamous 1995 subversion of \\"New York, New York\\" (performed by Delightful Precipice and sung by Irish singer Christine Tobin). The Quiet Nights band was to approach the same territory and continue to subvert the original songs, but generally with a much more down-tempo and peaceful approach. In a 2008 interview with All About Jazz, Bates commented on his conversion to this kind of music as follows: > \\"Back in the early 1990s I did a couple of records with a Norwegian singer, > Sidsel Endresen. Doing them opened my ears to the possibilities of using a > singer and words. It was almost like having an actor on stage, telling a > story, rather than a singer in the traditional sense. Previously, I'd been > put off the idea of jazz and singing together because there was certain > style of doing that ‚Äî very over the top, lots of vibrato ‚Äîwhile I prefer > something quite different, more natural. Then a few years later, when I did > the Jazzpar, and they asked me to put together a contrasting project, the > first thing I saw when I went to gigs in Copenhagen was a student jam > session. There was this girl who just sang a standard beautifully and then > sat down‚Äîand all these males improvised for about an hour, all taking turns > to solo kind of competitively, while she sat there quietly, like in a > trance. Then when they finished she just got up and sang the song again. > Something about that amused me and I was impressed by it. After that, I got > more interested in having the power of the human voice in my music. Because > people had always said, \\"Yeah, I like your stuff, but it's kind of > complicated, anybody who isn't a musician isn't going to be able to bear to > listen to it.\\" Maybe I'm exaggerating, but I got the impression that what I > did was perceived as being quite muso orientated, and I found that a singer > opened it out to more people.\\" Their recordings of these songs made up the seventh Django Bates album, released in 1998 and also called Quiet Nights. It featured reinventions of songs including \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\", \\"Solitude\\" and \\"Hi-Li-Ho\\". Quiet Nights would continue to tour and perform during the remainder of the 1990s, although Cronsholm left after the first tour to start a family. She was replaced by another Swedish jazz singer, Josefine Lindstrand, about whom Bates has commented \\"She's a quite different singer to Josefine Cronholm, more lively and right on the beat compared to the very relaxed thing we'd done on Quiet Nights with standards and ballads.\\" At an unspecified point during this time, Bates claims that Human Chain \\"ate\\" Quiet Nights. This appears to mean that the Quiet Nights project was reabsorbed into Human Chain activity with Lindstrand becoming a fifth member of the band, although it's not entirely clear whether she is a full member or a longstanding guest collaborator. Human Chain in the 21st century From around 2000 onwards, Bates‚Äô recorded output and live performances became rarer as he adapted to a shrinking British jazz scene. He began to concentrate more on composition, including large-scale commissions for classical performers and ensembles. However, Human Chain remained Bates's main performance band, and appeared alongside The Smith Quartet at the Venice Biennale in 2003. Human Chain was once again the core band on Bates‚Äôs eighth album You Live And Learn (Apparently), which was released on his own label Lost Marble Recordings in 2004. Lindstrand was also a band member on the album which featured additional guest performances by The Smith Quartet, saxophonist David Sanborn and guitarist Jim Mullen. Human Chain played at the Fuse 2004 music festival in Leeds (curated by Bates) to promote the record. The band‚Äôs work has diminished from 2005 onwards following Bates‚Äôs employment as a professor at the Rhythmic Music Conservatory in Copenhagen, Denmark. Ballamy, France, Mondesir and Lindstrand have all concentrated on different projects. However, the band remain formally active and reunited to record Bates‚Äôs ninth album Spring Is Here (Shall We Dance?), which was released in 2008. Current members *Django Bates (keyboards, Eb tenor horn, occasional vocals) *Iain Ballamy (saxophones) *Michael Mondesir (bass guitar) * Martin France (drums, electric percussion) *Josefine Lindstrand (vocals) Deputising members Although the lineup of Human Chain has remained steady since 1992, various other musicians have occasionally deputised in the absence/pre-booking of regular members. These guest members have included drummer Gary Husband, bass players Laurence Cottle and Stuart Hall, and saxophonists Julian Seigel and Julian Arguelles.

It is part of a group of peaks that form the northeast wall of the Nanda Devi Sanctuary. It is a particularly steep and rocky peak, and all routes on it are serious undertakings. It has been the site of many significant climbs. It does not have a high topographic prominence, being slightly lower than its near neighbor Kalanka to the east, and lower than many other peaks in the immediate vicinity, but its steep rocky profile has made it a more attractive destination than its elevation would indicate. First ascent Changabang was first climbed on 4 June 1974 by an expedition led by Lt. Col Balwant Sandhu and Chris Bonington, via the Southeast Face, leading to the East Ridge. This is the easiest route on the mountain, and one of the few that is primarily a snow/ice climb, as opposed to a rock climb with some snow, ice, or mixed terrain. Notable ascents Other notable ascents include some of the hardest climbs ever done in the Himalaya. * 1976 Southwest Ridge, Naoki Toda, Akira Kobayashi, Masahide Aida, Harumi Ohno, Yukio Asano and Teruyoshi Karino (Japanese Alpine Club) all reached the summit after 33 days of effort. * 1976 West Wall, Peter Boardman and Joe Tasker, summit reached 15 October 1976. The route took over 25 days to ascend, and their use of big wall climbing techniques to overcome the serious, sustained difficulties was revolutionary. Boardman's account of the ascent, The Shining Mountain, won the 1979 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize for literature. * 1978 Direct South Face, Wojciech Kurtyka (Pol.), Krzysztof ≈ªurek (Pol.), Alex MacIntyre (UK) and John Porter (US-UK), summit reached 27 September 1978..

History  1991-1993 Moscow Independent Broadcasting Corporation (MIBC), a Russian joint-stock company, was established in August 1991. Among its shareholders were Government of Moscow, JSC Logovaz, Mosbiznesbank, OJSC Lukoil, All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, Mosfilm and private persons Eduard Sagalaev, Oleg Orlov and Nugzar Popkhadze. On 12 November 1992, MIBC won the competition to be allotted the sixth television channel frequency, ahead of the Russian newspaper Argumenty i Fakty and commercial radio station Europa Plus. The same year, MIBC and Turner Broadcasting System signed an agreement to establish Russia's first private independent television channel named TV-6 Moscow, during Ted Turner‚Äôs visit to Russia. Eduard Sagalaev became the first President of TV-6 Moscow. 1993-1994 TV-6 Moscow started broadcasting on 1 January 1993 for five hours a day (from 7pm to midnight Moscow time), with 500,000 viewers in Moscow and Moscow Oblast (a federal subject of Russia). Broadcasting hours were extended to 10 hours a day by the end of 1993. Until 1994, it shared with a minor channel \\"North Crown\\" (Russian: –°–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–∞—è –∫–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∞), which was closed a year later. It was originally an entertainment channel which broadcast talk shows, cartoons, music and series. TV-6 Moscow was the first in Russia to air foreign sci-fi series such as Babylon 5, Lexx, First Wave, as well as sitcoms Grace Under Fire, Married... with Children and 3rd Rock from the Sun. TV-6 Moscow was initially created as a joint Russian-American commercial partnership, under which the Turner Broadcasting System undertook to provide it with movies and news and its Russian counterpart committed to create Russia's first private television channel that would represent the interests of Ted Turner in Russian regions, eventually becoming on what would be Russia's equivalent to Turner owned network TNT, due to the music on TV-6's idents and promos. As early as 1994, the agreement establishing the joint Russian-American television channel was annulled at the initiative of the Russian party, and in June 1994 the Turner Broadcasting System opted out as TV-6 Moscow's founder. A few years later, Aleksey Simonov, President of the Glasnost Defense Foundation, quoted Eduard Sagalaev in his book entitled The End of the Disobedience Party: ‚ÄúOur partners from the provincial city of Atlanta and from other American provincial towns came to work in our European capital, with a strong feeling that they arrived in some African country where, in exchange for a seashell necklace, they would get the right to the equal co-ownership of a television network that was to air to dozens of millions of viewers‚Äù. Alexander Ponomaryov, whom Sagalaev appointed CEO of TV-6 Moscow in January 1993, shared his superior's view that a Russian team of young professionals, rather than American managers, was needed to open up the potentially highly lucrative Russian television market. This is how the host of MuzOBOZ Ivan Demidov became General Producer of TV-6 Moscow in Summer 1993. Alexander Oleynikov, director of the Moscow office of the Central Television of the USSR, became his deputy. The main goal pursued by Demidov and Oleynikov was to create and develop the entertainment television channel, something completely new for Russia. Within a relatively short time, TV-6 Moscow evolved from being a Moscow channel to being one of the top state television networks and a one-of-a-kind talent foundry for the new generation of Russian showbiz stars. In Autumn 1993, Larisa Sinelshchikova headed, at the personal invitation of Ponomaryov, the newly established TV-6 Media advertising agency. At the same time, she became his deputy and Vice-President of TV-6 Moscow. TV-6 Media was Russia's first TV advertising agency that was directly integrated into the channel, being also the latter's own sales house. Back then, Premier SV and Video International advertising agencies had a virtual monopoly in the Russian TV advertising market, selling 100% of ads on all TV channels. TV-6 Media, however, chose a distinctly different development model based on the independent work in the advertising market in the interest of TV-6 Moscow. As a result, the channel quickly became completely self- sufficient and was needed no public subsidies to become one of the most popular Russian entertainment TV channels. 1993-1994 In April 1994, TV-6 Moscow started broadcasting in other Russian regions as a network channel: while it had its own frequency in Moscow only, TV-6 Moscow aired in all other cities and towns via the frequencies of regional TV companies that acted as intermediaries and were responsible for passing the television signal. The same year, TV-6 Moscow started producing its own programs, Kineskop (–ö–∏–Ω–µ—Å–∫–æ–ø) and POSTmuzykalnye novosti (‚ÄúPost-musical news‚Äù, Russian: –ü–û–°–¢–º—É–∑—ã–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –Ω–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏), along with other original programs that created the channel's image: Ya sama (‚ÄúMyself‚Äù, Russian: –Ø —Å–∞–º–∞), DISK-kanal.

Much of TV-6 Moscow's broadcasting time was given to music, in particular MuzOBOZ, a program hosted by Ivan Demidov, and Akuly pera (‚ÄúNews tribe‚Äù, Russian: –ê–∫—É–ª—ã –ø–µ—Ä–∞), a talk show. 1995-1998 On 9 January 1995, Cyrillic letters replaced the Latin ones in the channel's name and TV-6 Moscow aired as '–¢–í-6 –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞' for the first time. The same year Ivan Demidov became Vice-President of TV-6 Moscow and Alexander Oleynikov filled the vacant post of the channel's General Producer. In 1996, broadcasting time of TV-6 Moscow increased to 18.5 hours a day. In March 1996, the channel launched its own news service and 6 novostey (‚ÄúSix pieces of news‚Äù, Russian: 6 –Ω–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π), an information programme, in which viewers determined the ‚Äúnews of the day‚Äù by telephone voting and that news would become the subject of a special report the following Sunday. It was also at that time that the broadcast schedule featured Skandaly nedeli (‚ÄúScandals of the week‚Äù, Russian: –°–∫–∞–Ω–¥–∞–ª—ã –Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª–∏), an information and entertainment program dedicated to social life, and Katastrophy nedeli (‚ÄúCatastrophes of the week‚Äù, Russian: –ö–∞—Ç–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ—ã –Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª–∏), a TV show focused on accidents and natural disasters all over the world. Much of the channel's broadcasting time was allocated to fun programs, such as Raz v nedelyu (‚ÄúOnce a week‚Äù, Russian: –†–∞–∑ –≤ –Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª—é), Nazlorekordam!? (‚ÄúIn spite of records!?‚Äù, Russian: –ù–∞–∑–ª–æ —Ä–µ–∫–æ—Ä–¥–∞–º!?), 33 kvadratnykh metra (‚Äú33 square meters‚Äù, Russian: 33 –∫–≤–∞–¥—Ä–∞—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –º–µ—Ç—Ä–∞), O.S.P. Studiya (‚ÄúO.S.P.

In September 1997, Larisa Sinelshchikova, who had by that time become Advertising and PR Vice-President at TV-6 Moscow, met Alexander Lyubimov, CEO of VID TV production company, at an event in the city of Surgut dedicated to the promotion of TV-6 Moscow in Russian regions. In a private conversation that they had the following day, Lyubimov outlined to Sinelshchikova the development prospects of VID as a production company and suggested that she should consider the career of a TV producer and media manager. In January 1998, Sinelshchikova leaving TV-6 Moscow and became CEO of VID. 1998-1999 In 1998 and 1999, TV-6 Moscow switched to the combined signal distribution system. The channel's own local branches started to open in various Russian cities as MIBC subsidiary enterprises (TV-6 Petersburg, TV-6 Vladimir, TV-6 Kemerovo, TV-6 Pomorye, TV-6 Perm and TV-6 Ufa), adding to TV-6 Moscow and regional partners and intermediaries. 1999-2001 In June 1999, Eduard Sagalaev sold 37.5% of his MIBC shares to businessman Boris Berezovsky who thus consolidated 75% of TV-6 Moscow. On 3 June 1999, the former host of Vremya Sergey Dorenko was appointed Deputy CEO of TV-6 Moscow for Information and Political Programs. This appointment had an immediate impact on the channel's broadcasting policy shifting its scope from entertainment to socio-political issues. In late March 2001, Badri Patarkatsishvili, the former Vice-Chair of ORT TV channel Board of Directors, became CEO of TV-6 Moscow. Alexander Ponomaryov spent some time as his first deputy and Igor Shabdurasulov headed the Board of Directors. On 14 April 2001, following the appointment of Boris Jordan as the new CEO of NTV TV channel and the subsequent dismissal of over 350 employees, Boris Berezovsky offered Yevgeny Kiselyov the post of interim CEO of TV-6 Moscow and the dismissed journalists the posts on his own channel. On 17 April 2001, Alexander Ponomaryov resigned from his post. Although there was no comment on the reasons behind this decision, many thought his resignation was related to Kiselyov's appointment as interim CEO of TV-6 Moscow. The day before, Mikhail Ponomaryov, editor-in-chief of the TV-6 Moscow information service who had also submitted his resignation, stated in an interview that ‚Äúas a citizen, an individual, a journalist and simply as a human being, [he] would under no circumstances work under the direction of Yevgeny Alekseyevich Kiselyov‚Äù. On 14 May 2001, Deputy CEO Stella Neretina, General Producer Ivan Demidov, Chief of the Regional Service Yelena Zlotnikova and Technical Director of TV-6 Moscow Alexander Zolotnitsky left the channel right after the extraordinary meeting of the channel's shareholders, during which Yevgeny Kiselyov's appointment as a new CEO was given final approval. The following day, Moscow- based daily newspaper MK published an article entitled 'BABskoye TV-6' (‚ÄúBerezovsky‚Äôs TV-6‚Äù, Russian: –ë–ê–ë—Å–∫–æ–µ –¢–í-6), quoting Alexander Ponomaryov who commented on the situation as follows: ‚ÄúMy worst fear came true‚Äù. Most hosts working on TV-6 Moscow left after Yevgeny Kiselyov and his team came to the channel. The information service was also hit hard, with 50 employees laid off (out of 85). From June to September 2001, Kiselyov decided to stop broadcasting most popular entertainment programs targeting the young audience, since they were out of line with the idea of a political TV channel, promoted by Boris Berezovsky on TV-6 Moscow. There were only a few entertainment programs left on the channel after the ‚Äúpurges‚Äù: Den zadnyom (‚ÄúDay after day‚Äù, Russian: –î–µ–Ω—å –∑–∞ –¥–Ω—ë–º), Skandaly nedeli and Vy-ochevidets. Overtly politically-oriented programs, Itogo (‚ÄúIn all‚Äù, Russian: –ò—Ç–æ–≥–æ) and Tushite svet (‚ÄúTurn the lights off‚Äù, Russian: –¢—É—à–∏—Ç–µ —Å–≤–µ—Ç), replaced other entertainment programs. The revisions to the channel's broadcasting policy were completed by September 2001. By this time, only one entertainment project had remained on TV-6 Moscow, namely Za steklom (‚ÄúBehind the Glass‚Äù, Russian: –ó–∞ —Å—Ç–µ–∫–ª–æ–º), the first television reality show in Russia. Journalist Marina Lesko qualified it as a ‚Äúfresh uplift on an old face‚Äù in her article published in the Russian newspaper Muzykalnaya Pravda on 16 November 2001, adding that ‚Äúits place is on MTV (instead of Undressed), rather than in the drain‚Äù, by which she meant TV-6 Moscow headed by Yevgeny Kiselyov. At the same time, the number of foreign series fell sharply on TV-6 Moscow, replaced with Russian detective TV series Ulitsy razbitykh fonarey (‚ÄúStreets of Broken Lights‚Äù, Russian: –£–ª–∏—Ü—ã —Ä–∞–∑–±–∏—Ç—ã—Ö —Ñ–æ–Ω–∞—Ä–µ–π), Agent natsionalnoy bezopasnosti (‚ÄúNational Security Agent‚Äù, Russian: –ê–≥–µ–Ω—Ç –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –±–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏) and Banditsky Peterburg (‚ÄúBandit Petersburg‚Äù, Russian: –ë–∞–Ω–¥–∏—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π –ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥). Closure After the change of staff Lukoil in May 2001 started the court battle over bankruptcy which the station lost on 11 January 2002, and was put into liquidation unanimously by 14 judges sitting in the supreme arbitration court, overturning a 29 December 2001 lower appeal court decision reviving the channel and ordering a new hearing of the bankruptcy application. Two lower arbitration courts had decided against the network last in the fall of 2001. States that there were \\"13 arbitration judges\\", not 14. An arm of the partly state owned oil company Lukoil, which owns 15% of TV-6, filed the bankruptcy proceedings in 2001. Lukoil used a law that grants shareholders the right to dissolve a company if its net worth falls below a certain level for two years. TV-6 stated that its net worth plunged in 1998 but rebounded last year, when the lawsuit was filed, and in 2002 exceeded the legal level. Under a new law which came into force on 1 January 2002, a minority shareholder such as Lukoil can no longer apply for a company to be declared bankrupt. But Lukoil argued that its appeal against the appellate court was valid because the ruling was granted three days before the law came into effect. The electricity was shut off just after midnight on Tuesday, 22 January 2002, in the middle of the \\"Nightingale's Night\\" show hosted by Vladimir Solovyov while guest performer Mikhail Krug was singing folk ballads. At 12:02 am, the program stopped with Solovyov announcing the shutdown of TV-6 and bidding farewell before the channel switched to TV-6's logo on a white background with an isometric thing on the left. At 12:09 am the channel switched to the Soviet-era UEIT testcard before they at 12:13 am switched to a message which said \\"–ù–ê–° –°–ù–Ø–õ–ò –° –≠–§–ò–†–ê\\" (\\"We were taken off the air\\") on the black background. Within hours of TV-6's closure, the station's frequency was allotted to an all-sports network which aired a live coverage of the 2002 Winter Olympics. The staff of the station got a license for a new station, TVS, but because of financial difficulties, this station was also shut down in June 2003. Views on closure U.S. Department of State representative Richard Boucher said in interview to The Guardian: \\"There's a strong appearance of political pressure in the judicial process against the independent media. Press freedom and the rule of law can be best served by keeping TV-6 on the air\\". CEO of VID Larisa Sinelshchikova described the situation as ‚Äúa conflict between owners, rather than a political issue‚Äù, adding that ‚Äúthe closure of the TV channel is a measure of last resort pointing to the professional failure of the channel‚Äôs management and that of its owner‚Äù. Deputy Chair of the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company Alexander Ponomaryov suggested that ‚Äúa solution would have to be found, so that viewers could keep watching the channel and journalists could do their job‚Äù.

After releasing his first solo album, Music of Hair, Bird appeared on three albums by Squirrel Nut Zippers before becoming the bandleader for Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire. Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire released Thrills on Rykodisc in 1997, shortly followed by second album Oh! The Grandeur in 1998. Both albums were heavily influenced by traditional folk, pre-war jazz, and swing, with Bird relying on the violin as his primary musical instrument, as well as providing vocals along with his trademark verbose lyrics. The Bowl of Fire featured musicians from Bird's home town of Chicago, including Kevin O'Donnell, Joshua Hirsch, Jon Williams, Nora O'Connor, Andy Hopkins, Jimmy Sutton, Colin Bunn, and Ryan Hembrey. Members of the Squirrel Nut Zippers, Katherine Whalen and Jimbo Mathus also appeared on Thrills. During this period, Andrew Bird was a member of the jazz group Kevin O'Donnells Quality Six, for which he was the lead singer and violinist and contributed to arrangements and songwriting for the albums Heretic Blues (Delmark 1999) and Control Freak (Delmark 2000) (both Delmark albums were produced by Raymond Salvatore Harmon). In 2001, the Bowl of Fire released their third album, The Swimming Hour, a dramatic departure from their previous recordings. It featured a mixture of styles, from the zydeco-influenced \\"Core and Rind\\" to more straightforward rock songs such as \\"11:11\\". Due to this eclectic yet pop- like nature, Bird has often referred to it as his \\"jukebox album\\". Although gaining critical praise (The Swimming Hour received a 9.0 from indie music website Pitchfork), the band failed to attain commercial success or recognition, playing to audiences as small as 40 people. In 2002, Bird was asked to open for a band in his hometown of Chicago, but fellow Bowl of Fire members were unavailable for the date. The reluctant Bird performed the gig alone, and the surprising success of this solo show suggested potential new directions for his music. The Bowl of Fire unofficially disbanded in 2003, and Bird went on to gain mainstream recognition and re-invent himself as a solo artist. In December of 2017, members of the band held a reunion performance at the Hideout Inn in support of the Foundations of Music's Andrew Bird scholarship. The line-up included Andrew Bird, Nora O'Conner, Kevin O'Donnell, and Colin Bunn, as well as Are You Serious bassist, Alan Hampton. Discography *Thrills (1998) *Oh!

For example: people believing that they are less at risk of being a crime victim, smokers believing that they are less likely to contract lung cancer or disease than other smokers, first-time bungee jumpers believing that they are less at risk of an injury than other jumpers, or traders who think they are less exposed to potential losses in the markets.Elder; Alexander \\"Trading for a Living; Psychology, Trading Tactics, Money Management\\" John Wiley & Sons 1993, Intro ‚Äì sections \\"Psychology is the Key\\" & \\"The Odds are against You\\", And Part I \\"Individual Psychology\\", Section 5 \\"Fantasy versus Reality\\" Although the optimism bias occurs for both positive events (such as believing oneself to be more financially successful than others) and negative events (such as being less likely to have a drinking problem), there is more research and evidence suggesting that the bias is stronger for negative events (the valence effect). Different consequences result from these two types of events: positive events often lead to feelings of well being and self-esteem, while negative events lead to consequences involving more risk, such as engaging in risky behaviors and not taking precautionary measures for safety.  Factors  The factors leading to the optimistic bias can be categorized into four different groups: desired end states of comparative judgment, cognitive mechanisms, information about the self versus a target, and underlying affect. These are explained more in detail below.  Measuring  Optimism bias is typically measured through two determinants of risk: absolute risk, where individuals are asked to estimate their likelihood of experiencing a negative event compared to their actual chance of experiencing a negative event (comparison against self), and comparative risk, where individuals are asked to estimate the likelihood of experiencing a negative event (their personal risk estimate) compared to others of the same age and sex (a target risk estimate). Problems can occur when trying to measure absolute risk because it is extremely difficult to determine the actual risk statistic for a person. Therefore, the optimistic bias is primarily measured in comparative risk forms, where people compare themselves against others, through direct and indirect comparisons. Direct comparisons ask whether an individual's own risk of experiencing an event is less than, greater than, or equal to someone else's risk, while indirect comparisons ask individuals to provide separate estimates of their own risk of experiencing an event and others' risk of experiencing the same event. After obtaining scores, researchers are able to use the information to determine if there is a difference in the average risk estimate of the individual compared to the average risk estimate of their peers. Generally in negative events, the mean risk of an individual appears lower than the risk estimate of others. This is then used to demonstrate the bias' effect. The optimistic bias can only be defined at a group level, because at an individual level the positive assessment could be true. Likewise, difficulties can arise in measurement procedures, as it is difficult to determine when someone is being optimistic, realistic, or pessimistic. Research suggests that the bias comes from an overestimate of group risks rather than underestimating one's own risk. An example: participants assigned a higher probability to picking a card that had a smiling face on its reverse side than one which had a frowning face.Taylor, Nigel, Making Actuaries Less Human: Lessons from Behavioral Finance. The Staple Inn Actuarial Society, 2000-01-18. Last accessed on 2009-03-16.  Cognitive mechanisms  The optimistic bias is possibly also influenced by three cognitive mechanisms that guide judgments and decision-making processes: the representativeness heuristic, singular target focus, and interpersonal distance.  Representativeness heuristic  The estimates of likelihood associated with the optimistic bias are based on how closely an event matches a person's overall idea of the specific event. Some researchers suggest that the representativeness heuristic is a reason for the optimistic bias: individuals tend to think in stereotypical categories rather than about their actual targets when making comparisons. For example, when drivers are asked to think about a car accident, they are more likely to associate a bad driver, rather than just the average driver. Individuals compare themselves with the negative elements that come to mind, rather than an overall accurate comparison between them and another driver. Additionally, when individuals were asked to compare themselves towards friends, they chose more vulnerable friends based on the events they were looking at. Individuals generally chose a specific friend based on whether they resemble a given example, rather than just an average friend. People find examples that relate directly to what they are asked, resulting in representativeness heuristics.  Singular target focus  One of the difficulties of the optimistic bias is that people know more about themselves than they do about others. While individuals know how to think about themselves as a single person, they still think of others as a generalized group, which leads to biased estimates and inabilities to sufficiently understand their target or comparison group. Likewise, when making judgments and comparisons about their risk compared to others, people generally ignore the average person, but primarily focus on their own feelings and experiences.  Interpersonal distance  Perceived risk differences occur depending on how far or close a compared target is to an individual making a risk estimate. The greater the perceived distance between the self and the comparison target, the greater the perceived difference in risk. When one brings the comparison target closer to the individual, risk estimates appear closer together than if the comparison target was someone more distant to the participant. There is support for perceived social distance in determining the optimistic bias. Through looking at comparisons of personal and target risk between the in-group level contributes to more perceived similarities than when individuals think about outer-group comparisons which lead to greater perceived differences. In one study, researchers manipulated the social context of the comparison group, where participants made judgements for two different comparison targets: the typical student at their university and a typical student at another university. Their findings showed that not only did people work with the closer comparison first, but also had closer ratings to themselves than the \\"more different\\" group. Studies have also noticed that people demonstrate more optimistic bias when making comparisons when the other is a vague individual, but biases are reduced when the other is a familiar person, such as a friend or family member. This also is determined due to the information they have about the individuals closest to them, but not having the same information about other people.  Desired end states of comparative judgment  Many explanations for the optimistic bias come from the goals that people want and outcomes they wish to see. People tend to view their risks as less than others because they believe that this is what other people want to see. These explanations include self-enhancement, self- presentation, and perceived control.  Self-enhancement  Self-enhancement suggests that optimistic predictions are satisfying and that it feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others. People tend to focus on finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome to be. This also suggests that people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.  Self- presentation  Studies suggest that people attempt to establish and maintain a desired personal image in social situations. People are motivated to present themselves towards others in a good light, and some researchers suggest that the optimistic bias is a representative of self-presentational processes: people want to appear more well-off than others. However, this is not through conscious effort. In a study where participants believed their driving skills would be either tested in either real-life or driving simulations, people who believed they were to be tested had less optimistic bias and were more modest about their skills than individuals who would not be tested. Studies also suggest that individuals who present themselves in a pessimistic and more negative light are generally less accepted by the rest of society. This might contribute to overly optimistic attitudes.  Personal control/perceived control  People tend to be more optimistically biased when they believe they have more control over events than others. For example, people are more likely to think that they will not be harmed in a car accident if they are driving the vehicle. Another example is that if someone believes that they have a lot of control over becoming infected with HIV, they are more likely to view their risk of contracting the disease to be low. Studies have suggested that the greater perceived control someone has, the greater their optimistic bias. Stemming from this, control is a stronger factor when it comes to personal risk assessments, but not when assessing others. A meta-analysis reviewing the relationship between the optimistic bias and perceived control found that a number of moderators contribute to this relationship. In previous research, participants from the United States generally had higher levels of optimistic bias relating to perceived control than those of other nationalities. Students also showed larger levels of the optimistic bias than non-students. The format of the study also demonstrated differences in the relationship between perceived control and the optimistic bias: direct methods of measurement suggested greater perceived control and greater optimistic bias as compared to indirect measures of the bias. The optimistic bias is strongest in situations where an individual needs to rely heavily on direct action and responsibility of situations. An opposite factor of perceived control is that of prior experience. Prior experience is typically associated with less optimistic bias, which some studies suggest is from either a decrease in the perception of personal control, or make it easier for individuals to imagine themselves at risk. Prior experience suggests that events may be less controllable than previously believed.  Information about self versus target  Individuals know a lot more about themselves than they do about others. Because information about others is less available, information about the self versus others leads people to make specific conclusions about their own risk, but results in them having a harder time making conclusions about the risks of others. This leads to differences in judgments and conclusions about self- risks compared to the risks of others, leading to larger gaps in the optimistic bias.  Person-positivity bias  Person-positivity bias is the tendency to evaluate an object more favorably the more the object resembles an individual human being. Generally, the more a comparison target resembles a specific person, the more familiar it will be. However, groups of people are considered to be more abstract concepts, which leads to less favorable judgments. With regards to the optimistic bias, when people compare themselves to an average person, whether someone of the same sex or age, the target continues to be viewed as less human and less personified, which will result in less favorable comparisons between the self and others.  Egocentric thinking  \\"Egocentric thinking\\" refers to how individuals know more of their own personal information and risk that they can use to form judgments and make decisions. One difficulty, though, is that people have a large amount of knowledge about themselves, but no knowledge about others. Therefore, when making decisions, people have to use other information available to them, such as population data, in order to learn more about their comparison group. This can relate to an optimism bias because while people are using the available information they have about themselves, they have more difficulty understanding correct information about others. It is also possible that someone can escape egocentric thinking. In one study, researchers had one group of participants list all factors that influenced their chances of experiencing a variety of events, and then a second group read the list. Those who read the list showed less optimistic bias in their own reports. It's possible that greater knowledge about others and their perceptions of their chances of risk bring the comparison group closer to the participant.  Underestimating average person's control  Also regarding egocentric thinking, it is possible that individuals underestimate the amount of control the average person has. This is explained in two different ways: # People underestimate the control that others have in their lives. # People completely overlook that others have control over their own outcomes. For example, many smokers believe that they are taking all necessary precautionary measures so that they won't get lung cancer, such as smoking only once a day, or using filtered cigarettes, and believe that others are not taking the same precautionary measures. However, it is likely that many other smokers are doing the same things and taking those same precautions.  Underlying affect  The last factor of optimistic bias is that of underlying affect and affect experience. Research has found that people show less optimistic bias when experiencing a negative mood, and more optimistic bias when in a positive mood. Sad moods reflect greater memories of negative events, which lead to more negative judgments, while positive moods promote happy memories and more positive feelings. This suggests that overall negative moods, including depression, result in increased personal risk estimates but less optimistic bias overall. Anxiety also leads to less optimistic bias, continuing to suggest that overall positive experiences and positive attitudes lead to more optimistic bias in events.  Health consequences  In health, the optimistic bias tends to prevent individuals from taking on preventative measures for good health. For example, people who underestimate their comparative risk of heart disease know less about heart disease, and even after reading an article with more information, are still less concerned about risk of heart disease. Because the optimistic bias can be a strong force in decision-making, it is important to look at how risk perception is determined and how this will result in preventative behaviors. Therefore, researchers need to be aware of the optimistic bias and the ways it can prevent people from taking precautionary measures in life choices. Risk perceptions are particularly important for individual behaviors, such as exercise, diet, and even sunscreen use. A large portion of risk prevention focuses on adolescents. Especially with health risk perception, adolescence is associated with an increased frequency of risky health-related behaviors such as smoking, drugs, and unsafe sex. While adolescents are aware of the risk, this awareness does not change behavior habits. Adolescents with strong positive optimistic bias toward risky behaviors had an overall increase in the optimistic bias with age. However, unconditional risk questions in cross-sectional studies are used consistently, leading to problems, as they ask about the likelihood of an action occurring, but does not determine if there is an outcome, or compare events that haven't happened to events that have. many times there are methodological problems in these tests. Concerning vaccines, perceptions of those who have not been vaccinated are compared to the perceptions of people who have been. Other problems which arise include the failure to know a person's perception of a risk. Knowing this information will be helpful for continued research on optimistic bias and preventative behaviors.  Neurosciences  Functional neuroimaging suggests a key role for the rostral Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) in modulating both emotional processing and autobiographical retrieval. It is part of brain network showing extensive correlation between rostral ACC and amygdala during imagining of future positive events and restricted correlation during imagining of future negative events. Based on these data, it is suggested that the rostral ACC has a crucial part to play in creating positive images of the future and ultimately, in ensuring and maintaining the optimism bias.  Policy, planning, and management  Optimism bias influences decisions and forecasts in policy, planning, and management, e.g., the costs and completion times of planned decisions tend to be underestimated and the benefits overestimated due to optimism bias. The term planning fallacy for this effect was first proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Decision Research Technical Report PTR-1042-77-6. In There is a growing body of evidence proving that optimism bias represents one of the biggest single causes of risk for megaproject overspend. Valence effect Valence effect is used to allude to the effect of valence on unrealistic optimism. It has been studied by Ron S. Gold and his team since 2003.. They frame questions for the same event in different ways: \\"some participants were given information about the conditions that promote a given health-related event, such as developing heart disease, and were asked to rate the comparative likelihood that they would experience the event. Other participants were given matched information about the conditions that prevent the same event and were asked to rate the comparative likelihood that they would avoid the event\\". They have generally found that unrealistic optimism was greater for negative than positive valence. Valence effects, which is also considered a form of cognitive bias, have several real-world implications. For instance, it can lead to the overestimation of a company's future earnings by investors and this could contribute to a tendency for it to becoming overpriced. In terms of achieving organizational objectives, it could encourage people to produce unrealistic schedules helping drive a so-called planning fallacy, which often result in making poor decisions and project abandonment.  Attempts to alter and eliminate  Studies have shown that it is very difficult to eliminate the optimistic bias. Some commentators believe that trying to reduce it may encourage people to adapt to health-protective behaviors. However, research has suggested that it cannot be reduced, and that efforts to reduce it tend to lead to even more optimistically biased results. In a research study of four different tests to reduce the optimistic bias, through lists of risk factors, participants perceiving themselves as inferior to others, participants asked to think of high-risk individuals, and giving attributes of why they were at risk, all increased the bias rather than decreased it. Other studies have tried to reduce the bias through reducing distance, but overall it still remains. This seemingly paradoxical situation ‚Äì in which an attempt to reduce bias can sometimes actually increase it ‚Äì may be related to the insight behind the semi-jocular and recursively worded \\"Hofstadter's law\\", which states that: Although research has suggested that it is very difficult to eliminate the bias, some factors may help in closing the gap of the optimistic bias between an individual and their target risk group. First, by placing the comparison group closer to the individual, the optimistic bias can be reduced: studies found that when individuals were asked to make comparisons between themselves and close friends, there was almost no difference in the likelihood of an event occurring. Additionally, actually experiencing an event leads to a decrease in the optimistic bias. While this only applies to events with prior experience, knowing the previously unknown will result in less optimism of it not occurring.  Pessimism bias  The opposite of optimism bias is pessimism bias (or pessimistic bias), because the principles of the optimistic bias continue to be in effect in situations where individuals regard themselves as worse off than others. Optimism may occur from either a distortion of personal estimates, representing personal optimism, or a distortion for others, representing personal pessimism. Pessimism bias is an effect in which people exaggerate the likelihood that negative things will happen to them. It contrasts with optimism bias. The difference is that we are in an improbable way worried about our society's future. People with depression are particularly likely to exhibit pessimism bias. Surveys of smokers have found that their ratings of their risk of heart disease showed a small but significant pessimism bias; however, the literature as a whole is inconclusive.

It is located at 6650 Griffin Road. It was designed by August Geiger. It opened its doors in 1918 to 90 students, and was in continuous use as a school until 1978. On March 29, 1988, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is the oldest extant school building in Broward County. School building The architect Geiger was hired by the school board in 1917 and presented them with his plans for the school that September. It is a T-shaped two-story building constructed of concrete with a textured stucco finish. The building has a hip roof with a surrounding parapet. Architectural elements include horseshoe and bell-shaped openings, raised bands of stucco and multiple panel windows. History Until the early 20th century, what is now Davie was considered an impenetrable swamp, accessible only by water. At first, school was held in a room at the general store along a canal, and in 1911, a two-room wooden structure was built for the growing population of Zona (what is now Davie). Built in 1917 it was the first permanent school in what had been The Everglades. The second floor auditorium was used for a variety of civic purposes. It functioned continuously as a school until 1979. In 1977 Davie built a new elementary school, the next year nearby students were taught there until the completion of Griffin Elementary School in 1979. Modern times The city of Davie negotiated the purchase of the land around the schoolhouse from the Broward County School District in 1998, at that time the school building was being used as an event venue. In 2008 after being closed to the public for nearly 20 years the Davie school reopened as the Old Davie School Historical Museum, with exhibits about life and agriculture during the development of Davie in the 1920s. Adjacent to the school is the 1930s period Viele House, a historic house museum, and the Pioneer House, a replica of a 1908 early settler's shack.

Burnley Pilkington made his name with Burnley after he was recommended to the Clarets by his hometown team Leyland Motors. With a strong interest from various north west clubs, Burnley signed him in April 1951, and he continued to work at Leyland Motors as an apprentice coach painter, while still playing for the Reserves in the Central League. Following the departure of Billy Elliott to Sunderland in the summer of 1953, Pilkington became a regular in the first team. In February 1954, he was called in to the Royal Air Force and was stationed at RAF Kirkham, but continued to play for Burnley during this period. During his career, Pilkington played 340 games for Burnley scoring 77 goals. During Burnley's momentous 1959/1960 season he missed only one game and contributed 11 goals, including the opening goal at Manchester City in the 2‚Äì1 win that crowned Burnley as champions. The following season, he continued to feature for the Clarets, scoring his last two goals for the club in the victory over Hamburg in the European Cup tie at Turf Moor. Transfers and international appearances Following this he spent three years at Bolton Wanderers, then Bury, Barrow and Chorley. He won one England cap, in place of the injured Tom Finney, whilst at Burnley, on 2 October 1954 in a 2‚Äì0 victory over Northern Ireland., Retrieved 3 October 2018 He was also capped twice for England B, scoring once. Post-football career He continued to live in Leyland and became a successful businessman and magistrate. He was married to Maureen, with whom he had a son, Tim. In 2018 the Lancashire Football Association honoured him by naming a stand after him at their headquarters in Leyland.

It is located at 1001 Northwest 4th Street. The first school building in Broward County for black students (earlier schools had no building), it was built in 1924 by Cayot & Hart and the architect was John Morris Peterman. On February 20, 1991, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is the oldest surviving black school in Fort Lauderdale, and is named for black education advocate James H. Dillard. (A small earlier black school, without a dedicated building, opened in 1907.) Its first principal, from 1924 until 1937, was Joseph A. Ely. Clarence C. Walker, Sr. served as principal from 1937 until his death in 1942. The high school grades were moved to a new facility in 1950, and the old building became Dillard Elementary. A new building was constructed for Dillard Elementary, and in 1954 a citizens' committee requested that the old school be named Walker Elementary. In the late 1980s the building was boarded up and slated for demolition, but was saved through community activism. Old Dillard Museum The Old Dillard Museum is located in the high school, which was built in 1923 as the city's first school for blacks. The museum's exhibits focus on the city's African American history and culture. Posters announcing the Museum's activities are found on its Twitter feed.

They are also found in significant numbers in the adjacent areas of Nigeria and Benin, along with smaller numbers in Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, and Cameroon.Zarma people, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica The Zarma people are predominantly Muslims of the Maliki-Sunni school, and they live in the arid Sahel lands, along the Niger River valley which is a source of irrigation, forage for cattle herds, and drinking water. Relatively prosperous, they own cattle, sheep, goats and dromedaries, renting them out to the Fulani people or Tuareg people for tending. The Zarma people have had a history of slave and caste systems, like many West African ethnic groups. Like them, they also have had a historical musical tradition. The Zarma people are alternatively referred to as Zerma, Djerma, Dyerma, Zaberma, Zabarma or Zabermawa people. Demographics and language The estimates for the total population of Zarma people as of 2013 has been generally placed over 3 million, but it varies. They constitute several smaller ethnic sub-groups, who were either indigenous to the era prior to the Songhai Empire and have assimilated into the Zarma people, or else are people of Zarma origins who have differentiated themselves some time in the precolonial period (through dialect, political structure, or religion), but these are difficult to differentiate according to Fuglestad.Fuglestad, F. (1983) A History of Niger: 1850‚Äì1960, Cambridge University Press: Cambridge. Groups usually referred to as part of the Zarma or Songhay, but who have traceable historical distinctions include the Gabda, Kado, Tinga, Sorko, Kalles, Golles, Loqas and Kourteys peoples. The Zarma language is one of the southern Songhai languages, a branch of the Nilo- Saharan language family. Because of the common language and culture, they are sometimes referred to as \\"Zarma Songhay\\" (also spelled \\"Djerma- Songhai\\").Zarma, Ethnologue: The Languages of the World History The geographic distribution of Zarma people (approx.). The Zarma people are an African ethnic group with unrecorded history and no ancient texts. Like other ethnic groups of the region, much of their known history comes from Islamic records after the 8th century, particularly from the medieval accounts of Arabs and North African historians, states Margari Aziza Hill ‚Äì a professor of humanities. The Islamic conquest was motivated and facilitated by the pre- existing trade between West Africa and the Mediterranean before Islam arrived, and in turn the arrival of Islam influenced the history of all people including the Zarma. North African Muslims increased the trans-Saharan trade, becoming of growing importance to the fortunes of ethnic groups and their chiefs. The Muslim traders were major actors in introducing Islam. The Sahel, which forms the origins and historic home of the Zarma people, has been the economic and ecological transition zone and travel route strategically located between the inhospitable Sahara desert and dense sub-Saharan forest zone of Africa.Margari Hill (2009), The Spread of Islam in West Africa: Containment, Mixing, and Reform from the Eighth to the Twentieth Century, Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Stanford University The Niger delta region already had major settlements of people before Islam arrived. Early Arab documents from the eighth century suggest that Muslims went into West Africa for trade, exchanging salt, horses, dates, and camels they had from the North and Arabian lands with gold, timber, and food from Niger river valley and nearby regions controlled by Songhay-Zarma people. This trade and commerce also ultimately led to cultural and religious conversion. Various theories have been proposed as to how, when and why Zarma people converted to Islam. According to Arabic records, the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence became the predominant system of rule in Niger river region and West Africa by the 11th-century, after the Almoravid conquest of North Africa, Niger river, Ghanaian Koumbi Saleh and Senegal river regions. Muslim scholars dispute if these early Islamic documents are reliable, with some disputing the \\"conquest\\" language, insisting that it was a peaceful, willing conversion from the old Islamic system to the new Maliki school. For example, Ahmad Baba in 1615 CE stated that black African Muslims willingly adopted Islam, not because of military threat. The Zarma people migrated south-eastward from Niger Bend region of Mali where Songhay people are found in high concentration, into their current geographic concentration around the Niger river valley during the Songhai Empire period, settling in many towns, and particularly what is now Southwest Niger near the capital Niamey. Forming a number of small communities, each led by a chief or ruler called Zarmakoy, these polities were in conflict for economically and agriculturally attractive lands with the Tuareg people, the Fula people and other ethnic groups in the area. This medieval era migration is attested by the legends and mythologies within the Zarma community, with some mentioning their historic origins to be Malinke and Sarakholle, one driven by persecution by local Muslim rulers or inter-ethnic rivalries. Clothing of an aristocratic Zarma According to Abdourahmane Idrissa and Samuel Decalo, the Zarma people had settled the Dallol Bosso valley, called Boboye in Zarma language, by the 17th-century. In 18th-century, they came under sustained violence from the Fulani people and Tuareg people who attempted to impose their version of Jihads in West Africa. The violence against the Zarma people settlements included raids for grain stocks, burning down standing crop, forced collection or seizure of surplus or wealth from homes, capture, enslavement and forced migration of the people. Slavery Slavery has been a historic practice in West Africa long before the arrival of colonialism. In Niger and Mali, where the largest population of Zarma people has historically lived and have their origins, there is textual evidence of a series of annual campaigns during the rules of Sunni 'Ali and Askiya Muhammad (Tur√©) to capture people as slaves, both for domestic use as well to export them to North Africa mainly Morocco, Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli. The 15th- century ruler Sunni Ali is an integral part of the legends revered by the Zarma people. The slavery system was a large part of the society and political arrangement. According to Jean-Pierre Olivier de Sardan, the slave population accounted for nearly two-thirds to three-quarters of the total population of Songhay-Zarma people. These numbers are similar to the high percentages of slavery in other ethnic groups that prevailed in pre-colonial West Africa, according to Martin Klein. However, Bruce Hall cautions that while it is \\"certainly true that the majority of population\\" had a servile status, these colonial era estimates for \\"slaves\\" in Niger river area ethnic groups are exaggerations because there is difference between servile status and slavery status. The ethnic groups including the Songhay-Zarma people, states Benedetta Rossi, stretching over the Sahelo-Sudanese have shared a political and economic system based on slavery from a pre-colonial period. The slaves were an economic asset, and they were used for farming, herding and for domestic work. The slavery system has been well developed and complex, according to Rossi, where a system of social stratification developed within the slaves and a master-slave status system survived even after slavery was officially abolished during the French colonial rule. The slave communities remain a part of memories of the Zarma people, states Alice Bellagamba. Colonial era The French colonial rulers came to regions inhabited by the Zarma people at the end of the 1890s, when the chiefs and warlords within the Zarma society were in an intra-ethnic conflict. The French picked the Zarmakoy Aouta of Dosso as their partner, and established a military post in what was then the village of Dosso in November 1898. The period that followed brought several natural disasters such as famines and locust attacks from 1901 to 1903. The French increased their presence during this period. The French relied on the Dosso military post and Niger river valleys for replenishing their supplies, as they attempted to establish a much larger colonial zone in Sahel all the way to Chad. This led to conflicts and violence against the Zarma people, in a manner that repeated the violence and tribute system imposed on Zarma from \\"at least the early nineteenth century\\", state Dennis Cordell and Joel Gregory. The French colonial rule established mines for resources in West Africa such as along the Gold Coast, and these mines were staffed with African labor that relied in large part with migrant Zarma people. Thousands of Zarma people travelled to various French mines, as well as to build roads and railroads to connect major sites of importance to the French rule. This migrant labor followed the pre-colonial tradition of Zarma warriors heading to Gold coast for booty, but colonial mines provided economic adventurism, however in many cases the migration was a means to \\"escape French economic exploitation\\". Of the various ethnic groups in Niger, the early cooperation of the Zarma elite led to a legacy where Zarma interests have been promoted and they have continued to be a dominating part of the political elite after its complete independence in 1960. Society and culture The language, society and culture of the Zarma people is barely distinguishable from the Songhai people. Some scholars consider the Zarma people to be a part of and the largest ethnic sub-group of the Songhai ‚Äì a group that includes nomads of Mali speaking the same language as the Zarma.Songhai people, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Some study the group together as Zarma-Songhai people. However, both groups see themselves as two different people. Social stratification A Zarma woman Jean-Pierre Olivier de Sardan, Tal Tamari and other scholars have stated that the Zarma people have traditionally been a socially stratified society, like the Songhai people at large, with their society featuring castes. According to the medieval and colonial era descriptions, their vocation is hereditary, and each stratified group has been endogamous.I. Diawara (1988), Cultures nig√©riennes et √©ducation : Domaine Zarma-Songhay et Hausa, Pr√©sence Africaine, Nouvelle s√©rie, number 148 (4e TRIMESTRE 1988), pages 9‚Äì19 (in French) The social stratification has been unusual in two ways; one it embedded slavery, wherein the lowest strata of the population inherited slavery, and second the Zima or priests and Islamic clerics had to be initiated but did not automatically inherit that profession, making the cleric strata a pseudo- caste. According to Ralph Austen, a professor emeritus of African history, the caste system among the Zarma people was not as well developed as the caste system historically found in the African ethnic groups further west to them. Louis Dumont, the 20th-century author famous for his classic Homo Hierarchicus, recognized the social stratification among Zarma-Songhai people as well as other ethnic groups in West Africa, but suggested that sociologists should invent a new term for West African social stratification system. Other scholars consider this a bias and isolationist because the West African system shares all elements in Dumont's system, including economic, ritual, spiritual, endogamous, elements of pollution, segregative and spread over a large region. According to Anne Haour ‚Äì a professor of African Studies, some scholars consider the historic caste-like social stratification in Zarma-Songhai people to be a pre-Islam feature while some consider it derived from the Arab influence. The different strata of the Zarma-Songhai people have included the kings and warriors, the scribes, the artisans, the weavers, the hunters, the fishermen, the leather workers and hairdressers (Wanzam), and the domestic slaves (Horso, Bannye). Each caste reveres its own guardian spirit. Some scholars such as John Shoup list these strata in three categories: free (chiefs, farmers and herders), servile (artists, musicians and griots), and the slave class. The servile group were socially required to be endogamous, while the slaves could be emancipated over four generations. The highest social level, states Shoup, claim to have descended from king \\"Sonni 'Ali Ber\\" and their modern era hereditary occupation has been Sohance (sorcerer). The traditionally free strata of the Zerma people have owned property and herds, and these have dominated the political system and governments during and after the French colonial rule. Within the stratified social system, the Islamic system of polygynous marriages is a part of the Zarma people tradition, with preferred partners being cross cousins, and a system of ritualistic acceptance between co-wives. This endogamy is similar to other ethnic groups in West Africa.Tal Tamari (1998), Les castes de l'Afrique occidentale: Artisans et musiciens endogames, Nanterre: Soci√©t√© d'ethnologie, (in French) Female genital mutilation The women among Zarma people, like other ethnic groups of Sahel and West Africa, have traditionally practiced female genital mutilation (FGM). However, the prevalence rates have been lower and falling. According to UNICEF and the World Health Organization studies, in Zarma culture the female circumcision is called Haabize.Priorities in Child survival, education and protection, UNICEF It consists of two rituals. One is ritual cutting away the hymen of new born girls, second is clitoridectomy between the ages of 9 and 15 where either her prepuce is cut out or a part to all of clitoris and labia minora is cut then removed. The operation has been ritually done by the traditional barbers called wanzam. Niger has attempted to end the FGM practice. According to UNICEF, these efforts have successfully and noticeably reduced the practice to a prevalence rate in the single digits (9% in Zarma ethnic group in 2006Legislation and other national provisions: Namibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Parliamentary Campaign against FGM, IPU (November 2006), Quote: \\"According to the World Health Organization, the prevalence rate was 5% in 1998. Excision and circumcision are common throughout the departments of Tollabery (Say, Ayerou, Torodi, Kollo), Marady and Diffa and in the urban community of Niamey along the neighbourhoods and other villages bordering on the Niger River, such as Lamord√©, Saga and Kirkisoye. The Peul and the Zarma ethnic groups feature the highest proportion of excised women: 30% and 9%, respectively.\\"), compared to east-North Africa (Egypt to Somalia) where the FGM rates are very high.Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting, UNICEF 2013 Global Report Livelihood The traditional round Zarma hut near Niamey, Niger. The Zarma villages traditionally consist of walled off compounds where a family group called windi lives. Each compound has a head male and a compound may have several separate huts, each hut with the different wives of the head male. The huts are traditionally roundhouses, or circular shaped structures made of mud walls with a thatched straw conical roof., Quote: \\"Huts are typically round with mud walls and straw roofs\\". The Zarma people grow corn, millet, sorghum, rice, tobacco, cotton and peanuts during the rainy season (June to November). They have traditionally owned herds of animals, which they rent out to others till they are ready to be sold for meat. Some own horses, a legacy of those Zerma people who historically belonged to the warrior class and were skilled cavalrymen in Islamic armies. Living along the River Niger, some Zarma people rely on fishing. The property inheritance and occupational descent is patrilineal. Many Zarma people, like Songhai, have migrated into coastal and prospering cities of West Africa, especially Ghana. Arts The Zarma people, like their neighboring ethnic groups in West Africa, have a rich tradition of music, group dance and singing. The common musical instruments that accompany these arts include gumbe (big drum), dondon (talking drums), molo or kuntigui (string instruments), goge (violin-like instrument). Some of this music also accompanies with folley, or spirit possession-related rituals.

Over 280 models of telephones support superdistribution based on OMA DRM; companies such as Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom have been exploring it. Superdistribution allows and indeed encourages digital products to be distributed freely in encrypted form, even as the product's owner retains control over the ability to use and modify the product. Superdistribution is a highly efficient means of distribution because distribution is not impeded by any barriers and anyone can become a distributor. A product made available through superdistribution may be free, in which case the user can use it immediately and without restriction, or restricted by means of Digital Rights Management (DRM). Restricted products generally require a license that the user must purchase either immediately or after a trial period (in the case of so-called demoware).

A remake of the 1973 film of the same name, it stars The Rock and Johnny Knoxville. Plot Honorably discharged U.S. Army Special Forces sergeant Chris Vaughn (The Rock) returns to his small home town in Kitsap County, Washington after a series of combat deployments. Looking for work, he finds the local cedar mill was closed down three years prior by its heir, Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough), who opened a new casino that now accounts for the majority of revenue for the local area. Hamilton, who was also Vaughn's school friend, invites him to a night of fun at the casino. While checking out the VIP lounge, Vaughn stumbles upon his childhood friend Deni (Ashley Scott), who is now working as a stripper. Later, he notices the craps dealer using loaded dice and demonstrates this to the patrons by placing a bet and calling out the roll before throwing the dice. When the floorman declares no payout, Vaughn instigates a fight. Although he beats down most of the security guards, he is subsequently subdued with a cattle prod and knocked unconscious. The security staff take Vaughn into the basement and Hamilton's right-hand man and head of security Booth (Kevin Durand) tortures him by cutting his torso with a utility knife before dumping him on a roadside. He is found by a trucker and hospitalized, but recovers quickly. Vaughn goes to the sheriff, Stan Watkins (Michael Bowen), to press charges against the guards, but Sheriff Watkins refuses to allow him to do so because the casino is viewed as too important to the town's economy, stating that because of its position, the casino is considered a \\"no fly zone\\". After this, Vaughn also learns that his nephew, Pete (Khleo Thomas), experimented with crystal meth, which was sold to his friends by the casino security guards. Infuriated, Vaughn goes to the casino, and using a piece of lumber as a club, begins destroying casino property, and brutally beats the security guards when they attempt to stop him. Vaughn is apprehended by Sheriff Watkins and his deputies as he is driving away from the scene. In the ensuing trial, all of Hamilton's security and staff testify against Vaughn. When the judge allows Vaughn to present his defense, he fires his appointed attorney, who is implicitly under Hamilton's employ. After making a civic speech about the town's great former self, Vaughn tells the jury and the rest of the town that if he is cleared of the charges, he will run for sheriff and clean up the town. To further emphasize his plea, Vaughn reveals the grotesque scars on his torso from his being tortured by the casino staff. He is then acquitted and wins the election for sheriff. Upon taking office, he summarily dismisses the entire police force and deputizes his friend, Ray Templeton (Johnny Knoxville), whom Vaughn feels he can trust, as well as help Vaughn learn about narcotics (Templeton revealed earlier that he served time in prison after becoming a drug addict). Vaughn and Templeton find drugs on Booth and they take him into custody. In an attempt to make him reveal information on the town drug operation, they hold him captive in a garage and proceed to strip his truck into pieces in front of him, but he does not talk. Vaughn assigns Templeton to stand watch over his house, as he knows Hamilton will likely target his family. Vaughn himself remains at the sheriff's office to supervise Booth. He is visited by Deni, stopping by under the pretense of bringing him food and reveals that she quit her job as the casino stripper. The two end up spending the night together in the office. The next morning, Watkins and his deputies arrive at the Sheriff's office where they blow up Vaughn's truck and fire upon the building with machine guns. Recognizing his dangerous predicament, Booth pleads for Vaughn to let him out of his cell, prompting Vaughn to use Booth's perilous situation as leverage for information. Booth reveals that the old mill is where the drugs are being produced, but is immediately killed by the indiscriminate fire of the attackers. Vaughn manages to kill all of the attackers with Deni's help. Vaughn's parents' house is attacked, but Templeton and Vaughn's father are able to dispatch the gunmen. After ensuring their safety, Vaughn heads for the mill where he discovers a meth lab as well as Hamilton, calmly waiting in a control room. Hamilton attempts to kill Vaughn with the mill equipment by dropping him through a trap door, but Vaughn drags Hamilton down with him and the two fall through a chute. Vaughn, whose leg is injured, manages to tend to his injury in a nearby forest before Hamilton attacks him with an axe. The two fight for their lives, with Vaughn ultimately coming out on top by beating Hamilton with a nearby uprooted tree, breaking his leg. Vaughn repeats what Hamilton said to him earlier \\"You're right, Jay. This does change our relationship. This is my town. You're under arrest.\\" And Hamilton is arrested and taken into custody, with Templeton's assistance, Vaughn shuts down the casino.

The name of the dish is also occasionally rendered as Jigs dinner or Jigg's dinner. In the rendering \\"Jigg's dinner\\", the apostrophe is incorrectly placed if in reference to the McManus character. Sometimes referred to colloquially as \\"JD\\", \\"Jiggs dinner\\" is the most common of all renderings. Ingredients The meal most typically consists of salt beef (or salt riblets), boiled together with potatoes, carrot, cabbage, turnip, and cabbage or turnip greens. Pease pudding and figgy duff are cooked in pudding bags immersed in the rich broth that the meat and vegetables create. Condiments are likely to include mustard pickles, pickled beets, cranberry sauce, butter, and a thin gravy made from the drippings of the roasted meat.Jiggs Dinner from Newfoundland recipe The leftover vegetables from a Jiggs dinner are often mixed into a pan and fried to make a dish known as \\"cabbage hash\\" or \\"corned beef and cabbage hash\\", much like bubble and squeak. It is also a traditional Saint Patrick's Day meal in North America. Many restaurants serve Jiggs dinner on and near March 17.

Versus became the NHL's cable partner in the United States beginning in the 2005‚Äì06 season from previous partner ESPN, providing coverage of regular season games, playoff games, and select games from the Stanley Cup Finals. Before the beginning of the 2011‚Äì12 season, Comcast‚Äîthe owners of Versus‚Äîacquired a majority stake in NBC Universal, the parent company of the NBC and the NHL's current American broadcast television partner. As a result of this merger and the impending relaunch of Versus as the NBC Sports Network in 2012, all NHL telecasts on Versus were re-branded under the NHL on NBC name beginning with the 2011‚Äì12 season. History The NHL on OLN logo, used until the switch of the network's name to Versus. The NHL's television deal with Versus was made at the conclusion of the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout that caused the cancellation of an entire season. At the time, Versus offered a two-year, US$130 million contract (with a network option for a third year) that delivered guaranteed money for Commissioner Gary Bettman (ESPN, which previously held the rights and broadcast games on ESPN National Hockey Night, wanted a revenue-sharing deal similar to NBC's). Versus was expected to use NHL coverage to show it was a legitimate suitor for Major League Baseball and National Football League packages that were to be negotiated later in 2005, but they did not land agreements with either league. In 2007, the NHL signed an agreement to extend the NHL on Versus to the 2010‚Äì2011 season. Versus paid $72.5 million for 2007‚Äì2008 and will pay inflationary increases over the next three years. In 2011, Comcast acquired a majority stake in NBC Universal. In April, NBCUniversal announced that it had reached a 10-year deal to unify the broadcast and cable rights to the NHL, in a contract valued at $2 billion. The deal would maintain and/or expand most of the existing broadcast arrangements on both networks, with Versus carrying 90 regular season games per-season, playoff games (with other NBCUniversal channels such as USA Network available as overflow for national broadcasts of all playoff games), and games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup. It was also stated that Versus would be rebranded under the NBC Sports name to reflect its integration of the division, later revealed to be NBC Sports Network. As part of the transition to NBCSN (which officially launched on January 1, 2012), the NHL on Versus branding was dropped from NHL telecasts on Versus beginning in the 2011-12 season, with all games now carrying the NHL on NBC branding. Coverage The network broadcast at least 54 games during the regular season (usually two games per week, sometimes three or just one), plus the All-Star Game, Skills Competition, and YoungStars game. At the end of the season, the network would have blanket coverage of the playoffs, culminating in the first two games of the Stanley Cup Finals. Versus also shows the NHL Awards Show and first round of the NHL Draft. Versus scheduled a few doubleheaders during the regular season (consisting of a game in the Eastern Time Zone or Central Time Zone, and then a Mountain or Pacific Time Zone game). Playoff coverage usually involved doubleheaders throughout the first two rounds, except weekends prior to 2007‚Äì08, when NBC often televised multiple games during its broadcast windows. Under the terms of the contract running from 2007‚Äì2011, Versus aired 54 or more NHL games each season, generally on Monday and Tuesday nights, and provided coverage of as many Stanley Cup Playoff games as possible (generally two per night in the first two rounds; the Conference Finals are usually played on alternating days), and two games of the Stanley Cup Finals (Games 3 and 4 in , and ). Much of the framework of the Versus deal continues to be the basis of NBCSN's coverage. The \\"Game of the Week\\" Included in the schedule was a \\"Game of the Week\\" for selected dates. In this \\"Exclusive\\" time period, which was created in 2006‚Äì07, no other National Hockey League game could be broadcast involving a team based in the United States and, in most cases, no other game was scheduled unless it involves two Canadian teams(or a Canadian team visiting an American team, which was aired on NHL Center Ice, using the TSN or Rogers Sportsnet feed). Regional carriers are allowed to air games outside Versus' exclusive window. Like NBC, games aired on The NHL on Versus usually featured teams based in the United States, with the exception of playoffs. As previously mentioned, for the first two playoff rounds, Versus occasionally simulcast TSN or CBC feeds depending on the schedule and match- ups, although it made a commitment to offering its own production in most cases. (This practice continues on NBCSN.) The selection of teams for The NHL on Versus was somewhat more diverse (possibly because there are more game slots to air) than its broadcast partner, NBC. Because of inordinately high ratings in the Buffalo and Pittsburgh markets, Versus had made note to air a significant number of games featuring the Buffalo Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins. Traditionally ratings-friendly teams such as the New York Rangers, Detroit Red Wings, and Boston Bruins, along with the Comcast-owned Philadelphia Flyers, also got selected regularly, frequently at or near the maximum of nine appearances per team during the regular season. Any regular season game selected by Versus aired exclusively on that network, which had caused controversy due to the relative lack of availability of Versus compared to other channels like ESPN (a similar situation developed with Thursday Night Football on the NFL Network, but unlike the NHL games on Versus, these games are not exclusive to NFL Network, and must be simulcast over-the-air in the primary markets of the participating teams). Hockey Central and NHL Live Versus also provided postgame coverage after every game they broadcast. The postgame show was initially known as Hockey Central, airing from their Stamford, Connecticut studios. Beginning in the 2011‚Äì12 season, the program was renamed NHL Live, and began incorporating NHL on NBC personalities. Playoff coverage During the playoffs, Versus' first-round and second- round games could have been subject to blackout in the participating teams' regional markets (although they have exclusivity for two second-round games per series). Versus regained full national coverage for its Conference and Stanley Cup Final telecasts. Beginning with the 2006 playoffs, Versus simulcast the CBC's coverage of some games, generally first and second round matchups from Western Canada, instead of using their own crews and announcers. In the early 1990s, SportsChannel America covered the Stanley Cup playoffs in a similar fashion. Versus continued to use CBC and TSN feeds to augment its own playoff coverage, sometimes even picking up a Canadian broadcast of a game involving two American teams. (NBCSN, Versus' successor, does so as well - even incorporating coverage from Comcast-owned regional sports networks.) In 2007, Canadians accused the NHL of giving the CBC second billing to Versus' coverage of the playoffs. Since the 2011‚Äì2012 season, NBC Sports and NBCSN have exclusive rights to the entire Stanley Cup playoffs starting in round 2 (Conference Semifinals), and non-exclusive rights for the first round (Conference Quarterfinals), and will air each game nationally. Ratings Versus had about 20 million fewer subscribers than ESPN when the NHL started on Versus, but its owner Comcast switched Versus from a digital tier to basic cable to make NHL games available to more cable subscribers as well as re- branded the network (which was then known as the Outdoor Life Network) as a sports network. For Versus, the NHL coverage was a good addition as Versus' ratings grew by about 275% when it showed an NHL game. 2005‚Äì06 Versus' games rated substantially higher than any non-Tour de France programming that Versus had ever aired in comparable timeslots (rating between 0.2 and 0.3 during the regular season). Still, these numbers were quite small compared to ratings for most other sports on national cable channels reaching at least as many homes as Versus. Versus' playoff viewership did not increase as much as it or the league might have hoped. Versus reached a viewership of 610,836 households for Game 1 of the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals. This figure was 39% fewer households than what ESPN drew for the Stanley Cup series opener two years earlier (though ESPN has a larger reach than Versus). Game 2 was seen in slightly fewer households (605,501). 2006‚Äì07 Versus averaged a 0.2 Nielsen Media Research household rating, about level with the 2005‚Äì06 regular season NHL numbers and its 2006 prime time average. Versus' coverage of the 2007 All-Star Game garnered a .7 rating (474,298 viewing homes and 672,948 total viewers). Ratings were down 76% from ABC's ratings in 2004, the last time the game was played, and down 82% from ABC's coverage in 2000. However, some of that significant drop can be attributed to the game being played on a weeknight (Wednesday) as opposed to the traditional weekend game, and the fact that Versus is a cable television network unlike ABC which is a broadcast network. The 2008 All-Star Game was scheduled for a Sunday. 2007‚Äì08 In 2007‚Äì08, NHL audiences on Versus in the United States remained small, but increased over the previous two seasons. Versus averaged 246,154 viewers a game, up 24 percent from the previous year. Over the year, channel distribution increased to 73.6 million households from 70.8 million. Conference Finals ratings were averaging a 1.2 HH rating. Game 2 between the Flyers and Penguins drew a 1.7 HH rating, 2.3 million viewers; an NHL record on Versus.

It comprises two competitive pipe bands that compete in the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association's competitions each year. The bands compete in Grades 3 and 4. Since the late 1980s until 2018 it also had a Grade 1 band. History The organisation was founded in 1906 as the Vale of Atholl Pipers Association, with the Marquess of Tullibardine as patron and led by pipe major Mitchell Pirnie. The band started in competing in competition in 1931 under the leadership of Robert Pirnie, and played at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. Ian Duncan, brother of Gordon Duncan, joined the band in 1965 and took over as Pipe Major in 1973. The band first entered competitions organised by the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association in 1977, starting in Grade 4, but by 1983 the band had been promoted to Grade 1. The band came second in the Champion of Champions table during the 1980s, and won the European and British Championship titles in 1988 and 1989 respectively. In 1993, the band reached a sponsorship agreement with Macnaughtons of Pitlochry, and changed its tartan from traditional Murray of Atholl tartan to the Muted Macnaughton. For much of this period, the organisation had a feeder system of youngsters who competed in the Novice Juvenile and Juvenile grades. Andy Renwick succeeded Ian Duncan as Pipe Major of the Grade 1 band at the end of 2000, and in 2002 sponsorship was secured with Robert Wiseman Dairies. Adrian Cramb took over the role of Pipe Major in 2008. Alastair McNab took over the role of Lead Drummer in 2013, replacing Crawford Allan. By this time the organisation's Novice Juvenile and Juvenile bands were ended and replaced with Grade 3 and Grade 4 bands.

The book is different from most Jaqueline Wilson books, as they are mostly told by characters who are not popular in school and are usually bullied by the popular students. Plot Charlotte Alice Katherine Enright (who prefers to be called Charlie, but is called Charlotte by her current teacher) is an eleven-year-old girl who lives with her mother, Jo, in a flat. She is the most popular girl in her school and because of that, she has a lot of friends. And of which her two best friends are called Angela Robinson and Lisa Field. When her class's form teacher, Mrs. Thomas, goes on maternity leave, she is replaced by a strict woman called Miss Beckworth, whom Charlie immediately dislikes. She calls Charlie by her birth name, Charlotte (even though that Charlie explained that everybody calls her Charlie) and she also forces Charlie to sit next to an intelligent boy, James Edwards, whom Charlie hates. Miss Beckworth sets the class a history project on the Victorians, and Charlie assumes that the topic will be boring and decides not to listen for the first lesson ‚Äì until she finds a picture of a Victorian servant girl who looks just like her. Charlie decides to write a diary, told from the point of view of her character Lottie who is eleven years old, like Charlie; however she has left school to become a servant. Jo loses her job as a shop manageress (who used to be in charge of a staff of twelve, at Elite Electricals) and has to take up cleaning in a supermarket, cleaning houses, and looking after a young boy called Robin to earn money to pay for her flat and mortgage. Jo takes a shine to Robin's single father, Mark, much to Charlie's despair - though Jo insists he is just a friend. Following a trip to a theme park, Charlie and Robin witness Mark and Jo kissing on a ride - though and they are both embarrassed afterwards. Charlie, upset by this, tells Robin that neither of his parents (Robin's mother's new partner does not get on with Robin) want him any more. Distressed, Robin runs away, leaving Mark and Jo distraught for the boy's safety, and Charlie guilt-ridden. In a subplot, Lottie, the servant girl Charlie had created, gets a job as a nursery maid, looking after three young and very irritating children ‚Äì Victor, Louisa and baby Freddie. Whilst at the park, Freddie is snatched from his pram after Lottie angrily storms off. Lottie is upset and distressed at the loss of the little boy, mirroring Charlie's own feelings towards the disappearance of Robin. Robin is found in a train station behind packages waiting to be delivered. He is freezing and is rushed to hospital. Mark is very upset with Charlie (after she admits to him, Jo and the police what she had said to Robin) and even though Charlie is relieved that Robin is no longer missing, she is still distraught as he catches pneumonia.

The state highway runs from U.S. Route 501 and US 29 Business in Lynchburg north to US 29 Business in Madison Heights. SR 163 is the original alignment of US 29 through Lynchburg, a highway has been twice bypassed: first by the Lynchburg Expressway and later by US 29's present bypass. The state highway provides access to downtown Lynchburg and many other historic neighborhoods of the independent city. Route description View south along SR 163 at Monroe Street in Lynchburg SR 163 begins as Wards Road, a five-lane road with center turn lane, at a partial interchange with US 501 (Lynchburg Expressway) and US 29 Business (Wards Road) adjacent to the River Ridge Mall on the south side of Lynchburg. Wards Road continues south as US 29 Business toward a junction with US 29 and US 460. There is no direct access from southbound SR 163 to northbound US 29 and southbound US 501, or from southbound US 29 and northbound US 501 to northbound SR 163. The missing movements are made via SR 163's intersection with SR 128 (Candler Mountain Road), which has a full interchange with US 501 and US 29 Business (Lynchburg Expressway) to the east. SR 163 continues north as Wards Road across Norfolk Southern Railway's Blue Ridge District to US 460 Business (Fort Avenue). The two highways run concurrently northeast as a four-lane undivided highway to the Fort Early and Jubal Early Monument, where SR 163 diverges north as two- lane Memorial Avenue at an acute intersection. Access from southbound SR 163 to eastbound US 460 Business and from westbound US 460 Business to northbound SR 163 is provided through Oakridge Boulevard. SR 163 continues north toward downtown Lynchburg. The state highway intersects US 221 (Oakley Avenue) and US 501 Business (Langhorne Road) and passes the historic home Centerview before crossing Norfolk Southern's Danville District rail line and becoming 5th Street. SR 163 passes the Old City Cemetery, Pyramid Motors, and the Kentucky Hotel on its way to a roundabout with Federal Street. Federal Street leads northwest into the Garland Hill Historic District, which contains the historic Lynchburg Hospital; and southeast into the Federal Hill Historic District, which preserves the William Phaup House, Lynch's Brickyard House, and the Dr. Robert Walter Johnson House and Tennis Court. SR 163 continues northeast along the northern edge of downtown Lynchburg, passing by the Western Hotel and near many more historic buildings and cultural sites in the Court House Hill- Downtown and Lower Basin historic districts in downtown Lynchburg. At the northern corner of downtown Lynchburg, SR 163 intersects the one-way pair of Church Street and Main Street, which combine to head northwest as Rivermont Avenue toward the Daniel's Hill and Rivermont historic districts. The state highway exits the city as Amherst Highway on a four-lane bridge over the James River and CSX's James River Subdivision into Amherst County. After reducing to two lanes and ascending out of the river valley, SR 163 meets the western end of SR 210 (Colony Road), which connects the highway with US 29 Business and US 29. The state highway continues north through a partial diamond interchange with US 29 Business (Lynchburg Expressway) that allows access from SR 163 to southbound US 29 Business, from northbound US 29 Business to SR 163, and from southbound US 29 Business to southbound SR 163. SR 163 gains a second lane northbound for its final stretch to its northern terminus at an intersection with US 29 Business that serves as the northern end of the Lynchburg Expressway.

This thriller film is adapted from the novel of the same name by Argentine mathematician and writer Guillermo Mart√≠nez. The film stars Elijah Wood, John Hurt, Leonor Watling and Julie Cox. Plot The plaster cast of Trajan's Column at the Victoria and Albert is discussed in the film. In 1993, Martin (Elijah Wood), a US student at the University of Oxford, wants Arthur Seldom (John Hurt) as his thesis supervisor. He idolises Seldom and has learned all about him. He takes accommodation in Oxford at the house of Mrs. Eagleton (Anna Massey), an old friend of Seldom. Also in the house is her daughter, Beth (Julie Cox), who is her full-time caregiver ‚Äì which she resents bitterly ‚Äì and a musician by occupation. In a public lecture, Seldom quotes Wittgenstein's Tractatus to deny the possibility of absolute truth. Hoping to impress his idol, Martin disputes this, asserting his faith in the absolute truth of mathematics: \\"I believe in the number pi\\". Seldom humiliates him, ridiculing his arguments and making him look foolish in front of the audience. Disillusioned, Martin decides to abandon his studies and goes to his office to collect his belongings. There, he encounters his office-mate, a bitter mathematician Podorov (Burn Gorman), who also failed to become a student of Seldom's. Martin then returns to his residence, where he finds Seldom arriving to visit Mrs. Eagleton. The two men enter the house together and find Martin's landlady murdered. Seldom tells the police that he had received a note with his friend's address marked as \\"the first of a series\\". As Seldom is an authority on logical series, he argues that a serial killer is using murder as a way to challenge his intelligence. According to Seldom, \\"The only perfect crime that exists is not the one that remains unsolved, but the one which is solved with the wrong culprit.\\"\\"Elijah wood in 'The Oxford Murders',\\" The Hollywood Reporter. 28 June 2010; the credit for coining this clever phrase, which was highlighted in the trailer, goes to Guillermo Martinez Martin and Seldom discuss how easily the murder of the old lady might have been overlooked, particularly as she already suffered from terminal cancer. Martin suggests that the murderer is committing \\"imperceptible murders\\", meaning that the killer is choosing victims who are already dying therefore meaning that the police would be less likely to suspect foul play. Martin goes to the hospital where his girlfriend Lorna (Leonor Watling) works. There he meets a religious fanatic (Dominique Pinon), who has a daughter in dire need of a lung transplant. He also runs into Seldom, who is visiting Kalman (Alex Cox), a former student who went mad and suffers from a debilitating cancer, with bone involvement. Soon after, the patient who shares the room with Seldom's friend dies of an apparent lethal injection and the authorities receive a second symbol: two interlocking arcs. Martin and Lorna's relationship becomes strained as he becomes more obsessed with Seldom and the murders and discovers that Lorna had once been Seldom's lover. At a Guy Fawkes Night concert, Martin sees Podorov acting suspiciously and the police give chase, only to discover that Podorov had merely intended to hang an insulting banner from the school roof. While they are distracted a member of the orchestra collapses and dies from respiratory failure. A drawing of a triangle is found on his music stand. Afterwards, Seldom tells Martin a story about a nineteenth century man who had written a diary listing ways to kill his wife. When the wife discovered the diary she killed her husband but was acquitted by a jury on grounds of self- defence. Decades later, the diary was discovered to have been forged by the woman's lover. Seldom uses this story to explain that the perfect crime is not one which is never solved, but one which is solved incorrectly. All of Oxford's mathematics community is excited as a local researcher claims to have solved Fermat's last theorem. The mathematicians, including Seldom and Martin, board a bus to head to the conference, but Martin jumps out after seeing Lorna passing on the street. The two reconcile and agree to take a long holiday away from Oxford, mathematics, and Seldom. After making love with Lorna, Martin realises that the sequence the killer has sent them all consist of Pythagorean symbols and that the fourth one will be a tetractys, consisting of ten points. The police, thinking that the killer is obsessed with Seldom, believe that he means to target the bus which Seldom and the other mathematicians are on. However, the killer, as Martin realises, is actually the man he had met at the hospital. The man is a bus driver for a school for developmentally disabled children. Seeing the students as unfit to live and wanting to provide organ donors to save his own daughter's life, he blows up his bus, killing the children inside and himself. Afterwards, the police theorise that he had planned to escape the blast alive and had committed the other murders to present the deaths of the schoolchildren as the work of a serial killer, thus shifting blame from himself. Afterwards, Lorna and Martin prepare to leave Oxford. However, Martin realises that Seldom has been lying to him the entire time. As Lorna leaves in disgust, Martin travels to meet Seldom. He explains what he has figured out. Beth, wanting to be relieved of the responsibility of caring for her mother, had murdered the old woman as the police had initially suspected. In a panic, she had called Seldom, who came over to help cover up the crime. But Seldom arrived just as Martin did and so could not clean up the crime scene. Instead, he invented the story about receiving a note from the killer to throw suspicion off of Beth. The man at the hospital had died of natural causes with Seldom merely creating a fake injection mark and leaving a symbol behind. The death of the musician at the concert was a fortuitous accident which Seldom took advantage of. Seldom argues that while he did indeed lie, his actions resulted in no deaths. However, Martin points out that the bus bomber took his inspiration from Seldom's string of murders. Seldom counters that all actions have unintended consequences and that one of Martin's casual comments to Beth had led to her murdering her mother. Mathematical and philosophical references The characters debate several mathematical, physical and philosophical concepts such as logical series, Wittgenstein's rule-following paradox, Heisenberg's Principle of Uncertainty, G√∂del's Theorem, circles, the Vesica Piscis, the possibility of perfect crime, Fermat's Last Theorem and its proof by Professor Wiles, the Taniyama conjecture, the tetraktys and the Pythagoreans. There are references, also, of the Butterfly effect. Artistic license \\"Logic series\\" is not actually an established topic in mathematical logic or mathematics. Contrary to what Seldom states in his lecture at the beginning of the film, the argument of Wittgenstein's Tractatus does not actually proceed by the use of equations (with the exception of a few simple equations in Wittgenstein's introduction of the truth tables) and it is not expressed in the formal language of mathematical logic; the argument is rather a philosophical argument expressed in normal, albeit idiosyncratic, language. Moreover, Professor Andrew Wiles, who solved Fermat's Last Theorem, is represented as \\"Professor Wilkin\\" of Cambridge University in the film, and Fermat's Last Theorem is represented as \\"Bormat's Last Theorem\\". Contrary to a statement made early in the film, electromechanical computers (namely the \\"Bombe\\") played a crucial role in the breaking of the German \\"Enigma\\" cipher by British (and earlier, Polish) cryptographers during WW2.

Specimen of an International Certificate for Operators of Pleasure Craft in accordance with Resolution No. 40 of the UN/ECE Working Party on Inland Water Transport. France specimen of an International Certificate. An International Certificate of Competence (ICC) is a certificate, which may be issued to anyone who has successfully completed certain national boating licenses or has passed an examination to prove the necessary competence for pleasure craft operation. ICC is the only sailing license approved by United Nations as a legitimate recreational sailing licenseOnline Sailing Certification and Endorsement Programs Worldwide. Persons wishing to be tested in the United Kingdom need to be tested by an approved ICC test centre Although only guaranteed to be accepted in countries that have adopted the relevant UN Resolution, the ICC is a useful document to carry and will generally be accepted where proof of competence is required. In very general terms an ICC is required for the inland waterways of Europe and for inland and coastal waters of Mediterranean countries. For the coastal waters of Northern Europe the ICC is generally not required, however to all of these generalisations there are exceptions. Description of the ICC The ICC is a product of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Inland Water Committee (UN ECE IWC) Resolution 40 (hereafter called Resolution 40). This states that the ICC may be issued by a government of one state to its nationals and residents who may be on the waters of a foreign state, on condition that both accept the requirements and conditions set out in Resolution 40. Governments may appoint competent authorities to issue ICC on their behalf. Globally International Yacht Training Worldwide (IYT) has been delegated such authority by both Ireland and the UK, and the Royal Yachting Association (RYA)Some Good News Regarding the International Certificate of Competence and the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) are both authorized by the UK. The ICC provides documentary assurance from one government to another that the holder meets the levels of competence laid down in Resolution 40. However, the acceptance of Resolution 40 is often caveated. History of the ICC The origins of the ICC arose from navigation on the Rhine and the Danube (Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine) and the need for reassurance that vessel operators were competent to ensure safety of navigation and protection of the environment as they moved from one country to another. As a result, on 29 January 1979, the United Nations Working Party on Inland Water Transport adopted Resolution 14, which recommended the introduction of a European document for an International Certificate (International Card) to provide those assurances. The Resolution was also intended to facilitate 'waterborne tourism'. Until then operators could well have been expected to produce competency certificates for each country whose waters they were on. In the mid-nineties, the Working Group on Inland Water Transport considered that Resolution 14 needed updating and strengthening and on 16 October 1998 the Working Party adopted their revisions as Resolution 40; this replaced Resolution 14. The International Certificate for Operators of Pleasure Craft created in Resolution 40 is now more commonly referred to as the International Certificate of Competence or simply ICC. The ICC is only applicable where the visited state has also adopted or recognises the ICC as a valid standard of competency. Application of the ICC Resolution 40 not only included operators of pleasure craft bound for or on the inland and coastal waters of foreign states but specifically included bareboat charter vessels. Significantly, it also set out the nautical, regulatory and technical competency requirements to be achieved and a minimum age (16 years of age) for the issue of an ICC irrespective of individual national schemes. It is the professional opinion of the UNECE IWC that the standards set out in Resolution 40 provide a reasonable and appropriate level of competence for day sailing with due regard to the safety of navigation and crew and the protection of the environment. It is strongly recommended that governments recognise this rather than be drawn into discussions on where the ICC may or may not fit into their own national schemes ‚Äì much the same as acceptance of the international driving licence. As of 2013 only 22 countries have adopted either resolution so far, of which 16 are EU member states. In reality many countries choose to accept the ICC even though they have not adopted the resolution ‚Äì but of course this is on their terms and can be subject to local variations. Spain, Greece and Portugal, for example, have not adopted Resolution 40 but are still most likely to ask visitors for an ICC. In reality, the ICC is more widely accepted as proof of the holder‚Äôs competence than adoption of Resolution 40 would suggest. Implementation of Resolution 40 The following UNECE member states have adopted Resolution 40 and thus officially accept the ICC as a proof of competence in their territories: Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa (not a member state), Switzerland the United Kingdom and Ukraine. Implementation of Resolution 14 The following UNECE member states have adopted the earlier Resolution 14. Also these countries accept the ICC: France, Italy and Poland. States that have not adopted Resolution 40 The following UNECE member states have not accepted the Resolution 40 nor the Resolution 14: Greece, Moldova, Portugal, Spain, Russian Federation, Serbia, Sweden and the United States. Individual states Finland Finland has adopted the resolution but does not require the ICC for normal yachts (\\"sufficient age and skill\\" is enough) and does not use CEVNI for its inland waters. Some official and some quality assured non- official certificates (mainly the coastal master certificates of the navigation association and the scouts) are regarded as fulfilling knowledge requirements of ICC for coastal waters.Trafi: Internationellt beh√∂righetsbrev f√∂r f√∂rare av fritidsb√•t Courses for the CEVNI part are arranged separately by many organisations. The certificate itself is issued by the authorities, usually based on such documents. The ICC is required for masters of boats chartered manned for international voyages (in addition to a domestic certificate) and for masters of recreational vessels with length more than 24 metres.Lag om fartygspersonal och s√§kerhetsorganisation f√∂r fartyg (29.12.2009/1687) Ireland IYT Worldwide is authorized by the Irish Department of Transport to issue ICCs to any nationality provided they meet the knowledge and competency standards required. The Irish Sailing Association is authorized by the Irish Department of Transport. Uniquely, IYT Worldwide has been approved by the Irish Government to issue ICC s to any qualified applicants of any nationality on their behalf. The ICC enables owners vessels to use them in those European waters where an ICC is required, and proves to local authorities that the skipper has the required Irish qualifications for skippering the vessel. United Kingdom International Yacht Training Worldwide (IYT Worldwide), The Royal Yachting Association (RYA), and the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) are with the authority of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) approved to issue ICCs to those who meet the mandated requirements and the competency requirements. ICC's are able to be issued by these Associations to citizens of Nations who are not signatories. In this manner, for example, USA citizens can gain the ICC. In the USA, NauticEd International Sailing Education facilitates the issuance of the ICC through the UK government via the Royal Yachting Association. UK ICCs are for use on British registered vessels in the waters of foreign states that participate in Resolution 40, without the need to comply with those states‚Äô national certification requirements. An ICC does not enable a British ICC holder to skipper a non-British registered vessel. If a British skipper wants to skipper a non-British registered vessel then he/she must be qualified per the regulations of the country in which the vessel is registered. The UK ICC was only available to British citizens or bona fide British residents. This has now been extended to cover other Nationals. Estonia Estonia requires operators of a small pleasure craft (2.5-24m with 25sqm sail area or 25kW+ power) to have an International Certificate of Competence .

It is considered a medical emergency because it can quickly result in life-threatening infection and death. Any cause of bowel ischemia, the earlier reversible form of injury, may ultimately lead to infarction if uncorrected. The causes of bowel ischemia or infarction include primary vascular causes (for example, mesenteric ischemia) and other causes of bowel obstruction.  Causes  Primary vascular causes of bowel infarction, also known as mesenteric ischemia, are due to blockages in the arteries or veins that supply the bowel. Types of mesenteric ischemia are generally separated into acute and chronic processes, because this helps determine treatment and prognosis. Bowel obstruction is most often caused by intestinal adhesions, which frequently form after abdominal surgeries, or by chronic infections such as diverticulitis, hepatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The condition may be difficult to diagnose, as the symptoms may resemble those of other bowel disorders. Bowel volvulus describes a specific form of bowel obstruction, where the intestine and/or mesentery are twisted, resulting in ischemia. Diagnosis  Management  An infarcted or dead intestinal segment is a serious medical problem because of the fact that intestines contain non-sterile contents within the lumen. Although the fecal content and high bacterial loads of the intestine are normally safely contained, progressive ischemia causes tissue breakdown and inevitably leads to bacteria spreading to the bloodstream. Untreated bowel infarction quickly leads to life-threatening infection and sepsis, and may be fatal. The only treatment for bowel infarction is immediate surgical repair and eventually removal of the dead bowel segment. Patients who have undergone extensive resection of the small bowel may develop malabsorption, indicating the need for dietary supplements. Additional images Bowel infarction.

Hasan, together with his friend, Grand Vizier Koca Yusuf Pasha, both important figures in the politics of the Ottoman Empire, convinced the Sultan Abdul Hamid I to name Mavrogenes prince of Wallachia on 6 April 1786.Ionescu, p.172-175 He left the Ottoman capital accompanied by a huge and ostentatious retinue.Djuvara, p.44 Unlike other Greek princes of Wallachia chosen by the Sultan, Mavrogenes was not born in Phanar and, as the Greek elites of Constantinople (the Phanariotes) saw this as a decrease in their influence, they tried to bribe Abdul Hamid with 4,000 bags of gold, in order to obtain Yusuf Pasha's ousting from office; nevertheless, the sultan disagreed, and the treasurer of the empire, who had proposed the deal, was arrested, tortured and killed.Ionescu, p.175 Ruler of Wallachia Boyar Council On 15 May 1786, Mavrogenes reached VƒÉcƒÉre≈üti, near Bucharest, and on 17 May he was ceremoniously crowned and settled at the princely residence of Curtea NouƒÉ. One of his first decrees was issued four days later, when he announced that all the people of Wallachia could address their grievances directly to him. He even set up a gazebo in T√¢rgul de afarƒÉ (Obor), so that peasants could speak to him.Giurescu, p.104-105; Ionescu, p.186 He also attempted to erect stakes on all major crossroads, to show the people what would happen to them if they engaged in theft or murder, or if they failed to attend church services. During the same year, he ordered the building of an aqueduct, which, although completed, was destroyed during the conflicts that followed his rule, and never fully rebuilt.Djuvara, p.207 Mavrogenes was also involved in the Orthodox Church, decreeing that places of worship were to be permanently open; according to chronicles of the time (Dionisie Eclesiarhul), churches were always full during service, for the duration of his rule ‚Äî not because of fear of divine punishment, but rather due to fear of the law. Mavrogenes also demanded that Wallachians should lead an austere life and, as such, forbade his people from feasting or lingering in taverns for more than one hour after sunset. On 10 January 1787 he signed a degree which allowed Jews to be tax exempt and gave them a plot of land in mahalaua Popescului neighbourhood of Bucharest for them to build a synagogue (see History of the Jews in Romania).Ionescu, p.185-190 Mavrogenes often extorted money from the boyars, for which he cited as pretext his recurring dreams, in which he claimed to have been commanded random killings or banishments, effects which he was allowed to avert only if paid a certain sum. In order to mock the boyars, he even gave his horse the rank of clucer and assigned him a bedroom right next to his own, on the second floor of the Court Palace. Mavrogenes awarded those people who paid him enough money boyar ranks and privileges, and even revoked the title for boyars who refused to pay him the amount he demanded.Ionescu, p.192-194 He sometimes staged incognito inspections, to observe the activities of boyar officials. In the 1787 War On 24 August 1787 the Ottomans declared war on the Russian Empire and imprisoned the Russian ambassador, Yakov Bulgakov, in the Seven Towers. Mavrogenes replicated the gesture of the Grand Vizier, and arrested Ivan Ivanovich Severin, Russia's consul in Wallachia. Severin was soon freed, after the intervention of Georg Ignaz, Freiherr von Metzburg, the Habsburg consul, who described Mavrogenes as acting maniacally and being terrified by the prospect of being at war.Ionescu, p.201 As the city of Bucharest was spread over a large area and lacked any kind of fortifications, Mavrogenes decided to build some, including the digging of a moat from Cotroceni to Oborul Vechi, as well as reinforcing the walls of inns and monasteries (which were thus turned into crude fortresses). Unlike any other Phanariote ruler, he raised his own army, which reached 5‚Äì10,000 men and was equipped with several cannons, but it was unruly and poorly trained. In addition, Mavrogenes asked for the Ottoman army to help him seal the border with Habsburg Transylvania and reinforce the borders with Moldavia.Ionescu, p.202-204 During that period, Mavrogenes used the services of Perdicari, an astrologer whom he trusted, and used both the predictions and his dreams for decisions in time of war, such as attacking the city of Kronstadt (present-day Bra≈üov).Ionescu, p.196 On 21 November a Habsburg army of 20,000 men, located in the Banat and led by Prince Josias of Coburg, started pressuring the Wallachian border and soon occupied fortified spots such as the Tismana and Sinaia monasteries; nevertheless, Mavrogenes continued to dismiss evidence of a Habsburg-Russian alliance. Two months later, on 28 January 1788, the boyars were summoned and informed that the Russians, led by Alexander Suvorov, had entered Moldavia, and that 25 of them were to lead military units and leave for Foc≈üani as soon as possible, to engage Russian troops. However, just as the boyar contingents reached BuzƒÉu, they were ordered to return ‚Äî it became apparent that Mavrogenes was just testing to see if boyars would betray him (indeed, two of them, members of the C√¢mpineanu and Cantacuzino families, fled to Transylvania). In order to avoid other betrayals, Mavrogenes arrested all the Wallachian boyars and dispatched them to an Ottoman fortress.Ionescu, p.206-207 On 9 February 1788, Joseph II, the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor, declared war on the Ottoman Empire and started spreading manifestos in Wallachia which explained the war's purpose and promised to \\"free the Romanian people from the Turkish yoke\\". At that time, Mavrogenes' army had about 11,000 soldiers, and there was also an army of about 15,000 Turks assisting him. With these forces, he obtained a few victories in the battles of T√¢rgu Jiu and C√¢mpulung, and was able to prevent a Habsburg invasion for about a year.Ionescu, p.208; 210-211; 215 These victories, together with the predictions astrologer made him confident in a victory and attacked Kronstadt from July to October 1788, but failed to take the city.Ionescu, p.215-216 As the winter of 1788-1789 was harsh, no further military actions were carried out. After Abdul Hamid died in April, the new sultan, Selim III, gave Mavrogenes about 5-6,000 soldiers from Rumelia.Ionescu, p.217 Coburg's troops being welcomed in Bucharest In the meantime, the Russian army reported victories in Moldavia and rendezvoused with the Habsburg Army in Adjud, advancing toward Wallachia. On 21 July 1789 they fought the Wallacho-Ottoman army led by Grand Vizier Koca Yusuf Pasha in the Battle of Foc≈üani, with an undecided result. A second confrontation occurred as the Battle of Rymnik; more than 10,000 died on the Ottomans' side.Ionescu, p.217-218 Mavrogenes fled Bucharest on 26 October, accompanied by an army of 1,000 men, after appointing Dumitru Turnavitu as temporary Caimacam. Most Wallachians welcomed Prince Coburg's army,Giurescu, p.106 and the local boyars accepted a document which basically annexed Wallachia, while keeping autonomy to the same level as within the Ottoman Empire.Ionescu, p.223 The country was, however, soon hit by a major plague and famine; these were still claiming lives after the end of the war and through the early years of Alexander Mourousis' rule. In June 1790, Mavrogenes, joined by a new Ottoman invading force, occupied the village of Calafat, but, after being attacked and defeated by the Habsburg troops, retreated and, all alone, crossed the Danube in a small boat. He wandered from village to village on the Bulgarian shore, until September 1790, when a kapucu sent by the Sultan killed him in the village of Byala. His body was buried on the shore of the Danube, while his head was sent to Constantinople, where it was impaled on a stake. His bones were later moved by his daughter, Eufrosina, to the Church of the Holy Apostles in Brussa.Ionescu, p.226-227 Legacy and reputation Mavrogenes in a deer-drawn carriage Rigas Feraios, the Greek revolutionary who was a clerk for the Wallachian court, considered Mavrogenes \\"a villain, unworthy to be the ruler of Wallachia\\";Ionescu, p.197 Feraios had begun a lifelong friendship with Osman Pazvantoƒülu, future pasha and rebel leader, who at the time was a soldier in Mavrogenes' service ‚Äî on one occasion, he defended and rescued Pazvantoƒülu from the prince's wrath. Thomas Hope, who knew Mavrogenes personally, made him a character in a novel called Anastasius, or Memoirs of a Modern Greek.Thomas Hope, Anastasius: Or, Memoirs of a Greek, downloadable at Google books Mavrogenes remained a controversial figure, and historians' opinions about him are often contradictory. The Romanian radical and historian Nicolae BƒÉlcescu considered him an \\"original and fantastic man, despising the aristocracy, but having pity of the low-ranking and poor people\\". However, another 19th-century historian, Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu thought of him as \\"a new Caligula, a tyrant for the boyars, priests, merchants and peasants\\". V. A. Urechia believed him to be in fact \\"a great patriot and organizer\\", while A. D. Xenopol saw him as maniacal and cruel.Ionescu, p.172 See also *History of Bucharest *Wallachian military forces Notes References *Neagu Djuvara, √éntre Orient ≈üi Occident. ≈¢ƒÉrile rom√¢ne la √Ænceputul epocii moderne (\\"Between Orient and Occident.

It is the largest such organization in the world.\\"About NCEA.\\" National Catholic Educational Association. Retrieved 2018-06-12. History NCEA traces its official beginning to a meeting held in St. Louis, Missouri, July 12‚Äì14, 1904. At that meeting the separate Catholic education organizations, the Education Conference of Catholic Seminary Faculties (1898), the Association of Catholic Colleges (1899) and the Parish School Conference (1902) agreed to unite as the Catholic Educational Association (CEA). From then until 1919, the CEA was the only unifying agent for Catholic education at the national level. In 1919, the establishment of the National Catholic War Council (NCWC), later changed to National Catholic Welfare Council, to serve as an agency of the American bishops to coordinate all Catholic activity, including education, marked a new era for CEA. A working relationship of independent cooperation between the Association and the Department of Education of NCWC was established that endures with the NCW successor, the United States Catholic Conference (USCCB). In 1927, the word ‚Äònational‚Äô was added to the official CEA title and, in 1929, the association headquarters moved to Washington, DC to be in proximity to other national secular agencies of education. The Association began a policy of friendly cooperation with other private and public educational associations and federal government agencies in the service of all aspects of American education. In 2016, the NCEA discontinued its departments for seminaries and parish religious education departments, instead focusing on K-12 Catholic organizations in the United States. At present, NCEA focuses on: leadership development for superintendents, presidents, principals, pastors, and governing bodies; professional development for teachers; and serving as the voice for Catholic school education. ACCU and NCEA The Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, founded independently in 1899, has a long relationship with the various components that later became the National Catholic Educational Association, of which it has for some time been a constitutive member. As of July 1, 2000, ACCU is an independently incorporated 501(c3) organization and an Affiliate of the NCEA. NCEA is a voluntary association of educators and institutions. The Association's organizational structure changed from a departmental arrangement to a functional arrangement. Previously, member institutions held association membership through one of the constitutive departments. In 2016 the organization was restructured eliminating the seminary and religious education departments, focusing instead on the three pillars of Lead. Learn, Proclaim. Lead is the development of leadership skills of members. Learn is the seminar and conference approach to enhancing learning of members. Proclaim is the Organization's position to being a national voice for Catholic Education in the US. While the USCCB remains the authority for the Catholic Church in the US, NCEA develops and articulates a national point of view that is consistent with the USCCB. NCEA is the largest private professional education organization in the world, representing 150,000 Catholic educators serving 1.9 million students in Catholic education. Symbolism of the Official NCEA Logo NCEA and its membership: working together to promote our Catholic faith and lighting the way for the future of Catholic education. Together, NCEA and its members share light and life with each other (two candles) and bring the light of faith (cross) and knowledge (light and bookends) to students. Green represents growth and renewal. It symbolizes the promise of new life as well as learning, growth and harmony. Blue is embraced as the color of heaven and authority, strength, trust and dependability.  Governance  NCEA has a Board of Directors which has from 15 to 18 members, including three ex-officio members. The Chair of the Board shall be US Bishop of the Roman Catholic Church. The current and past Chairs are as follows: * Bishop Gerald F. Kicanas (Diocese of Tucson, 2017 - current) * Bishop George V. Murray, S.J. (Diocese of Youngstown, 2015 - 2017) * Cardinal Blase J.

Courses are taught in Arabic (in education, arts and social sciences courses) or English (in natural sciences, engineering and business courses). The university is the only government university in the country. The university hosts ten colleges ‚Äì Arts and Sciences, Business and Economics, Education, Engineering, Law, Sharia and Islamic Studies, Pharmacy, College of Health Science, College of Medicine, and the latest College of Dental Medicine ‚Äì with a total of almost 8000 students at a 13:1 student-teacher ratio. Students entering the university are placed in a ‚ÄúFoundation Program‚Äù, which ensures the acquirement of skills such as Math, English, and Computer technology. Many of its academic departments have received or are currently under evaluation for accreditation from a number of organizations. In addition to undergraduate academics, QU has a research infrastructure including research labs, an ocean vessel, technical equipment and a library including a collection of rare manuscripts. The university serves on behalf of the government and private industry to conduct regional research, particularly in areas of the environment and energy technologies. Qatar University has a student body of fifty-two nationalities, 65% of which are Qatari nationals. About 35% are children of expats. Women make up approximately 70% of the student population, and are provided their own set of facilities and classrooms. QU has an alumni body of over 30,000 graduates. History East View of Qatar University The institution was established as the College of Education by a decree from the Emir of Qatar in 1973. The college began with a total of 150 students (93 women and 57 men) and was later expanded to become the University of Qatar in 1977 with four new colleges : Education, Humanities & Social Sciences, Sharia & Law & Islamic Studies, and Science. Three years later, the College of Engineering was established. By then, the number of enrolled students was 2,600. This was followed by the establishment of the College of Business & Economics in 1985. The new colleges prompted a large expansion of the university campus, which was overseen by Aga Khan Award for Architecture recipient Kamal El Kafrawi.Project summary of Qatar University By Fall Semester 2005 / 2006, the number of registrants for study at Qatar University had reached 7660 male and female students, equaling almost 1/6 of the eligible Qatari population. As of 2011, there are seven colleges: College of Education, College of Arts and Sciences, College of Shariah and Islamic Studies, College of Engineering, College of Law, College of Business & Economics, and College of Pharmacy. The new College of Pharmacy was established in 2006, with its first intake of BSc (Pharm) students in 2007. Between 2003 and 2015, the president of the university was Sheikha Abdulla Al-Misnad. She left in 2015. Her replacement was Hassan Rashid Al-Derham, who currently holds the position, and is the university's sixth president. Al-Derham received his doctoral degree from the University of South Wales (United Kingdom). In December 2015, the university awarded its first-ever honorary doctorate degree to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. In 2019, the College of Dental Medicine was founded, which is the tenth college for Qatar University. The college has a competitive 25 seats in its first class and is a six-year program leading to a Doctor of Dental Medicine.http://www.qu.edu.qa/newsroom/Qatar- University/Qatar-University-Announce-New-%E2%80%9CCollege-of-Dental- Medicine%E2%80%9D Strategies The Qatar University 'Reform Project (2003-2007)' evaluated and restructured the university administration and direction to enhance the quality of instruction and place emphasis on research. The reform was initiated in 2003, led by His Highness Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani, QU President Dr. Sheikha Al Misnad, and the newly established Office of Institutional Research and Planning (OIPD). It focused on three principles; ‚ÄúAutonomy‚Äù, ‚ÄúDecentralization‚Äù, and ‚ÄúAccountability‚Äù. While the university had previously operated as a government entity, the reformed institution would be an autonomous body governed by a board of regents who reported to the Emir. This change allowed the University to manage its own finances, stated objectives and vision, and personnel and decentralization within the university granted similar financial and personnel control to colleges, departments and programs. Academically, the reform resulted in the establishment of offices such as the Student Learning Support Center (SLSC) and Student Counseling Center (SCC). Construction was undertaken to ensure accessibility of university facilities by handicapped persons. A newsletter, Tawasol, began publication in the university The reform changed the title of the university from ‚ÄúUniversity of Qatar‚Äù to ‚ÄúQatar University‚Äù with a new slogan; ‚ÄúQatar University, Changing for You‚Äù and a new university logo. A new strategy was put in place \\"from reform to transformation\\" covering the years 2018‚Äì2022. President of Qatar University Dr. Hassan Al-Derham: \\"we have developed a new five-year strategy, which will map out the routes to achieving continuing performance excellence and build on our achievements in our key areas of Education, Research, Institution and Engagement.\\"http://www.qu.edu.qa/static_file/qu/about/documents/Qatar%20University%20Strategy%202018-2022%20Booklet%20-%20EN.pdf This new strategy takes into consideration the Qatar National Vision 2030. Local significance and interaction The research vessel used by the Qatar University Environmental Studies Center in 2005 The university contributes to the process of ‚ÄúQatarization‚Äù, which places an emphasis on the hiring and support of national citizens. While western nations may have trouble implementing such a system due to equality legislation, Qatari nationals only account for approximately 1/4 of the country's population, and this movement is deemed necessary to maintain cultural and national identity. World view and influence Qatari leaders have recognized the vulnerability of oil and natural gases as a long-term economic model, especially for a smaller area such as Qatar. The university has directed funding towards contributions to international projects. This has included taking part in global environmental studies through regional measurements, promotion of energy-awareness, and the recent contribution to CERN of data gathered through the university's new positron beam. Since graduate programs are not available in many fields, Qatar University often works closely with a network of international affiliate schools. Students who have shown exceptional potential or progress can often receive sponsorship from the University for graduate studies abroad, on the condition that they will return to work once finished. Construction Qatar University is situated on the northern edge of Doha, approximately 16 kilometers from the city center. Due to the growth of the city, this area has recently become more valuable, and a popular development site for upscale residential and commercial buildings. QU has agreed to lease a portion of its property to the construction of new commercial zones to the north and east, as well as a substantial plot for the College of the North Atlantic to the south. A QAR 20 million Scientific and Applied Research Center is under construction. Colleges and Departments College of Arts and Sciences The Women's College of Arts and Sciences at Qatar University in 2008 The College of Arts and Sciences was established in 2004 through the merging of two former colleges; the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, and the College of Science.

Biography  Born in Krefeld, Neuenfels studied at the Max Reinhardt Seminar in Vienna in the 1960s, and in the 1970s he quickly established himself as a leading practitioner of German Regietheater. Being invited to prominent venues, such as the Burgtheater, his productions were often controversially received, but he worked at the same time with well-known actors such as Klaus Maria Brandauer, Bernhard Minetti and . His opera productions have often been accompanied by heated discussions and scandals. In particular his version of Aida in 1980 for Frankfurt, conducted by Michael Gielen, in which he portrayed Verdi's Ethiopian slave as a cleaning woman in a contemporary setting, or his Fledermaus in 2001 for the Salzburg Festival, which provoked angry reactions and resentment. Neuenfels has been criticised for creating extremely sexually explicit opera scenes. Soprano Karita Mattila criticised him in 2000 for a Salzburg production of Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte in which huge insects and background videos, some of them erotic, distracted attention from the singers; during Fiordiligi's fiery aria \\"\\", Mattila arrived onstage walking two men, in leather and chains, as if they were dogs. She called that the worst experience and said she believed Neuenfels had crossed the line. Later, in December 2003, Neuenfels' production of Mozart's Idomeneo at the Deutsche Oper Berlin included a scene in which the title character staggers on stage carrying the severed heads of Neptune, Jesus, Buddha and Mohammed. After the police warned that the production might present a security risk, the opera house cancelled future performances, planned for September 2006. Following protests that the opera house was engaging in self-censorship, its manager, , rescheduled those performances for December 2006; see 2006 Idomeneo controversy. Neuenfels debuted in 2010 at the Bayreuth Festival with Wagner's Lohengrin, conducted by Andris Nelsons. This production set the opera in a laboratory and featured chorus members costumed as lab rats. The audience reaction at the premiere ranged from enthusiastic applause to irate booing.\\"Neuer 'Lohengrin' in Bayreuth: Wie man den Schwan rupft\\", Der Spiegel, in German, 26 July 2010.

Biography  Jean-Pierre Richard began his advanced studies at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure, at the time a school of the University of Paris, in 1941, passed the \\"agr√©gation\\" in literature in 1945, and got his doctoral degree (doctorat √®s lettres) in 1962 at the University of Paris. He taught literature first in foreign universities, and then in France, and finally became a professor at the University of Paris IV in 1978. Since the publication of Litt√©rature et Sensation in 1954, which brought him critical attention, Jean-Pierre Richard has continually sought to explore - in the works of writers of the nineteenth and twentieth century - the links between their writings and their intimate experience of the world. In his first book, which studied Stendhal, Flaubert, Fromentin and the Goncourt brothers, he analyzed these authors' perceptions and sensations of material world. In Po√©sie et Profondeur, he refined his critical method by searching for the \\"first moment of literary creation\\", that instant during which a literary project constructs both the writer and his or her work. Published in 1962, Richard's \\"Univers imaginaire de Mallarm√©\\" remains one of the most important studies of that poet.

It lies east of Aleksandr√≥w Kujawski and south-east of Toru≈Ñ. The village had a population of 740 in 2005.  History and development  Odolion is located 3km away from the famous Polish spa town of Ciechocinek and 5km from Aleksandr√≥w Kujawski, an important national railway interchange. A railway runs directly between these two towns, stopping only at Odolion in between. The main purpose of the railway line was to take visitors from all parts of the country to Ciechocinek, a small principality, via Aleksandr√≥w Kujawski. It is however a major means of transport for the people of Odolion, taking them to school, work, and for leisure. During the German occupation of Poland (World War II), the German police massacred 266 Poles from Aleksandr√≥w Kujawski, Ciechocinek and Wo≈Çuszewo in the Odolion forest throughout October 1939‚ÄìJanuary 1940 (see Nazi crimes against the Polish nation).Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, By≈Ç rok 1939. Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpiecze≈Ñstwa w Polsce. Intelligenzaktion, IPN, Warszawa, 2009, p. 209 (in Polish) The village began to be built up in the 1970s and is now growing rapidly. In the early 1990s, the parish of Odolion-Stawki was created - before, the villagers had to travel either to Aleksandr√≥w or Ciechocinek to go to church and belonged to these respective parishes. A chapel was built in Mi≈Ça street, and a large, modern church was completed in 2006, adjacent to the chapel to cope with the increasing population. There is a cemetery just outside the village, in the Stawki area.  Amenities  Although Odolion is a relatively small settlement its number of amenities grows year on year, including a large parish church, supermarket, fire station, petrol filling station and playing fields. 2009 saw the opening of several new shops housed within large, purpose-built trading pavilions; these include a large supermarket, pharmacy and furniture store. Local businesses have expressed concern over the arrival of the supermarket chain Lewiatan which they believe will threaten their family run shops. Currently there is no sewage system running through Odolion, although discussions about introduction of this amenity as well as piped gas are ongoing. The valley location of the village results in poor receipt of signals from electronic devices, resulting in poor satellite TV and mobile phone reception.  Environment and Climate  The majority of Odolion is on the forest side of the railway, with one street continuing approx. 500m further across the railway line and Lodz road. The streets on the forest side are arranged in a figure of 8 shape, fitting snugly into the horseshoe of the forest running closely around it. The current list of streets is as follows: * Dworcowa * Mi≈Ça * M≈Çodzie≈ºowa * Zau≈Çek * Kwiatowa * Kr√≥tka * Piaskowa * Okrƒô≈ºna * Szosa Ciechoci≈Ñska * Relaksowa * Lipowa * Kolejowa However, more houses are being built all the time - increasingly by wealthy city businessmen. Odolion's proximity to the spa town of Ciechocinek and historical city Torun are desirable factors.  Weather  Summers are roughly in line with Polish averages, with both sun and rain featuring. Temperatures have broken the 35C barrier on several occasions. Winters are bitter, with snow often several feet deep. The snow usually lasts from mid November through to February or March.

It eventually became one of the most prominent figures in today's video game industry, being the world's largest video game company by revenue.  Origins  Nintendo poster from early Meiji Era Nintendo was founded as by Fusajiro Yamauchi on September 23, 1889. Based in Kyoto, Japan, the business produced and marketed hanafuda. The name \\"Nintendo\\" is commonly assumed to mean \\"leave luck to heaven\\", but there are no historical records to validate this assumption. The cards, which were all handmade, soon began to gain in popularity, and Yamauchi had to hire assistants to mass-produce cards to keep up with the demand. Fusajiro Yamauchi did not have a son to take over the family business. Following the common Japanese tradition, he adopted his son-in-law, Sekiryo Kaneda, who then legally took his wife's last name of Yamauchi. In 1929, Fusajiro Yamauchi retired from the company and allowed Sekiryo Kaneda to take over the company as president. In 1933, Sekiryo Kaneda established a joint venture with another company and renamed the company Yamauchi Nintendo & Co. In 1947, Sekiryo established a distribution company, Marufuku Co., Ltd., to distribute the hanafuda, as well as several other types of cards produced by Nintendo. Sekiryo Kaneda also had only daughters, so again his son-in-law (Shikanojo Inaba, renamed Shikanojo Yamauchi) was adopted into the family. Shikanojo later abandoned his family and did not become company president. Subsequently, his son Hiroshi Yamauchi was brought up by his grandparents and he later took over the company instead of his father. 1889‚Äì1965: As a card company Nintendo's first headquarters in Kyoto, 1889 In 1949, Hiroshi Yamauchi was attending Waseda University in Tokyo, however, after his grandfather died he left to take office as the president of Nintendo. In 1950, he renamed Marufuku Co. Ltd. to , and in 1951 to (writing \\"karuta\\" as \\"È™®Áâå\\" rather than \\"„Åã„Çã„Åü\\"). In 1953, Nintendo became the first company in Japan to produce playing cards from plastic. In 1956, Yamauchi visited the U.S., to engage in talks with the United States Playing Card Company (USPCC), the dominant playing card manufacturer in the United States, based in Cincinnati. He was shocked to find that the world's biggest company in his business was relegated to using a small office. This was a turning point for Yamauchi, who then realized the limitations of the playing card business. In 1959, Nintendo struck a deal with Disney to allow the use of Disney's characters on Nintendo's playing cards. Previously, Western playing cards were regarded as something similar to hanafuda and mahjong: a device for gambling. By tying playing cards to Disney and selling books explaining the different games one could play with the cards, Nintendo could sell the product to Japanese households. The tie-in was a success and the company sold at least 600,000 card packs in a single year. Due to this success, in 1962, Yamauchi took Nintendo public, listing the company in Osaka Stock Exchange Second division. In 1963 Nintendo Playing Card Co., Ltd. was renamed to Nintendo by Yamauchi. Nintendo now began to experiment in other areas of business using the newly injected capital. Between 1963 and 1968, Nintendo set up a taxi company, \\"love hotel\\" chain, food company (trying to sell instant rice, similar to instant noodles) and several other things (including a vacuum cleaner, Chiritory, which later appeared in a two-player minigame in WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$ in 2003). All these ventures eventually failed, except toymaking, where they had some earlier experience from selling playing cards. In 1964, while Japan was experiencing an economic boom due to the Tokyo Olympics, the playing card business reached its saturation point. Japanese households stopped buying playing cards, and the price of Nintendo stock fell from 900 yen to 60 yen. In 1965, Nintendo hired Gunpei Yokoi as a maintenance engineer for the assembly line. However, Yokoi soon became famous for much more than his ability to repair conveyor belts. 1966‚Äì1972: Toy company and new ventures Nintendo struggled to survive in the Japanese toy industry; it was still small at this point, and dominated by already well-established companies such as Bandai and Tomy. Because of the generally short product life cycle of toys, the company always had to come up with new products. This was the beginning of a major new era for Nintendo. In 1966, Yamauchi was observing a hanafuda factory. He noticed an extending arm, which was made by one of their maintenance engineers, Gunpei Yokoi, for his own amusement. Yamauchi ordered Yokoi to develop it as a proper product for the Christmas rush. Released as the \\"Ultra Hand\\", it would become one of Nintendo's earliest toy blockbusters, selling over a million units. Seeing that Yokoi had promise, Yamauchi pulled him off assembly line work. Yokoi was soon moved from maintenance duty to product development. Due to his electrical engineering background, it soon became apparent that Yokoi was quite adept at developing electronic toys. These devices had a much higher novelty value than traditional toys, allowing Nintendo to charge a higher price margin for each product. Yokoi went on to develop many other toys, including the Ten Billion Barrel puzzle, a baseball throwing machine called the Ultra Machine, and a Love Tester. Another invention of his, in collaboration with Masayuki Uemura from Sharp, was the Nintendo Beam Gun Game, the precursor to the NES Zapper (which was used in games like Duck Hunt.). Nintendo released the first solar-powered light gun, the Nintendo Beam Gun,History of Nintendo - Toys & Arcades (1969 - 1982) (archived), Nintendo Land in 1970; this was the first commercially available light-gun for home use, produced in partnership with Sharp. In 1972, Nintendo released the Ele-Conga, one of the first programmable drum machines. It could play pre-programmed rhythms from disc-shaped punch cards, which could be altered or programmed by the user, to play different patterns. 1972‚Äìpresent In 1972, the first commercially available video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, had a light gun accessory, the Shooting Gallery.The Ten Greatest Years in Gaming , Edge, June 27, 2006, Accessed Mar 1, 2009 This was the first involvement of Nintendo in video games. According to Martin Picard in the International Journal of Computer Game Research: \\"in 1971, Nintendo had -- even before the marketing of the first home console in the United States -- an alliance with the American pioneer Magnavox to develop and produce optoelectronic guns for the Odyssey (released in 1972), since it was similar to what Nintendo was able to offer in the Japanese toy market in 1970s\\".Martin Picard, The Foundation of Geemu: A Brief History of Early Japanese video games, International Journal of Computer Game Research, 2013 In 1973, its focus shifted to family entertainment venues with the Laser Clay Shooting System, using the same light gun technology used in Nintendo's Kousenjuu series of toys, and set up in abandoned bowling alleys. Following some success, Nintendo developed several more light gun machines for the emerging arcade scene. While the Laser Clay Shooting System ranges had to be shut down following excessive costs, Nintendo had found a new market. In 1974, Nintendo secured the rights to distribute the Magnavox Odyssey video game console in Japan. Color TV-Game Nintendo's first video game system, the Color TV Game 6 Nintendo at this time saw how successful video games were and began to dabble in them. Their first step in that field was to secure the rights to distribute the Magnavox Odyssey in Japan in 1975. At the time, home video game consoles were extremely rare‚Äîeven the seminal like the Atari Pong consoles had yet to be produced. After experiencing reasonable success at this, Nintendo began developing its own video games, both for home and for arcades. In the 1970s, Mitsubishi Electric proposed joint development of \\"Color TV Game Machine\\" and Nintendo accepted. In 1977, they released \\"Color TV Game 6\\" and \\"Color TV Game 15\\" (6 and 15 indicates the number of games). Their first video arcade game was 1975's EVR Race; a handful of others followed in the next several years, Radar Scope and Donkey Kong being among the most famous of these. The early 1980s saw Nintendo's video game division (led by Yokoi) creating some of its most famous arcade titles. The massively popular Donkey Kong was created in 1981, with Shigeru Miyamoto as its mastermind, and released in the arcades and on the Atari 2600, Intellivision, and ColecoVision video game systems (although Nintendo themselves generally had no involvement with these early console ports). This release method would be used on several later Nintendo arcade games of this same period, including the original Mario Bros. (not to be confused with the later Super Mario Bros.) Nintendo would also become a member of the Japan Amusement Machinery Manufacturers Association (JAMMA), but it would eventually withdraw its membership on February 28, 1989. On July 31, 1992, Nintendo announced it would no longer manufacture arcade equipment. Game & Watch and Nintendo Entertainment System In addition to the arcade game activity, Nintendo was testing the consumer handheld video game waters with the Game & Watch. The Game & Watch or G&W; is a line of handheld electronic games produced by Nintendo from 1980 to 1991. Created by game designer Gunpei Yokoi, each Game & Watch features a single game to be played on an LCD screen in addition to a clock and/or an alarm. It was the earliest Nintendo product to garner major success, with 43.4 million units sold worldwide. In 1982, Nintendo developed a prototype system dubbed the \\"Advanced Video System\\" (or AVS for short) and had controllers much like the NES. There were accessories such as a tape drive, a joystick and a lightgun, and along with all of that, the system was made of a computer, much like the Atari 400, Commodore Vic-20 and Commodore 64. It was never released and is on display at the Nintendo World Store in New York. In July 1983, Nintendo released the Famicom (Family Computer) system in Japan, which was its first attempt at a cartridge-based video game console. The system sold over 500,000 units within two months at a price around $100 USD. However, after a few months of favorable sales, Nintendo received complaints that some Famicom consoles would freeze when the player attempted to play certain games. The fault was found in a malfunctioning chip and Nintendo decided to recall all Famicom units that were currently on store shelves, which ultimately cost them approximately half a million USD . During this period, Nintendo rekindled their desire to release the Famicom (Or Nintendo Entertainment System) in the US. Since the company had very little experience with the US market, they had previously attempted to contract with Atari for the system's distribution in 1983. However, a fiasco involving Coleco and Donkey Kong soured the relationship between the two during the negotiations, and Atari refused to back Nintendo's console. In 1983‚Äì1985, a large scale recession in video game sales hit the market which amounted to a 97% decrease primarily in the North American area. The recession known as the \\"video game crash of 1983\\" was caused by a few main factors including the flooding of the console market, competition of home computers, inflation, and loss of publishing control. The video game crash of 1983 soon took out not only Atari, but the vast majority of the American market itself. Over time, dominance in the market shifted from America to Japan. Nintendo began exporting to America and had virtually only one major competitor in the market, Sega, which was another Japanese company. Nintendo was determined not to make the same mistakes in the US that Atari had. Because of massive influxes of games that were regarded as some of the worst ever created, gaming had almost completely died out in America. Nintendo decided that to avoid facing the same problems, they would only allow games that received their \\"Seal of Quality\\" to be sold for the Famicom. In 1985, Nintendo announced that they were releasing the Famicom (Family Computer) worldwide with a different design under the name the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). They used a creative tactic to counter the bad view that the media was giving on video games, and released the NES with R.O.B. units that connected to the console and were synchronised to the games. To ensure the localization of the highest-quality games by third-party developers, Nintendo of America limited the number of game titles third-party developers could release in a single year to five. Konami, the first third-party company that was allowed to make cartridges for the Famicom, would later circumvent this rule by creating a spinoff company, Ultra Games, to release additional games in a single year. Other manufacturers soon employed the same tactic. Also in 1985, Super Mario Bros. was released for the Famicom in Japan and became a large success. Nintendo test marketed the Nintendo Entertainment System in the New York area on October 18, 1985. They expanded the test to Los Angeles in February 1986, followed by tests in Chicago and San Francisco. They would go national by the end of 1986, along with 15 games, sold separately. In the US and Canada, it outsold its competitors by a wide margin. This was also the year that Metroid and Super Mario Bros. 2 (the Japanese version) were released. In 1987, The Legend of Zelda was released to much critical acclaim. In 1988, Nintendo of America unveiled Nintendo Power, a monthly news and strategy magazine from Nintendo that served to advertise new games. The first issue published was the July/August edition, which spotlighted the NES game Super Mario Bros. 2. Nintendo Power has since ceased publication with its December 2012 edition. Game Boy and Super NES The original Game Boy In 1989, Nintendo (which had seen a large amount of success from the Game & Watch) released the Game Boy (both created by Gunpei Yokoi), along with the accompanying game Tetris. Due to the price, the game and its durability (unlike the prior Microvision from Milton Bradley Company, which was prone to static and screen rot), the Game Boy line sold extremely well, eventually amassing sales of 118 million units. Also, Super Mario Land was also released with the system, which sold 14 million copies worldwide. 1989 was also the year that Nintendo announced a sequel to the Famicom, to be called the Super Famicom.\\"Chronology of Nintendo Video Games (1988-1989).\\" Chronology of Nintendo Video Games (1988-1989). N.p., n.d. Web. 07 Aug. 2015. The last major first-party game for the NES, Super Mario Bros. 3, was released in early 1990, and went on to sell over 18 million units. It was followed by a licensed television adaption named The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!, which was released by DIC Entertainment and Viacom Enterprises in that year to capitalise on the game's immense popularity. The Super Famicom was released in Japan on November 21, 1990. The system's launch was widely successful, and the Super Famicom was sold out across Japan within three days, selling 1.6 million units by June 1991. In August 1991, the Super Famicom was launched in the US under the name \\"Super Nintendo Entertainment System\\" (SNES), followed by Europe in 1992. The Super Nintendo Entertainment System followed in the steps of its predecessor, with high technical specifications for its era. The controller of the SNES had also improved over that of the NES, as it now had rounded edges and four new buttons, a standard which is evident on many modern controllers today. The controller was called the \\"dog bone\\". SNES, c. 1991 Nintendo had also begun development on a CD-ROM attachment for the SNES/Super Famicom. Their first partner in this project was Sony, whom Nintendo had worked with before to provide the SNES with its SPC sound chip. Development on the Nintendo PlayStation CD-ROM add-on and SNES/SFC standalone hybrid console began. However, at the last minute Nintendo decided to pull out of the partnership and instead go with Philips, and while no CD-ROM add-on was produced, several Nintendo properties (namely The Legend of Zelda) appeared on the Philips CD-i media console. Upon learning this, Sony decided to continue developing the technology they had into the PlayStation. The exact reason Nintendo left its partnership with Sony has been the subject of speculation over the years, but the most common theory is that Sony either wanted too much of the profits for the machine or the rights to the CD-ROM attachment itself. In Japan, the Super Famicom easily took control of the gaming market. In the US, due to a late start and an aggressive marketing campaign by Sega (Headed by the Sega Company's new mascot, Sonic The Hedgehog, their answer to Nintendo's Super Mario), Nintendo saw its market share take a precipitous plunge from 90-95% with the NES to a low of approximately 35% against the Sega Genesis. Over the course of several years, the SNES in North America eventually overtook the Genesis, thanks to franchise titles such as Super Mario World, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Street Fighter II, and the Final Fantasy series. Total worldwide sales of the SNES reached 49.10 million units, eclipsing the estimated 40 million unit sales of the Genesis. As the SNES battled the Sega Genesis, Nintendo was running into problems on another front caused by their own aggressive marketing behavior. In 1991, Nintendo agreed to a settlement regarding price-fixing allegations brought by the Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general in New York and Maryland. Nintendo had been accused of threatening to cut off shipments of the NES to retailers who discounted the price of the system. The estimated cost of the settlement was just under $30 million. In 1992, Gunpei Yokoi and the rest of R&D; 1 began planning on a new virtual reality console to be called the Virtual Boy. Hiroshi Yamauchi also bought majority shares of the Seattle Mariners in 1992. By May 1993, Nintendo had reportedly become one of the top ten leading companies in the world. In 1993, Nintendo announced plans to develop a new 64-bit console codenamed Project Reality that would be capable of rendering fully 3D environments and characters. In 1994, Nintendo also claimed that Project Reality would be renamed Ultra 64 in the US. The Ultra 64 moniker was unveiled in arcades on the Nintendo branded fighting game Killer Instinct and the racing game Cruisin' USA. Killer Instinct was later released on the SNES. Soon after, Nintendo realized they had mistakenly chosen a name for their new console that the Konami corporation owned the rights to. Specifically, only Konami would have the rights to release games for the new system called Ultra Football, Ultra Tennis, etc. Therefore, in 1995 Nintendo changed the final name of the system to the Nintendo 64, and announced that it would be released in 1996. They later showed previews of the system and several games, including Super Mario 64, to the media and public. 1995 is also the year that Nintendo purchased part of Rare. In 1994, after many years of Nintendo's products being distributed in Australia by Mattel since the NES in 1985, Nintendo opened its Australian headquarters and its first Managing Directors were Graham Kerry, who moved along from Mattel Australia as Managing Director and Susumu Tanaka of Nintendo UK Ltd. In 1995, Nintendo released the Virtual Boy in Japan. The console sold poorly, but Nintendo still said they had hope for it and continued to release several other games and attempted a release in the US, which was another disaster. Also in 1995, Nintendo found themselves in a competitive situation. Competitor Sega introduced their 32-bit Saturn, while newcomer Sony introduced the 32-bit PlayStation. Sony's fierce marketing campaigns ensued, and it started to cut into Nintendo and Sega's market share. Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color Nintendo 64 black console with blank game cartridge and grey controller On June 23, 1996, the Nintendo 64 (N64) was released in Japan, selling over 500,000 units on the first day of its release. On September 29, 1996, Nintendo released the Nintendo 64 in North America, selling out the initial shipment of 350,000. Many feel that the advertising onslaught by Sony at this time did not truly begin to take effect until many of the consumers who held out for the N64 became frustrated at the lack of software following the first few months after the system's release. What also greatly contributed to the extremely competitive climate that Nintendo was entrenched in was the fact that many third-party companies immediately began developing and releasing many of their leading games for Nintendo's competing consoles. Many of those third party companies cited cheaper development and manufacturing costs for the CD format, versus the cartridge format. On December 1, 1999, Nintendo released an add-on to the Nintendo 64 in Japan, titled the Nintendo 64DD, although it was never released elsewhere. Nintendo followed with the release of the Game Boy Pocket, a smaller version of the original Game Boy, designed by Gunpei Yokoi as a parting gift. A week after the release of the Game Boy Pocket, Gunpei resigned from his position at Nintendo. Gunpei helped in the creation of a competitor system named the WonderSwan, using the skills he gained in the creation of the Game Boy. In 1995, Pocket Monsters (known internationally as \\"Pok√©mon\\") was released in Japan to a huge following. The Pok√©mon franchise, created by Satoshi Tajiri, was proving so popular in America, Europe, and Japan, that for a brief time, Nintendo took back their place as the supreme power in the games industry. In 1997, Gunpei Yokoi died in a car accident at the age of 56. The same year, the European Economic Community forced Nintendo to drastically rework its third-party licensing contracts, ruling that Nintendo could no longer limit the number of games a license could release, require games to undergo prior approval, or require third-party games to be exclusively manufactured by Nintendo. On October 13, 1998, the Game Boy Color was released in Japan, with releases in North America and Europe a month later. Game Boy Advance and GameCube controller and 251-block memory card Nintendo released the Game Boy Advance in Japan on March 21, 2001, followed by the North American launch on June 11 and the European launch on June 22. Nintendo released the GameCube home video game console on September 14, 2001, in Japan. It was released in North America on November 18, 2001, Europe on May 3, 2002, and Australia on May 17, 2002. In January 2002, Minoru Arakawa resigned as president of Nintendo of America, and Nintendo named Tatsumi Kimishima as his successor. In May 2002, Hiroshi Yamauchi stepped down as the president of Nintendo and named Satoru Iwata his successor. During the same year, Nintendo and Chinese-American scientist Dr Wei Yen co-founded iQue to manufacture and distribute official Nintendo consoles and games for the mainland Chinese market under the iQue brand. Nintendo's aggressive business tactics in Europe would catch up to them. The European Commission determined that Nintendo had engaged in anticompetitive price-fixing business practices dating at least as far back as the early 1990s. This resulted in a heavy fine being laid against the company ‚Äî ‚Ç¨149 million, one of the largest antitrust fines applied in the history of the commission. Nintendo DS and Wii Nintendo DS Lite in its opened position In May 2004, Nintendo announced plans to release a new brand of handheld, unrelated to the Game Boy, featuring two screens, one of which was touch-sensitive. The Nintendo DS, released on November 21, 2004, received over three million pre-orders. In addition to the touch screen, the DS can also create three-dimensional graphics, similar to those of the Nintendo 64, although its lack of hardware support for texture filtering results in more pixelated graphics than on the Nintendo 64. President Satoru Iwata reassigned all of Nintendo's software designers under new managers and different division; most of the resources were allocated to Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka and the Nintendo EAD division. On May 14, 2005, Nintendo opened its first retail store accessible to the general public, Nintendo World Store, at the Rockefeller Center in New York City. It consists of two stories, and contains many kiosks of GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo DS games. There are also display cases filled with things from Nintendo's past, including Hanafuda, Nintendo's first product. They celebrated the opening with a block party at Rockefeller Plaza. At E3 in May 2005, Nintendo displayed the first prototype for their \\"next-generation\\" system, codenamed the Nintendo Revolution (now known as the Wii), its controller revealed at the Tokyo Game Show later that year. On January 26, 2006, Nintendo announced a new version of their Nintendo DS handheld, the Nintendo DS Lite, designed to be smaller and lighter, with a brighter screen. It was launched in Japan on March 2, 2006, and three months later in North America and Europe on June 11 and June 23, 2006, respectively. On May 25, 2006, Reggie Fils-Aim√© was promoted to President and COO of Nintendo of America, Inc. The former President, Tatsumi Kimishima, was promoted to Chairman of the Board and CEO. On July 7, 2006, Nintendo officially established a South Korean subsidiary, Nintendo Korea, in the country's capital, Seoul, which replaced Daewon Media as the official distributor of Nintendo products in South Korea. Original Wii console with Wii Remote In early August 2006, it was revealed that Nintendo, along with Microsoft, was made the target of a patent-infringement lawsuit. Leveled by the Anascape Ltd., the suit claimed that Nintendo's use of analog technology in their game controllers constitutes a violation of their patents. The lawsuit sought to recover damages from both corporations and possibly force them to stop selling controllers with the violating technology. Microsoft settled with Anasacape, while Nintendo went to trial, initially losing and being ordered to pay US$21 million in damages. Nintendo appealed, and on April 23, 2010 the Federal Circuit reversed the ruling. In November 2010, Anascape's appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied. In mid-September 2006, during press conferences held in Tokyo, New York, and London on 13, 14 and 15 September, respectively, Nintendo announced launch details for its Wii console, as well as demonstrated features of the \\"Wii Menu\\" GUI. The system was first released on November 19, 2006 in the US, followed by the Japanese launch on December 2, the Australian launch on December 6, and the European launch on December 8. The console sold fast and was a big breakthrough for Nintendo,Internet Archive Wayback Machine picking up the pace lost from their last console, the GameCube. The success of the Wii has been attributed to the intended market of the product; while at the time most competitors were focusing on more adult and fan-based games, Nintendo decided to release a console for a larger demographic, one including casual gamers, children and those who wouldn't ordinarily play video games. Since no other major gaming console was marketing for this image, these other companies were caught mostly unprepared by the success of the Wii system, and it wasn't until 2010 that Sony and Microsoft released consoles targeting the same demographic as the Wii. On September 17, 2007, Nintendo of America closed its official forums, the NSider Forums, indefinitely due to a major overhaul of their site. For months prior, cutbacks in Nintendo of America's online department led to the trimming back of NSider's chat hours and the replacement of their annual Camp Hyrule event ‚Äî held during August ‚Äî with a sweepstakes. In the meantime, Nintendo encouraged fans to run their own forums. Nintendo-Europe's forum section of their site was also officially closed down a week later due to a site revamp, however it had been offline citing \\"security issues\\" since June of that year. On December 19, 2007, Nintendo opened a forum for technical support only. In October 2007, Nintendo announced Nintendo Australia's new Managing Director, Rose Lappin. She is Nintendo's first female head of one of its subsidiaries and worked for Nintendo before it started in Australia as Director of Sales and Marketing for Mattel and had that role until she was announced Managing Director. On November 1, 2008, Nintendo released an updated version of the Nintendo DS Lite in Japan; the Nintendo DSi. It includes all features of the Nintendo DS Lite, but it includes a camera on the inside and outside of the system, and newer features. It is the first handheld game system manufactured by Nintendo that allows downloadable gaming content to the system. The Nintendo DSi was released April 2, 2009, in Australia and Asia, April 3, 2009, in Europe, and April 5, 2009, in North America. Nintendo 3DS and Wii U The Wii U console with Wii U GamePad Nintendo Switch In October 2016, Nintendo revealed a new system called the Nintendo Switch, which was released on March 3, 2017. It is a hybrid video game console with detachable controllers with an emphasis on portability and on the go multiplayer in contrast of the then competitors PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In the year the Switch was released Nintendo put out The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey, both games with critical acclaim that helped sell millions of units in the first year of the new console, eventually culminating with the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild being named Game of the Year 2017. In 2018, Tatsumi Kimishima stepped down as president and Shuntaro Furukawa became the new successor, the Switch became much more popular when the crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate came out. On March 20, 2020, Animal Crossing: New Horizons was released.

His uncle, Franc Snoj, was a prominent member of the Slovene People's Party and a minister in the Royal Yugoslav Government. In April 1941, after the invasion of Yugoslavia he escaped with his family from the Nazis to the Italian-occupied Lower Carniola. From there, the family had to flee again to Ljubljana in order to escape persecution by the Communist-led partisan movement. In 1947, his uncle Franc Snoj was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment in a staged trial together with other liberal and social democrats who tried to organize a legal opposition to Josip Broz Tito's Communist regime (the so-called Nagode's trial). These experiences deeply influenced Jo≈æe Snoj's his later literary opus. After graduation in Slavic philology at the University of Ljubljana he started working as a reporter for the newspaper Delo. Together with Dane Zajc, Gregor Strni≈°a, Dominik Smole, Marjan Ro≈æanc, and others, he was part of the generation which, influenced by the \\"modernist turn\\" of the poet Edvard Kocbek, strongly challenged the literary canon established by the Communist regime.

Phalacrocorax lucidus sometimes is treated as a subspecies of the great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo lucidus, but some authorities (e.g. Sibley & Monroe, 1990, Sinclair, Hockey and Tarboton, 2002) retain its original treatment as an allospecies in the P. carbo superspecific group, in which case it is referred to as Phalacrocorax lucidus. A black-necked form originally classified as Phalacrocorax patricki or Phalacrocorax carbo patricki is now regarded as synonymous with Phalacrocorax lucidus. As its name suggests, the 80‚Äì100 cm long white-breasted cormorant has a white neck and breast when adult, and the white area tends to increase as the bird becomes more mature. In other respects it is a large cormorant generally resembling the great cormorant. The smaller and very different southern Australian black-faced cormorant, Phalacrocorax fuscescens, is also sometimes known as the white-breasted cormorant.

It has a wide distribution; on the west coast from the Cape Verde Islands to Guinea-Bissau and from Angola to the Cape of Good Hope and northwards on the east coast to Mozambique. It occurs around the entire Southern African coastline, but it is not clear whether the coastal populations are separate from the inland populations. On the African mainland it occurs more frequently in eastern and southern parts, rather than in the drier western regions, where it usually is found only on perennial rivers and dams. On inland waters it commonly occurs together with the reed cormorant and the African darter, but it is ecologically separated from these species by its fishing habits and the size and nature of its prey. There are also inland populations in Nigeria and around Lake Chad, and in eastern and southern Africa from Sudan southwards. It can be found around the Red Sea, where it is sometimes referred to as the Red Sea white-breasted cormorant.

In 2006, the population was 7,207 inhabitants. Although officially part of a larger town region, Nijlen, Kessel is very famous on itself for its many touristic attractions, such as \\"de Kesselse Heide\\" (a nature reserve) and \\"Fort Kessel\\" (a fortress built for World War I). Kessel lies between two rivers: the Kleine Nete in the north and the Grote Nete in the south. It borders with Emblem, Nijlen, Bevel, Berlaar and Lier. Although Kessel is a fairly small town, it has 2 separate town centres, Kessel-Dorp, which is built up around the town square, and Kessel-station, which is built up around the train station. The name Kessel comes from the Latin word Castellum (fortress), indicating that Kessel might have been the location for an old Roman camp. In 1912, another Fortress was built, in order to withstand a German invasion. During World War I, German artillery fire from Berlaar made the fort useless, though it still stands until this day and was given the status of Protected Monument by the Belgian government.

From the 1970s through the 1990s Lundin established numerous natural resource companies both in the mining sector and the oil and gas sector, which in turn made a number of world class discoveries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe and South America. Several of these deposits are still producing commercial quantities of oil, gas, gold, copper and other minerals; others are still under development. Lundin made a fortune in the 1970s when he came across huge natural gas fields in Qatar. Biography Early years Adolf Lundin earned a master's degree in 1956 from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Between 1957 and 1960 he worked as a Petroleum Engineer for the Royal Dutch Shell Group in South America. In 1961 he earned an MBA degree from the Centre d‚ÄôEtudes Industrielles in Geneva, Switzerland. Between 1961 and 1966 he was responsible for oil exploration activities in the North Sea and Portugal for the Ax:son Johnson Group. In 1966, he moved with his family to Geneva to work as assistant director of the Centre d‚ÄôEtudes Industrielles (which later became the International Institute for Management Development). Adolf's brother Bertil (1946-2005) was head of the Kontoret f√∂r S√§rskild Inh√§mtning (The Office for Special Collection). The KSI is Sweden's most secretive intelligence agency. Career In 1971, he started his career as an independent oil and mining entrepreneur on a global scale. His first successful venture was Gulfstream Resources which, in 1976, co-discovered the North Gas Field, offshore Qatar - this field remains today as the single largest known gas accumulation in the world. Lundin was an ardent anti-Communist. In the United States Lundin was involved with the Conservative think tank, The Heritage Foundation based in Washington, D.C. (Reagan Doctrine/ Kirkpatrick Doctrine). In 1980, Lundin sponsored Ronald Reagan's election campaign. Lundin and his wife Eva were invited to the Reagan inauguration in 1981. The program included an inauguration party with Frank Sinatra that the couple watched from the front row.Lundin may have led Bildt to the heart of darkness, The Local, 22 December 2011 He founded Lundin Mining in 1994.Company History Lunding mining.

(date unknown) Ludƒõk Alois Marold (7 August 1865, Prague ‚Äì 1 December 1898, Prague) was a Czech painter and illustrator, best known for his panorama depicting the Battle of Lipany. It is the largest painting in the Czech Republic and currently has its own pavilion at the V√Ωstavi≈°tƒõ exhibition grounds.  Biography  The Artist in His Studio (1892) He was born out of wedlock and given his mother's surname. His father, an Army Lieutenant, was killed the following year during the Austro-Prussian War and his mother died six years later. The next nine years of his life are largely undocumented, although he apparently tried to enter Cadet School, but failed the examinations. Brief biography @ Rodon. At the age of sixteen, he entered the Academy of Fine Arts, but remained for only a year and was expelled. His studies did not resume until 1881, when he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, where his instructors were Ludwig von L√∂fftz and Nikolaos Gysis. While there, he exchanged ideas with other Czech painters such as Mikol√°≈° Ale≈° and Alfons Mucha. His first professional successes came as an illustrator for several German and Czech magazines, such as Svƒõtozor. During this time, he began to suffer from rheumatic fever so, in 1887, he returned to Prague, where he worked in the studios of Maximilian Pirner and edited publications from the newly established M√°nes Union of Fine Arts, headed by his old friend Ale≈°. Two years later, he received a state scholarship to study in Paris, where he found a position in the studios of Pierre-Victor Galland. In 1891, he was married. The following year, after Galland's death, he gave up his scholarship to become a freelance artist. He continued to create illustrations for periodicals and books by Czech authors and received a gold medal at an exhibition in Munich in 1892. Later, he adopted the Art Nouveau style and began receiving orders for posters. In 1895, he was elected a member of the \\"\\". By 1897, he was back in Prague, where he proposed creating a gigantic panorama of the Battle of Lipany for an upcoming exhibition. His proposal was accepted and, after making sketches at the battlefield, he began work in early 1898. He collaborated with Karel Ra≈°ka (1861-1918), the landscape painter V√°clav Jansa, colorist Theodor Hil≈°er (1866-1930) and the animal painter Ludv√≠k Vac√°tko. It measures 11 meters (36 feet) high and 95 meters (311 feet) long. The stress of completing this huge work on schedule had a fatal effect on his already fragile health and he died shortly after it went on display in 1898. A major retrospective of his work was held the following year. Three streets in have been named after him; in Dƒõƒç√≠n, Kladno and Prague.

The Union of South Africa participated with other British Commonwealth forces in battles in North Africa against Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps, and many South African pilots joined the Royal Air Force and fought against the Axis powers in the European theatre. Political choices at outbreak of war On the eve of World War II, the Union of South Africa found itself in a unique political and military quandary. While it was closely allied with the United Kingdom , being a co-equal Dominion under the 1931 Statute of Westminster with its head of state being the British king, the South African Prime Minister on 1 September 1939 was J.B.M. Hertzog ‚Äì the leader of the pro-Afrikaner and anti-British National Party. The National Party had joined in a unity government with the pro-British South African Party of Jan Smuts in 1934 as the United Party. Hertzog's problem was that South Africa was constitutionally obligated to support Great Britain against Nazi Germany. The Anglo-Polish military alliance obligated Britain, and in turn its dominions, to help Poland if attacked by the Nazis. After Adolf Hitler's forces attacked Poland on 1 September 1939, Britain declared war on Germany two days later. A short but furious debate unfolded in South Africa, especially in the halls of power in the Parliament of South Africa. It pitted those who sought to enter the war on Britain's side, led by Smuts, against those who wanted to keep South Africa neutral, led by Hertzog. Declaration of war against the Axis On 4 September 1939, the United Party caucus refused to accept Hertzog's stance of neutrality in World War II and deposed him in favour of Smuts. Upon becoming Prime Minister, on 6 September Smuts declared South Africa officially at war with Germany and the Axis. Immediately, Smuts set about fortifying South Africa against any possible German sea invasion because of South Africa's global strategic importance controlling the long sea route around the Cape of Good Hope. John Vorster and other members of the pro-Nazi Ossewabrandwag strongly objected to South Africa's participation in World War II and actively carried out sabotage against Smuts' government. Smuts took severe action against the Ossewabrandwag movement and jailed its leaders, including Vorster, for the duration of the war. Field Marshal and Prime Minister Smuts Field Marshal Jan Smuts was the only important non-British general whose advice was constantly sought by United Kingdom's war-time Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Smuts was invited to the Imperial War Cabinet in 1939 as the most senior South African in favour of war. On 28 May 1941, Smuts was appointed a Field Marshal of the British Army, becoming the first South African to hold that rank. Ultimately, Smuts would pay a steep political price for his closeness to the British establishment, to the King, and to Churchill which had made Smuts very unpopular amongst the Afrikaners, leading to his eventual downfall. Manpower With the declaration of war in September 1939, the South African Army numbered only 5,353 regulars, with an additional 14,631 men of the Active Citizen Force (ACF) which gave peace time training to volunteers and in time of war would form the main body of the army. Pre-war plans did not anticipate that the army would fight outside southern Africa and it was trained and equipped only for bush warfare. One of the problems to continuously face South Africa during the war was the shortage of available men. Due to its race policies it would only consider arming men of European descent which limited the available pool of men aged between 20 and 40 to around 320,000. In addition the declaration of war on Germany had the support of only a narrow majority in the South African parliament and was far from universally popular. Indeed, there was a significant minority actively opposed to the war and under these conditions conscription was never an option. The expansion of the army and its deployment overseas depended entirely on volunteers. Given the country's attitudes to race at the time, the enlistment of fighting troops from the much larger black population was hardly considered. Instead, in an attempt to free up as many whites as possible for the fighting and technical arms, a number of corps were formed to provide drivers and pioneers, drawn from the more acceptable Cape Coloured and Indian populations. These were eventually amalgamated into the Cape Corps. A Native Military Corps, manned by blacks, was also formed for pioneer and labouring tasks. For some of their tasks, individuals were armed, mainly for self-protection and guard duties, but they were never allowed to participate in actual combat against Europeans. Military contributions and casualties in World War II South Africa and its military forces contributed in many theatres of war. South Africa's contribution consisted mainly of supplying troops, airmen and material for the North African campaign (the Desert War) and the Italian Campaign as well as to Allied ships that docked at its crucial ports adjoining the Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean that converge at the tip of Southern Africa. Numerous volunteers also flew for the Royal Air Force. #The South African Army and Air Force played a major role in defeating the Italian forces of Benito Mussolini during the 1940‚Äì1941 East African Campaign. The converted Junkers Ju 86s of 12 Squadron, South African Air Force, carried out the first bombing raid of the campaign on a concentration of tanks at Moyale at 8am on 11 June 1940, mere hours after Italy's declaration of war.BROWN, J.A.

Valenti would then be hired as co- host of The Sports Inferno alongside Terry Foster, mid-days on 1270 WXYT in Detroit. In March 2009 Valenti caused controversy after reading a couple jokes about Detroit Lions defensive end Corey Smith, who was lost at sea and is presumed dead. Valenti while on air, read a couple distasteful \\"ticket texts\\" poking fun at Smith's disappearance. With 97.1 being the team's flagship station, he apologized on air the next day.

Highlights of the rant featured Valenti saying the Spartans \\"handed [the game] away like a nice three-button coat at the Salvation Army,\\" that they \\"choked on applesauce\\", and his plea to then-head coach John L. Smith to recognize that \\"timeouts are not like cell phone minutes ‚Äî they don't carry over!\\" Valenti also included scathing criticism of offensive coordinator Dave Baldwin's decision to have Drew Stanton \\"run the option in Hurricane Katrina,\\" and a desire for defensive coordinator Chris Smeland to be replaced by H.

St Edward's School, Cheltenham The majority of pupils come to the school from St Edward's Junior School, although a significant number come from schools across the county each year. St Edward's is Cheltenham's only independent day school. The current headmaster is Matthew Burke.  History  The school site, Charlton Park, was a hunting lodge that belonged to Edward the Confessor (1003-1066), the only English monarch to have been canonised. The manor of Cheltenham which included Charlton was royal property ‚Äì hence the local area's name, Charlton Kings ‚Äì and is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. Later the property was owned by a succession of families, and the original medieval manor house, known as Forden House, was rebuilt several times. It now is substantially as it was in the 18th century, though incorporating 16th-century beams and brickwork. In 1935 the property was acquired by a religious order, the sisters of La Sainte Union, originally from France, who established a convent in the house and added new buildings for classrooms. Charlton Park School was opened as a Roman Catholic school for girls in 1939. An area on the edge of the site was given for the building of a new Catholic parish church, Sacred Hearts, in 1957. The need for a similar Catholic school for boys in the Cheltenham area was met in 1958 when the Carmelite order of priests and brothers acquired another historic site, Ashley Manor, less than a mile away on the London road. Here they opened Whitefriars School. The two schools had many natural links, with families educating their sons and daughters at them. For some years Catholic children who passed their 11+ were awarded places at the schools by the local education authority. Both schools attracted many pupils of other denominations, while retaining their Catholic ethos. New buildings were added on both sites as the schools grew. By the 1980s, the numbers of L.S.U. sisters and Carmelite friars had fallen, and both orders were leaving the field of education. The parents at Charlton Park and Whitefriars were keen that the Christian education provided in the schools should continue. A new lay-run trust was set up, and St Edward's School was created as a fully independent school. The main school (Years 7 - 13) took over the Charlton Park site, while the Whitefriars site became St Edward's Junior School (Years 1 - 6).  Development  St Edward's building programme has continued: in summer 2008, a new block, the Abbot Building, was opened which includes a large new refectory, a drama studio and a new base for geography.

The release marked a shift in the label's direction; a year later 4AD would sign Pixies based in part on the band's connection to Throwing Muses, and by the mid-1990s much of the label's roster was made up of American bands. Production All the songs on the album were written by Kristin Hersh, with the exception of \\"Green\\", written by Tanya Donelly. The album was produced by Gil Norton, who went on to produce albums for Pixies. The band considers the album to be untitled, with Throwing Muses the name they give to another album released in 2003.  Release history  The album was originally released in the UK by 4AD in August 1986 (CAD607) on LP, CD and cassette. Sometime around the early 1990s, the album went out of print, as plans were made by the band's American label, Sire Records to issue the album for the first time in the USA, along with 1987's Chains Changed EP, which had also never seen American release. After Throwing Muses were dropped by Sire following the disappointing sales for 1995's critical favorite University, plans for the re-issue were dropped. The band later resurrected the re-issue project, issuing the 2-CD compilation In a Doghouse in 1998 on 4AD (DAD607CD) in the UK, and on Rykodisc in the USA. This compilation not only contained the debut LP and EP as originally planned, but also (on the second CD) the demo tape that convinced 4AD president Ivo Watts-Russell to sign the band; newly recorded versions of songs originally written in the band's early years; and the band's award-winning 1987 video for the song \\"Fish\\". Reception AllMusic calls the album a \\"powerful debut\\" whose \\"startling collision of punk energy, folky melodicism, and Kristin Hersh's mercurial voice and lyrics...puts the work of most self-consciously 'tortured' artists to shame.\\" The review praises the record's \\"fluid, effortless emotional shifts\\"‚Äîalso described as \\"violent, vibrant mood swings\\".

Thorne began his musical career as a pianist with the big bands of England during the 1940s, playing at night clubs and the dance halls. At age 27, Thorne decided to seriously study composition with private tutors at Cambridge and later studied the organ for five years in London.Ken Thorne. supermancinema.co.uk 2011. Retrieved 18 July 2011. Film scoring Thorne began composing scores for films in 1948. He was considered Richard Lester's composer of choice since their first work together on It's Trad, Dad! (1962), Help! (1965) and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1966). When Henry Mancini was scoring Blake Edwards' 1968 film The Party with Peter Sellers, Thorne composed the soundtrack to Inspector Clouseau. He also composed the music scores for How I Won the War (1967), The Monkees movie Head (1968), The Magic Christian (1969) and The Ritz (1976). He was also hired for Richard Lester's films Superman II and III with instructions to reuse the themes composed by John Williams from the first film and adapt them for the sequels, also adding some original work. From the 1980s, Ken Thorne mainly focused on his work for TV, working predominantly with director Kevin Connor. His television work included the theme to the 1964 BBC series R3, and he also scored incidental music for The Persuaders! and The Zoo Gang in the 1970s. His later work included the score for the miniseries Return to Lonesome Dove in 1993.

It is located 17 km south of Panagyurishte and 26 km north of Pazardzhik, on both banks of the Luda Yana River. the population is 2,383. There is a small workshop of Optix, a Panagyurishte-based optical and lens producing firm. The village lies at 407 m above sea level at the foot of the Sredna Gora mountain range, at . As of 2005 the mayor is Mariya Shopova. Geography The village is situated in the Sredna Gora plains, and is around 20 km. from Panagyurishte. It is near the river Luda Yana. Some of the villagers call the village \\"The Spigot\\" (), while others simply call it \\"The Village\\" (). The village is known as being very hospitable. An area named Petelovo is located near the village‚Äîlarge amounts of gold and other precious metals have been found there before. History The exact date of the village's establishment is unknown, but it is known that it was inhabited at the time of the Thracians. This is backed by a large amount of archeological items in the local areas Popinsko Kale, Obrochishte, Sveti Nikola, Sveta Petka, Gospodova Cherkva, Borova Mogila, Poleto, and Tsonina Chukara. Above 25 burial mounds, a votive plate to the Thracian leader Heros, ceramic items, were found, which shows proof of a functioning settlement and a forgotten and misunderstood history. It is thought that the settlement fell under Ottoman rule in 1393, at which time the Bulgarian kingdom (under Ivan Shishman) was falling into Ottoman hands. Popintsi is an old Bulgarian village, created near the Middle Ages. Information about the village under the names Popinche and Popinich is contained within Ottoman registers from 1489–ü–æ–ø–∏–Ω—á–µ - Istanbul - BOA,TD 26 and 1530.–ü–æ–ø–∏–Ω–∏—á - Istanbul - BOA,TD 370 The village traditions have stayed alive for centuries, passed from generation to generation. During recent years, a new tradition has emerged‚Äîfrom 1977 onwards, every three years, a large festival is held in the village, with participants from the entire country. The community center \\"Iskra,\\" established in 1872, plays a large role in keeping the cultural traditions in the village alive. Groups in the center revive and recreate the Popintsi culture, not only for the local public, but for the country, and have won many awards. Near the historic fort \\"Gradishteto,\\" even today, the remnants of an ancient chapel can be found, which shows the presence of the Eastern Orthodox Church in Popintsi even from ancient times. The current church was built in 1848, and its bells still are rung in the village on holidays. During Ottoman rule, the village did not accept Turks at all, despite their hospitability. There is a tale, that one night, two Turks decide to \\"visit\\" in a house in Popintsi. They demand that the family in the house prepares a large amount of food for them: bread, banitsa, and many other things. At that time, the mother, daughter and boy were present in the house‚Äîthe father was not present. Suddenly, the Turks begin to eye the daughter, and the intelligent mother tells the girl to get the father, while giving them copious amounts of wine and rakia, and they soon become drunk. The father then came and quickly slaughtered the Turks. They buried the bodies in the house‚Äîas during that time, the village huts had only dirt floors‚Äîand covered them with clay. The victims' fellow Turks then came to try to locate their friends and were unable to. From then on, Turks no longer \\"visited\\" the village.

Originally emphasizing acoustic instruments and group harmonies, they performed extensively and recorded two albums. In 1965, as the Modern Folk Quintet, they ventured into electric folk rock and recorded with producers Phil Spector and Jack Nitzsche. Although MFQ received a fair amount of exposure, their rock-oriented recordings failed to capture their sound or generate enough interest and they disbanded in 1966. Subsequently, MFQ re-formed several times and made further recordings. Early career Cyrus Faryar, Henry Diltz, Chip Douglas, and Stan White formed the quartet in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1962, after Faryar had returned from the mainland U.S. after a period singing with Dave Guard's Whiskeyhill Singers. They took the name Modern Folk Quartet as a conscious parallel with the Modern Jazz Quartet, who were known for their use of sophisticated counterpoint. The MFQ adopted a similar approach to vocalization; a fellow folk musician commented: \\"They were singing diminished, flatted ninths, jazz chords ... really advanced stuff\\". The group moved to Los Angeles, where they became regulars at the Troubadour club. After White became ill, he was replaced by local singer-guitarist Jerry Yester, who had performed with the New Christy Minstrels and Les Baxter's Balladeers. Herb Cohen became their manager (later manager of Frank Zappa, Tim Buckley and others) and the quartet recorded their debut album in 1963. Simply titled The Modern Folk Quartet, it was produced by Jim Dickson (later manager of the Byrds) for Warner Brothers Records. MFQ performed with an array of popular folk group instruments, including guitar, banjo, ukulele, bass, and percussion, and four-part vocal harmonies. An album review called their material \\"a superbly chosen selection of concurrently new traditionals and original adaptations of standards from the folk music canon\\" that benefit from the group's fresh approach. For much of 1963 to 1965, MFQ was based in New York City's Greenwich Village, then the center of the folk- music movement. They performed at clubs, such as the Bitter End, and \\"hundreds of college concerts\\". In November 1963, MFQ appeared in the Warner Bros. film, Palm Springs Weekend. During the sequence at Jack's Casino, they sing \\"The Ox Driver's Song\\" and a second unidentified song. The group released a second album in 1964 for Warner Bros. titled Changes. A review noted \\"with an ear toward sustaining the fresh sound of their predecessor [album] they blend their arrangements and adaptations to another impressive lineup of modern compositions from the group's contemporaries\\". These include early songs written by Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, John Stewart, and Chet Powers (aka Dino Valente). A third album for Warner Bros. was not forthcoming. Yester explained \\"we were on the road so much that when we were off, we didn't really want to work ... We basically performed with those two albums worth of material. I don't think we had enough for another album until we changed into folk-rock\\". Folk-rock period In 1965, MFQ began exploring a rock sound. Faryar saw the progression \\"as a logical outcome of how we think. We would have had to change our whole mental attitude to stay where we were\\". He also admitted being influenced by other bands: \\"The Byrds whet our appetites for folk-rock. Whatever sweet music the Byrds came up with, they legitimized this transition from folk to folk-rock ... We had developed a rock set when we played with the Lovin' Spoonful at the Cafe Wha? in the [Greenwich] Village\\" (the Spoonful's John Sebastian sometimes also sat in on drums with the MFQ between playing sets at a nearby club). Their first attempt to record rock was with producer Charles Calello. A single \\"Every Minute of Every Day\\", backed with \\"That's Alright with Me\\" was released in April 1965 by Warner Bros. It was largely unnoticed and Faryar felt that the material was wrong for them. The group moved back to Los Angeles and debuted their folk rock set at their old haunt, the Troubador. Faryar recalled reactions similar to Dylan's electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival: The transition was complete in September 1965 when they added rock drummer Eddie Hoh and were renamed \\"officially the Modern Folk Quintet, but prefer[red] to be known as the MFQ\\". Producer Phil Spector became interested in the group. According to Henry Diltz, \\"we'd heard that Spector was looking for a folk-rock band ... The word was that he really wanted the Lovin' Spoonful, but he couldn't get them. So he came down to see us instead\\". Spector went as far as to join MFQ onstage at a local club with a twelve-string guitar and performed \\"Spanish Harlem\\" with the group. Soon he became a fixture in their lives: At Gold Star Studios in 1965 (from left to right): Faryar, Yester, Douglas, Phil Spector, Diltz, Hoh Recording sessions at Gold Star Studios followed where they recorded \\"This Could Be the Night\\", cowritten by Spector and Harry Nilsson. The song bore Spector's Wall-of-Sound used on Beach Boys recordings, rather than a folk rock sound reminiscent of the Byrds with Terry Melcher. It was slated for release as their first single with the new lineup, but Spector became focused on Tina Turner and \\"River Deep ‚Äì Mountain High\\" and \\"forgot all about the Modern Folk Quartet\\". Instead it was used as the theme to the rock concert film The Big TNT Show, the 1966 follow-up to the T.A.M.I. Show. Yester later commented \\"I never forgave him for the thing with the TNT Show [for which Spector was the musical director and associate producer]. We were supposed to be in it, because we were on his label, for god's sake. But we ended up being the entertainment for everybody while they were setting up for the next band\\". The MFQ performed frequently at Hollywood clubs, such as the Whisky a Go Go and the Trip. They appeared with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Donovan, the Byrds, and the Mamas and the Papas. After Frank Zappa made some disparaging comments about New York, MFQ took the place of the Mothers of Invention at the Velvet Underground's Exploding Plastic Inevitable performances in Los Angeles. In early 1966, MFQ signed with Dunhill Records, where they recorded with producer Jack Nitzsche. \\"Night Time Girl\\", a song written by Al Kooper and Irwin Levine, has been described as raga rock, with its eastern-sounding bouzouki accompaniment and sunshine pop/Mamas & the Papas-style vocals. The single reached number 122 on Billboard magazine's extended pop chart on April 16, 1966. Despite their exposure at the clubs, an appearance on the television music variety show Shindig!, and more college dates, a breakthrough eluded them and they disbanded by July 1966. Band members felt that the material and direction given to them by record producers were partly to blame. According to Faryar: \\"I think Herbie [Cohen, their manager] steered us into some situations, like with Charlie Calello, where they wanted us to think this kind of song, they wanted us to think that kind of song, and we did not thrive in the hands of that kind of direction. We were most successful inventing our own stuff\\". Yester added: \\"I wished we would have recorded that [a folk-rock album], but we never did. The group didn't embrace original material as readily as I thought it should have. If we would have stuck with Chip's and my songs, we would have gotten further in the folk-rock days\\". Later years Two years after MFQ disbanded, a second Dunhill MFQ single, the double A-side \\"Don't You Wonder\\" backed with \\"I Had a Dream Last Night\\", was released in 1968.Priore 2007, p. 98. The various members went on to develop their own careers. They re-formed between 1975 and 1978, and they released a third album \\"Live at The Ice House 1978, and again in the 1980s, again becoming the Modern Folk Quintet when Yester's brother Jim, formerly of the Association, joined in 1988.

History The origins of the company stretch to 1981, when Edmonton's Theatre Network became the third company in the world to regularly produce Keith Johnstone's Theatresports. The Artistic Director of Theatre Network at the time, Stephen Heatley, brought the high-energy format to Edmonton, and eventually, performers from the show formed Rapid Fire Theatre, which officially became its own theatre company in 1988. Rapid Fire Theatre performed originally at the Phoenix Theatre in Downtown Edmonton until 1990 when it moved to The Chinook Theatre in Old Strathcona, which became the Varscona Theatre in 1994. Rapid Fire Theatre performed there until 2012, and was part of the Varscona Theatre Alliance, along with Teatro la Quindicina and Shadow Theatre. In September 2012, Rapid Fire Theatre moved back north of the river to Zeidler Hall at the Citadel Theatre complex, as announced by Maria Bamford. In 2013 Rapid Fire Theatre launched a capital campaign with the goal of building their own theatre.

It is often considered their best record, and is their second best selling album. The album reunites La Ley again with Rodrigo Aboitiz and invites a new member, Pedro Furgone, after the death of founder Andres Bobe. The album begins the dark era of La Ley. It was also La Ley's first album to have a song completely in French (\\"Deuxi√®me Fois\\"). The album contains the number one hits \\"El Duelo\\", \\"D√≠a Cero\\", and \\"Cielo Market\\".  Backstory and Reception  In 1994, Bobe died in a motorcycle accident, an event that brought the group to a major crossroad. It was Beto Cuevas who ultimately became most prominent in the group as it weathered the disaster. He assumed the dual function of bandleader and spokesperson, steering the band through the catastrophe. Some months passed before the band regenerated to the form of a quintet once again, featuring Cuevas, Rojas, and Claver√≠a, with new a guitarist, Pedro Frugone, and La Ley's former keyboard player, Aboitiz, who rejoined the group at that time. Bobe continued to influence the band even after his death. Beto Cuevas says that Bobe came to him in a dream and when Cuevas asked how he could complete the currently unfinished album if Bobe was dead, Andres responded, \\"You can see me, but to the rest of the world I am just invisible.\\" This was the direct inspiration for Beto to write songs such as \\"Invisible\\" and \\"D√≠a Cero.\\" As a result, in 1995 Invisible was released (production was delayed until 1994) with the first single \\"El Duelo\\" which exceed the expectations of the band and quickly rose to the top spot in most of the billboard charts in Latin America, particularly in their native Chile, Mexico and Spain. The band's reputation began to spread quickly, and they moved to Mexico in an attempt to further their success. Shortly after, they released the single \\"D√≠a Cero\\" which was an immediate success and to this day is considered to be one of the group's most successful singles. After some time, they released the third single \\"Hombre\\", which included images from a recent United States tour. For the first and only time on 1996, La Ley released two more singles (\\"Cielo Market\\" and \\"1-800 Dual\\"), bringing the total to five. The album as a whole is considered by many fans to be the band's best album; it is their second-best-selling album, behind La Ley MTV Unplugged. The album sold 400,000 copies within its first few months in Mexico alone.

His name reached its greatest reputation in the years since his death under the leadership of his sons, first with an emphasis on the use of innovative materials and later for more conservative designs. After 2000 the company went into decline and was sold to investment bankers.  Biography  Originally trained as a shoemaker, after World War I Jourdan opened a shoe shop in Romans-sur-Is√®re in the Dr√¥me region of France, the center of France's shoe industry. His lines of women's shoes prospered, and this became the focus of his career. After only two years Jourdan moved his shoe company into a factory on Boulevard Voltaire in 1921 and employed over 30 people in Romans. In the 1930s, Jourdan was the first shoe designer to place advertisements in the high-end fashion magazines, which helped to identify his name as an haute couture house. In 1947 his three sons Rene, Charles and Roland joined the company, and in 1950 they expanded beyond France and began selling designer shoes in the United Kingdom. One regular customer was none other than Lady Diana Spencer who, eventually became Princess of Wales. Jourdan and his sons opened his first boutique in Paris in 1957, although the company headquarters remained in Romans. They were granted a license to design and manufacture shoes under the Christian Dior brand in 1959 and in more recent years have also created designs under the Pierre Cardin label. The company has for many years focused on being viewed as setting trends and innovating in fashion design, and it can be debated whether Herbert Levine and Beth Levine inspired this innovation or learned from it; both may be true. Jourdan and the Levines are arguably the most innovative designers to use new materials in women's shoes in the period since World War II. In the 1960s and early 1970s Jourdan used its magazine advertising campaigns to advance its avant-garde image by using imagery from the surrealist photographer Guy Bourdin. In 1975 ready-to-wear clothing and handbags were added to the Jourdan line, although the company has remained best known for its shoes. Charles Jourdan died in Paris in 1976, but the company continued under the leadership of his sons. During this decade Roland Jourdan began to lead the company's designs, taking the basic pump, lengthening the toe and adding simple buckles to increase both its delicacy and its tailored image. By this time Jourdan boutiques were open in major cities across Europe and in North America. Roland Jourdan retired in 1981, and the company subsequently was known for more conservative designs. Jourdan gained unintended publicity from the exposure of Imelda Marcos' excesses in shoe fashion in 1986, among them many Jourdan stilettos. The company has also created a limited number of perfumes, including a scent called Stiletto (after the stiletto heel) in 1996 to recognize the 75th anniversary of the firm. To honor Paris the bottle was shaped like the Eiffel Tower. The flagship store for the Romans-based manufacturer was moved to the Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris in 1999, but it remained open for less than two years due to financial troubles caused by a switch in emphasis from design to retailing. In mid-2002 the company filed for bankruptcy with over $9 million in debt and was reorganized as the Jourdan family sold its stake to a Luxembourg investment fund, Lux Diversity. Sales had fallen to only 65,000 pairs per year. Patrick Cox, a Canadian who had launched his own shoe label, was named head designer of Charles Jourdan in 2003. In 2005 he left the firm and was replaced by Josephus Thimister.  Cocktail  Charles Jourdan may also be responsible for the somewhat obscure titular cocktail. Its original iteration requires somewhat obscure ingredients, as follows: * 4 cl lighter, flowery tequila * 3 cl verjus * 2 cl sweet white Gew√ºrztraminer * 1 cl Triple Sec * 0.5 cl cr√®me de violette * 2 dashes orange bitters Alternative recipes substitute lychee liqueur, gin, and grapefruit juice for the more recondite ingredients.

It is relatively large for the region and has 1,307 inhabitants. Its name until 1950 was Mechka (–ú–µ—á–∫–∞), which in Bulgarian means \\"bear\\". Geography Oborishte. The village is situated in the mountain of Sredna Gora. The surrounding country is hilly, covered with forests of oak, beech and fir in which mushrooms are particularly abundant in the late summer and autumn. There are several micro dams located to the south and southwest of the village as well as a large dam to the north in which the refuse waters of Asarel Medet are accumulated. The road between Panagyurishte and Vakarel passes through the village. Settlements nearby include the town of Panagyurishte at 9 km to the east and the villages of Poibrene at 9 km to the west and Muhovo at 17 km to the south. The main occupation of the population is agriculture. Barley, rye and plums are among the most common crops to be raised in the surrounding areas. The villagers grow flowers, orchards and vegetables in their gardens. Livestock is by far dominated by goats, pigs and hens. Many locals work in the large copper plant Asarel. History The modern name of the village comes from the locality of the same name at 3 km to the east where in April 1876 was held the Grand National Assembly. The decision for the April Uprising was made there. The deputy from Mechka was Dimitar Pavlov. However, there was a traitor among the deputies and the uprising broke out prematurely and was crushed by the Ottoman authorities. Many of the surrounding villages and Panagyurishte were burned to the ground. Culture The main landmark is the 19th century church and its renewed bell- tower in which the national hero Vasil Levski had allegedly hidden. There is also a large elementary school. On the central square rises the Town hall and the local Chitalishte (a kind of library) which is among the oldest in the region. Traditions Every year there are celebrations held on 1 and 2 May at the Oborishte locality to commemorate the First Grand National Assembly. The event is attended by people from all over the region but mainly from Panagyurishte. There is a small monument erected on the meadow where the assembly was held with the names of all deputies but the name of the traitor was erased.

They landed at Anakena beach and his people spread out across the island, sub-divided it between clans claiming descent from his sons, and lived for more than a thousand years in their isolated island home at the southeastern tip of the Polynesian Triangle. History Polynesians first came to Rapa Nui (also called Easter Island) sometime between 300 CE and 800 CE. These are the common elements of oral history that have been extracted from island legends. Linguistic, DNA and pollen analysis all point to a Polynesian first settlement of the island at that time, but it is unlikely that other details can be verified.Summary of Thomas S. Barthel's version of Hotu MatuÍûåa's arrival to Easter Island. During this era the Polynesians were colonising islands across a vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. Hotu MatuÍûåa led his people from Hiva; linguistic analysis comparing Rapanui to other Polynesian languages suggests this was the Marquesas Islands. Legend Hau-Maka had a dream in which his spirit traveled to a far country, to help look for new land for King Hotu MatuÍûåa. He traveled to the Mata ki te rangi (\\"Eyes that look to the sky\\"). The island has also been called Te pito o te henua, which means \\"the Center of the Earth.\\" Both islands are commonly said to be Easter Island. When Hau-Maka woke, he told the King. The King then ordered seven men to travel to the island from Hiva, their mythical home, to investigate. They found the land and returned to Hiva. The king himself then traveled to the new island.Thomas S. Barthel's The Eighth Land: The Polynesian Settlement of Easter Island (Honolulu: University of Hawaii 1978; originally published in German in 1974) The king traveled with his queen, Vakai (Vakai-a-hiva).Bernice P. Bishop Museum Bulletin, 1971 Theories and controversy TuÍûåu ko Iho The resemblance of the name to an early Mangarevan founder god, Atu Motua (\\"Father Lord\\"), has made some historians suspect that Hotu MatuÍûåa was added to Easter Island mythology only in the 1860s, along with adopting the Mangarevan language. The real founder would have been TuÍûåu ko Iho, who became just a supporting character in the Hotu MatuÍûåa‚Äìcentric legends.See Steven Fischer (1994).

Online version. Dates of the first settlements There is considerable uncertainty about the accuracy of this legend as well as the date of settlement. Published literature suggests the island was settled around 300-400 CE, or at about the time of the arrival of the earliest settlers in Hawaii. Some scientists say that Easter Island was not inhabited until 700-800 CE. This date range is based on glottochronological calculations and on three radiocarbon dates from charcoal that appears to have been produced during forest clearance activities,Diamond, Jared. Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. Penguin Books: 2005. . Chapter 2: Twilight at Easter pp.79‚Äì119. See page 89. while a recent study, with radiocarbon dates from what is thought to be very early material, proves the island was settled by 1200 CE.Hunt, T. L., Lipo, C. P., 2006. Science, 1121879. See also \\"Late Colonization of Easter Island\\" in Science Magazine. Entire article is also hosted by the Department of Anthropology of the University of Hawaii. This seems to be supported by the latest information on island's deforestation that could have started around the same time. Any earlier human activity seems to be insignificant or low impact. South America or Polynesia The Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl pointed out many cultural similarities between Easter Island and South American Indian cultures which he suggested might have resulted from some settlers arriving also from the continent.Heyderdahl, Thor.

The same legend claims that occasional travels oversees were done already earlier. See History of the Incas by Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, 1572. Online version of the book, page 91; in English. Some early accounts of the legend place hanau epe as the original residents and Polynesians as later immigrants coming from Oparo.This version was recorded by Doctor J.L. Palmer in 1868. See Heyerdahl. However, the legends may be influenced by the situation of the 1860s: fierce fighting ensued on the island when the remaining population and returning immigrants fought for the land and resources. After mutual suspicions erupted in a violent clash, the hanau eepe were overthrown and exterminated, leaving only one survivor.The \\"Hanau Eepe\\", their Immigration and Extermination. The first description of island's demographics by Jacob Roggeveen in 1722 still claimed that the population consisted of two distinctive ethnic groups, one being clearly Polynesian and the other \\"white\\" with so lengthened earlobes that they could tie them behind their necks. Roggeveen also noted how some of the islanders were \\"generally large in stature\\". Islanders' tallness was also witnessed by the Spanish who visited the island in 1770, measuring heights of 196 and 199 cm (6.4 and 6.5 ft).See Heyerdahl. The fact that sweet potatoes, a staple of the Polynesian diet, and several other domestic plants - up to 12 in Easter Island - are of South American origin indicates that there may have been some contact between the two cultures. Either Polynesians have traveled to South America and back, or South American balsa rafts have drifted to Polynesia, possibly unable to make a return trip because of their less developed navigational skills and more fragile boats, or both. Polynesian connections in South America have been noticed among the Mapuche Indians in central and southern Chile.Mapuche Indians and Polynesian connections. The Polynesian name for the small islet of Salas y G√≥mez (Manu Motu Motiro Hiva, \\"Bird's islet on the way to a far away land\\") east of Easter Island has also been seen as a hint that South America was known before European contacts. Further complicating the situation is that the word Hiva (\\"far away land\\") was also the name of the islanders' legendary home country. Inexplicable insistence on an eastern origin for the first inhabitants was unanimous among the islanders in all early accounts.This was recorded e.g. by the British B. F. Clark in 1877. See Heyerdahl. Mainstream archeology is skeptical about any non-Polynesian influence on the island's prehistory, although the discussion has become political. DNA sequence analysis of Easter Island's current inhabitants (a tool not available in Heyerdahl's time) offers strong evidence of Polynesian origins. However, since few islanders survived the 19th century slave raids, epidemics and deportations (perhaps only 0.25% of the peak population), this evidence depends on how representative the survivors were of the general Rapanui population.

History  The band started in 1987 playing at bars, parties and every type of dive. After a pair of adjustments to the band's lineup they recorded two albums with the label Barrab√°s. They made themselves known by playing in venues across Madrid until 1995 when they split with Barrab√°s and decided to start their own production business aptly named BKT. They launched two albums, Cr√≠a Cuervos and Tu Condena, and played in rock festivals as diverse as Festimad and Metaliko Rock among others. Following this, the group decided to create a trilogy which would be named La Ruta del Ch√©, the three albums of which would include different versions of popular songs such as \\"Hasta Siempre\\" by Carlos Puebla and engravings made while they were on tour in countries such as Cuba, Mexico, and Argentina. At this stage of La Ruta del Ch√© the group took inspiration from the South American countries they visited and included a greater number of instruments and rhythms from Latin America. After concluding Ruta del Ch√©, they released a new album entitled Historias Directas de Boikot, where they included a booklet and a video of the tour. This was in turn followed by the release of two new albums: De Espaldas al Mundo and Tus Problemas Crecen in 2002 and 2004 respectively. During 2007, much as in previous years, the band performed at numerous festivals in Colombia, Germany, Italy and Turkey. In Turkey the group featured in Barƒ±≈üarock, a festival organized under the motto \\"for peace, rock and the convergence of cultures\\" celebrated during August in Istanbul, Turkey. In addition, in 2007 the band also participated in the extensive tour \\"Not One Step Back\\" along with Reincidentes, Porretas and Sonora. Near the end of 2007 the members of Boikot traveled to Mostar, Bosnia to record their eleventh album in the Pavarotti Music Centre. Their eleventh disc was entitled Amaneci√≥ and was released on April 2, 2008 under Realidad Musical.  Influences  Boikot's music is a blend of ska, punk, hardcore punk and general rock. Bands like The Clash, La Polla Records, Kortatu, Pearl Jam, Ramones, Nirvana, NOFX, Bad Religion, Le√±o, Burning and Barricada influenced them. Their music is influenced by South American Latin rhythms and instruments. More recently Balkan instruments have worked their way into the group's diverse musical repertoire.

The two central figures are physician John Snow, who created a map of the cholera cases, and the Reverend Henry Whitehead, whose extensive knowledge of the local community helped determine the initial cause of the outbreak. Dr. John Snow was a revered anesthetist who carried out epidemiological work in Soho, London. Around the mid-1850s Snow figured out the source of cholera contamination to be the drinking water from the Broad Street pump.  Reception  The New York Times reviewed The Ghost Map, stating that there was \\"a great story here\\". A review posted in the International Journal of Epidemiology was largely favorable, stating that \\"the single weakness of this book is a bewildering final section which attempts to apply John Snow's work to a long list of contemporary problems.

It includes a graphic artist's \\"version\\" of parts of the actual arms. The blue shield features a crown and anchor, symbols which have long been the working images for Sydney. The white anchor represents Sydney as a port city on Sydney Harbour and the discovery of Australia by a naval officer. The gold masoned mural crown, common in many Commonwealth municipal arms, denotes the power and authority of a city. The upper division of the shield features simplified versions of the three emblems in the upper part of the previous coat of arms, which together represent the naming of Sydney, the British contribution to Sydney's establishment and Sydney's emergence as a port city. The leftmost, with three white shells and a blue chevron on a gold background, is based on part of the arms of the man for whom the city was named, Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney. Townshend played an important role as Principal Under-Secretary of State when Sydney was founded in 1788. The coat of arms of Sydney above Sydney Town Hall features a shield with a beehive, a traditional symbol of industry, and a ship, representing Sydney's maritime heritage. The shield is supported by a British seaman and an Indigenous Australian and the design includes the motto \\"I take but I surrender\\". The central emblem, a blue cross on white overlaid with a yellow circle, was originally the red cross of the flag of England, which is also a significant feature of British Naval Flag, acknowledging the contribution of Captain Arthur Phillip. The yellow circle represents the globe which was a principal feature of the arms granted posthumously to Captain James Cook, the naval officer who discovered the east coast of Australia. The top right emblem, containing three white lion heads and a blue chevron with a curved upper edge, is based on the arms of the first Lord Mayor of Sydney, Thomas Hughes, who first suggested that the city obtain a grant of arms. The shield is supported by a serpent and a coiled rope. The serpent, in blue with white and gold markings, represents the Rainbow Serpent, a creator-being said to have formed the landscape in the Dreamtime as it travelled through the country. Its markings are based on those used by the Eora people, who lived in the area on which Sydney was founded. The rope continues the maritime imagery, and symbolises the diverse origins of the people of Sydney. The rope and serpent are intertwined, representing cultural harmony. The crest is a six-pointed star or \\"Mullet of six points\\". History The former coat of arms From 1857 until 1908, the City of Sydney used variations on a design for the city seal by draughtsman M. de St Remy. This design, for which the city never received an official grant of arms, featured a shield with a rising sun, a common symbol in early Australian heraldry representing the growth of the new colony, and a ship, representing Sydney's maritime heritage. The sun was later replaced with a beehive, a traditional symbol of industry. The shield was supported by a British seaman and an Indigenous Australian and the design included the motto \\"I take but I surrender\\". After the position of Mayor become that of Lord Mayor in 1902, the first Lord Mayor, Thomas Hughes, suggested that the council apply for a grant of arms from the College of Arms in London. The heraldic designer William F. Ward submitted a new design, which included the ship, supporters and motto from the earlier version, but also included elements of the arms of Thomas Townshend and Captain Cook, as well as the crown, anchor and six-pointed star as a crest. The ship was now on a gold over blue background, symbolising the \\"Golden South\\". When the arms were approved by the heralds on 30 July 1908, the arms of Thomas Hughes had been added, along with a helmet and mantling above the shield. The new arms adopted in 1996 simplified many elements of the 1908 arms, although the ship and motto were completely removed. The sailor and indigenous person were replaced with the modern style serpent and coiled rope, with their symbolism extended by the intertwining. The city still uses a banner of the 1908 arms as the official flag. As the current arms does not follow the original grant of arms, it is not in fact a proper coat of arms at all; more of a logo in the style of a coat of arms.

History  Halifax Fire Department - Plaque commemorating first Fire Department in Canada, Grand Parade (Halifax), Nova Scotia Halifax originated as a British fortification in 1749, followed by Dartmouth in 1750 and Sackville in 1751. The Halifax Fire Service is the oldest fire department in Canada (1754). It was first known as the Union Fire Club and then became the Union Engine Company (1768). The Dartmouth Fire Department was eventually formed on the east side of the harbour in 1861. Nine fire fighters were killed in the Halifax Explosion, the most ever at a single event in Canada.http://thechronicleherald.ca/community/bedford- sackville/1134967-museum-shows-off-canada-s-oldest-fire-department-s-history In 1996, with the creation of the newly amalgamated Halifax Regional Municipality, the Fire Service was consolidated through a merger of the fire departments of the cities of Halifax and Dartmouth, the town of Bedford and the many volunteer departments located throughout Halifax County. At that time, there were 515 career fire fighters and 1,200 volunteer firefighters from a total of 38 fire departments would become part of the new organization. This extremely diverse entity was brought together under Fire Chief Gary Greene and Deputy Chiefs Michael Eddy and William Mosher. The department is currently led by Fire Chief Ken Stuebing, Deputies Peter Andrews, Dave Meldrum, Roy Hollett and Corey Beals. In 2011, a museum to commemorate the history of fire fighting in Nova Scotia, with special attention to the Halifax region was opened in Fall River, Nova Scotia named the Regional Firefighters Interpretation Centre. Their website is www.rficns.com There is a provincial firefighter museum in Yarmouth. Since 2012, there is an Annual Firefighter Memorial Service on June 2. The Fallen Firefighters monument is located at Station 4, 5830 Duffus Street, Halifax. Operations The service consists of a total of 51 stations, 489 career firefighters and civilian employees, over 600 volunteer firefighters, and is divided into 2 primary divisions: * \\"Core\\" - Serving HRM's urban core, this division comprises 18 twenty-four hour stations, 10 all career stations, and 8 composite stations with additional volunteer staff. Communities and neighbourhoods are covered by this division in Halifax, Dartmouth, Bedford, Eastern Passage, Westphal, Cole Harbour and Lower Sackville. * \\"Rural\\" - Serving HRM's large rural area in the eastern and western parts of Halifax County, this division is primarily volunteer, supported by composite day staff stations. It comprises 30 fire departments with 33 stations (24 all volunteer, 9 composite), 95 trucks, 500 volunteer and 38 career firefighters organized into 4 zones. In addition to regular urban and rural firefighting services, HRFE also provides Technical Rescue, Water and Ice Rescue, Hazardous Materials, and Medical First Responder services. Under the currently suspended Federal USAR Task Force program, HRFE had been designated as CAN TF-5, one of 5 USAR teams from across Canada. HRFE is also equipped and trained for CBRN response.

The name, Zanmi Lasante, means Partners In Health in Haitian Creole. It was built in 1985 to treat patients who were incapable of paying hospital fees. Services cost the equivalent of about eighty American cents for everyone \\"except for women and children, the destitute, and anyone who was seriously ill.\\" Additionally, no one may be turned away. Its facilities include two operating wards, \\"adult and pediatric inpatient wards, an infectious disease center, an outpatient clinic, a women's health clinic (Proje Sante Fanm), ophthalmology and general medicine clinics, two laboratories, a pharmaceutical warehouse, a Red Cross blood bank, and radiographic services.\\" It currently has eight sites in the area of the central plateau of Haiti and serves a catchment area of 1.2 million Haitian peasant farmers Zanmi Lasante is the largest non-government healthcare provider in Haiti. Its staff includes over 4000 people, most of them Haitians. The staff at Zanmi Lasante is able to treat most common tuberculosis patients for $150‚Äì200, while the same case in the U.S. would cost between $15000-20000. Zanmi Lasante, located in Cange, Haiti  History  Zanmi Lasante was created by Paul Farmer, Ophelia Dahl, Tom White, Jim Yong Kim, and Todd McCormack in 1983. It was formed to provide medical care to a small village named Cange in the central plateau of Haiti, that Farmer described as: \\"amazingly, biblically, dry and barren.\\" Farmer was horrified by the living conditions that the people living in Cange suffered: \\"An individual might exist in misery this great almost anywhere, but it was hard to imagine an entire community poorer and sicker than this.\\" It began as a small community clinic, and its mission of servicing the poor was inspired by an idea that Farmer valued: \\"doctors are lawyers for the poor\\" -Rudolph Virchow. Paul decided to create his own health clinic after visiting the other major healthcare clinics and hospitals in Haiti and being disappointed that they refused care to individuals without money Zanmi Lasante faced Haitian opposition during its initial stages. The hospital outwardly supported the democratically elected president Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1990. When Aristide was removed from power by the Haitian Junta, or military, Farmer spoke out against them; thus Zanmi Lasante became at odds with the military. On multiple occasions, the military investigated the medical complex, threatening to shut it down, or to attack the staff. Only the threat that Zanmi Lasante was the best chance at healing a Haitian soldier when he inevitably became ill was enough to deter them. The clinic saw three years of hardship, with patients afraid to seek medical treatment for fear of getting attacked by Haitian Junta, and Farmer forbidden from entering the country. Fortunately, Aristide was reinstated as president in 1994, and Partners in Health was able to continue improving upon Zanmi Lasante. Zanmi Lasante built schools, houses, and water sanitation systems throughout its catchment area to prevent disease as well as treat it once it arose. Zanmi Lasante has helped educate 9,400 Haitian children.\\"PIH- Haiti Farmer set up Zanmi Lasante to be a fully functioning, autonomous healthcare system even in his absence. In fact, Zanmi Lasante has not lost a tuberculosis patient in 12 years (at the time Tracy Kidder wrote Mountains Beyond Mountains ).

It is mostly about the claim of a Megalithic era discovery of axial precession, and the encoding of this knowledge in mythology. The book was severely criticized by academics upon its publication. Argument The main argument of the book may be summarized as the claim of an early (Neolithic) discovery of the precession of the equinoxes (usually attributed to Hipparchus, 2nd century BCE), and an associated very long-lived Megalithic civilization of \\"unsuspected sophistication\\" that was particularly preoccupied with astronomical observation. The knowledge of this civilization about precession, and the associated astrological ages, would have been encoded in mythology, typically in the form of a story relating to a millstone and a young protagonist‚Äîthe \\"Hamlet's Mill\\" of the book's title, a reference to the kenning Aml√≥√∞a kvern recorded in the Old Icelandic Sk√°ldskaparm√°l.

[...] The Mill is thus not only very great and ancient, but it must also be central to the original Hamlet story. It reappears in the ' Skaldskaparmal, where Snorri explains why a kenning for gold is 'Frodhi's meal'\\" The authors indeed claim that mythology is primarily to be interpreted as in terms of archaeoastronomy (\\"mythological language has exclusive reference to celestial phenomena\\"), and they mock alternative interpretations in terms of fertility or agriculture.\\"Nevertheless, the expression of this proto-scientific vision of the cosmos was not mathematical but mythological. All the gods are stars, and mythological language has exclusive reference to celestial phenomena: for example, \\"earth\\" in myth means only \\"the ideal plane laid through the ecliptic\\" (p. 58); all stories of floods \\"refer to an old astronomical image\\" (p. 57). Without bothering to refute alternative positions which hold that some, at least, of the gods and myths stemmed from concern with fertility or meteorological phenomena, the authors merely mock \\"the fertility addicts\\" (p. 308) and \\"the Fecundity-'Trust\\" (p. 381).\\" White (1970:541). The book's project is an examination of the \\"relics, fragments and allusions that have survived the steep attrition of the ages\\".Hamlet's Mill, as quoted in Leach 1970 In particular, the book reconstructs a myth of a heavenly mill which rotates around the celestial pole and grinds out the world's salt and soil, and is associated with the maelstrom. The millstone falling off its frame represents the passing of one age's pole star (symbolized by a ruler or king of some sort), and its restoration and the overthrow of the old king of authority and the empowering of the new one the establishment of a new order of the age (a new star moving into the position of pole star). The authors attempt to demonstrate the prevalence of influence of this hypothetical civilization's ideas by analysing the world's mythology (with an eye especially to all \\"mill myths\\") using Santillana and Dechend state in their introduction to Hamlet's Mill that they are well aware of modern interpretations of myth and folklore but find them shallow and lacking insight: \\"...the experts now are benighted by the current folk fantasy, which is the belief that they are beyond all this - critics without nonsense and extremely wise\\". Consequently, Santillana and Dechend prefer to rely on the work of \\"meticulous scholars such as Ideler, Lepsius, Chwolson, Boll and, to go farther back, of Athanasius Kircher and Petavius...\\" They give reasons throughout the book for preferring the work of older scholars (and the early mythologists themselves) as the proper way to interpret myth; but this viewpoint did not sit well with their modern critics schooled in the \\"current anthropology, which has built up its own idea of the primitive and what came after\\".All quotations are from the Introduction to Hamlet's Mill, first edition. Santillana had previously published, in 1961, The Origins of Scientific Thought, on which Hamlet's Mill is substantially based. Compare various statements in Hamlet's Mill to this quotation from The Origin of Scientific Thought: \\"We can see then, how so many myths, fantastic and arbitrary in semblance, of which the Greek tale of the Argonaut is a late offspring, may provide a terminology of image motifs, a kind of code which is beginning to be broken. It was meant to allow those who knew (a) to determine unequivocally the position of given planets in respect to the earth, to the firmament, and to one another; (b) to present what knowledge there was of the fabric of the world in the form of tales about 'how the world began'.\\"As quoted in pages 35-36 of Reception Hamlet's Mill was severely criticized by academic reviewers\\"The cowed reviewer is soon reduced to wondering whether mere critical prose should even be expended on something that obviously solicits the suspension of disbelief.\\" Puhvel (1970). \\"As will presently be apparent, my reaction to this book is hostile - so before my prejudices get out of hand, let me try to explain what it is all about.\\" (Leach 1970) \\"De Santillana has served us well once more by underscoring a pioneering idea, but von Dechend's implementation of that idea will prevent many scholars from recognizing its validity.\\" White (1970). on a number of grounds: tenuous arguments based on incorrect or outdated linguistic information;\\"The long- forgotten period-piece etymologies of Max M√ºller and Adalbert Kuhn (\\"surely a great scholar\\", p. 381) are blithely resurrected (for example, Sanskrit Pramantha matching Greek Prometheus, p. 139), while more up-to-date authorities are caricatured as \\"severe philologists, slaves to exact 'truth'\\" (p. 294). Puhvel (1970) lack of familiarity with modern sources;\\"..but in all other respects they choose to ignore almost completely nearly everything that has been written about their subject matter over the past forty years [...] Academic arrogance of this sort is impenetrable; in the certitude of their faith out authors are bound to dismiss all criticism as tendentious, and so, as critic, I have nothing left to say except that I do not believe a word of it.\\" Leach 1970. an over-reliance on coincidence or analogy;\\"Her only proofs are analogy, often strained. On a single page (425) she connects myths of Greece, Japan, Egypt, Iceland, the Marquesas, and the Cherokee Indians. On page 309, a rabbinical and a Pawnee tradition show \\"mistakable\\" identity. On page 320 we read \\"here ancient Greek myth suddenly emerges in full light among Indian tribes in America, miraculously preserved.\\" One might quote such passages indefinitely.\\" White (1970:541). and the general implausibility of a far-flung and influential civilization existing and not leaving behind solid evidence. At most, it has been given a grudging sort of praise. Thus, Jaan Puhvel (1970) concluded that Writing in The New York Review of Books, Edmund Leach noted: H. R. Ellis Davidson referred to Hamlet‚Äôs Mill as: In contrast the classical scholar Harald Reiche positively reviewed Hamlet's Mill.\\"Hamlet's Mill, review by: Harald A. T. Reiche\\". (1973). The Classical Journal, 69(1): 81-83. Reiche was a colleague of Santillana at MIT, and himself developed the archaeoastronomical interpretation of ancient myth in a series of lectures and publications similar to Hamlet's Mill (dealing more specifically with Greek mythology), including an interpretation of \\"the layout of Atlantis as a sort of map of the sky\\".http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/seri/JHAS./0011//0000100.000.html The Swedish astronomer Peter Nilson, while recognizing that Hamlet's Mill does not qualify as a work of science, expressed admiration for it as well as it being a source of inspiration when he wrote his own book on classic mythologies based on the night sky: Himlavalvets s√§llsamheter (1977). Barber & Barber (2006), itself a study aiming to \\"uncover seismic, geological, astrological, or other natural events\\" from mythology, appreciates the book for its pioneer work in mythography, judging that \\"Although controversial, [Santillana and von Dechend] have usefully flagged and collected Herculean amounts of relevant data.\\"Barber, Elizabeth Wayland and Barber, Paul T., When They Severed Earth from Sky: How the Human Mind Shapes Myth. 2006. Princeton University Press, . p. 185, n.3. Nevertheless, the conclusions the authors draw from their data have been \\"virtually ignored by the scientific and scholarly establishment.‚ÄùRoy G.

It was the winner of the August Derleth Award (1995)British Fantasy Award for Best Novel (August Derleth Award) and Philip K. Dick Award (2000).Past winners of the Philip K Dick Award  Plot  A small boy is left on his own in a flat. The boy answers a knocking on the front door of his high rise flat to find a man with no head standing on the doorstep. The man cannot speak, but the boy knows he is asking him for help. The boy apologises and, explaining that he cannot help him, closes the door and returns to playing games. The protagonist, Stark, a troubleshooter living in the Colour Neighbourhood, accepts a job from his friend, a high-ranking member of The Action Centre, Zenda Renn, and sets out to find senior Actioneer Fell Alkland, who appears to have gone missing under peculiar circumstances. Stark contacts another friend, a psychotic ganglord in the Red Neighbourhood named Ji, to assist him in tracking Alkland down, but something other than kidnapping is to blame for the old man's disappearance, tied into Alkland's past, into The City itself. The City The City is a sprawling mass of neighbourhoods, each one geared to the interests and tastes of its residents. Neighbourhoods in The City include: * Colour is where Stark lives along with his cat Spangle. Colour is one of the more easygoing neighbourhoods, where the only entry requirement is an appreciation of colour. The 'street colour co-ordinator computer' controls dynamic murals and streetlights which change colour to match or complement the clothes of nearby residents. Epileptics are banned from the neighbourhood as the constant shifting of colours could be dangerous to them. After 7pm residents venturing outdoors must wear the regulation black jacket, otherwise the street colour co-ordinator computer will sound the alert for an 'improperly dressed person' * Red is home to Ji and is an extremely dangerous neighbourhood. Controlled by feuding gang-lords, prostitution, gun-crime and drug culture are accepted pastimes of residents. Ji has his headquarters in a bar named BarJi, from here he plans and launches his takeover bids for other areas of the neighbourhood. Hu is generally accepted to be the most dangerous area of Red ‚Äì an attack on Hu leads Ji to discover that his brother Snedd is one of the rival gang-lords that he was trying to kill. The two of them team up and together take over more of Red. * Turn is undescribed except for the fact that is claimed to be even rougher than Red. Its full name may be \\"Turn Again\\". * The Action Centre is a yuppie office worker's paradise. It's a hive of activity designed for those who have to be doing something all the time ‚Äì every second is spent in advancement of their own interests and status is everything. Actioneers often sleep at their desks at night in order that no- one can sneak in and steal their hard earned places. The ACIA are the intelligence service of the Action Centre; its agents are identified by their violet cuff-links. The Action Centre is home to Zenda Renn and Fell Alkland. * Stable is a closed neighbourhood. The authorities zealously guard their neighbourhood against the outside world, its residents believe that they are the only survivors of a nuclear war. The windows to the outside are in fact vidscreens put in place by the authorities to perpetuate the belief that there is nothing but a radioactive wasteland beyond the city walls. * NatSci is a neighbourhood for geeks, its residents are all scientists and inventors. NatSci is a provider of technology to other neighbourhoods, including a weather control system to Stable and fast computers to the Action Centre. NatSci has a number of high tech facilities itself, including street cleaning robots which compete against each other to pick up litter. * Fnaph ‚Äì Little is known about this neighbourhood except that its residents believe that the human soul is shaped like a Frisbee and spend their time bouncing on trampolines trying to fling themselves into heaven. * Idyll is a peaceful neighbourhood where Zenda Renn grew up. * Cat neighbourhood is inhabited solely by cats. Humans come and go, some to visit their cats, others to stay briefly in the neighbourhood hotels. All of the shops are well stocked and the neighbourhood is clean and tidy -apparently kept that way by the cats. The neighbourhood is entered through a set of iron gates which refuse to let anyone other than true cat lovers in. * Eastedge is a neighbourhood on the east coast of The City, bordering the sea.

The organisation is based in Chichester and was founded by the owner of The Body Shop, Dame Anita Roddick, (DBE) in 1990 following her visit to several Romanian orphanages. It was co-founded by Rachel Bentley, who has led the organisation to this day. Prior to joining the E.U, the closing of Romania's state institutions forced many abandoned children to return to violent family homes or to live on the streets. Roddick's organisation helped to shelter them by setting up three orphanages. Once children were released from the orphanage, the organisation helped to shelter and reintegrate them into society. Children on the Edge started off in Romanian orphanages, but has since expanded to cover many other countries throughout Eastern Europe and Asia, including Bangladesh, Burma, India, Thailand, and Uganda. The charity exists to help children who are living on the edge of their societies around the world. They focus on some of the most marginalised children, who are overlooked by governments, larger organisations, the media and the international community.  History   1990 - 1999  After Anita Roddick visited Romania for the first time in 1990, The Body Shop undertook refurbishment of three orphanages as well as providing medical help and facilitating annual playschemes until 1996. At this time the organisation were entitled \\"The Body Shop Romania Relief Appeal\\". By 1999, the organisation had established the \\"Big Brothers Big Sisters\\" programme in Romania for children without parental care. They also provided mobile sanitation units in Albania for refugees from the Kosovan crisis.  2000 - 2009  The following year, they worked on rebuilding a school in Kosovo, which was destroyed during Kosovan crisis. Much of the experience in Europe contributed to the organisation being invited by UNICEF to implement a Child Friendly Space in a post conflict environment in Viqueque, East Timor. From 2002 to 2005 they continued to refurbish schools in Kosovo, established semi-independent living apartments for orphaned children in Romania and also opened two Special Needs Day care centres in Romania to help prevent these children being forced into state institutions. In 2004, Children on the Edge registered as an independent charity and, using the model they had developed in East Timor, established a Child and Community Centre in Aceh, Indonesia helping children and their community rebuild their lives after the traumas of the Asian Tsunami. Throughout 2006 and 2007 they began work on the Thailand/Burma border, helping Burmese refugees and migrants fleeing persecution from a brutal military regime within their homeland. This started out with the provision of nurseries, which were set up in Ei Htu Hta Refugee camp on the banks of the Salween river. In 2008, they began the following projects: Apartment Schools in Malaysia for Chin refugees from Myanmar; created a scholarships programme in India for Chin refugee children from Myanmar; and developed standards of care in Thai Boarding Houses for Karen refugees from Myanmar. Their first trip to Bangladesh was undertaken in 2009, which marked the beginning of their work with the unregistered Rohingya community in the makeshift Kutupalong camp, providing low profile education for their children. Concurrently they began supporting nine Learning Centres for slum dwelling children in neighbouring Cox's Bazar.  2010 - 2019  After the 2010 Haitian earthquake, they started supporting a sports and education programme children in the slums of Port au Prince, Haiti. In 2012, they established a Child Friendly Space, agricultural training programme and a voluntary Child Protection Team in Soweto Slum, Jinja, Uganda. To continue their work with children displaced by conflict, the following year Children on the Edge started providing Early Childhood Development and support for children displaced by war and living in the remote IDP camps of Kachin State, Myanmar. In 2014, they began supporting an education programme for ‚Äòuntouchable‚Äô Dalit children in Bihar State, India. At this time they also began to provide support for children in brothel communities on the India/Nepal border. Again working with refugee children, 2014 was also the year they started investing in tent schools for Syrian children living in the informal settlements of Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. Work in Uganda had been progressing over the last two years and in 2015 \\"Children on the Edge Africa\\" was registered in Uganda. The new Ugandan team was expanding the work of Child Protection Team in Soweto to further slum areas surrounding Jinja In 2017, the Rohingya genocide triggered over 700,000 more Rohingya refugees to flee to Bangladesh, into the areas on the border where the charity was providing education. They responded with a brief humanitarian relief programme and expanded education work in the camps for 7,500 children. The following year, they also established ten Learning Centres for Rohingya refugee children in the Doharazi Enclaves, Bangladesh. Using a model built up in the Jinja slum areas, and experience developed in Kachin State, Myanmar, in 2019 they began to replicate their Early Childhood Development work by supporting Congolese refugee communities in Kyaka II, Uganda to provide high quality early years education for their children.

It is the first book in the Larklight Trilogy. Larklight is a space opera set in an alternative Victorian era, in which mankind has been exploring the solar system for at least a century, and wherein most of the planets are inhabitable. Protagonist Art Mumby narrates an attack on the British Empire and the solar system at large by an ancient, arachnid-like extraterrestrial race, against which he and his family play a central role, aided by the pirate Jack Havock and his crew. Plot summary The story begins at Larklight, a house that orbits Earth's moon, where the Mumbys receive a visitor from the Royal Xenological Society, a Mr. Webster, who is revealed to be an extraterrestrial resembling an enormous white spider. Art and his sister Myrtle escape; but their father is captured and held prisoner. Art and Myrtle leave in an escape pod and crash-land on the Moon, where they are encased with predatory larvae of the Potter Moth and freed by pirate Jack Havock and his crew. Art is shocked to find that Jack is only fifteen years old, and that he is the only human in his crew, while Myrtle is distressed at being in the company of a pirate and demands that Jack take them to the moon's British residence, Fort George. En route aboard the pirates' ship Sophronia, a ship of the British Navy comes alongside and orders Jack to surrender or have his ship destroyed. Jack distracts the officers by pretending to hold Art and Myrtle hostage, giving Ssillissa, the ship's alchemist, time to activate the ship's engines and fly the Sophronia to safety. They conceal themselves on Venus, Jack Havock's old home, where Jack tells Art and Myrtle that the colonists there, including his parents and brother, were changed into trees by a sudden pollination. The white spiders take Myrtle to the Martian home of industrialist Sir Waverly Rain, whose factories cover Phobos and Deimos. She escapes with a Martian maid named Ulla and her husband, Richard, with whom she learns that Sir Waverly Rain had been captured by the spiders and replaced with a spider-controlled automaton; believing the spiders might manufacture something much more sinister, they race to London. Jack and Art visit Jupiter's moon Io, descending into Jupiter's atmosphere to ask aid of the Thunderhead, who tells them to protect the key to Larklight. Not knowing what this is, they attempt to leave Jupiter, but are abandoned by their ferryman and escape to a broken-down harpoon ship attached to a native organism. They are rescued by the Sophronia's crew. Jack discovers that Myrtle's locket (now in Art's possession) is the key to Larklight, in that it can activate a set of complex engines capable of transforming the solar system, and leads his crew to the spiders' home on the Rings of Saturn to exchange it for Myrtle's safe return. Upon arriving at the spiders' home, most of the crew are captured. Art is later taken before Professor Phineas Ptarmigan, formerly of the Royal Xenological Institute where Jack was imprisoned until he was twelve, who reveals that he wishes to use Larklight to destroy the Solar System, leaving the remains to the spiders whose ancestors had colonized the planetesimals. Meanwhile, Ssillissa and her crewmate Yarg free the captured crew and two additional prisoners, Sir Waverly and Art's mother Emily. Having freed Larklight from the spiders, the protagonists visit Earth, where a gigantic mechanical spider is attacking London. There, Myrtle takes control of the machine and uses it to kill Mr. Webster, and later re-unites with her family and Jack. The epilogue reveals that the race of white spiders has not been exterminated, but subdued, and that Ptarmigan has been placed in an insane asylum. The Mumby family return to live at Larklight, which they deprive of its otherworldly machinery. Film adaptation Warner Bros. bought the rights to Larklight in 2006. In April 2008, Shekhar Kapur announced that he was to direct, and that he and Steven Knight had been working on the screenplay for three months. He said that it would have a budget of $200 million and would be his most expensive movie. Alison Greenspan and Di Novi were to produce. The film was to be released on 1 January 2010, but after the death of the director Anthony Minghella in 2008, Kapur took over his unfinished movie New York, I Love You, and postponed Larklight.

Its name means \\"inequality\\". It is also spelled hutosiki (using Kunrei-shiki romanization). Futoshiki was developed by Tamaki Seto in 2001. An example of a 5√ó5 Futoshiki puzzle ... ... and its solution The puzzle is played on a square grid. The objective is to place the numbers such that each row and column contains only one of each digit. Some digits may be given at the start. Inequality constraints are initially specified between some of the squares, such that one must be higher or lower than its neighbor. These constraints must be honored in order to complete the puzzle.  Solving the puzzle  Solving the puzzle requires a combination of logical techniques. Numbers in each row and column restrict the number of possible values for each position, as do the inequalities. Once the table of possibilities has been determined, a crucial tactic to solve the puzzle involves \\"AB elimination\\", in which subsets are identified within a row whose range of values can be determined. For example, if the first two squares within a row must contain 1 or 2, then these numbers can be excluded from the remaining squares. Similarly, if the first three squares must contain 1 or 2; 1 or 3; and 1 or 2 or 3, then those remaining must contain other values (4 and 5 in a 5√ó5 puzzle). Another important technique is to work through the range of possibilities in open inequalities. A value on one side of an inequality determines others, which then can be worked through the puzzle until a contradiction is reached and the first value is excluded. 200px The first step to solve the puzzle is to enumerate possible values based on inequalities and non-duplication within rows and columns. Then AB elimination may be usable to narrow down the range of possibilities. As shown here, the top and bottom positions in the center column must contain 5 and 3, so these can be excluded from the second and fourth positions. 200px Logical deduction within the inequalities can restrict the range of possibilities. As shown here, a 2 in the upper left corner requires a 1 in the second position due to the first inequality; but a 1 in the second position allows only a 3 in the fifth position. This continues until we conclude that two 4s would need to be placed in the same column. Likewise, a 3 in the upper left corner would require the top row to be 3 2 5 4 1 and the bottom again to be 1 2 3 4 5, which would lead to the same contradiction. Only a 5 is permissible in the top left corner, from which we deduce 5 4 3 2 1 at top and 1 2 5 4 3 at bottom. The remainder of the solution is simple elimination. A solved futoshiki puzzle is a Latin square. As with sudoku case, more difficult futoshiki puzzles require the use of various types of chain patterns.

Following two unsuccessful bids for the County of Flanders, William became King Stephen of England's chief lieutenant during the civil war of 1139-54 known as the Anarchy. He held Kent, though not the title of earl, until the early years of King Henry II's reign, when he returned to Flanders.  Struggle for Flanders  William was an illegitimate son of Philip of Loo, who was the son of the Flemish count Robert the Frisian and younger brother of Robert II.Richard Eales, of Ypres, styled count of Flanders (d. 1164/5)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography William's mother was a wool carder, which further diminished his status; King Louis VI of France pointed out that she never rose from that station. The exact date of his birth is unknown, and although 1090 is the commonly used date of his birth, several other dates later in the same decade are also plausible.Richard Eales, of Ypres, styled count of Flanders (d. 1164/5)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography His brother, Theobald Sorel, was likely born of another relationship of hers. His maternal origin did not prevent him from having a large influence in Flanders. A succession crisis ensued in the County of Flanders in 1119 upon the sudden death of the childless Count Baldwin VII, William's cousin. Though illegitimate, William remained the last male-line descendant of Count Robert the Frisian. His claim to the countship was supported by Baldwin's powerful mother, Clementia of Burgundy,and stepfather, Godfrey I of Louvain,Richard Eales, of Ypres, styled count of Flanders (d. 1164/5)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography but Flanders nevertheless passed to the Danish prince Charles the Good, son of Robert I's daughter Adela.Richard Eales, of Ypres, styled count of Flanders (d. 1164/5)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography The chronicle of Galbert of Bruges attributes his failure to his illegitimate birth. It is possibly the case that, rather than being an active participant, William was simply a figurehead manipulated by his more powerful relatives; giving weight to this argument is the fact that not only did he survive the succession crisis, but he was also granted the same positions as his father, i.e. the effective ruler of Ypres and the surrounding localities.Richard Eales, of Ypres, styled count of Flanders (d. 1164/5)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Charles was assassinated on 2 March 1127 by the Erembald Clan, who then offered the countship to William, but he did not wish to be associated with them and he severed all ties with the murderers, going so far as to execute one of their members on 20 March.Richard Eales, of Ypres, styled count of Flanders (d. 1164/5)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Louis VII, as feudal overlord, rejected William's claim using his mother's status as an excuse, but this time William responded with force. He used funds allegedly given to him by King Henry I of England to hire 300 mounted warriors, with whom he occupied Ypres and forced its merchants to accept him as count. Henry was eager to prevent Flanders from passing to his nephew William Clito, another contender and second cousin of William of Ypres, as William Clito also laid claim to Henry's Duchy of Normandy. The war united him with another nephew of Henry and likewise a second cousin, Stephen of Blois. Ypres was besieged a month later on the 26 April by William Clito and Louis VI. After bitter fighting, the gates of Ypres were opened by the citizens, and William of Ypres was imprisoned along with his brother on 10 September.Richard Eales, of Ypres, styled count of Flanders (d. 1164/5)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National BiographyAt Bruges there was an inquest into the death of Charles the Good. It is unclear how seriously William's involvement was considered, but in the end he escaped implication and was released in March 1128 having given an oath of loyalty to Clito. However, by this stage Clito had alienated most of his allies and faced a new opponent, Thierry of Alsace, who was the son of Gertrude, the daughter of Robert the Frisian. Clito was killed in July 1128 at the siege of Aalst, leading to Thierry being confirmed as count. William made one final attempt to take the county in 1130, though the events are veiled in obscurity. He was unable to prevail against Thierry and unlike his predecessors, Thierry was less than forgiving, banishing William from Flanders sometime between 1133 and 1135.Richard Eales, of Ypres, styled count of Flanders (d. 1164/5)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.  The Anarchy  Having failed to established himself as Count of Flanders, William went from his wife's lands in Sluis to Stephen's County of Boulogne. Stephen's accession to the English throne following Henry I's death in 1135 finally changed William's fortunes for the better. He commanded Stephen's troops against the forces of their cousin, Henry's daughter Empress Matilda, who claimed the throne. Many of the soldiers were William's fellow Flemings, including his brother. Stephen's campaign in Normandy failed because the local noblemen refused to co-operate with William and other Flemings. William was much more active in England, where he took part in the Battle of Lincoln (1141), during which Stephen was captured by the Empress's forces. William led his contingent away when it became clear that the battle was lost, for which he was reprimanded by the author of Gesta Stephani and excused by Henry of Huntingdon. At this moment most of Stephen's supporters either declared for the Empress or attempted to stay neutral. William, however, determinedly supported Stephen's wife, Matilda I of Boulogne, who took over during the King's imprisonment, and he assumed command over all of Stephen's forces. William distinguished himself during the Rout of Winchester and two subsequent battles which led to Stephen's release. He was involved in some of the most dishonorable events of the Anarchy, such as the plundering of Abingdon Abbey, burning of Wherwell Abbey and Andover, and threatening to burn St Albans. Stephen rewarded William with the County of Kent and its revenues at Christmas 1141. Though no proof exists of his creation as Earl of Kent by King Stephen, chroniclers describe him as \\"possessing the county\\" and \\"having Kent in his custody\\". He exercised the same powers over this county as other earls over theirs, though he never adopted the comital style. William lost his sight in the late 1140s, which ended his military career and may have contributed to Stephen's compulsion to designate Empress Matilda's son Henry Plantagenet as his heir. William founded the Cistercian house of Boxley 1146 and endowed monasteries in Flanders.  Last years  Despite his fierce loyalty to King Stephen, William was very unpopular, primarily for being a foreigner, but also due to plundering and extortion (common among English magnates). Upon Stephen's death in 1154, the crown passed to Henry Plantagenet, who found it a military and political necessity to banish Flemings and other foreigners. William initially held onto Kent but, being old and blind, could not be of use to the new monarch. He left England in 1157 and returned to Lo in Flanders, living quietly and piously. He died there on 24 January 1165.

He was born in Darjeeling, British India. Early life The son of a judge in the Indian Civil Service, Cornes was educated at Clifton College\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. ref no 9237: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 and won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he read History. He stayed at Oxford for an extra year, studying one of the languages of Nigeria and learning how to work in the colonies. He left Oxford in 1932, when he competed in the Olympics at Los Angeles. Career After the 1932 Olympic Games, Cornes was posted to Nigeria as a civil servant. He stayed there for five years, during which time he was given leave to attend the 1936 Games in Berlin. He only decided to go for the '36 Olympics a year before, so he did no intensive training in between, but during that time he raced a local Nigerian around the walls of Katsima and lost. In 1937, Cornes returned from Nigeria and on 12 June he married Rachael Addis in Frant, Sussex. Their marriage was extremely happy. In 1997, they celebrated their diamond wedding anniversary. Also in 1937, he went to work for the civil service in Palestine, as assistant district officer of Ramallah, in Judea. He also worked in Hebron and Safad. His three elder sons, Nick, Colin and John were born in Palestine. He was working at the King David Hotel at the time of the King David Hotel bombing. He was curious when he heard a small explosive blast in the street outside the hotel, which had been set off by terrorists to keep passers-by away from the area. He went outside to investigate, and while he was outside a bomb inside the hotel was detonated, killing everyone on his floor. Cornes left Palestine in 1947. Returning home, he worked for the Colonial Office and taught colonial service students at Oxford until 1953. His youngest son, Andrew, was born during this period. In 1953, he came into an inheritance and bought West Downs School, Winchester, where he taught History, Religious Studies and Latin, as well as being headmaster. He retired in 1988 and the school was closed down. Athlete Cornes first became interested in running at Clifton, where he won the seven mile cross-country 'Long Pen Pole' race, as his father had done twice before him. When the Achilles Club from Oxford and Cambridge came for a match against Clifton, he beat, on handicap, Douglas Lowe, who was an Olympic champion. At Oxford, he won the Freshman cross-country race. He competed for Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the 1932 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, in the 1500 metres where he won the Silver medal. His time was 3 minutes 52 seconds. He then competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, gaining sixth place in the 1500 metres event but running his personal best time of 3 minutes 51.4 seconds. The race was exceptional because the first two runners broke World Records and the first five, Olympic Records. At the 1930 Empire Games he won the bronze medal in the 1 mile event. Four years later at the 1934 Empire Games he won again the bronze medal in the 1 mile competition.

History  Porchetto emerged from the Acoustic movement of Argentine rock during the early 1970s releasing his debut record in 1972, following the subgenre's popular rise in the wake of the \\"Acusticazo\\" festivalBio on cmtv.com.ar. By the mid 70s he would become a member of one of the first, and ephemeral supergroup of Argentine rock, PorSuiGieco, with Le√≥n Gieco, Charly Garc√≠a, and Nito Mestre. For the remainder of the 1970s Porchetto released an average of one LP a year. In 1980 his sixth album Metegol featured a very innovative type of uptown-suave sounding rock, yet remaining accessible and unpretentious when listened to. Metegol sent Porchetto's career to the top of Argentine rock. The album even beat out Ser√∫ Gir√°n's third release Bicicleta, in a yearly rock survey by newspaper Clar√≠n and when that group was the most popular act in Argentine rock. In a similar style Porchetto released Televisi√≥n in 1981. Mirroring the early 80s trend towards the much more light and direct rock music of the New Democracy Sound, Ra√∫l Porchetto came out with his next two album releases. 1983's Reina Madre became one of the best selling rock albums until that time. He became the best attended solo act in concerts during the first half of the 80s. His most recognized hit is 1986's \\"Bailando en las veredas.Raul Porchetto www.rock.com.ar But Porchetto grew tired of the Rock Star rat race. That along with his eagerness to pursue more experimental and ambitious music led his later releases following Reina Madre to be departures from his earlier sound, and more inaccessible to casual fans (one of his late 80s albums even include actual choruses singing evangelical themes). Thus they did not sell nearly as well, and by the late 1980s Porchetto had cut ties with major record labels and went indie. He has continued to record and release albums until the present day; his latest studio releases is Dragones y planetas (2010), and Sombras en el cielo (2018). During his career Ra√∫l Porchetto earned 10 gold, two platinum and one double platinum records, becoming one of the best-selling rock artists of all time in Argentina.

However, as their political views clashed and caused animosity (Pierce was a vociferous and deeply opinionated Free-Soiler), Pierce left after only a year of politically tinged employment to take up newspaper work in the Midwest. At the request of Sydney Williams, brother-in-law of Baker and managing director of the chocolate mill, Pierce returned to Boston after a year and was appointed manager of the Walter Baker Counting House at 32 South Market Street in Boston (now a part of the Quincy Market retail area). After the deaths of both Walter Baker (in 1852) and Sydney Williams (in 1854), Pierce was permitted to lease the chocolate business from the trustees of the Baker Estate. The trustees of the Baker Estate, aware that Pierce had only been with the company for five years, leased the business to him for a two-year probationary period, \\"subject to a life interest payable annually to Mrs. Baker,\\" widow of the owner and step-aunt to Pierce, until her death in 1891. He began manufacturing under the name and style of Walter Baker & Company. In 1856 the trustees extended the lease a further eight years, during which time Pierce began an expansion that would eventually absorb his competitors in the Lower Mills. The trustees continued the ten-year lease until 1884, when \\"all terms under the Walter Baker will having been satisfied, the entire property is conveyed by the Trustees to Henry L. Pierce.\\" In 1860, Pierce bought the Preston Chocolate Mill from Henry Chapin, to whom it had been sold the previous year, and in 1881, Josiah Webb sold his chocolate mill to Pierce. In 1864, the trustees of the Baker Estate renewed the lease for a second decade. This decade was decisive for Pierce, as he began to enter his chocolate in competitive exhibitions both in this country and abroad. In 1867, Baker's Chocolate and Cocoa won an award in the Paris Exposition for the quality of the product. In 1873, the company won the highest awards at the Vienna Exposition, and in 1876, at the Philadelphia Centennial, Walter Baker chocolate and cocoa won the highest awards. With mill managers and mill employees, Pierce was able to expand the chocolate business and build new mills. In 1894, these were equipped with chocolate-making machines, most of which were imported from Germany, that saved power and were easy to attend. Politics Pierce followed in his father's footsteps and was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1860 to 1862, and again in 1866. After Dorchester was annexed to the city of Boston on January 4, 1870, Pierce became a member of the Boston Board of Aldermen and was nominated and elected Mayor of Boston for 1873. Pierce was elected as a Republican to the Forty- third Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of William Whiting. He was reelected to the Forty-fourth Congress and overall served from December 1, 1873, to March 3, 1877. He declined to be a candidate for renomination, but was again Mayor of Boston in 1878. It was during his terms as mayor that Pierce's business began an extensive marketing and public relations campaign to make Walter Baker & Company a household name or, better, the household choice for chocolate and cocoa. In 1883, the company formally adopted the trademark La Belle Chocolatiere as its logo. Used earlier in the company's history, this famous design was copied from the pastel portrait of Das Schokoladenm√§dchen by Jean-√âtienne Liotard, an 18th-century Swiss painter. The chocolate girl was to become as famous as the company she promoted. It was not until 1884 that the trustees of the Baker Estate allowed Pierce to purchase the company outright. Once done, it was incorporated as Walter Baker & Company, Ltd. Pierce was honored by the City of Boston when the school committee voted in 1892 to name the new grammar school just south of Codman Square in his honor. The school was designed by Boston city architect Harrison Henry Atwood (1863‚Äì1954) and was an enormous hammered granite building at the corner of Washington Street and Welles Avenue (now the site of the Codman Square Branch of the Boston Public Library). It was considered one of the most advanced schools in the Boston public school system, and after the Great Depression, its focus became that of a \\"Baking School,\\" which offered trade classes. Ownership of Walter Baker & Company During Pierce's ownership of Baker Chocolate Company, from 1854 to 1896, he was to increase business greatly, so much so that he created an urban mill village with modern chocolate mills along the Neponset River. His budget for advertising and marketing was tremendous, but none was more important than the adoption of La Belle Chocolatiere as his trademark. He employed women to dress as the trademark come to life in silk gowns, with crisply starched white lawn aprons, caps and cuffs. They would act as demonstrators at exhibitions and fairs, where they offered samples of Baker's Chocolate to those in attendance. These demonstrators, with comely faces and ready smiles, were an important and appropriate way to advertise his product. An article in the New York Times on October 21, 1892, reports that these demonstrators were at an exhibition at the Madison Square Garden in New York City, where it was said that the \\"taste of the chocolate is its own sufficient advertisement, but the combination of chocolate and girl is particularly effective.\\" The article went on to say that at this food show, \\"one of the most noticeable exhibits of this sort is made by Walter Baker & Co., who occupy a conspicuous place just opposite the main entrance to the amphitheatre. Under a silken canopy, disposed as was the canopy at old Ashby, wherein Lady Rowena watched the conquering arms of the young King Ivanhoe, a cluster of pleasing damsels dispenses the soothing 'tap' of Baker. All are dressed in the costume of 'La Belle Chocolatiere' of Liotard's painting in the Dresden Gallery, made familiar to everybody as the trademark of this old established firm. The soft draperies of the canopy are a pleasing frame for the quaint costumes and brilliant complexions of the chocolate girls, and even rival exhibitors praise the taste shown by the firm in displaying its wares so attractively.\\" These comely demonstrators, who elicited the praise of even the rival exhibitors at an exhibition, were only one aspect of Henry Lillie Pierce's astute ability to attract attention to his products. In her book Crowding Memories, Mrs. Thomas Bailey Aldrich, widow of the former editor of the Atlantic Monthly, wrote of Pierce as a close friend to her and her husband. She said that for \\"nearly twenty-five years‚Ä¶[he had] been one of the most loved of guests at our fireside.\\" Pierce's \\"deep and unaffected friendship\\" for the Aldriches was sincere, and they, like many others, benefited from his estate, inheriting his farm at Ponkapoag in Canton, Massachusetts. Mrs. Aldrich summed up his character, saying that he was in all ways a strong man. \\"Strong in will even to obstinacy, strong in his sense of honor, strong in his love for his friends, strong in his sympathies, strong in his patriotism, strong in his likes and dislikes. To those who knew him best there was a certain charming simplicity in his character because it was the clear and direct product of his nature, unhelped by outside influences.\\" Death Pierce died in Boston on December 17, 1896. His interment was in Dorchester South Burying Ground on Dorchester Avenue in Dorchester Lower Mills. Upon his death, Henry Lillie Pierce remembered each of his employees with a gift of $100. His public bequests included one to Harvard that, at the time, was the largest such gift the college had ever received. Pierce also left equal sums to the Museum of Fine Arts, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Homeopathic Hospital, and it was said that \\"not in a long time has there been known such generous remembrances of public institutions and charities as in the provisions of his will.\\" In 1896, the City of Boston named the intersection of Dorchester Avenue and Washington and Adams Streets in Dorchester Lower Mills \\"Pierce Square\\" in memory of Henry Lillie Pierce. Today, few residents of the area know that this is the official name of the Lower Mills intersection, nor are they familiar with the myriad accomplishments of the man for whom it was named.

It continues the adventures of protagonist Locke Lamora and his friend Jean Tannen as they arrive on the exotic shores of Tal Verrar, where they must face the dangers of their past, as well as new rivals that wish to stop them at all costs while they try to pull their most ambitious con yet. Plot summary Two years after Locke Lamora and Jean Tannen fled Camorr, they have created new secret identities for themselves in the island city of Tal Verrar as professional gamblers at an opulent casino called the Sinspire. The establishment, run by a man named Requin and his disfigured lover Selendri, has a policy that anyone caught cheating at the games is to be killed no matter how high-born they may be. Locke and Jean have been constantly cheating at the games despite this, primarily by manipulating the subtle weaknesses of their gambling opponents, and have gone through many procedures across Tal Verrar and nearby regions to find a way to break into Requin's heavily fortified vault. But they begin to fear for the success of their scheme when the Bondsmagi of Karthain, speaking through the possessed bodies of night market vendors, threaten revenge against the duo for torturing and mutilating the Falconer. Having such power means that the Bondsmagi could kill the two, by simply possessing them and making them kill each other. However, throughout the book the Bondsmagi refrain from such direct action, contenting themselves with acting subtly and indirectly against the two. Locke decides to enact the next phase of their plan by revealing to Selendri that they have been cheating. When brought to Requin and ordered to explain both their actions and his seemingly suicidal confession, Locke claims that they are working for some unknown party who is paying them through proxies to rob his vault. He claims to have confessed to the cheating because he is tired of this secondhand connection to their employer, wishing to instead work at the Sinspire. Requin and Selendri grudgingly decide to spare the duo's lives for the time being. Soon after Requin's interrogation, Locke and Jean are captured by the Eyes of the Archon, elite soldiers who work directly for the leader of Tal Verrar - who are under the command of a highly capable woman named Merrain Merrai - and brought to the Mon Magisteria, the capital building of the city. There, they meet the archon Maxilan Stragos, who tricks them into drinking a poison which kills a person in two months if periodic antidotes are not taken. Stragos had received dispatches from contacts among the Bondsmagi about their true identities, their activities in Camorr, and the Bondsmagi's satisfaction with letting Stragos use them as he pleased. The archon decides to exploit Locke and Jean's impersonation skills by having them learn to pretend to be competent sailors. He then wants them to command a ship, sail across the Sea of Brass to the Ghostwind Islands in the far south, gain the support of pirates in that region, and then return to Tal Verrar's waters to pillage ships. Stragos hopes that the supposed pirate threat will make the Verrari people desperate for a strengthened navy, which the archon, the commander-in- chief of Tal Verrar's military, would provide. This would also give the archonate far more power relative to the Priori, the governmental council which co-rules the city with the archon but desires to avoid war to preserve their economic interests. Stragos gave Locke and Jean the poison, the antidote to which only his personal alchemist can concoct, because the two-month window gives them just enough time to get to the Ghostwinds and back with pirate allies; Stragos promises to give the duo a permanent antidote once their assignment is thoroughly completed. Upon talking to Requin again, Locke is able to fit Stragos into his story as the supposed true identity of the mysterious employer he discussed earlier. A short interlude given from the archon's point of view lets the reader know that - unlike what she had led Locke and Jean believe - Merrain does not work for the archon, but has been sent by her unnamed \\"masters\\" to temporarily work with him. In the conversation Merrain also casually mentions that, should the archon's plans succeed, they would result in \\"more bloodshed than was seen in two hundred years\\" - an outcome which Merrain evidently considers acceptable or even desirable. As Locke and Jean go through heavy cramming on naval matters with sailing master Caldris bal Comar, they suddenly become the target of several assassination attempts by some unknown party unconnected to either Requin or Stragos. Nonetheless, after a month of training they are given charge of a ship called the Red Messenger and ordered to free imprisoned sailors in the Windward Rock dungeon to comprise their crew. The archon also orders them to keep the sailors from killing the incapacitated guards; Locke and Jean comply. However, after the crew's escape Merrain covertly kills the guards - acting on behalf of her true bosses, and clearly without the archon's knowledge. This act would discredit Locke and Jean in the archon's eyes and later on would come close to getting them killed by him. During the voyage south, Locke and Jean play the parts of captain and first mate while Caldris gives them discreet guidance on commanding the ship. The strain of covering for the duo while also tending to all the ship's affairs leads to the elderly Caldris having a fatal heart attack right before a major storm; without Caldris‚Äô help, Locke's incompetence results in several dead crewmen and damage to the ship's mast. The surviving Messengers, now aware that Locke and Jean are not real sailors, mutiny and put the two out to sea in a small boat. Hours after the mutiny, the Red Messenger and the duo's boat are captured by a pirate ship called the Poison Orchid captained by Zamira Drakasha. Locke, Jean, and the captured Messengers are put on the Poison Orchid‚Äôs ‚Äúscrub watch,‚Äù a group of captured men who do lowly labor. Locke is interrogated by Zamira about the reason he commandeered a ship despite his clear inexperience, while Jean and the ship's first mate, Ezri Delmastro, fall in love. Under Zamira's rules, the scrub watch have the opportunity to become full Orchids by participating in a raid on another ship. Locke and Jean volunteer to be the first to board the next ship in order to regain the trust they lost with the Messengers. The duo's bravery becomes an object of admiration among the crew when the ship they raid turns out be defended by vicious Jeremite Redeemers. Jean contends with Locke that the pirates, as fellow thieves, deserve their full frankness instead of Locke's plan to lead them to their doom against Tal Verrar. Following the Messengers‚Äô induction into the Poison Orchid‚Äôs crew, Locke takes Jean's advice, telling Zamira the truth about how Stragos has been using him and begging her to help him find a way to subvert the archon's scheme. In Port Prodigal, the sole remaining town in the Ghostwinds, Zamira relays Locke's request to a council of pirate captains. Although the council votes to let her go against Stragos, they secretly fear that the archon will attack them in retaliation and decide to later send Jaffrim Rodanov to keep Zamira from dragging the rest of them into any potential conflict. Locke and Jean return to Tal Verrar with the Poison Orchid and reestablish contact with Stragos, to whom they promise to begin attacking ships, and Requin, who they fool into thinking they will immediately return to the Ghostwinds. They and the Orchids deliberately aggravate the archon by only partly adhering to his orders, staging a half-hearted raid on a small merchant vessel but mounting a massive assault on a town to the northwest where peasants let themselves be put through cruel and humiliating games by nobles for money. Locke and Jean hope to get close enough to the archon's alchemist during one of their subsequent meetings to somehow take the antidote, but Stragos eventually refuses to see them again unless they have mounted a proper raid on a ship. Rodanov's ship intercepts Zamira and attacks the Poison Orchid. As the battle turns into a stalemate, one of the Orchids who had actually been working for Rodanov brings up an alchemical sphere capable of quickly burning through the ship's hull and threatens to ignite it unless Zamira surrenders. He accidentally lights it prematurely when one of the Orchids shoots him with an arrow, but Ezri sacrifices her life to throw the burning sphere onto the enemy ship instead, killing the rest of Rodanov's crew. Locke and a grieving Jean decide to take down Stragos that same night while also completing the Sinspire job. Deciding to involve the Priori against the archon, Locke and Jean sneak into the house of Marius Cordo and his son Lyonis, both members of the Priori who frequent the Sinspire. Marius turns out to be the one who hired the mysterious assassins to kill the two thieves based on false information from the Bondsmagi that Locke and Jean were threats to the Priori. Deciding to let the assassination matter drop, Locke enlists their aid against Stragos. Locke and Jean then convince the Eyes to arrest them publicly outside the Sinspire to help them complete their heist scheme. At the Sinspire, Locke and Jean tell Requin in his office that the archon knows about their plan to defect. When an angry Requin goes down to handle the situation, Locke and Jean overpower Selendri and the guards while revealing that the steps they took to break into the vault were a ruse to distract from their real plan: to steal the valuable Therin Throne era paintings in Requin's office. Locke and Jean sneak back down to the ground floor with the paintings and let themselves be arrested by the Eyes; on the way back to the Mon Magisteria, Lyonis and his men kill the Eyes and take their uniforms as disguises. At the Mon Magisteria, Stragos, with Merrain and the alchemist present, tells Locke and Jean of his intent to have them executed for the murdered guards at Windward Rock. The disguised Lyonis and his men knock down the archon and take control of the castle. The captured alchemist reveals that he currently only has one vial of the antidote prepared, but when Locke and Jean plan to take him with them to make more, Merrain kills him with a poisoned dagger and tries unsuccessfully to kill Locke, Jean, and Stragos before running off. Locke and Jean give Stragos to Zamira and her crew to imprison and torment as they desire before leaving for Vel Virazzo. Requin and Selendri subsequently strike a deal with the Priori to help shape the new order in Tal Verrar. Requin then reveals to Selendri that the stolen paintings were actually recent replicas of the real Therin Throne works hidden in his vault. Locke and Jean find this out themselves from the Vel Virazzo art dealer buying the paintings, who gives them a small fraction of the original price he would have paid for the genuine articles. As the duo sullenly eat a meal on a rented ship, Jean insists that Locke drink the antidote, only for Locke to admit that he had already snuck the antidote into Jean's drink. Locke then tells Jean that he wants them to sail the Sea of Brass to ‚Äúsomewhere new‚Äù during the last few weeks Locke has to live. The book thus ends with a huge cliffhanger, Locke apparently doomed to die soon - which is left to be resolved in the series' next volume. Also left open is the question of who Merrain was truly working for. References External links *Red Seas Under Red Skies Excerpts: Chapter 12 in Scott Lynch's LiveJournal.

He is known as the author of The Hidden Ireland, a 1924 study of the poetry of eighteenth-century Irish-language poets in Munster. Academic career Corkery was born in the city of Cork and educated at Presentation Brothers College before training as a teacher at St Patrick's College, Dublin. He taught at Saint Patrick‚Äôs School in Cork, but resigned from there in 1921 when he was refused the headmastership. Among his students there were writer Frank O'Connor and sculptor Seamus Murphy. After leaving St. Patrick's, Corkery taught art for the local technical education committee, before becoming inspector of Irish in 1925 and Professor of English at University College Cork in 1930. Among his students in UCC were Se√°n √ì Faol√°in and Se√°n √ì Tuama. Corkery was often a controversial figure in academia for his 'nativist' views on Irish literature. His views sometimes resulted in conflict with scholars of the Irish language, including P√°draig de Br√∫n and de Br√∫n's niece M√°ire Mhac an tSaoi. √ì Tuama, however, was a frequent defender of Corkery's reputation. In his late twenties, he learnt Irish and this brought him into contact with members of the Irish language revival movement, including Terence MacSwiney, T. C. Murray and Con O'Leary, with whom he founded the Cork Dramatic Society in 1908. His plays Embers and The Hermit and the King were performed by the society. Later plays were staged at the Abbey Theatre, including The Labour Leader (1919) and The Yellow Bittern (1920). He also wrote short stories, including the collections A Munster Twilight (1916), The Hounds of Banba (1920), The Stormy Hills (1929), and Earth Out of Earth (1939), and a novel, The Threshold of Quiet (1917). His non-fiction included The Hidden Ireland (1924), an influential work about the riches of eighteenth- century Irish poetry. In this he attempted to reconstruct a worldview preserved by Gaelic poets amongst the poor and oppressed Catholic peasantry of the Penal Laws era, virtually invisible in the Anglo-Irish tradition that had dominated the writing of Irish history. \\"An instant, influential classic\\", wrote Patrick Walsh, \\"its version of the past provided powerful cultural underpinning to the traditional nationalist history that became, in the 1930s, the educational orthodoxy of the new state\\". Corkery's papers are held in the Boole Library of University College Cork. Political career He was a member of Seanad √âireann for Fianna F√°il from 1951 to 1954 when he was nominated by the Taoiseach. General Every year, in the third week of July, the Daniel Corkery Summer School is held in the village of Inchigeelagh, County Cork.

It was released on Virgin Records in May 1995 as their first album on the label and their follow-up to 360¬∞ (1993). The record mixes the group's distinctive blend of dub music, electronic instrumentation and sampling with a wider array of styles, such as Celtic music, Indian music and poetry, a result of the group conceiving the album as a representation and celebration of modern multicultural Britain. They were inspired by the films of Michael Powell and the Festival of Britain era. Upon release, the album reached number 37 on the UK Albums Chart, and is the band's most successful release to date. Four of its singles reached the UK Singles Chart, including lead single \\"Zion Youth\\" and Top 20 hit \\"Little Britain\\". The supporting tour featured guest vocalist Earl Sixteen, who appears on the album, and attracted a following of crusties. The album received critical acclaim, and journalists highlighted the record's disparate influences. Six of the album's tracks appeared in the 1995 Festive Fifty, and the poll's organiser John Peel named Second Light his 12th favourite album ever in 1997. A deluxe edition of Second Light, including a bonus disc of extra material, was released by EMI in March 2012. Production Dreadzone emerged in 1993, composed of former Big Audio Dynamite and Screaming Target members Greg Roberts and Leo Williams, alongside remixer and producer Tim Bran. That same year, Creation Records released the band's debut album 360¬∞, which showcased the group's distinctive dub style that incorporated heavy elements of electronica such as sampling. The group's usage of sampling was passed down from Roberts and Williams' time in Big Audio Dynamite, where they pioneered weaving samples into music in a textural fashion. In this period, Dreadzone proved to be one in a number of acts, alongside acts like Tricky, Orbital, Stereo MC's and The Orb, that bridged the audiences for rock and dance music by playing both the dance tent and NME rock tent at Glastonbury Festival. Dreadzone recorded Second Light at their own Dubby Road Studios in West London, producing the record themselves. It was the second and final album by the group to be largely written by Roberts, as later albums featured more collaborative writing. Guest vocals throughout the album were contributed by Earl Sixteen and Donna McKevitt. In 1994, after the album was recorded, Dreadzone were signed to Virgin Records by A&R; executive Paul Kinder. The group presented Second Light to the label as a finished project. Brand explained: \\"We delivered the album with our own funds, so it wasn't like the A&R; man came down and said, 'The high-hat's too loud'.\\" Due to the backing of Virgin ‚Äì a major label ‚Äì the band did not face trouble when clearing samples, as the label's infrastructure helped \\"clear it up for us and our publishers\\", according to Roberts. Composition Dreadzone intended Second Light to emphasise melody and emotion and to feature a distinctly British quality, drawing influence from the eclectic array of old and new music from different cultures they felt surrounded by in London, which Brand felt was \\"so much more cosmopolitan than other cities.\\" According to Roberts, the music was inspired by filmmaker Michael Powell and how he would \\"[put] something of the national character of England or Britain into his art. It wasn't a sense of patriotism so much as a sense of history and emotional ties with the past.\\" He explained that Dreadzone would mix up those British \\"elements\\" on the album with influences of Indian, Jamaican and dub music to create a \\"collage\\" that they felt represented modern Britain, noting: \\"It's something that doesn't have anything to do with an imperial past and wants to cut those ties, but something that also wants to breathe new life into the land.\\" Musically, the record is an eclectic album of \\"listening music\\" that draws from dub reggae, electronic music, poetry and folk music styles such as Celtic music. Casper Smith of Select described the album's sound as \\"dub meets keyboard-powered trance meets classical strings,\\" while Dominic Pride of Billboard felt the album resisted categorisation as it has \\"too much beat to be ambient and [is] too laid-back to be dance.\\" The largely instrumental \\"Captain Dread\\", which features an accordion, adopts a sea shanty style. was inspired by Roberts and his son visiting the Cutty Sark clipper in Greenwich. Phil Johnson of The Independent felt that the album's Celtic folk elements and \\"appropriation of the pirate tradition\\" on \\"Captain Dread\\" helped highlight a new age influence. Some consider the album to be a reggae record; when asked whether he agreed that Second Light was a reggae or dub record, Roberts said: The album also samples from an array of British films, including a \\"spoken vision from the future\\" taken from Lindsay Anderson's film if... (1968) and dialogue and music from Powell's films The Thief of Baghdad (1940) and A Canterbury Tale (1944). Johnson noted these unusual samples, saying \\"[a] scholarly regard for the treasures of the British film industry is not the first thing one associates with the British dance music scene.\\" The record also incorporates Derek Walcott's war poetry and what Johnson described as \\"sundry ironic messages from the channel-hopping trawl of a stoned viewers' late-night television habit.\\" Credited samples include Johnny Clarke's \\"Love for Everyone\\" (\\"Love, Life and Unity\\"), Patrick Street's \\"King of Bally Hooley\\" (\\"Captain Dread\\"), Lee Perry & The Upsetters' \\"Dead Lion\\" (\\"Zion Youth\\") and Ryuichi Sakamoto's \\"Before Long\\" (\\"Out of Heaven\\"). The record is largely instrumental, as the band felt that lyrics would prevent listeners from \\"using their imaginations,\\" according to Roberts. \\"I think people imagine all kinds of things when they're listening to our record.\\" Release and promotion In the United Kingdom, Second Light was released by Virgin on 30 May 1995; the label also released the album in other European countries, although the American edition did not follow until later in the year. In the UK, Virgin stocked it at ¬£9.99 for a limited period to incite new buyers. The album debuted and peaked at number 37 on the UK Albums Chart, and stayed on the chart for seven non-consecutive weeks. It remains Dreadzone's most successful album, and as of February 2017, it has sold 81,182 copies in the UK. Four singles from Second Light reached the UK Singles Chart; \\"Zion Youth\\" and \\"Captain Dread\\" both reached number 49 in May and July 1995 respectively, while \\"Little Britain\\" reached number 20 in January 1996 and \\"Life, Love & Unity\\" reached number 56 that March. As a Top 20 hit, \\"Little Britain\\" was the band's breakthrough single, and they performed it on Top of the Pops. The supporting tour for the album did not repeat its contents in the same fashion. Williams said: \\"If we played the album live, people would really not be excited. We have to give the audience something else.\\" The live concerts featured vocalist Earl Sixteen and visual projections from Brand's brother Chris. The group intentionally sought a \\"no icons\\" and \\"no stars\\" stage presence, instead appearing silhouetted against a projection of Sabu from The Thief of Baghdad. Dreadzone developed a sizeable fan base of crusties who would frequent their concerts; the crustie-heavy audience at a December 1995 concert at Wolverhampton was described by Johnson as \\"like a Glastonbury tribe gone back home to the reservation of the winter.\\" Writer Jon Dennis referred to Dreadzone as \\"crusty dance\\". Critical reception Second Light received acclaim from professional music critics according to Dominic Pride of Billboard, who wrote in an article that Second Light was a \\"gentle collage\\" in the vein of \\"many contemporary acts whose outlook has the boundary-breaking elements that dance music permits, without the monotony of the four-to-the-floor beats.\\" Paul Johnson of The Independent praised Second Light in an article, calling it a \\"big ideas album, deconstructing received notions of Britishness with the kind of multi-cultural perspective to be expected from two survivors of Big Audio Dynamite and the post-punk Notting Hill scene, plus their fiendishly clever knob-twiddling third partner.\\" He felt the album's quality made it an enthralling listen which \\"runs counter to the current renaissance of guitar-driven bedroom angst posting as serious pop,\\" further lauding how \\"Dreadzone have the temerity to try to make us think, even while they're putting us in a trance.\\" Eddie Gibb of The List described Second Light as a warm, spacious dub album which is \\"fun and funky.\\" In a less receptive review, Caspar Smith of Select wrote that the album's \\"relentlessly upbeat\\" sound was suited for the summer, but felt that \\"a pervasive sniff of novelty jollity\\" appeared on tracks like \\"A Canterbury Tale\\", and felt the album did not approach the \\"weirdness\\" of Lee Perry or Tricky. In his retrospective, three-star review for AllMusic, John Bush made note of how the album weaves influences of Celtic music into the band's heavy dub sound. In Rock: The Rough Guide, Chris Wright refers to Second Light as the point where \\"Dreadzone's ideas take off,\\" and felt it was \\"to be compared favourably with the more celebrated efforts of Leftfield and Massive Attack.\\" Colin Larkin referred to the album as \\"excellent\\" in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music, and he later elaborated in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music that Second Light captured Dreadzone's varied sound better than their other albums, \\"notably the folk-influenced melodies and bouncy grooves of 'Captain Dread' and 'Little Britain', and the trancey 'One Way' and 'Zion Youth'.\\" He also highlighted \\"A Canterbury Tale\\" as \\"a lush more ambient track, blending synthesized textures with acoustic instruments such as the oboe, violin, piano and a female voice.\\" Legacy In 1997, John Peel ranked Second Light among his twenty favourite albums ever. In their year-end lists of the best albums of 1995, OOR ranked it 20th, while Dominic Pride of Billboard jointly ranked it fourth alongside Leftfield's Leftism, calling both records \\"[v]ariations on a dub.\\" Second Light also dominated the 1995 edition of the Festive Fifty, an annual rundown of the year's fifty best songs according to listeners of John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show. \\"Zion Youth\\" was at No. 5, \\"Maximum\\" at No. 9, \\"Fight the Power\\" at No. 16, \\"Little Britain\\" at No. 23, \\"Captain Dread\\" at No. 35 and \\"Life, Love & Unity\\" at No. 48. Peel himself, who had been following Dreadzone for several years, ranked the album at number 12 in a list of his twenty favourite albums of all time, published in The Guardian in 1997. The group met Peel several times at festivals and BBC Radio sessions, in addition to being invited to appear on Peel's edition of This Is Your Life. Second Light was re-released by EMI on 5 March 2012 as a double disc special edition including, among several bonus material, the Peel session instrumental \\"Maximum\\" and the band's previously unreleased 45-minute set from Glastonbury Festival 1995. The special edition was remastered at AIR Studios by Matt Colton, who had also mastered Dreadzone's previous four albums. Roberts, who attended the mastering sessions, said of Colton's remastering: \\"He is quality and has made it have more warmth and bass end. I am well pleased. [...] We were lucky that Virgin had all the DAT tapes.\\" Dreadzone toured in promotion of the special edition, with a segment of Second Light material dominating the end of the shows.

Informally known as bicosoecids, they are a small group of unicellular flagellates, included among the heterokonts. The cells are free-living, with no chloroplasts, and in some genera are encased in a lorica. The name of the type genus Bicosoeca described by James-Clark in 1866 is derived from Greek roots (, vase, bowl, plus oekein, inhabit). The philologically preferable compound would be Bicoeca, as \\"corrected\\" by Stein in 1878 and followed by most subsequent authors. However, according to the ICBN and ICZN, the original spelling of the name cannot be considered incorrect and it must be used in its original form. The group was formerly considered to be related to the Chrysophyceae. Some authors use the vernacular term \\"bicosoecid\\" (or \\"bicoecid\\") in a narrower sense, only for Bicosoeca, applying \\"bicoeceans\\" to Bicosoeca and related groups like Cafeteria. Supplementary material . With the advent of using molecular phylogenies to resolve relationships of many eukaryotes the original circumscription of bicosoecids has been greatly expanded upon to include other orders and the rank has changed from an order to a class.

It is home to 95 runs across 4 mountains, with a maximum vertical drop of 825 feet. Average snowfall accumulation is around 10 feet each season. During the summer, the area serves as a hiking destination and getaway resort with nearby access to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) and Lake Superior.  Location  Lutsen is one of the northernmost ski areas in the United States outside of Alaska, Montana, and Washington (state). It is located in the Sawtooth Mountains, which are hills that are part of the Superior Highlands on the north shore of Lake Superior. Lutsen receives natural snow, at times lake effect snow from the lake at its foot, and also has snowmaking equipment. Lutsen Mountains Resort is the largest ski resort in the Midwest, also having the 2nd most vertical drop in the Midwest behind Mount Bohemia. The ski season extends from November into mid-April, longer than most other resorts in the Upper Midwest.  Ski Runs and Terrain  The ski area consists of four hills, named Eagle, Ullr, Mystery, and Moose Mountains. The ski resort's \\"Eagle Mountain\\" should not be confused with Eagle Mountain, the highest point in Minnesota, which is actually in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area. The base sits at the feet of Eagle and Ullr Mountains.  Eagle Mountain  Eagle Mountain consists of 21 primary runs (in which two have terrain parks), 4 side-country runs, and two chairlifts. It is typically open from 9:00 AM-4:00 PM during the season. The run difficulty breakdown is 3 double black diamonds, 10 black diamonds, 9 blue, and 3 green. The base and gondola (to Moose Mountain) are easily accessible from multiple runs. Two junior race courses, 1 mogul, and 2 terrain park runs sit on the mountain.  Ullr Mountain  Ullr Mountain consists of 8 short runs (7 primary and 1 side-country), one chairlift, and one surface lift. The run difficulty breakdown is 5 blue, and 3 green. The base and gondola are accessible from all runs.  Mystery Mountain  Mystery Mountain is accessible from the bottom of Eagle and Mystery Mountains. There is one chairlift that provides access to 10 runs (2 primary and 8 side-country), one of which consists of a terrain park featuring banked turns, jumps and rollers. The run difficulty breakdown is 2 black diamond and 8 blue.  Moose Mountain  Moose Mountain is the largest of the four mountains and provides views of Lake Superior from the Southeast facing slope. It features 52 runs, including 9 double black diamond, 13 black diamond, and 30 blue, 1 terrain park, and 1 mogul run. The mountain can be accessed from the resort base via Gondola or the Moose Access run from Eagle Mountain. Two chair lifts (including one six-person lift) can be found at the bases of the two east-facing slopes. The Summit Chalet can be found at the top of the mountain right off of the Gondola. Three double black diamond runs drop off of the Northwest slope.  History and Future Plans  In 1989, Lutsen Mountains installed a German-made PHB Hall gondola to provide access between the base area and Moose Mountain. The gondola is the first, and currently the only, gondola in a mid-American ski resort. Lutsen is known as a family-friendly resort, being named as a Top 20 Family Ski Resort for two years in a row. Lutsen mountains is host to two resorts, the Caribou Highlands, and Eagle Ridge Resorts, which offer a wide variety of rooms, condos and townhomes. Many of them feature ski-in/ski-out access to the mountains. In May 2013, it was announced that Lutsen is installing a six-place high speed detachable lift on Moose Mountain to replace the current Caribou double chair. The existing Caribou double lift will be stored and re-installed on the backside of Moose Mountain to service expert terrain. In summer 2014, Lutsen installed a new pipeline to carry water for snowmaking from Lake Superior to the resort's pumping facility. This alleviates the need to pull water from the Poplar River, a designated trout stream. Within the next ten to fifteen years , Lutsen has put forward plans to expand its pedestrian village & skier services, as well as add additional skier services and base facilities on Eagle and Moose Mountains. Current plans outline a 150-acre expansion, effectively doubling the current skiing acreage, with five or more new chairlifts and several dozen new ski runs. This expansion plan would mark the first attempt by a private ski resort in Minnesota to expand on to public lands, namely the Superior National Forest and is therefore locally controversial. In December 2014, it was announced that Lutsen would begin its expansion and modernization efforts by purchasing and installing a $7 million Doppelmayr 8-passenger high-speed gondola to bring skiers between Eagle and Moose Mountains, replacing the current PHB Hall Skycruiser model, which was installed as a used lift in the late 1980s.

He was active in musical, theatrical, and performance events in high school. After graduating from high school and attending college, he became involved in the entertainment industry, opening the first coffee house in Hawaii. He later moved to Southern California and became active with several groups. When Dave Guard left the Kingston Trio to pursue his interest in early folk music styles, Guard asked Faryar to join his new group, The Whiskeyhill Singers. After the Whiskeyhill Singers disbanded Faryar moved to San Diego to perform with other folk musicians. After his San Diego period Faryar returned to Hawaii, where he helped form the Modern Folk Quartet, and produced two records of his eclectic neo-folk music style. Still living in Hawaii, he continues to perform occasionally with his recognizable and distinctive deep baritone voice.  Early life, family, and education  Cyrus Faryar () was born in Tehran, Iran in 1936 to a family of Persian descent. He was a childhood friend of folk singer Dave Guard. He attended Punahou School, graduating in 1953. He attended the University of Hawaii in Manoa Valley, but left before obtaining his degree.  Professional life and accomplishments  By 1957 Faryar's avant-garde interests led him to establish a \\"beat\\" style coffee house in Honolulu. Faryar's Greensleeves coffee house was, like those popularized first by San Francisco's beat generation in the Broadway section of the city, a gathering place for local musicians, poets, and writers. By 1961, Faryar had left Honolulu and established himself in San Diego. Dave Guard then recruited him to join his new group, the Whiskeyhill Singers, who also included Judy Henske. After the Whiskeyhill Singers broke up, Faryar returned to Hawaii, and formed a new singing group, the Modern Folk Quartet, with Chip Douglas, Henry Diltz and Jerry Yester, which lasted three years before itself disbanding in 1966. At the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967, Faryar led a band dubbed the \\"Group With No Name,\\" which made an anonymous appearance. Later that year, he collaborated with Mort Garson and synthesizer virtuoso Paul Beaver, providing the narration for the album The Zodiac: Cosmic Sounds, a pioneering psychedelic LP on Elektra Records. In 1968, he performed on Cass Elliot's album Dream a Little Dream. He released two solo albums as a singer/songwriter in the early 1970s, but became better known as a producer, particularly for the Firesign Theatre, and playing sessions for Linda Ronstadt and others. He has also continued to record and tour with re-formed versions of the Modern Folk Quartet (or Quintet), as well as recording Hawaiian music following his return to live there.  Discography  *1967: The Zodiac: Cosmic Sounds *1971: Cyrus *1973: Islands  Current life  As of now he lives in Puna, Hawaii, with his wife Suzette Bevier and stepdaughter.

They supported the growth of labor unions, the civil rights movement, and the War on Poverty, while simultaneously opposing totalitarianism and Communist Party rule. Cold-War liberals therefore supported efforts to contain Soviet communism. Liberalism during the Cold War U.S. liberalism of the Cold War era was the immediate heir to Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and the slightly more distant heir to the Progressives of the early 20th century.Alonzo L. Hamby, Liberalism and Its Challengers: From F.D.R. to Bush (1992) Sol Stern wrote, \\"Cold War liberalism deserves credit for the greatest American achievement since World War II‚Äîwinning the Cold War.\\"Stern, Sol (Winter, 2010) \\"The Ramparts I Watched.\\" City Journal. The essential tenets of Cold War liberalism can be found in Roosevelt's Four Freedoms (1941): of these, freedom of speech and of religion were classic liberal freedoms, as was \\"freedom from fear\\" (freedom from tyrannical government), but \\"freedom from want\\" was another matter. Roosevelt proposed a notion of freedom that went beyond government non-interference in private lives. \\"Freedom from want\\" could justify positive government action to meet economic needs, a concept more associated with the concepts of Lincoln's Republican party, Clay's Whig Party, and Hamilton's economic principles of government intervention and subsidy than the more radical socialism and social democracy of European thinkers, or with prior versions of classical liberalism as represented by Thomas Jefferson's Democratic-Republican and Jackson's Democratic party. In the 1950s and 1960s, both major U.S. political parties included liberal and conservative factions. The Democratic Party had two wings: on the one hand, Northern and Western liberals, on the other generally conservative Southern whites. Difficult to classify were the northern urban Democratic \\"political machines\\". The urban machines had supported New Deal economic policies, but would slowly come apart over racial issues. Some historians have divided the Republican Party into liberal Wall Street and conservative Main Street factions; others have noted that the GOP's conservatives came from landlocked states (Robert Taft of Ohio and Barry Goldwater of Arizona) and the liberals tended to come from California (Earl Warren and Paul N. \\"Pete\\" McCloskey), New York (Nelson Rockefeller), and other coastal states. Opposing both communism and conservatism, Cold War liberalism resembled earlier \\"liberalisms\\" in its views on many social issues and personal liberty, but its economic views were not those of free-market Jeffersonian liberalism nor those of European social democrats. They never endorsed state socialism, but did call for spending on education, science, and infrastructure, notably the expansion of NASA and the construction of the Interstate Highway System. Their progressive ideas continued the legacy of Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Most prominent and constant among the positions of Cold War liberalism were: * Support for a domestic economy built on a balance of power between labor (in the form of organized unions) and management (with a tendency to be more interested in large corporations than in small business). * A foreign policy focused on containing the Soviet Union and its allies, one factor leading to its dissolution at the end of 1991. * The continuation and expansion of New Deal social welfare programs (in the broad sense of welfare, including programs such as Social Security). * An embrace of Keynesian economics. By way of compromise with political groupings to their right, this often became, in practice military Keynesianism. At first liberals generally did not see FDR's successor Harry S. Truman as one of their own, viewing him as a Democratic Party hack. However, liberal politicians and liberal organizations such as the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) sided with Truman in opposing communism both at home and abroad, sometimes at the sacrifice of civil liberties.Alonzo L. Hamby, Man of the People: A Life of Harry S. Truman (1995) Hubert Humphrey, for example, in 1950 put before the Senate a bill to establish detention centers where those declared subversive by the President could be held without trial. It did not pass. Liberals were united in their opposition to McCarthyism.Richard M. Fried, Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective (1991)  John F. Kennedy  John F. Kennedy (JFK), the 35th President of the United States, is regarded by some as one of the key players that revived liberalism. JFK was the most influential liberal of the time. During his campaign, Kennedy took the liberal approach by promising voters to revive liberalism, which had withered under Dwight D. Eisenhower, with a new set of reforms collectively called the New Frontier.Hamby, 1992, pp 104-123 The young president wanted to expand Social Security to benefit more Americans, help the elderly pay their medical costs, fund educational endeavors, raise the national minimum wage, and reduce income inequality. In his famous inaugural address, Kennedy appealed to American youth by instructing them to ‚Äúask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.‚Äù He later launched the Peace Corps to support this effort, encouraging young Americans to assist people in developing countries. Kennedy also responded to national fears and pressures regarding the space race with the Soviet Union by challenging Americans to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. His enthusiasm spread across the country. He sought to reform economic issues along with issues of the Humanities which is what paved the way for the future of liberalism(Hamby, 1992 p.106)  Notable Cold War liberals  Some notable pioneers of Cold War liberalism included Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson. World War II ended under the Presidency of 33rd President Harry S. Truman. Although Truman is criticized in some quarters now for his decision to use atomic weapons against Japan, popular opinion at the time was a positive one. Johnson succeeded to the presidency following the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, completed Kennedy's term and was elected President in his own right, winning by a large margin over Barry Goldwater in the 1964 election.Hamby,1992, p216 Johnson was greatly supported by the Democratic Party and as President, he was responsible for designing the \\"Great Society\\" legislation that included laws that upheld civil rights, public broadcasting, Medicare, Medicaid, environmental protection, aid to education, and his \\"War on Poverty\\". Johnson was renowned for his domineering personality and the \\"Johnson treatment,\\" his coercion of powerful politicians in order to advance legislation. All of his accomplishments were influenced by the idea of Cold War liberalism which was according to most, implemented by JFK.Hamby,1992 p.235 Henry Martin \\"Scoop\\" Jackson, first a congressman and then senator from the state of Washington, is also widely recognized as a Cold War liberal. A Democrat, his political beliefs were characterized by support of civil rights, human rights, and safeguarding the environment, but with an equally strong commitment to oppose totalitarianism in general, and Communism in particular. Scoop Jackson and his legacy are acknowledged as having significant influence on Neoconservatism.

Griffin was born and died in Philadelphia, and focused most of his research on the Catholic history of the city. Martin Ignatius Joseph Griffin (1842‚Äì1911) was an American Catholic journalist and historian, instrumental to the founding of the American Catholic Historical Society. He contributed widely to scholarly journals and was the author of several books and monographs on the Catholic history of the United States. Life Griffin was born at Philadelphia on October 23, 1842. From an early age, Griffin became known as a regular contributor and editor with various Catholic publications. In 1872 he was made secretary of the Irish Catholic Benevolent Union, and both founded and edited its journal from 1873 to 1894. This publication began as the I.C.B.U. Journal but was eventually called simply Griffin's Journal. Articles on American Catholic history were a regular feature in his journal. This historical interest led to the founding of the American Catholic Historical Society on July 22, 1884. Griffin remained librarian of that society until his death. In January 1887, he acquired the journal of newly-defunct Ohio Valley Catholic Historical Society and continued its publication under the name American Catholic Historical Researches. This he also continued to edit until his death. He died in Philadelphia on November 10, 1911. Legacy Three years after his death, Griffin was praised as \\"an indefatigable delver into the byways of the past\\" by the Catholic Encyclopedia because of the extent and quality of his research into the Catholic history of the United States. Among his publications are two major books, a History of Commodore John Barry (Philadelphia, 1903) and Catholics and the American Revolution (3 vols., Philadelphia, 1907‚Äì1911). Griffin also published monographs on the history of Old St. Joseph's and several other Philadelphia churches (1881‚Äì1882), on Bishop Michael Francis Egan, O.S.F.

Prior to its construction, Ketcham High School was the district's only high school, away in Wappingers Falls. The 1973 graduating class was the first class to have completed four full years at John Jay HS. Growth in Southern Dutchess County, New York has resulted in a number of classes having more than 25 students in them, although there has been a recent rise in classes with less than 15 students. John Jay's current principal is David Kedzielawa. Paul Albanese, Eleanore Reilly, and Jason Gelardi are John Jay's current administrators. In 2002, a new biology-chemistry wing was opened for the exclusive use of these laboratory courses. In 2009, a new math wing was opened on the first floor. The school is geographically surrounded by IBM East Fishkill. The presence of IBM in the area has fueled and helped to fund a model example of a high school engineering focus. John Jay offers many classes focused on engineering, with some classes utilizing college-level computer programs and mathematics. Some of the classes are eligible for college credit through the Rochester Institute of Technology.

He was reported in 1865 to have been at the bedside of Abraham Lincoln when he died, but that claim has been widely disputed.Miller, Cheryl. \\"Francis Donates Wormley Portrait\\". Washington History. 4:2 (Fall/Winter 1992/1993), pp. 88‚Äì90, 88. Wormley was born a free black citizen in 1819 in Washington. He and his siblings believed they were of Indian descent. Wormley started out driving a carriage for his father, Lynch Wormley (ca. 1780-1852), who owned a livery near the Willard Hotel. In this capacity he met many prominent men in the city and turned those connections into an opportunity to manage a club in the city. He gained a reputation as a fine steward and worked for some time as a steward on a Mississippi riverboat and then as steward for Reverdy Johnson. Wormley was instrumental, in 1871, in getting Congress to fund the city's first public elementary school for black students, the Sumner School, and chaired the committee that oversaw its construction. The Wormley Hotel was at on the southwest corner of 15th and H streets of the northwest quadrant of the city.Shribman, David.

In the 1890s, following James Wormley's death, his son, James T. Wormley took over management of the hotel.  Legacy  Wormley had chaired the committee that oversaw construction of an elementary school for black children in Georgetown at 3325 Prospect Street, near 33rd Street. It opened as the Wormley School in 1885. According to one source, the nearby neighborhood was mostly white, and the black children attending the school mostly came from the eastern part of Georgetown.\\"What‚Äôs In A Name: Profiles of the Trailblazers\\". History and Heritage of District of Columbia Public and Public Charter Schools. District of Columbia Commission on the Arts and Humanities. The school closed in 1952 and became an annex for school administration. The Wormley School building also had a brief second life as a public school for special-needs students. The building was also used from 1979-1994 as a school called Prospect Learning Center. The school worked with children who had learning disabilities and some emotional issues. This building was finally closed forever as a public school in June of 1994 due to the District of Columbia not keeping up with maintenance over a period of many years. The Wormley building also had problems with asbestos and lead-based paint. After the building was shut down in 1994, it was sold to Georgetown University for $500,000. It was slated to be renovated into student housing; however, Georgetown never did anything with it, and the building and grounds sat vacant from 1994-2005. The historic building is now home to the Wormley Row condominiums. On the site of the old parking lot and playground, houses were built which match the character and time period of the neighborhood. Wormley's life and achievements were featured in the Washington Post article \\"A Hotel for the History Books\\" by Nicholas E. Hollis on March 18, 2001.

The current Archbishop of San Salvador is Jos√© Luis Escobar Alas. His cathedra, or archiepiscopal seat, is in San Salvador Cathedral, otherwise the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Holy Saviour (). The city also has a former cathedral, now the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (), and a minor basilica dedicated to the Virgin of Guadelupe, the . The Archdiocese of San Salvador has an unusual arrangement in which the Auxiliary Bishop (Gregorio Rosa Ch√°vez) is a Cardinal. This technically means that he ranks higher than the Archbishop in the Church hierarchy; however, the Archbishop still has authority over archdiocesan affairs.  Statistics  As per 2014, it pastorally served 2,322,000 Catholics (74.0% of 3,137,000 total) on 3,295 km¬≤ in 163 parishes and 6 missions with 354 priests (158 diocesan, 196 religious), 1 deacon, 1,471 lay religious (343 brothers, 1,128 sisters) and 107 seminarians.  History  What is currently the territory of the Republic of El Salvador previously was part of the Spanish colonial Captaincy General (governorship) of Guatemala and, ecclesiastically, of the Archdiocese of Guatemala. Until 1842, there were four church regions in El Salvador, which reported to the San Salvador region, the most important one: Santa Ana, Sonsonate, San Vicente and San Miguel. * Pope Gregory XVI erected the Diocese of the Divine Savior (in Spanish, El Salvador means \\"The Savior\\"), separating the territory of the Republic of El Salvador from the Archdiocese of Guatemala, by Papal bull dated 28 September 1842, constituting it as a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Guatemala. * On 1913.02.11 it was promoted as Metropolitan Archdiocese of San Salvador / Sancti Salvatoris in America (Latin), having lost territory to establish as first suffragan sees Diocese of San Miguel and Diocese of Santa Ana * It lost territories again : on 1943.12.18 to establish Diocese of San Vicente and on 1987.12.30 to establish Diocese of Chalatenango, both as its suffragans. * It enjoyed Papal visits from Pope John Paul II in March 1983 and February 1996.  Twentieth century policy  Under three archbishops, Luis Ch√°vez y Gonz√°lez, √ìscar Arnulfo Romero y Gald√°mez, and Arturo Rivera y Damas, the archdiocese saw over fifty years of a progressive pastoral ministry influenced by the currents of the Second Vatican Council and a Latin American church trend that later was known as Liberation Theology. Critics interpreted the Church's advocacy for the poor as fomenting a socialist revolution and targeted the clergy for assassination. Two bishops, including Archbishop Romero, were assassinated, as were twenty six priests (including Fr. Rutilio Grande, pictured), three nuns and countless catechists and Church workers. The post-Civil War period saw a return to traditional spirituality under the watch of the conservative Archbishop Fernando S√°enz Lacalle, a former military chaplain and member of Opus Dei.  Sexual abuse cases  In November 2015, sex abuse scandals in the Archdiocese of San Salvador started coming to light when the Archdiocese's third highest ranking priest Jesus Delgado, who was also the biographer and personal secretary of the Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero was dismissed by the Archdiocese after its investigation showed that he had molested a girl, now 42 years of age, when she was between the ages of 9 and 17. Due to the statute of limitations, Delgado could not face criminal charges. In December 2016, a canonical court convicted Delgado and two other El Salvador priests, Francisco Galvez and Antonio Molina, of committing acts of sex abuse between the years 1980 and 2000 and laicized them from the priesthood.https://catholicherald.co.uk/news/2016/12/19/vatican-court-finds- three-el-salvador-priests-guilty-of-child-abuse/ In November 2019, the Archdiocese acknowledged sex abuse committed by a priest identified as Leopoldo Sosa Tolentino in 1994 and issued a public apology to his victim.

He may also have been a relative of Lutfullah Shirazi, who was the Faujdar of Sylhet in 1663. In 1699 (1110 Hijri), Abdullah built a large domed mosque in Shah Jalal's dargah complex towards the south. The ruins of this mosque can be seen, located just east of the dargah pond.

Johnson. In addition to claiming that a son was born out of that relationship, Brown also implicated Johnson in a conspiracy to assassinate President John F. Kennedy. Background Brown described her background in her 1997 autobiography, Texas in the Morning: The Love Story of Madeleine Brown and President Lyndon Baines Johnson. According to Brown, she was raised in a middle-class Catholic household in Dallas, Texas, where her father was a utility company supervisor and her mother was a housewife. She stated that she attended W. H. Adamson High School. Brown said at the age of 19 she married James Glynn Brown, a childhood sweetheart and neighborhood soda jerk, whom she divorced in 1955. She described her husband as a veteran of the United States Marine Corps whose \\"war experiences had shattered his nerves, and turned him into a hopeless, physically abusive drunkard\\". Brown said that he \\"was eventually institutionalized in a veteran's hospital for 'chronic paranoid schizophrenia'\\". According to Brown, she left her husband in 1948 while he was in the hospital, returning to Dallas with her two-month-old son, Jimmy Glynn Brown. She said that she was subsequently hired that same year by Glenn Advertising and was promoted to media buyer whose responsibilities including purchasing radio advertising time. Initial allegations: affair with LBJ On November 5, 1982, Brown spoke at a news conference held at the Dallas Press Club, alleging that she had an extramarital relationship with Johnson for almost twenty years. She said that the affair began in 1948 after a party at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas and lasted until 1967. The Dallas Morning News also published the allegations under the headline \\"Dallas Woman Claims She Was LBJ's Lover\\", noting that spokespeople for Lady Bird Johnson and the Johnson family rejected the claims. Brown's statement, in which she said she wanted to \\"clear the record\\", came three weeks after published reports of an affair between Johnson and Alice Glass. Paternity suit and subsequent allegations: Child with LBJ Paternity suit filed On June 18, 1987, Brown's second son, Steven Mark Brown (December 27, 1950 - September 28, 1990), filed a $10.5 million lawsuit against Lady Bird Johnson in a Texas district court alleging that the former first lady and two friends of President Johnson, Jesse Kellam of Austin and Jerome T. Ragsdale of Dallas, had conspired to deprive him of a share of the Johnson estate. His suit claimed: \\"My legal birthrights have been violated and a conspiracy was formed to deprive me of my legal heirship.\\" The suit included an affidavit from Madeleine Brown, alleging that she met President Johnson in 1948 at a social function within a Dallas hotel, then had an affair with him that lasted from 1948 until 1969. According to her affidavit, Ragsdale, a deceased Dallas attorney, was assigned to assist with legal issues regarding her pregnancy and later claimed to be the child's father in order to shield Johnson from negative publicity. Betty Tilson, the press secretary for Lady Bird Johnson, was quoted as stating: \\"We're convinced the whole thing is made-up, frankly.\\" Tilson indicated that close associates of the Johnson family were not familiar with the name \\"Steven Mark Brown\\" nor was there any record of correspondence or visitation from him within the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum. She also stated that no one she talked to knew Ragsdale. Interview with People magazine  The August 5, 1987 issue of People magazine detailed additional claims made by Madeleine and Steven Brown. In the 1940s, the Johnsons owned a radio station in Austin, KTBC, run by Jesse Kellam. Madeleine Brown claimed that she attended a KTBC reception in 1948 while working for a Dallas advertising agency and was introduced to Johnson through Kellam. She reported that Johnson flirted with her during this initial encounter and that she was \\"dazzled\\" by him. According to Brown, Kellam immediately asked her to another reception three weeks later at the Adolphus Hotel. It was at that meeting, she said, that her long affair with Johnson began after he invited her up to his apartment in the hotel. Brown said that Johnson insisted the affair be kept secret, and she alleged that Kellam functioned as a go-between who arranged for Johnson and her to meet. People magazine reported that she claimed her relationship with Johnson was \\"purely physical\\" and had discovered that he had other mistresses. According to Brown, she told Johnson in April 1950 that she was pregnant and he assured her he would provide for her needs. She claimed that Kellam told her a few days later that she would be contacted by attorney Jerome Ragsdale. Brown alleged that after the birth of Steven in 1950, Ragsdale provided her with \\"a six-room house for $15,000, complete with a live-in maid\\", and paid the various charge cards he supplied to her. She said her physician told her that he would note her husband, James Glynn Brown, as the father. According to Brown, she continued to meet with Johnson throughout the 1950s and 1960s. She told People that for five years, at Kellam's urging, she had a \\"paper marriage\\" to a Dallas businessman with whom she never lived. She said that years after they divorced, she was told by a friend that the man had committed suicide. According to Brown, she was on her way to see Johnson in Austin when she heard about the assassination of Kennedy over the radio, then turned around. She said that a few weeks later Kellam instructed her to meet the new President of the United States in their usual place. Brown told People that her sexual relationship with Johnson abruptly ended in 1967 after she was badly injured in a car accident in which her son, Steven, was at the wheel. She said she had one last meeting with Johnson in 1969 at the Shamrock Hotel in Houston, Texas, in which they had a two-hour discussion which she described as their first \\"real conversation\\". Brown said that in 1973 Kellam telephoned her to say that Johnson had died. Brown stated that she was hospitalized after suffering a heart attack in February 1987 and, expecting to die, called Steven to her bedside in order to confess hiding the true identity of his father from him. According to People, despite the name of his mother's first husband on his birth certificate, Steven had been \\"wracked by uncertainty\\" about who was his true father and \\"had come to suspect a lawyer friend of the family was actually his father\\". Steven's mother said that she had no love letters from Johnson and that the few people who could corroborate her story were dead. According to Brown, she came forward with the paternity claim to assist Steven in claiming his inheritance. Discussing the purpose of the lawsuit, Steven said: \\"In a public forum, sooner or later the truth comes out. That's what's important to me. I want my last name changed to Johnson, the way it ought to be.\\" He maintained that he wanted money from the former first lady in order to provide for two nephews. Shortly after the interview, entertainment writer Harry Haun said that Brown's claims in People \\"stirred up such a hornet's nest of book publishers and movie producers that the woman will indeed write a book about\\". Haun wrote that literary agent Scott Meredith had been enlisted to handle the book and film rights. Paternity suit dismissed In 1989, Steven Brown's suit against Lady Bird Johnson was dismissed after he failed to show in court. He died in 1990, at age 39, from lymphatic cancer. Later allegations: LBJ and the assassination of JFK After the paternity claims, Brown made other allegations suggesting that there was a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy, including the charge that Johnson had foreknowledge of a plot. In 1988, she briefly appeared in investigative columnist Jack Anderson's syndicated program, American Expose: Who Murdered JFK, and said: \\"In the fall of 1963 I was in the Carousel Club with other advertising people, and Jack Ruby was saying that Lee Harvey Oswald had been in the club and he had been bragging that he had taken a shot at Major General Edwin Walker\\". Interviews with Brown implicating Johnson also appeared in an episode of A Current Affair in February 1992, and in a 2003 episode of Nigel Turner's documentary The Men Who Killed Kennedy, titled \\"The Guilty Men.\\" Brown claimed to have been present at a party in Clint Murchison, Sr.'s Dallas home on the evening prior to the assassination of John F. Kennedy that was attended by Johnson as well as other famous, wealthy, and powerful individuals including, J. Edgar Hoover, Richard Nixon, H. L. Hunt, George Brown, and John McCloy. According to Brown, Johnson had a meeting with several of the men after which he told her: \\"After tomorrow, those goddamn Kennedys will never embarrass me again. That's no threat. That's a promise.\\"Brown, Madeleine D. (1997), Texas in the Morning: The Love Story of Madeleine Brown and President Lyndon Baines Johnson, Conservatory Press, p. 166. Brown said that on New Year's Eve 1963, she met with Lyndon Johnson at the Driskill Hotel in Austin, Texas, and that Johnson confirmed the conspiracy to kill Kennedy, insisting that \\"Texas oil and ... renegade intelligence bastards in Washington\\" had been responsible.Brown, Madeleine D. (1997), Texas in the Morning: The Love Story of Madeleine Brown and President Lyndon Baines Johnson, Conservatory Press, p. 189. Turner, Nigel. The Men Who Killed Kennedy, Part 9, \\"The Guilty Men\\", 2003. Brown alleged that Johnson did not attempt to stop the assassination because he hated Kennedy and had an intense desire to be President. Brown also said that she witnessed Oswald meeting with Ruby in the Carousel Club prior to the assassination, but did not specify how long before the assassination this meeting had occurred. In the years following Brown's allegations, her story has received national attention and several conspiracy authors have cited her claims as evidence of a conspiracy in the case of the JFK assassination. Allegations challenged In November 2012, The Dallas Morning News published an article by Hugh Aynesworth describing David Perry's efforts to disprove Brown's allegations. Perry, a former insurance investigator turned conspiracy debunker, had placed his investigation of her claims on his website in an article entitled \\"Texas in the Imagination\\" the previous month. According to Perry, he and his wife met Brown at a social function a few years after she made her original allegations as to the JFK assassination but did not find her story to be believable. He said he initially decided to investigate Brown's conspiracy claim of Johnson and other notable individuals attending a party at Murchison's house. Perry pointed to evidence placing key figures outside of Dallas on the evening of November 21, 1963, including Johnson (with Kennedy in Houston and in Fort Worth), Murchison (in East Texas), and Hoover (in Washington, D.C.). He said that while Nixon was in Dallas at that time, a writer for The Dallas Morning News had placed him at a bottlers convention in the downtown area. Investigating the paternity claims of Brown and her son, Perry found a report of the son's dismissed lawsuit against Lady Bird Johnson in The Dallas Morning News as well as information indicating a prior conviction for Brown on forgery charges. In 1989, Brown was convicted of forging the will of an elderly relative, who had died the previous year, and was sentenced to ten years in prison. The conviction was overturned in 1994 when the appeals court determined she had not personally signed the original will. In 2012, Perry found documents indicating that Steven Mark Brown had previously filed another paternity lawsuit in 1979 claiming to be an heir to the estate of Jerome Ragsdale, the Dallas attorney who Brown said had claimed to be her son's father in order to shield Johnson from negative publicity. That suit was also dismissed due to lack of evidence.

Ward is a prominent Oklahoma City businessman and philanthropist. He is currently the Chairman and CEO of Mach Resources, a privately owned energy company in Oklahoma City, OK. He was the founder and former Chairman and CEO of Tapstone Energy and SandRidge Energy, Inc. and is the former President, Chief Operating Officer, and co-founder of Chesapeake Energy. After growing SandRidge into a $10 billion company, Ward and SandRidge parted ways in 2013. The decision to move on from Ward was made without cause, along with two separate board investigations concluding nothing improper and no wrongdoings occurred during his tenure as Chairman and CEO. Ward, who Bloomberg coined \\"a natural gas icon\\" in 2017, has founded and led several successful oil and gas companies throughout his career. Ward is also owner of TLW Trading, L.L.C., Heritage Feeders, L.P., and TLW Land and Cattle. TLW Trading, L.L.C. invests both financially and physically in commodities, focusing primarily on energy, specifically on North American natural gas markets. Heritage Feeders is ranked within the top 10 cattle feeders in the United States.  Early life  Ward grew up in Seiling, Oklahoma, where he was raised and attended high school. In high school, Ward competed in football, basketball, baseball, and track. During his senior year, he worked with his uncle in local oil fields. Before leaving for college, Ward met his future wife, Schree.  Education  Ward graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1981 with a BBA in Petroleum Land Management.  Philanthropy and community involvement  Ward co-founded White Fields in 2000 and serves as the Chairman of the Board. White Fields' mission is to provide a continuum model of care offering a long-term home for abused and neglected boys. They strive to meet the physical, emotional, educational, and spiritual needs of these boys by giving them a long-term home, counseling, and guidance. At White Fields, the boys can stay as long as they need to in order to heal, unlike many other short-term arrangements. In 2016, the Oklahoma Department of Human Services partnered with Ward, through White Fields Inc., and Eckerd Kids to provide innovative software that uses predictive analytics to prevent childhood tragedies. In 2002, the Tom L. and Sch'ree Ward Fieldhouse at Anderson University was named after Ward and his wife for their gift that completed the construction of the Kardatzke Wellness Center in Anderson, Indiana. The couple also created a scholarship program for young people who are members of Crossings Community Church in Oklahoma City to attend Anderson University, a private Christian institution, for tuition comparable to an Oklahoma state school. In 2005, Ward provided a free campus for SeeWorth Academy with an ideal location, where 400 students could gain a balanced curriculum without outside distractions and influences.‚Äù In 2014, Ward invested $17 million dollars into the 96-year-old vacant Mideke building in Bricktown, in downtown Oklahoma City, to reestablish it as Tapstone‚Äôs headquarters. Renovations include the east alley wall of the warehouse being modified with a ‚Äútransparent glass fa√ßade,‚Äù and a partial revamp of the interior by integrating existing historical architectural elements into the new design. Additional renovations include a 3,600 square foot expansion for an All About Chai Coffee and Tea. Ward was highly active in sponsoring major downtown activities in December 2014, such as the SandRidge Tree Lighting Festival and SandRidge Santa Run. Ward and SandRidge also worked intently with Alva's minimum security Bill Johnson Correctional Center located in Oklahoma. ‚ÄúThrough the partnership, rehabilitation, non-violent inmates earn the opportunity to return back to the workplace.‚Äù Ward was a member of the Professional Basketball Club LLC, which owns the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder, until he sold his interest to George Kaiser in April 2014.Adam Wilmoth, \\"George Kaiser buys Thunder stake: Tulsa businessman George B. Kaiser is the newest co-owner of the Oklahoma City Thunder after buying out the ownership interest of Tom Ward.\\" The Oklahoman, April 18, 2014. Ward is a committed member of several education-affiliated organizations. He is a former Board of Trustees member for Anderson University in Indiana, is a member of the Economic Advisory Council of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and participates on the Board of Visitors for the OU Health Sciences Center. He is also on the board of the Department of Medicine, the Board of Trustees for The World Golf Foundation, and a member of The First Tee, which is an organization developed to help ‚Äúshape the lives of kids and teens from all walks of life by introducing them to values inherent in the game of golf.‚Äù Ward also contributes as a member of the Nopetro Board of Directors. Ward has provided substantial scholarship money to Oklahoma colleges and universities to help students achieve their higher education goals and find work in the state after college. Ward played a major role in revitalizing downtown's Central Business District. Ward oversaw the renovation of the former Kerr-McGee Tower into SandRidge's corporate headquarters, which is now known as SandRidge Commons. Ward is notable in restoring rundown buildings, such as Oklahoma City's historical Braniff Building, by adding retail, contemporary office space, and restaurants. Ward also directed 120 Kerr from a \\"dilapidated parking structure,\\" to a modern office building. Ward is also the Chairman of the Tom L. Ward Family Foundation, which supports several nonprofits, including Positive Tomorrows and Oklahomans for Criminal Justice Reform.  Honors and awards  Ward was inducted into the Oklahoma Heritage Foundation's Hall of Fame in 2012 and was one out of four honorees chosen for the Neal Horton Award at the 2014 Dean A. McGee Awards Ceremony for his role in the revitalization of downtown's Central Business District. On April 2006, Ward was chosen as a Friend of Children Honoree by the Oklahoma Institute for Child Advocacy. Ward was honored by Big Brothers Big Sisters with the Judge William R. Saied Founder's Award for his advancement of mentoring in Oklahoma City. In 2008, The National Philanthropy Day Past Award was also presented to Ward for being an Outstanding Philanthropist.

Background While residing in Bonn, Germany from 1979 to 1981, Tegtmeier ran an occult bookstore named Horus. In conjunction with the bookstore, an experimental magical group that became informally known as 'The Bonn Group' was formed. During this time Peter J. Carroll's Liber Null was translated and published by Tegtmeier under his Edition Magus label. In the late 1980s, during his active participation in the order, Tegtmeier developed the concept of cyber magic. He was also the second-foremost proponent of 'ice magick', second only to the creator of ice magick, Helmut Barthel. In the early 1990s, Tegtmeier was involved with a schism from the Illuminates of Thanateros, an event known as 'the ice magick wars'. Tegtmeier has been uninvolved with the IOT since then, and has distanced himself from Chaos Magic as represented by Carroll. Ralph gave his first public account of the schism in an interview with David Rietti, which was published in 2006 in the UK-based occult magazine, The Oracle.\\"Ice Magic. A Conversation between Frater Frater U‚à¥D‚à¥ and David Rietti\\", The Oracle Occult Magazine, Issue No. 6 [2006], pp. 13-18. There, he states that, while the altercation between him and Carroll and the subsequent schism positively occurred, the 'ice magick war' itself was an entirely delusionary event that never actually took place except in his detractors' imagination. Ralph also states that during said schism, 80% of the order's membership left the organization, setting up an alternative organization (the Revolutionary Illuminates of Thanateros or RIOT), disputing his opponent's claim that the order was actually saved. Contrary to that inflated statistic, Peter Carroll himself has stated that only the German and Swiss divisions of the order split off, and together they constituted about 30 percent of the total IoT membership. In his self-published book eismagie. erste einblicke (ice magic. first insights)eismagie - erste einblicke, Edition Magus, Bad M√ºnstereifel 1996 Tegtmeier is radically critical of conventional magic and its shortcomings, calling for a deconstructionist approach stripped from cultural, historical and societal bias. He promotes an alternate definition of magic as \\"doing the impossible\\".

The area is not in fact just Hertfordshire but encompasses Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire and Cambridgeshire. Present Day Hertfordshire is probably among the weakest of the British counties as a result of the small number of large population centres in the region it serves. It has further been affected by the general trend of reduced emigration from Ireland to the UK since the 1980s. As a result, a number of the original clubs have folded ‚Äì including the Milton Keynes-based team Erin Go Bragh in 2005. However, a resurgence may be under way. The youth sections of the county is very promising as in 2018 Hertfordshire u14's won the Feile Peile na nOg in Meath, following up the year after winning a shield competition in Connaught.

These muscles are also called mimetic muscles. Structure The facial muscles are just under the skin (subcutaneous) muscles that control facial expression. They generally originate from the surface of the skull bone (rarely the fascia), and insert on the skin of the face. When they contract, the skin moves. These muscles also cause wrinkles at right angles to the muscles‚Äô action line. Nerve supply The facial muscles are supplied by the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), with each nerve serving one side of the face. In contrast, the nearby masticatory muscles are supplied by the mandibular nerve, a branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V). List of muscles The facial muscles include: * Occipitofrontalis muscle * Temporoparietalis muscle * Procerus muscle * Nasalis muscle * Depressor septi nasi muscle * Orbicularis oculi muscle * Corrugator supercilii muscle * Depressor supercilii muscle * Auricular muscles (anterior, superior and posterior) * Orbicularis oris muscle * Depressor anguli oris muscle * Risorius * Zygomaticus major muscle * Zygomaticus minor muscle * Levator labii superioris * Levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle * Depressor labii inferioris muscle * Levator anguli oris * Buccinator muscle * Mentalis The platysma is supplied by the facial nerve. Although it is mostly in the neck and can be grouped with the neck muscles by location, it can be considered a muscle of facial expression due to its common nerve supply. The stylohyoid muscle, stapedius and posterior belly of the digastric muscle are also supplied by the facial nerve, but are not considered muscles of facial expression. Development The facial muscles are derived from the second branchial/pharyngeal arch. Clinical significance An inability to form facial expressions on one side of the face may be the first sign of damage to the nerve of these muscles. Damage to the facial nerve results in facial paralysis of the muscles of facial expression on the involved side. Paralysis is the loss of voluntary muscle action; the facial nerve has become damaged permanently or temporarily. This damage can occur with a stroke, Bell palsy, or parotid salivary gland cancer (malignant neoplasm) because the facial nerve travels through the gland. The parotid gland can also be damaged permanently by surgery or temporarily by trauma. These situations of paralysis not only inhibit facial expression but also seriously impair the patient‚Äôs ability to speak, either permanently or temporarily.Illustrated Anatomy of the Head and Neck, Fehrenbach and Herring, Elsevier, 2012, page 89 See also * Masticatory muscles * Facial Action Coding System * Modiolus References External links * ARTNATOMY: Anatomical Basis of Facial Expression Learning Tool  Facial muscles at PracticeAnatomy Category:Muscles of the head and neck Muscles ","title":"Facial muscles"},{"id":"7227966","text":"Johnny Messner may refer to: *Johnny Messner (musician) (1909-1986), American big band/swing bandleader *Johnny Messner (actor) (born 1970), American actor ","title":"Johnny Messner"},{"id":"7227968","text":"Johnny Messner (13 October 1909 New York City ‚Äì January 1986 Ridgefield Park, New Jersey) was an American bandleader, composer, saxophonist, and vocalist during the big band/swing heyday.

It is generally regarded as the most famous of all artisan cheeses made in the country and can be found in many markets outside Croatia. History In 1774, the travel writer Alberto Fortis, on his way to Dalmatia, wrote about Pag island's products, including sea salt, sage honey, wool and Pag cheese. Until early in the 20th century, the inhabitants of Pag had their own dry stone huts in which they milked the sheep and made Pag cheese. These stone houses are adorned in sedge and reeds from the nearby fields, the huts were built out of town on the rocky hills above the pastures. The majority of the pastures are located on the hilly parts of the island and are recognizable by the dry stone walls that surround them. From far off, the intricate stone walls resemble the famous Pag lace (pa≈°ka ƒçipka) as they traverse the rocky summits. Historically, there was no private ownership of the pastures and the sheep freely grazed on all the land. Over time, the pastures slowly became privately owned, so the shepherds moved back into towns and their stone huts became pasture homes. As shepherds commuted to and from pastures to care for their sheep, the women assumed the role of cheese makers. Pag cheese slowly but surely gained importance not only as a food for the locals but also as a commodity to market across Croatia, thus Pag cheese became an important source of income for the villagers. Production process The island of Pag has a long tradition of cheese making and agriculture and is the most indented island in the Adriatic, which provides perfect conditions for making cheese. The island of Pag's eastern landscape is dominated by the mountain range on the mainland, Velebit. It is on these snowy peaks that hot and cold air amasses, and particularly in winter, gives birth to the Pag Bora. A strong, cool, dry wind that gathers strength as it tumbles down the southern slopes of Velebit onto the calm seas. The Bora then dries and turns into dry salt dust, which it then scatters all over Pag, turning it into a white, salty island. and in these conditions upon the rocky hills of Pag, only the extremely resilient and aromatic plant species survive.\\"The joy of Pa≈°ki sir\\", Hudin.com, July 2011 The best known and most precious is the fragrant Pag's Sage, there are numerous colonies of this purple flowered plant which adorn the pure white limestone in May, and fill the air with its scent. It is upon such salty and aromatic vegetation that Pag's autochthonous breed of sheep graze freely, giving local sheep unique qualities and taste in their milk which then permeate the taste of Pag cheese. Certification The main producers of Pag cheese came together to form an association with the aim of obtaining Protected Designation of Origin for Pag cheese. PDO will impose strict conditions of production techniques as well as a particular origin of base products which will ensure that Pag cheese remains a product of Pag.

He graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology in 1897. He was the owner of the Kidde company which manufactured fire extinguishers. His parents immigrated to the United States from Bohemia. Kidde died of a heart attack in 1943 at the age of 65. (He is unrelated to the Danish Kidde family, to which author Harald Kidde and cartoonist and author Rune T. Kidde belong.) Career At the age of 23, Walter Kidde opened Walter Kidde & Company. Walter Kidde & Company helped build ship yards at Port Newark and Kearny. He later joined the New Jersey State Highway Commission. During his time there, he oversaw the first traffic circle in Camden, the first clover-leaf intersection and most importantly the Pulaski Skyway in 1932. Even though he had no railroad experience, Walter Kidde was the court appointed trustee of the bankrupt New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway from July 24, 1937 until his death in 1943.http://secondriver.blogspot.com/2009/02/walter- kidde.html Walter Kidde & Company Walter Kidde & Company started out as a construction company, but slowly grew into a fire suppression company. In 1918 Walter Kidde & Company purchased the rights to the \\"Rich\\" system for on board fire detection and suppression. The problem with this system was steam was used to put out fire, which then caused considerable damage to the cargo on the ship. Kidde came up with the solution to use carbon dioxide instead of steam. This new design had one drawback, the carbon dioxide was not being released fast enough. In order to solve this problem, he bought the rights to a patent for a siphoning device. With this system Walter Kidde & Company released the first portable carbon dioxide fire extinguisher and the first built in industrial system. In 1926 Walter Kidde & Company helped the US Navy design a system to prevent engines on airplanes from catching fire. In the 1930s and the 1940s the Walter Kidde & Company experienced great growth reaching markets in Asia, Europe, Africa, and South America. World War II helped Walter Kidde & Company reach unprecedented sales. In 1938 Walter Kidde & Company had sales of $2 million, and by 1943 the company was producing over $60 million worth or war equipment. This massive increase in sales had Kidde wondering if he was fit to run such a large company. Walter Kidde & Company was hit with a huge backlog and was always behind schedule. This was because Walter Kidde & Company had to adapt their products that were meant for peacetime to those to be used during wartime. After Walter Kidde's death in 1943 the company was passed down to his son John Kidde.http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2840500180.html Boy Scouts Kidde was a great friend to Boy Scouting in the Montclair, New Jersey area. His engineering efforts and personal financial donations were instrumental in creating a dam of the Panther Brook (now known as Fox Brook) and resultant Lake Vreeland in 1917. The Lake is the centerpiece of Camp Glen Gray, Mahwah, NJ founded in 1917, which was the first purpose-built Boy Scout camp in New Jersey, and among the oldest still in existence in the US.

McGivern was tried with his partner in the robbery, Charles Culhane, and was sentenced to ten to twenty years in state prison. On September 13, 1968, McGivern, Culhane and a third convict, Robert Bowerman, were being transported by two deputies, from Auburn State Prison to a court hearing in White Plains. During a rest stop along the New York State Thruway, a deputy's gun was seized in an attempted escape. During the struggle inside the police car, a deputy and Bowerman were shot to death. McGivern and Culhane contended that Bowerman acted alone in the escape attempt, and that Bowerman killed the deputy. Following one trial ending in a hung jury, a second trial in which they were sentenced to death, then a successful appeal of that death sentence, in a third trial they were found guilty of felony murder and sentenced to 25 years to life. In a controversial New Year's Eve 1985 decision, New York Governor Mario Cuomo granted McGivern clemency, and he was paroled three years later. Early life McGivern was born in Manhattan, the son of Gertrude Burke and Thomas McGivern, who were both born and raised in Belfast, Northern Ireland. He attended Catholic schools and served in the United States Navy. He lived with his family in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx. McGivern's first serious brush with the law was for marijuana possession in the Bronx. Culhane was his codefendant in a robbery of a gas station in Pelham, New York, in December 1966. Instead of accepting a plea bargain of five years in the case, McGivern chose to go to trial. The Westchester County court sentenced him to ten to twenty years in state prison. Sing Sing prison was McGivern's first destination and then upstate to Auburn Prison where he left for White Plains, New York, Westchester's county seat, on September 13, 1968, to appear as a witness in a court hearing for Culhane. September 13, 1968 On September 13, 1968, McGivern, Culhane and a third prisoner Robert Bowerman left Auburn prison with two deputies for a court hearing ordered by Westchester County Judge John C. Marbach, a former district attorney and trial lawyer. Marbach acted on Culhane's coram nobis application to determine the validity of Culhane's claim of improper sentencing in the Pelham Manor case. He approved a hearing on the matter. Westchester County Sheriff Daniel F. McMahon sent two of his deputies‚ÄîJoseph Singer and William Fitzgerald‚Äîto Auburn to pick up the three prisoners and deliver them to court in White Plains. McMahon was the former Public Safety Commissioner of Yonkers and a former chief of the criminal division of the office of the United States Attorney in New York. He had been elected Westchester's county sheriff the previous January in 1968. Robert Bowerman, a jailhouse lawyer at Auburn, prepared the coram nobis application for Culhane. Bowerman had a history of escape attempts. Although he claimed in the legal papers to have personal knowledge of Culhane's case, Bowerman had never been arrested in Westchester County and had no association with the 1967 robbery case. An assistant for the Westchester County DA's office, B. Anthony Morosco, formally opposed Bowerman attending the hearing. The five men left Auburn Prison on the morning of September 13 in a 1967 blue Chevrolet owned by Deputy Fitzgerald. It was not equipped with a security screen between the front and back seats. All five men dressed in plainclothes. The vehicle headed south on the New York State Thruway. On three occasions before lunch, Robert Bowerman requested that the deputies stop while he urinated along the side of the road. The deputies allowed Bowerman to leave the vehicle. When the Chevrolet passed through Ulster County on the Thruway in the early afternoon, Robert Bowerman asked the deputies to stop the vehicle again. The sequence of what happened next became the source of considerable dispute over the next three decades in three trials, numerous appeals, the polygraph tests McGivern passed, news coverage and controversy surrounding the grant of executive clemency. Deputy Sheriff William Fitzgerald and the prisoner Robert Bowerman were shot to death inside the car at Milepost 67.4. Culhane and McGivern maintained it was a solo escape attempt by Bowerman who was responsible for killing Deputy Fitzgerald. The surviving deputy Joseph Singer claimed McGivern shot Fitzgerald and that the escape attempt involved all three prisoners. Culhane and McGivern were indicted for felony murder, with attempted escape in the second degree as the underlying felony. The Ulster County Legislature passed a resolution on June 3, 1971 (Resolution 129) \\"that the office of the Ulster County Attorney be empowered to conduct a detailed legal investigation of the facts surrounding this crime to determine if there is sufficient grounds for instituting a negligence action against Westchester County, the Westchester County Sheriff and the State of New York for its statutory obligation.\\" Ulster County's legislators expected to be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the case, a crime which occurred within Ulster's borders on the Thruway. Ulster County's attempt to recoup damages was unsuccessful. Three trials in Ulster County, New York In an atmosphere of negative media coverage, the first trial in Kingston, New York, in 1969 ended in a hung jury. \\"Editorials of the Air\\" were the trademark of a Kingston radio station managed by Harry Thayer, the son of the former commissioner of corrections of the State of New York, Dr. Walter N. Thayer Jr., who served the state from 1931 to 1936. Harry Thayer broadcast controversial editorials on the air during all three Culhane-McGivern trials in Ulster County. The juries in the Culhane-McGivern trials considered two versions of eyewitness testimony. In the investigation following the incident, the police did not conduct fingerprint tests on the weapons or other forensic tests which might have strengthened one eyewitness version of the account over the other. Following the hung jury in 1969, Harry Thayer publicly admonished the jurors on the air for not returning a verdict, calling it an example of \\"Lace Panty Justice,\\" a term meaning \\"soft on crime\\". In the second trial in 1970 a jury found the defendants guilty, and Harry Thayer advocated for the death penalty on the air. The defendants were sentenced to death and sent to death row at Green Haven Correctional Facility across the Hudson River from Ulster County, where they remained in the death house for 33 months. Defense attorneys filed an appeal brief citing negligence in the case investigation, inconsistencies in the testimony of Singer, the prosecution's main witness, negative pretrial publicity, an unfair jury selection process, and denials of motions for a change of venue. In October 1973 the New York State Court of Appeals unanimously overturned the convictions and death sentences, saying that four jurors who had shown a bias in favor of conviction should have been excused. The decision also noted that \\"Singer's testimony. . .was inconsistent as to certain particulars\\" and \\"... the prosecutor's evidence --taken in the context of this particular trial-- presented substantial questions of credibility for the jury's consideration.\\" (October 23, 1973 decision, 33 N.Y. 2nd at 95 and n.1). The Court ordered a new trial. The third trial, in March 1975, ended in convictions and sentences of 25 years to life. The Culhane-McGivern Defense Fund was sponsored by the folk singer Pete Seeger, the poet Allen Ginsberg and the political commentator William F. Buckley Jr. The third trial conviction was upheld on appeal. Dissent highlighted the judge's unfair charge to the jury and the suppression of Robert Bowerman's prior history of escape attempts. Appeals attempting to overturn the third trial conviction were filed by attorneys Michael Tigar, William Kunstler, Karen Peters, John Mage and John Privitera. The conviction was upheld but not without dissent. Executive clemency McGivern's and Culhane's paths now diverged. They were sent to different prisons, McGivern to the Green Haven Correctional Facility and Culhane to the Attica Correctional Facility, and elected to pursue different paths to gaining release. McGivern took and passed two polygraph tests in 1979 regarding his involvement in the crime. The tests were administered by Charles Jones, a member of the Case Review Committee of the American Polygraph Association and Lincoln Zonn, who had had his own company and polygraph institute for the previous 30 years. Zonn's clients included the U.S. government and many law enforcement agencies. A group of religious leaders including the Green Haven prison chaplain presented a petition seeking clemency for McGivern. Lieutenant Governor Mario Cuomo formally recommended that New York Governor Hugh Carey commute McGivern's sentence. The district attorney of Ulster County, Michael Kavanagh, publicly opposed the clemency recommendation throughout its lifetime. Governor Carey declined to act on the recommendation. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat, was elected governor of New York State in 1983. During his twelve years in office, he granted a total of 33 clemencies. On December 31, 1985, he granted clemency to McGivern, an act that brought a firestorm of criticism from Republicans at state and national levels as well as from law enforcement personnel. The parole board granted McGivern parole three years later, and he was released on March 17, 1989, after 22 years in prison. Later life, death, and legacy McGivern was married to Marguerite Culp, a reporter for the Woodstock Times, from 1978 until 1991. On June 13, 1994, McGivern was arrested for drug possession, a parole violation, and he was returned to prison. He died of cancer in Albany Medical Hospital on November 19, 2001.

Retrieved May 28, 2012. Steely Dan FAQ author Anthony Robustelli describes \\"Pretzel Logic\\" as a bluesy shuffle about time travel. Fagen has stated that the lyrics, including anachronistic references to Napoleon and minstrel shows, are about time travel. According to Steely Dan FAQ author Anthony Robustelli, the \\"platform\\" referred to in the song's bridge is the time travel machine. But Something Else! critic Victor Aaron describes the lines \\"I stepped out on the platform, the man gave me the news/He said, 'You must be joking son, where did you get those shoes?'‚Äù as a memorable putdown line. Steely Dan biographer Brian Sweet hypothesizes that the first verse was inspired by the band's distaste for touring, particularly the tours of the American South that their record label had sent them upon the previous year. Brownsville Herald writer Bobby Alvarez felt the song was about Steely Dan's \\"quest for stardom\\" and represented their philosophy about themselves‚Äîthat whatever they have not done or experienced in the past doesn't matter anymore since the past is gone. Billboard described \\"Pretzel Logic\\" as a \\"bluesy rock hit\\" and praised the vocals, production, and the \\"catchy instrumental refrain. Rolling Stone critic Bud Scoppa describes \\"Pretzel Logic\\" as one of the album's most conventional songs, calling it a \\"modified blues.\\" Aaron regards it as Steely Dan's song that remains most faithful to the blues, but acknowledges that a few non-blues chords are incorporated into the refrain. Scoppa particularly praised the electric guitar improvisations for their originality and for pedal steel guitar parts that don't sound like country music. Scoppa credited Jeff Baxter for this, although according to Steely Dan biographer Brian Sweet, Walter Becker played the guitar solo. This is one of the first Steely Dan songs to feature Walter Becker as a lead guitarist. Eduardo Rivadavia cites \\"Pretzel Logic\\" as one of several songs on the album on which Steely Dan hones their trademark sound, \\"as sweetly infectious as it was deceptively intricate, dark and witty.\\" Alvarez rated it one of the best songs on the album.

(retrieved 3 March 2010) from Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, Canada. He is known for his woodcarving, argillite carving, jewellery, and painting.HAND TO HAND:The Legacy of Charles Edenshaw DVD 2005 Ravens and Eagles Productions, www.urbanrez.ca Background Edensew (the name also spelled Edensaw, or Edenso from the Haida chiefly name ) was born at the Haida village of Skidegate, on Haida Gwaii, located 27 miles off of the coast of British Columbia Canada. His father was of the lineage of the Raven moiety. His mother, whose lineage identity he followed in the Haida matrilineal system, was (later Mrs. John Robson) of the Eagle moiety's lineage, of which Charles eventually became chief. He spent his early years at Kiusta and Yatza in the northwestern Charlottes, i.e. the Queen Charlotte Islands (Haida Gwaii). His Haida name was or Tahaygen, alternatively spelled Tahayren and Tahayghen. He learned from his uncle, the Eagle chief Albert Edward Edenshaw. In 1884 he was baptised with his English name, which derived from Scotland's Bonnie Prince Charlie. In addition to the chiefly name , he also held the titles (\\"Fairies Coming to You as in a Big Wave\\"), (\\"Noise in the Housepit\\"), (\\"They Gave Ten Potlatches for Him\\"). Artworks He produced many commissioned works, including for the American Museum of Natural History. His work is in many museum collections, and he served as consultant to many anthropologists. His works include bentwood boxes, rattles, masks, totem poles, and staffs, and he worked in wood, argillite, gold, and silver. His work was collected by the anthropologists Franz Boas and John R. Swanton. He is specifically credited for advancing gold and silver engraving in traditional formline design. Family Edenshaw's marriage to Isabella Edenshaw () was part of a long pattern of intermarriage between these two prominent Haida lineages. Together they parented five daughters (in chronological order): Emily (White), Agnus (Yeltatzie), Florence (Davidson), and Nora (Cogo). Through his daughter Emily, Edenshaw is great-grandfather to the contemporary artists Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas, Jim Hart and Lisa Hageman Yahgulanaas and great-great grandfather to many Haida artists. Edenshaw's daughter was the matriarch Florence Davidson, and is great grandfather to internationally renowned artists Robert Davidson, and Reg Davidson, and through Florence, he is grandfather to her daughter, the weaving artist Primrose Adams, great-grandfather to her daughter the weaving artist Isabel Rorick.

Often seen by divers at night in the Pacific Northwest, this cartilaginous fish gets its characteristic name from a pointed rat-like tail. The ratfish lays leathery egg cases on the bottom of muddy or sandy areas, which are often mistaken by divers as something inanimate. While mainly a deep-water species, it occurs at shallower depths in the northern part of its range. The generic name, Hydrolagus, comes from the Greek words ·ΩïŒ¥œâœÅ, meaning water,Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940).

The spotted ratfish is common in much of its range, not typically eaten by humans (the flesh is bland with an unpleasant aftertaste), and not commercially caught. Description left The spotted ratfish has a very distinct appearance compared to unrelated fish species. The female is up to long, much bigger than the male. These fish have a smooth and scaleless skin that is a silvery-bronze color, often with sparkling shades of gold, blue, and green. The speckled white spots along their backs contribute to their name. Dark edges outline both the caudal and dorsal fins, whereas the pectoral fins have a transparent outline. Their pectoral fins are large and triangular, and extend straight out from the sides of their bodies like airplane wings. They have a venomous spine located at the leading edge of their dorsal fin, which is used in defense. It does not present a serious danger to humans, but can cause painful wounds and has been known to kill harbor seals that ate spotted ratfish (caused by the spine penetrating vital tissue in the stomach or esophagus after the ratfish was swallowed).Akmajian, A.M.; Lambourn, D.M.; Lance, M.M.; Raverty, S.; and Gaydos, J.K. (2012). Mortality related to spotted ratfish (Hydrolagus colliei) in Pacific harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in Washington State. J Wildl Dis. 48(4): 1057-1062. doi: 10.7589/2011-12-348. The tail of the ratfish constitutes almost half of its overall length and closely resembles a pointed, rat-like tail. The body of this fish is supported by cartilage rather than bone. It has a duckbill-shaped snout and a rabbit-like face. The mouth is small and contains one pair of forward-directed, incisor-shaped teeth in the bottom jaw and two pairs in the top jaw. Unlike sharks, which have sharp teeth that are easily replaceable, spotted ratfish teeth are plate-shaped, mineralized, and permanent, which assist them in grinding their prey. Like many bony fishes, but unlike its sister group, the Elasmobranchii, the upper jaw of the chimaera is fused with the skull.. [null ‚Üë] Stevens, J.; Last, P.R. (1998).

Hard prey, soft jaws and the ontogeny of feeding mechanics in the spotted ratfish Hydrolagus collie. Journal of the Royal Society Interface 5 (25), 941-953. Although their jaws are soft and mouths are relatively small, they have the largest biting force and jaw leverage found within the Holocephali, which supports their ability to consume large prey. One of their most mesmerizing features is their large, emerald green eyes, which are able to reflect light, similar to the eyes of a cat. Frontal view of the plate-shaped, mineralized, and permanent teeth of H. colliei Lateral view of the generalized features of the skull: The upper jaw is fused to the cranium. Both the upper and lower teeth are plate-shaped (9). Of note, the spotted ratfish does not have a cartilaginous appendage to the frontonasal region (2), which is a common feature of the chimera. Distribution and habitat The spotted ratfish can be found in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, ranging from Alaska to Baja California, with an isolated population in the Gulf of California. They are abundant in much of their range. They be found most commonly off the Pacific Northwest. The range of depths in which this fish is found extends from below sea level, but it is most common between . Spotted ratfish typically live closer to the shore in the northern part of their range than in the southern, but it is also found as shallow as off California. Spotted ratfish tend to move closer to shallow water during the spring and autumn, then to deeper water in summer and winter. For most of the year, they prefer temperatures between , but seasonally they do move into slightly warmer water. They can most commonly be found living near the sea floor in sandy, muddy, or rocky reef environments. Unlike most of its relatives, which are entirely restricted to deep waters, the spotted ratfish has been held in public aquaria. It has also been bred in such aquaria, where two of the main issues are the requirements of low light and low temperature (generally kept at ). Diet The spotted ratfish swims slowly above the seafloor in search of food. Location of food is done by smell. Their usual hunting period is at night, when they move to shallow water to feed. They are particularly drawn to crunchy foods such as crabs and clams. Besides these, the spotted ratfish also feeds on shrimp, worms, small fish, small crustaceans, and sea stars. Species known to prey on the spotted ratfish include soupfin sharks, dogfish sharks, Pacific halibut, pinnipeds, and pigeon guillemots. Reproduction Like some sharks, spotted ratfish are oviparous. Their spawning season peaks during the spring to autumn. During this time, the female releases up to two fertilized eggs into sand or mud areas of the seabed every 10‚Äì14 days. The extrusion process can last 18‚Äì30 hours and the actual laying can last another 4‚Äì6 days. The egg sack is leather-like, long, and has a filament connected to it which is used to attach it to the ocean floor when it is let go by the mother. A female may be seen swimming around her newly laid eggs, in hopes of preventing predators from finding them. Development of the egg can take up to a year, which can be dangerous because the eggs are sometimes mistaken for inanimate objects by divers. When the young finally hatch, they are about in length and grow, reaching in length their first year. The cephalic clasper, or frontal tentaculum, of the spotted ratfish chimaera is shown in color. Male spotted ratfish have multiple secondary sexual characteristics, which include paired pelvic claspers, a single frontal tentaculum, and paired pelvic tentacula. The pelvic claspers are located on the ventral side of the fish. They protrude out from the pelvic fins and are responsible for the movement of sperm to the oviduct of the female. The interior of the pelvic clasper is supported by cartilage and separates into two branches, ultimately ending in a fleshy lobe on the posterior end. The cephalic clasper (tentaculum) is a unique, club-like organ not found in any other vertebrates.Raikow, R. J., & Swierczewski, E. V. (1975). Functional anatomy and sexual dimorphism of the cephalic clasper in the pacific ratfish (Chimaera collei). Journal of Morphology, 145(4), 435-439. doi:10.1002/jmor.1051450404 The cephalic clasper is located on the head of the fish, just anterior to the eyes. The tip of the retractable organ is fleshy and lined with numerous small, sharp barbs. For the male to stay attached during courtship, the clasper has been observed to clamp down on the pectoral fin of the female.limley, A. P., & Oerding, S. (2013). Biology of Sharks and Rays. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.Carrier, J. C., Heithaus, M. R., & Musick, J. A. (2012). Biology of sharks and their relatives. Boca Raton: CRC Press. Additional evidence for this use has been found in the form of scars and scratches on the dorsal sides of females. The significantly smaller body size of males, which is a sexually dimorphic characteristic, may be a contributing factor to this mating behavior. Behaviour The ratfish prefers to maintain a safe distance from divers, and are usually not aggressive. However, if they feel their territory has been invaded, they are able to inflict a mildly toxic wound with their dorsal fin spines. As they swim, they perform barrel rolls and corkscrew turns, as if they are flying. Ratfish swim using large pectoral fins, and this has often been termed aquatic flight given the resemblance to a bird.Foster, K. L. and Higham, T. E. (2010).

Early life Grant was born in Montreal in 1904, the son of Hockey Hall of Fame defenceman Mike Grant, who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1950. The younger Grant tried his hand at amateur hockey in Canada before coming to the United States in the mid-1920s. Career Grant moved to New York City in 1924, and, starting as a hotel night clerk and part-time ice hockey referee, gained a foothold in a career on Wall Street. He worked for Billings, Olcott & Co., E.B. Smith & Co., and, in 1936, Redmond & Co. In 1938 Grant was named a general partner and was, from 1945, a managing director of the brokerage firm Fahnestock & Company. Baseball executive Grant's interest in baseball stemmed from a long-standing friendship with Joan Whitney Payson, who in the 1960s became the Mets' principal owner. Grant was a member of the New York Giants board of directors in the 1950s. He and Payson were the only members of the Giants board who opposed the team's move to San Francisco after the 1957 season. With the Mets, Grant was known for bringing fan favorite and former Brooklyn Dodgers first baseman Gil Hodges back to New York in 1968 to manage the team. Only one year later in 1969, the Mets won their first World Series, beating the Baltimore Orioles, 4 games to 1. The Mets first manager during their first years at the Polo Grounds, former home of the New York Giants was former NY Giants player, Boston Braves and NY Yankees manager, Casey Stengel. After Payson's death, her daughter, Lorinda de Roulet, assumed ownership of the team and delegated a great deal of authority to Grant. However, even with the success of the 1969 Mets, Grant's baseball knowledge was often questioned by lifelong baseball professionals. Whitey Herzog, Director of Player Development for the Mets when they won the 1969 World Series, said that Grant \\"didn't know beans about baseball.\\" Grant opposed Major League Baseball's move to player free agency, a stance that particularly affected the Mets as its cross-town rival, the New York Yankees, aggressively pursued free agents under majority owner George Steinbrenner. Grant is notorious for the contentious contract negotiations and subsequent 1977 trade of future Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver from the Mets to the Cincinnati Reds. The controversy was fully played out on the back pages of New York's tabloid newspapers, with Seaver angrily accusing Grant of planting a negative article mentioning Seaver's wife with New York Daily News sports columnist Dick Young. Seaver's anger at Grant never abated, contending years later that Grant possessed \\"a plantation mentality\\" toward his players. As further evidence of Grant's failure to foresee the future of baseball and the wealth and popularity of its players, Seaver tells how Grant once confronted him astonished that Seaver would have the audacity to apply for membership in the prestigious Greenwich Country Club in Connecticut. The Mets finished in last place two years in a row in 1977 and 1978. At one point, due to the Mets' futility on the field and low attendance records, Shea Stadium was dubbed by fans as \\"Grant's Tomb.\\" Grant was fired at the end of the 1978 season. Later life After his retirement from Wall Street in 1988, Grant managed the Hobe Sound Company real estate investment firm in his new home of Hobe Sound, Florida. Personal life Grant wed Alice Waters in 1932. Grant died in Hobe Sound on November 28, 1998. He was survived by his wife, two sons, a daughter, and nine grandchildren.

The object-based spatial model treats the world as surface littered with recognizable objects (e.g. cities, rivers), which exist independent of their locations. Objects can be simple as polygons and lines, or be more complex to represent cities. While a field-based data model sees the world as a continuous surface over which features (e.g. elevation) vary, using an object-based spatial database, it is easier to store additional attributes with the objects, such as direction, speed, etc. Using these attributes can make it easier to answer queries like \\"find all tanks whose speed is 10 km and oriented to north\\". Or \\"find all enemy tanks in a certain region\\". Storing attributes with objects can provide better result presentation and improved manipulation capabilities in a more efficient way. In a field-based data model, this information is usually stored at different layers and it is harder to extract different information from various layers. This data model can be applied above the ER as in GERM model and GISER. S.Shekhar introduces direction as a spatial object and presents a solution to object-direction-based queries. Data model representation The most common representations for the data model follow. PostGIS An open-source software program that adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL object-relational database. PostGIS follows the Simple Features for SQL specification from the Open Geospatial Consortium. OMT-G Provides a UML representation for geographic applications, it can represent the concept of field, object and provides a way to differentiate between spatial relation and simple association. Entity Relationship GraphDB Represents a framework of objects as classes that are partitioned into three kinds of classes: simple classes, link classes, and path classes. Objects of a simple class are on the one hand just like objects in other models. They have an object type and an object identity and can have attributes whose values are either of a data type (e.g. integer, string) or of an object type (that is, an attribute may contain a reference to another object). So the structure of an object is basically that of a tuple or record. On the other hand, objects of a simple class are nodes of the database graph ‚Äì the whole database can also be viewed as a single graph. Objects of a link class are like objects of a simple class but additionally contain two distinguished references to source and target objects (belonging to simple classes), which makes them edges of the database graph. Finally, an object of a path class is like an object of a simple class, but contains additionally a list of references to node and edge objects which form a path over the database graph. GEIS Represent a data model to store geographic information on top of EER model, GEIS define the input data model and provide the following for data model Geometry. In the GISER model, geometry is an entity that is related to a spatial object by the relationship determines shape of. Additional entities represent the primitives such as points, lines, and polygons as proposed in related models. Topology. Topology is a property belonging to a spatial object and that property remains unaltered even when the object deforms. An example is a road network. The two nodes in the network thus remain connected even if the path between the nodes is changed by road construction. In order to represent the topology, the basic primitives such as networks (i.e., graphs) and partitions are provided. Additional primitives can be added on lines of the Worboy model, This system support representation for stored data. GeoOOA Oracle spatial  Oracle spatial is a component of enterprise Oracle 10g and provides support to stores object such as road on top of the current implentend construction but it used network data model to store geographic data as nodes and links (a graph representation) with each node or links it has a set of attributes. For example, a route object can be added to the database. GRASS GIS It supports raster and some set of vector representation.

The line consisted of Mark Gastineau, Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons and Abdul Salaam. Origins In 1981, a fan by the name of Dan O'Connor submitted the \\"New York Sack Exchange\\" name to a pre-season contest held by The Jet Report, a team magazine. Jets public relations director Frank Ramos used the nickname in a press release and it was soon picked up by the media. All four members of the Sack Exchange were drafted by the Jets in the 1970s. Salaam, a defensive tackle, was drafted in the 7th round (188th overall) by the Jets in 1976. Klecko, a defensive end, was a 6th round pick (144th overall) in 1977. Lyons, a defensive tackle, was a first round pick (14th overall) in 1979, while Gastineau, a defensive end, was selected with the Jets' second round selection in that draft (41st overall). Success In November 1981, Gastineau, Klecko, Salaam and Lyons were invited to ring the ceremonial opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, which served as the inspiration for their nickname. Gastineau and Klecko competed to see which defensive end could record the most sacks. In 1981, the Jets led the league with 66 sacks. The Jets reached the 1982 AFC Championship Game. Salaam was traded after the 1983 season. However, Gastineau, Klecko, and Lyons continued to have success for several years, with Gastineau and Klecko making two more Pro Bowls apiece. Lyons, the last active member of the Sack Exchange, retired after the 1989 season. Legacy The prowess of the New York Sack Exchange, and New York Giants rookie linebacker Lawrence Taylor, caused the NFL to start counting Quarterback sacks as a statistic. Members of the New York Sack Exchange have earned individual honors. The Jets retired Klecko's #73 during a halftime ceremony on December 26, 2004. Lyons was inducted in the College Football Hall of Fame in 2011. Klecko and Joe Fields wrote a book on Klecko's career, including details on his personal relationship with Gastineau. A book that told the story of this era of the Jets, titled Sack Exchange: The Definitive Oral History of the 1980s New York Jets, by author Greg Prato, was released in September 2011 via ECW Press.

The oldest recorded recipe is from Dubrovnik, dating from the fifteenth century.https://www.thefooddictator.com/the-hirshon-croatian-beef-stew- pasticada/; the name is of Venetian origin; there, there are traditional dishes made in similar way with the same name; Dalmatia indeed for long was under Venetian republic. In the Dalmatian village of Veliko Brdo, on the foothills of Biokovo above the coastal town of Makarska, pa≈°ticada is traditionally served to mark the feast day of Sveti Jeronim (Saint Jerome), the village's patron saint on September 30th.

There are two kinds of oncom: red oncom and black oncom. Oncom is closely related to tempeh; both are foods fermented using mold. Usually oncom is made from the by-products from the production of other foods: soy pulp left from making tofu, peanut press cake left after the oil has been pressed out, cassava tailings when extracting the starch (pati singkong), coconut press cake remaining after oil has been pressed out or when coconut milk has been produced. Since oncom production uses by-products to make food, it increases the economic efficiency of food production. Red oncom has been found to reduce the cholesterol levels of rats. Black oncom is made by using Rhizopus oligosporus while red oncom is made by using Neurospora intermedia var. oncomensis. It is the only human food produced from Neurospora. Toxicity Oncom cooked as pepes dish. In the production of oncom, sanitation and hygiene are important to avoid contaminating the culture with bacteria or other fungi like Aspergillus flavus (which produces aflatoxin). Neurospora intermedia var. oncomensis and Rhizopus oligosporus reduce the aflatoxin produced by Aspergillus flavus. However, aflatoxin-producing molds (Aspergillus spp.) are often naturally present on peanut presscake. Furthermore, coconut presscake can harbor the very dangerous Burkholderia gladioli, which produces two highly toxic compounds ‚Äì bongkrek acid and toxoflavin. Shurtleff and Aoyagi address toxicity in their book section on oncom. While it is known that soybeans are the best substrate for growing R. oligosporus to produce tempeh, oncom has not been as thoroughly studied; the best fermentation substrates for producing oncom are not yet known. Cooking methods Nasi tutug oncom, roasted oncom mashed with steamed rice, served with side dishes. Oncom can be prepared and cooked in various ways. It can be simply deep fried as gorengan fritters, seasoned and cooked in a banana leaf pouch as pepes, or roasted, seasoned and mixed with steamed rice as nasi tutug oncom. Oncom is also a selected fillings for comro, lontong and arem-arem rice dumplings.

He competed in distance events, both racewalking and running, at the 1904, 1908 and 1912 Olympics and at the 1906 Intercalated Games. An announcement in the August 6, 1904 issue of The New York Times indicated that the Metropolitan Association of the Amateur Athletic Union would hold a \\"special five-mile race\\" at Celtic Park on August 13, 1904 with the eight top finishers receiving a paid trip to compete in the marathon at the Olympic Games in St. Louis on August 30, 1904. Bonhag, listed as representing the Greater New York Irish Athletic Association, was named as one of 19 \\"probable competitors\\" in the event. At the 1904 Summer Olympics he competed in 800 m running but his result is unknown. At the 1906 Intercalated Games he placed fourth over 5 miles and sixth over 1500 m. Disappointed and highly motivated to make up for his loss he entered the 1500 m walk and won the gold medal. This was the only time he competed in this event, and the first walking race at Olympics. The rules were not clearly set, and many of the nine competitors, including Bonhag, were \\"skipping\\" (i.e. changing to half-running). The first two finishers, Robert Wilkinson and Eugen Spiegler were disqualified for skipping. Two of four judges voted to disqualify Bonhag too, but he was defended by James Sullivan, chief judge of the event, and Prince George, who was president of the jury. A re-walk was set up between Bonhag and Don Linden, who finished fourth. Bonhag did not show up at the re- walk, and for uncertain reasons the jury did not change the race results and gave the gold medal to Bonhag and silver to Linden. Two years later Bonhag was part of the American 3 mile team that won the silver medal. Bonhag also participated in the 3200 m steeplechase event, but was eliminated in the first round. In his fourth Olympics in 1912 he won a team gold medal in the 3000 m race and placed fourth over 5000 m. He also participated in the individual cross country contest. As he was one of three Americans who did not finish the race, his team was unplaced. Bonhag also competed in the exhibition baseball tournament at the 1912 Olympics.

Problem description Disk encryption suites generally operate on data in 512-byte sectors which are individually encrypted and decrypted. These 512-byte sectors alone can use any block cipher mode of operation (typically CBC), but since arbitrary sectors in the middle of the disk need to be accessible individually, they cannot depend on the contents of their preceding/succeeding sectors. Thus, with CBC, each sector has to have its own initialization vector (IV). If these IVs are predictable by an attacker (and the filesystem reliably starts file content at the same offset to the start of each sector, and files are likely to be largely contiguous), then there is a chosen plaintext attack which can reveal the existence of encrypted data. The problem is analogous to that of using block ciphers in the electronic codebook (ECB) mode, but instead of whole blocks, only the first block in different sectors are identical. The problem can be relatively easily eliminated by making the IVs unpredictable with, for example, ESSIV. Alternatively, one can use modes of operation specifically designed for disk encryption (see disk encryption theory). This weakness affected many disk encryption programs, including older versions of BestCrypt as well as the now-deprecated cryptoloop. To carry out the attack, a specially crafted plaintext file is created for encryption in the system under attack, to \\"NOP-out\\" the IV Markus Gattol. \\"Redundancy, the Watermarking Attack and its Countermeasures\\". such that the first ciphertext block in two or more sectors is identical.

Thus, we must choose plaintexts, \\\\scriptstyle P_1,\\\\, P_2 such that \\\\scriptstyle P_1 \\\\,\\\\oplus\\\\, P_2 \\\\;=\\\\; IV_1 \\\\,\\\\oplus\\\\, IV_2.

The aluminum pole had another disadvantage: While taking it aboard a train in Philadelphia, Bragg hit an electrical line and was nearly electrocuted.Bill Livingston, Above and Beyond Part Four, The Plain Dealer While at Villanova University, he won the NCAA pole vault championship in 1955 and was the IC4A champion, both indoors and outdoors, from 1955 to 1957. He also tied for the AAU indoor championship. After graduating in 1957, Bragg again tied for the AAU indoor championship in 1958, then won the event from 1959 through 1961. He was also the AAU outdoor champion in 1959. Nicknamed \\"Tarzan\\" because of his size and strength, Bragg's goal was to play that role in the movies. Few have so actively pursued a role. He toured Europe and Africa for the U.S. Department of State as a goodwill ambassador, climbing trees and swinging from vines. He met Johnny Weissmuller, who agreed that Bragg would be perfect as Tarzan. When he won the gold at the 1960 Olympics he did the infamous Tarzan yell from the podium, shocking the crowd. He was offered the role twice, but was injured and missed both opportunities. His dream went unfulfilled. He later became athletic director at Stockton State College in New Jersey, the owner of a summer camp, and the author of A Chance to Dare: The Don Bragg Story. His time running a summer camp is chronicled in Kamp Olympik by Don and Theresa Bragg, as told to Patricia Doherty. In August 2010, Bragg made a speech in Rome at a ceremony commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the 1960 Summer Olympics. He concluded this speech with his Tarzan yell.\\"Golden Reunion for Don Bragg in Rome\\", Clayton Pioneer, July 23, 2012. Accessed July 28, 2012.

The series' protagonist is Dave King, a Canadian Mountie who always gets his man and who, over the course of the series, is promoted from Corporal to Sergeant. King has appeared in newspaper strips, comics, Big Little Books, and other ancillary items. Zane Grey's son Romer and Slesinger collaborated on many of the stories, and the artwork was produced by Allen Dean, , and Jim Gary in Slesinger's New York studio.

It represents an emerging trend of neo-Darwinian thought in intellectual disciplines beyond those traditionally considered as evolutionary biology: evolutionary psychology, evolutionary anthropology, behavioral ecology, evolutionary developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, affective neuroscience, behavioural genetics, evolutionary epistemology, and other such disciplines.For an overview of evolutionary research in the human sciences, see Human Behavior and Evolution Society History and scope Interest in the relationship between Darwinism and the study of literature began in the nineteenth century, for example, among Italian literary critics. For example, Ugo Angelo Canello argued that literature was the history of the human psyche, and as such, played a part in the struggle for natural selection, while Francesco de Sanctis argued that Emile Zola \\"brought the concepts of natural selection, struggle for existence, adaptation and environment to bear in his novels\\". Modern Darwinian literary studies arose in part as a result of its proponents' dissatisfaction with the poststructuralist and postmodernist philosophies that had come to dominate literary study during the 1970s and 1980s. In particular, the Darwinists took issue with the argument that discourse constructs reality. The Darwinists argue that biologically grounded dispositions constrain and inform discourse. This argument runs counter to what evolutionary psychologists assert is the central idea in the \\"Standard Social Science Model\\": that culture wholly constitutes human values and behaviors.On the conceptual character of poststructuralism, see Terry Eagleton, \\"Post-structuralism\\" in Literary Theory: An Introduction, (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1983); M. H. Abrams, \\"The Transformation of English Studies: 1930-1995\\", Daedalus; and Jonathan Culler, Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1997). For Darwinist critiques of \\"cultural constructivism,\\" see Brian Boyd, \\"Getting It All Wrong\\"; and Joseph Carroll, \\"Pluralism, Poststructuralism, and Evolutionary Theory,\\". Literary Darwinists use concepts from evolutionary biology and the evolutionary human sciences to formulate principles of literary theory and interpret literary texts. They investigate interactions between human nature and the forms of cultural imagination, including literature and its oral antecedents. By \\"human nature\\", they mean a pan-human, genetically transmitted set of dispositions: motives, emotions, features of personality, and forms of cognition. Because the Darwinists concentrate on relations between genetically transmitted dispositions and specific cultural configurations, they often describe their work as \\"biocultural critique\\".For introductory commentaries on evolutionary studies in the humanities, see Harold Fromm, \\"The New Darwinism in the Humanities\\", Hudson Review; D. T. Max, \\"The Literary Darwinists\\", The New York Times; John Whitfield, \\"Literary Darwinism: Textual Selection\\", Nature; Mark Czarnecki, \\"The Other Darwin\\" , Walrus Magazine. Many literary Darwinists aim not just at creating another \\"approach\\" or \\"movement\\" in literary theory; they aim at fundamentally altering the paradigm within which literary study is now conducted. They want to establish a new alignment among the disciplines and ultimately to encompass all other possible approaches to literary study. They rally to Edward O. Wilson's cry for \\"consilience\\" among all the branches of learning. Like Wilson, they envision nature as an integrated set of elements and forces extending in an unbroken chain of material causation from the lowest level of subatomic particles to the highest levels of cultural imagination. And like Wilson, they regard evolutionary biology as the pivotal discipline uniting the hard sciences with the social sciences and the humanities. They believe that humans have evolved in an adaptive relation to their environment. They argue that for humans, as for all other species, evolution has shaped the anatomical, physiological, and neurological characteristics of the species, and they think that human behavior, feeling, and thought are fundamentally shaped by those characteristics. They make it their business to consult evolutionary biology and evolutionary social science in order to determine what those characteristics are, and they bring that information to bear on their understanding of the products of the human imagination.For general statements about the aims of scholars in this field, see Brian Boyd, \\"Literature and Evolution: A Bio-Cultural Approach\\"; Interview with Joseph Carroll, \\"What Is Literary Darwinism?\\"; Jonathan Gottschall, \\"The Tree of Knowledge and Darwinian Literary Study\\"; Maya Lessov, A Filmed Interview with Joseph Carroll, Brian Boyd, and Jonathan Gottschall; and Marcus Nordlund, \\"Consilient Literary Interpretation\\". Evolutionary literary criticism of a minimalist kind consists in identifying basic, common human needs‚Äîsurvival, sex, and status, for instance‚Äîand using those categories to describe the behavior of characters depicted in literary texts. Others pose for themselves a form of criticism involving an overarching interpretive challenge: to construct continuous explanatory sequences linking the highest level of causal evolutionary explanation to the most particular effects in individual works of literature. Within evolutionary biology, the highest level of causal explanation involves adaptation by means of natural selection. Starting from the premise that the human mind has evolved in an adaptive relation to its environment, literary Darwinists undertake to characterize the phenomenal qualities of a literary work (tone, style, theme, and formal organization), locate the work in a cultural context, explain that cultural context as a particular organization of the elements of human nature within a specific set of environmental conditions (including cultural traditions), identify an implied author and an implied reader, examine the responses of actual readers (for instance, other literary critics), describe the socio-cultural, political, and psychological functions the work fulfills, locate those functions in relation to the evolved needs of human nature, and link the work comparatively with other artistic works, using a taxonomy of themes, formal elements, affective elements, and functions derived from a comprehensive model of human nature.For an analysis of the topics and approaches in this field, see Joseph Carroll, \\"Evolutionary Approaches to Literature and Drama\\". For examples of interpretive essays by evolutionary critics, see Brian Boyd, \\"Art and Evolution: Spiegelman's The Narrative Corpse; Brian Boyd, \\"The Art of Literature and the Science of Literature\\" (on Lolita); Brian Boyd, \\"On the Origin of Comics: New York Double-Take\\"; Joseph Carroll, \\"Aestheticism, Homoeroticism, and Christian Guilt in The Picture of Dorian Gray\\"; Joseph Carroll, \\"The Cuckoo's History: Human Nature in Wuthering Heights; Joseph Carroll, \\"Human Nature and Literary Meaning: a Theoretical Model Illustrated with a Critique of Pride and Prejudice\\"; Nancy Easterlin, \\"Hans Christian Andersen's Fish out of Water\\"; Nancy Easterlin, \\"Psychoanalysis and the 'Discipline' of Love'\\" (on Wordsworth); Jonathan Gottschall, \\"Homer's Human Animal: Ritual Combat in the Iliad\\"; Judith Saunders, \\"Evolutionary Biological Issues in Edith Wharton's The Children; and Judith Saunders, \\"Male Reproductive Strategies in Sherwood Anderson's 'The Untold Lie'\\". Contributors to evolutionary studies in literature have included humanists, biologists, and social scientists. Some of the biologists and social scientists have adopted primarily discursive methods for discussing literary subjects, and some of the humanists have adopted the empirical, quantitative methods typical of research in the sciences. Literary scholars and scientists have also collaborated in research that combines the methods typical of work in the humanities with methods typical of work in the sciences.For examples of evolutionary criticism making use of empirical, quantitative methodology, see Carroll, Gottschall, Johnson, and Kruger, \\"Agonistic Structure in Nineteenth-Century British Novels: Doing the Math\\"; Jonathan Gottschall, \\"Greater Emphasis on Female Attractiveness in Homo sapiens: A Revised Solution to an Old Evolutionary Riddle\\"; Jonathan Gottschall, \\"A Modest Manifesto and Testing the Hypotheses of Feminist Fairy Tale Studies\\"; Jonathan Gottschall, \\"Response to Kathleen Ragan's 'What Happened to the Heroines in Folktales?'\\"; Jonathan Gottschall and Marcus Nordlund, \\"Romantic Love: A Literary Universal?\\"; Johnson, Carroll, Gottschall, and Kruger, \\"Hierarchy in the Library: Egalitarian Dynamics in Victorian Novels; and Stiller, Nettle, and Dunbar, \\"The Small World of Shakespeare's Plays\\". Essays by scientists using the discursive methods typical of work in the humanities are included in the collections of essays edited by Boyd, Carroll, and Gottschall; Gottschall and Wilson; Headlam Wells and McFadden; and Martindale, Locher, and Petrov. Adaptive function of literature and the arts The most hotly debated issue in evolutionary literary study concerns the adaptive functions of literature and other arts‚Äîwhether there are any adaptive functions, and if so, what they might be. Proposed functions include transmitting information, including about kin relations, and by providing the audience with a model and rehearsal for how to behave in similar situations that may arise in the future.The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 44 Evolutionary approaches of literature and drama by Joseph Carrol Steven Pinker (How the Mind Works, 1997) suggests that aesthetic responsiveness is merely a side effect of cognitive powers that evolved to fulfill more practical functions, but Pinker also suggests that narratives can provide information for adaptively relevant problems. Geoffrey Miller (The Mating Mind, 2000) argues that artistic productions in the ancestral environment served as forms of sexual display in order to demonstrate fitness and attract mates, similarly to the function of the peacock's tail. Brian Boyd (On the Origin of Stories, 2009) argues that the arts are forms of cognitive \\"play\\" that enhance pattern recognition. In company with Ellen Dissanayake (Art and Intimacy, 2000), Boyd also argues that the arts provide means of creating shared social identity and help create and maintain human bonding. Dissanayake, Joseph Carroll (Literary Darwinism 2004), and Denis Dutton (The Art Instinct, 2009) all argue that the arts help organize the human mind by giving emotionally and aesthetically modulated models of reality. By participating in the simulated life of other people one gains a greater understanding of the motivations of oneself and other people. The idea that the arts function as means of psychological organization subsumes the ideas that the arts provide adaptively relevant information, enable us to consider alternative behavioral scenarios, enhance pattern recognition, and serve as means for creating shared social identity. And of course, the arts can be used for sexual display. In that respect, the arts are like most other human products‚Äîclothing, jewelry, shelter, means of transportation, etc. The hypothesis that the arts help organize the mind is not incompatible with the hypothesis of sexual display, but it subordinates sexual display to a more primary adaptive function.For commentaries on the adaptive (or non-adaptive) functions of the arts, see Brian Boyd, \\"Evolutionary Theories of Art,\\" in The Literary Animal: Evolution and the Nature of Narrative, ed. Jonathan Gottschall and David Sloan Wilson (Evanston, IL: Northwestern UP), 147-76; Joseph Carroll, filmed lecture \\"On the Function of Imagination, at the National Humanities Center, 2007; Joseph Carroll, \\"Adaptationist Literary Study: An Emerging Research Program,\\" Style 42 (2008): 119-28 ; and in the same volume Joseph Carroll, \\"Rejoinder,\\" pp. 349-68 ; Joseph Carroll et al. \\"The Adaptive Function of Literature and the other Arts , Online Colloquium, the National Humanities Center, 2009; Steven Pinker, \\"Toward a Consilient Study of Literature,\\" a review of The Literary Animal, Philosophy and Literature 31 (2007): 162-178;Catherine Salmon and Donald Symons, \\"Slash Fiction and Human Mating Psychology,\\" Journal of Sex Research 41 (2004): 94-100;John Tooby and Leda Cosmides, \\"Does Beauty Build Adapted Minds? Toward an Evolutionary Theory of Aesthetics, Fiction, and the Arts,\\" SubStance 30.1&2 (2001): 6-27; E. O Wilson chapter ten in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge (1998). Hypotheses about formal literary features Some Darwinists have proposed explanations for formal literary features, including genres. Poetic meter has been attributed to a biologically based three-second metric. Gender preferences for pornography and romance novels have been explained by sexual selection. Different genres have been conjectured to correspond to different basic emotions: tragedy corresponding to sadness, fear, and anger; comedy to joy and surprise; and satire to anger, disgust, and contempt. Tragedy has also been associated with status conflict and comedy with mate selection. The satiric dystopian novel has been explained by contrasting universal human needs and oppressive state organization. Distinguishing literary Darwinism Cosmic evolutionism and evolutionary analogism: Literary Theorists who would call themselves \\"literary Darwinists\\" or claim some close alignment with the literary Darwinists share one central idea: that the adapted mind produces literature and that literature reflects the structure and character of the adapted mind. There are at least two other ways of integrating evolution into literary theory: cosmic evolutionism and evolutionary analogism. Cosmic evolutionists identify some universal process of development or progress and identify literary structures as microcosmic versions of that process. Proponents of cosmic evolution include Frederick Turner, Alex Argyros, and Richard Cureton. Evolutionary analogists take the process of Darwinian evolution‚Äîblind variation and selective retention‚Äîas a widely applicable model for all development. The psychologist Donald Campbell advances the idea that all intellectual creativity can be conceived as a form of random variation and selective retention. Rabkin and Simon offer an instance in literary study. They argue that cultural creations \\"evolve in the same way as do biological organisms, that is, as complex adaptive systems that succeed or fail according to their fitness to their environment.\\"E. S. Rabkin, and C. P. Simon, \\"Age, Sex, and Evolution in the Science Fiction Marketplace.\\" Interdisciplinary Literary Studies, 2 (2001): 45-58. Other critics or theorists who have some affiliation with evolutionary biology but who would not identify themselves as literary Darwinists include William Benzon (Beethoven's Anvil) and William Flesch (Comeuppance). Cognitive rhetoric: Practitioners of \\"cognitive rhetoric\\" or cognitive poetics affiliate themselves with certain language-centered areas of cognitive psychology. The chief theorists in this school argue that language is based in metaphors, and they claim that metaphors are themselves rooted in biology or the body, but they do not argue that human nature consists in a highly structured set of motivational and cognitive dispositions that have evolved through an adaptive process regulated by natural selection. Cognitive rhetoricians are generally more anxious than literary Darwinists to associate themselves with postmodern theories of \\"discourse,\\" but some cognitive rhetoricians make gestures toward evolutionary psychology, and some critics closely affiliated with evolutionary psychology have found common ground with the cognitive rhetoricians.See Brian Boyd, \\"Literature and Discovery,\\" Philosophy and Literature, 23 (1999): 313-33; Nancy Easterlin, \\"Romanticism's Gray Matter,\\" Philosophy and Literature 26 (2002): 443-55. The seminal authorities in cognitive rhetoric are the language philosophers Mark Johnson and George Lakoff. The most prominent literary theorist in the field is Mark Turner. Other literary scholars associated with cognitive rhetoric include Mary Thomas Crane, F. Elizabeth Hart, Tony Jackson, Alan Richardson, Ellen Spolsky, Francis Steen, and Lisa Zunshine.On the relations between cognitive rhetoric and literary Darwinism, see Joseph Carroll, \\"An Evolutionary Paradigm for Literary Study,\\" Style 42 (2008): 105-108 ; F. Elizabeth Hart, \\"The epistemology of cognitive literary studies, Philosophy and Literature 25 (2001): 314-34; Alan Richardson and Ellen Spolsky, eds., The Work of Fiction: Cognition, Culture, and Complexity, Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2004. Critical commentaries Some of the commentaries included in the special double issue of Style are critical of literary Darwinism. Other critical commentaries include those of William Benzon, \\"Signposts for a Naturalist Criticism,\\" (Entelechy: Mind & Culture, Fall 2005/Winter 2006); William Deresiewicz, \\"Adaptation: On Literary Darwinism,\\" The Nation June 8, 2009: 26-31; William Flesch, Comeuppance: Costly Signaling, Altruistic Punishment, and Other Biological Components of Fiction, (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 2008); Eugene Goodheart, Darwinian Misadventures in the Humanities, (New Brunswick: NJ: Transaction, 2007); Jonathan Kramnick, \\"Against Literary Darwinism,\\" in Critical Inquiry, Winter 2011; \\"Debating Literary Darwinism,\\" a set of responses to Jonathan Kramnick's essay, along with Kramnick's rejoinder, in Critical Inquiry, Winter 2012; Alan Richardson, \\"Studies in Literature and Cognition: A Field Map,\\" in The Work of Fiction: Cognition, Culture, and Complexity, ed. Alan Richardson and Ellen Spolsky (Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2004 1-29); and Lisa Zunshine, \\"What is Cognitive Cultural Studies?,\\" in Introduction to Cognitive Cultural Studies (Johns Hopkins UP, 2010 1-33). Goodheart and Deresiewicz, adopting a traditional humanist perspective, reject efforts to ground literary study in biology. Richardson disavows the Darwinists' tendency to attack poststructuralism. Richardson and Benzon both align themselves with cognitive science and distinguish that alignment from one with evolutionary psychology. Flesch makes use of evolutionary research on game theory, costly signaling, and altruistic punishment but, like Stephen Jay Gould, professes himself hostile to evolutionary psychology. For a commentary that is sympathetic to evolutionary psychology but skeptical about the possibilities of using it for literary study, see Steven Pinker, \\"Toward a Consilient Study of Literature,\\" a review of The Literary Animal, Philosophy and Literature 31 (2007): 162-178.David Fishelov has argued that the attempt to link Darwinism to literary studies has failed \\"to produce compelling evidence to support some of its basic assumptions (notably that literature is an adaptation)\\" and has called on literary scholars to be more conceptually rigorous when they pursue \\"empirical research into different aspects of literary evolution.\\" David Fishelov, \\"Evolution and Literary Studies: Time to Evolve,\\" Philosophy and Literature, Vol. 41, No. 2 (October 2017): 286. Whitley Kaufman has argued that the Darwinist approach to literature has caused its proponents to misunderstand what is important and great in literature.

Edited collections: The volume edited by Boyd, Carroll, and Gottschall (2010) is an anthology, that is, a selection of essays and book excerpts, most of which had been previously published. Collections of essays that had not, for the most part, been previously published include those edited by Cooke and Turner (1999); Gottschall and Wilson (2005); Headlam Wells and McFadden (2006); Martindale, Locher, and Petrov (2007); Gansel and Vanderbeke;and Hoeg and Larsen (2009). Journals: Much evolutionary literary criticism has been published in the journal Philosophy and Literature. The journal Style has also been an important venue for the Darwinists. Social science journals that have published research on the arts include Evolution and Human Behavior, Evolutionary Psychology, and Human Nature. The first issue of an annual volume The Evolutionary Review: Art, Science, Culture appeared in 2010; the journal ceased publication in 2013. The first issue of a semi-annual journal Evolutionary Studies in Imaginative Culture appeared in spring of 2017. Symposia: A special double-issue of the journal Style (vol. 42, numbers 2/3, summer/fall 2008) was devoted to evolutionary literary theory and criticism, with a target article by Joseph Carroll (\\"An Evolutionary Paradigm for Literary Study\\"), responses by 35 scholars and scientists, and a rejoinder by Carroll. Also, a special evolutionary issue of the journal Politics and Culture contains 32 essays, including contributions to a symposium on the question \\"How is culture biological?\\", which includes six primary essays along with responses and rejoinders. Discussion groups: Online forums for news and discussion include the Biopoetics listserv, the Facebook group for Evolutionary Narratology, and the Facebook homepage for The Evolutionary Review. Researchers with similar interests can also be located on Academia.edu by searching for people who have a research interest in Evolutionary Literary Criticism and Theory / Biopoetics or in Literary Darwinism or Evolutionary Literary Theory.

History  Kaundinya is a region to which elephants have returned after 200 years. In the last decade, elephants have been migrating more than ever before, looking for habitable forests. From 1983 to 1986, a sizable number of elephants began their journey from the forests of Anekal-Hosur in Tamil Nadu and Bannerghatta in Karnataka to seek alternative homes in other regions. Thirty-nine of the elephants moved to the forests of Andhra Pradesh, a state which had no elephants before. This led to the government setting up the sanctuary in December 1990. Today it is home to about 72 elephants  Geography  The habitat of Kaundinya sanctuary is rugged with high hills and deep valleys. The sanctuary has dry deciduous forests with thorny scrubs interspersed with trees. These forests have small ponds, tanks and the Kaindinya and Kaigal tributaries of Palar River. The sanctuary is situated in region where the Kolar Plateau ends and slopes down into the plains of Tamil Nadu creating many valleys and ghats.

The falls are located 10 kilometres from Palamaner. Kaigal Water Falls Kaigal Waterfalls is a waterfall located to the west of Palamaner in the Chittoor district of India in the Koudinya Wildlife Sanctuary. The falls are located 28 kilometres from Palamaner and 10 km from vkota, it lies between palamaner and kuppam national highway.  Flora and fauna  The sanctuary is covered by southern tropical dry deciduous and thorn forests. Some of the important flora consists of Albizia amara, Acacia, Lagerstroemia, Ficus, bamboo, and a species which is a regeneration of Santalum album. The sanctuary is primarily an elephant reserve and is home to about 78 Indian elephants. The vulnearble yellow-throated bulbul is present in the sanctuary. Apart from Indian elephant], some of the animals found in the sanctuary are: sloth bear, panther, cheetal, chowsingha, sambar, porcupine, wild boar, jungle cat, jackal, jungle fowl, starred tortoise and slender loris. Threats and conservation issues The threats faced in the sanctuary are man-animal conflict, over-grazing, illegal collection of wood. Insufficient fodder in the forest due to over-grazing by livestock, and availability of crops like sugarcane, sorghum and ragi attracts elephants, resulting in man-animal conflict. Till 2002, 42 people have been killed by elephants, and 12 elephants have been electrocuted to death by local population. Kalyani Dam in Chamala Valley, a part of Sri Venkateswara National Park, is a good habitat for elephants. A corridor for elephants is being planned between Koundinya Wildlife Sanctuary and Sri Venkateswara National Park under Project Elephant.

The southern terminus is at US 222 in Cumru Township. Its northern terminus is at US 222 in Ontelaunee Township. The route begins at the US 222 freeway and heads through the southwestern suburbs of Reading as Lancaster Avenue, intersecting Pennsylvania Route 724 (PA 724) in Shillington. US 222 Bus. continues into Reading on Lancaster Avenue and intersects the northern termini of PA 625 and PA 10 before reaching an interchange with the US 422 freeway. The business route crosses the Schuylkill River and becomes Bingaman Street. US 222 Bus. turns north on 5th Street and intersects US 422 Bus. in downtown Reading and the southern terminus of PA 61 to the north of downtown. The route interchanges with the PA 12 freeway and continues north through suburban Muhlenberg Township as 5th Street Highway. US 222 Bus. reaches Temple and continues northeast to its northern terminus as Allentown Pike. US 222 Bus. is the only auxiliary route of US 222 in Pennsylvania. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the road between Reading and Lancaster was designated US 222 while the road between Reading and Allentown was part of US 22, which ran along what was designated the William Penn Highway in 1916 and PA 3 in 1924. In the late 1920s, US 222 briefly ran concurrent with PA 41 and PA 240 at different times. PA 42 originally ran north‚Äìsouth through Reading starting in 1927. By 1930, the concurrent state route designations were removed from US 222 and US 22. US 222 entered Reading along with PA 73 along Lancaster Avenue and Bingaman Street before turning north on 9th Street along with PA 83 to end at US 22 and US 422 at Penn Street. US 22 continued north on 9th Street out of Reading and continued along Kutztown Road through Temple toward Allentown. US 120 began at US 222 at Bingaman Street and headed north on 4th Street and Center Street out of Reading. In 1931, US 22 was moved to a more direct alignment between Harrisburg and Allentown, and US 222 was extended north along the former alignment between Reading and Allentown. US 222 was shifted to use Lancaster Avenue, Bingaman Street, and 5th Street and 5th Street Highway through the Reading area in the 1930s, running concurrent with US 122 through downtown Reading. The US 122 overlap was removed in 1963 and the PA 73 concurrency was removed by 1966. In 1975, US 222 was rerouted to bypass Reading on the West Shore Bypass and the Warren Street Bypass, with the former alignment through the city becoming US 222 Bus. In 1998, US 222 Bus. was extended north to its current terminus following the rerouting of US 222 to a new outer bypass of Reading. The business route was extended south to its current endpoint in 2004 with the completion of the US 222 freeway south of Reading to Mohnton. Route description US 222 Bus. northbound approaching split with PA 724 in Shillington. Overhead signage still refers to the former US 222 designation.

US 222 Bus. reaches its northern terminus at a trumpet interchange with the end of the US 222 freeway bypass of Reading, at which point Allentown Pike continues north as US 222. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, the route heading southwest out of Reading toward Lancaster was legislated as Legislative Route 148 while the route heading from Reading northeast toward Allentown was legislated as Legislative Route 157. In 1916, the road between Reading and Allentown became a part of the William Penn Highway, an auto trail that ran from Pittsburgh to New York City. In 1924, the William Penn Highway was designated as PA 3 with the establishment of the first state route numbers in Pennsylvania. With the establishment of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the route heading from Reading southwest to Lancaster was designated as US 222 while the route heading from Reading to Allentown along the William Penn Highway was designated as part of US 22, which ran concurrent with PA 3. In 1927, PA 41 was designated concurrent with US 222 between Lancaster and Reading and PA 42 ran north‚Äìsouth through downtown Reading. A year later, the concurrent PA 41 designation along US 222 between Lancaster and Reading was replaced with PA 240. In addition, PA 73 ran concurrent with US 222/PA 240 between New Holland Avenue, where it split south, and downtown Reading. By 1930, the concurrent PA 240 designation was removed from US 222 while the concurrent PA 3 designation was removed from US 22. At this time, US 222 entered Reading on Lancaster Avenue, where it became concurrent with PA 73 at New Holland Avenue and intersected the northern terminus of PA 42 at Morgantown Road. US 222/PA 73 crossed the Schuylkill River on Bingaman Street and intersected the southern terminus of US 120, which headed north on 4th Street and Center Street, and continued northeast to intersect PA 83 at 9th Street. Here, PA 73 continued northeast on Bingaman Street and US 222 turned north concurrent with PA 83 on 9th Street to reach its northern terminus at US 22 and US 422 at Penn Street. At this intersection, PA 83 turned west along with US 22 on Penn Street and US 22 continued north along 9th Street out of Reading, where it continued north through South Temple and Temple on Kutztown Road. In 1931, plans were made to reroute US 22 and the William Penn Highway to a more direct alignment between Harrisburg and Allentown by way of PA 43. As a result of the rerouting of US 22, the road between Harrisburg and Reading would become a western extension of US 422 while the road between Reading and Allentown would become a northern extension of US 222. The changes were approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials on June 8, 1931. Signs were changed to reflect the new designations on May 31, 1932, with the new route designations officially in place on June 1, 1932. In the 1930s, US 222 was shifted to follow 5th Street north through Reading and 5th Street Highway through Muhlenberg Township. US 122 replaced the PA 42 designation south of Reading and the US 120 designation north of Reading and was routed to run concurrent with US 222 on Lancaster Avenue, Bingaman Street, and 5th Street between Morgantown Road and Center Street. In 1963, the US 122 concurrency was removed from US 222 in Reading as part of the elimination of US 122. By 1966, the PA 73 concurrency was removed from US 222 through Reading. US 222 was split into a one-way pair along 5th Street northbound and 4th Street southbound between Laurel and Chestnut streets. On November 15, 1975, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved rerouting US 222 to bypass downtown Reading to the west along the limited-access West Shore Bypass (where it ran concurrent with US 422) and the Warren Street Bypass. As a result, US 222 Bus. was designated onto the former alignment of US 222 between US 222/US 422 (West Shore Bypass) and US 222 (Warren Street Bypass). In October 1998, the Park Road Corridor was completed, and US 222 was rerouted to follow a new freeway alignment from the Warren Street Bypass northwest to Van Reed Road, where it turned northeast along what was called to the \\"Road to Nowhere\\" to end at its original alignment in Ontelanuee Township. As a result, US 222 Bus. was extended north from the Warren Street Bypass, which had been redesignated PA 12, to the north end of the US 222 freeway in Ontelanuee Township in December of that year. In 2004, the US 222 freeway was extended south from PA 724 to Grings Hill Road in Mohnton, and US 222 was rerouted south from Wyomissing along the Warren Street Bypass and the new freeway. As a result, US 222 Bus. was extended south from US 422 (West Shore Bypass) to its current southern terminus.

Football While in college as a star on the Lafayette team, he was named to the final Walter Camp All-America football team as an end in 1924. In 1925‚Äì26 he starred for the Pottsville Maroons of the NFL, leading the league in scoring in 1925 with 74 points. During the 1925 NFL season, the Maroons played a game against the top college football team, a group of All-Stars from the University of Notre Dame. This team featured the famed Four Horsemen as was seen the best team in the country. At the time college football was seen as consisting of superior talent over the professionals. The hard-fought contest was decided in the last minute of the game. Down a point, Berry kicked a 30-yard field goal to upset college's best team 9‚Äì7.http://www.explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1012 The Maroons' victory over the Irish ensured that the NFL now had the credibility to exist on equal standing with college football. Unfortunately, the game resulted in the Maroons being stripped of their NFL title due to a disputed rules violation. Baseball Berry started his major league career with ten games for the Philadelphia Athletics in but didn't return to the majors until after his football career ended, playing for Portland and Dallas minor league teams in 1926‚Äì27. He also played for the Boston Red Sox (1928‚Äì32), Chicago White Sox (1932‚Äì33) and again with the Athletics (1934‚Äì36). He became an Athletics coach under manager Connie Mack from 1936 to 1940, making his last playing appearance in . A right-handed hitter, he posted a .267 batting average with 23 home runs and 256 runs batted in in 709 major league games. At Mack's suggestion, he managed the Wilmington Blue Rocks (of which Mack was vice president) for the last half of the 1940 season, finishing second in the Interstate League, but was discouraged by Mack from pursuing his goal of a managing career due to the high turnover rate in the profession. In addition to his brief managing career, Berry was the football coach at Grove City College for five seasons in the 1930s. Official Following his playing and coaching career, Berry became an umpire in the American League from 1942 through 1962. He officiated in five World Series (1946, 1950, 1954, 1958, 1962) and five All-Star Games (1944, 1948, 1952, 1956, second 1959 game), calling balls and strikes for the first half of the 1948 and 1956 games. He was the third base umpire for the one-game playoff to decide the AL pennant, and after becoming a league umpiring supervisor returned to the field for the first game of the 1970 American League Championship Series during an umpires' strike, working the outfield. On July 1, 1951, he was behind the plate when Bob Feller became the first pitcher to throw three the no-hitters in the AL; Berry later worked the bases for four more no-hitters. At the same time, he was a head linesman for the NFL for 24 seasons, officiating in 12 championship games including the renowned \\"Sudden Death\\" championship game between the Baltimore Colts and New York Giants in 1958. In fact, he is the only man to have officiated the World Series, the NFL Championship and the College All- Star game in one year. He credited his success as an official to his attention to the rules, noting, \\"Every morning, right after I got up, I would open the rule book and read. I'd open the book at random and start reading a few pages. I did the same thing when I was in the NFL.\\" While admitting his own general ignorance of the rules when he had been playing, he added, \\"All during my umpiring and officiating career I was astounded by the number of players who had only a casual acquaintance with the rules. And it caused a lot of needless trouble on the field.\\" Bill Haller, who worked as an AL umpire from 1961 to 1982, recalled that Berry was his boyhood hero and inspiration to pursue umpiring, even though growing up in Lockport, Illinois he never met him in his youth: \\"Berry went to school with the father of my best friend, Jack Ernst. I was about 11 years old and I heard so much from Mr. Ernst about Berry. I used to umpire the kid games around the neighborhood and later on I umpired the semi-pro games around Lockport.\\" After retiring from umpiring in 1962, Berry also worked as an observer of NFL officials. He died of a heart attack at his son-in-law's home in Evanston, Illinois at the age of 69, after suffering a stroke three months earlier. He was interred in Belvidere Cemetery in Belvidere, New Jersey.The Baseball Necrology He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980.

It is a major anniversary celebrated by not only the Sinhalese people but by most Sri Lankans. The timing of the Sinhala New Year coincides with the new year celebrations of many traditional calendars of South and Southeast Asia. The festival has close semblance to the Tamil New year and other South and Southeast Asian New Years. It is a public holiday in Sri Lanka. It is generally celebrated on 13 April or 14 April and traditionally begins at the sighting of the new moon.http://www.worktheworld.com.au/blog/new-years-festival-sri- lankahttp://www.island.lk/2004/04/13/featur03.html According to Sinhalese astrology, New Year begins when the sun moves from Meena Rashiya (the house of Pisces) to Mesha Rashiya (the house of Aries). It also marks the end of the harvest season and of spring. History Cultural anthropological history of the 'Traditional New Year' which is celebrated in the month of April, goes back to an ancient period in Sri Lankan history. People think that the celebration of the new year is the change of thoughts too. Various beliefs, perhaps those associated with the fertility of the harvest, gave birth to many rituals, customs, and ceremonies connected with the New Year. The advent of Buddhism in the 3rd century BC led to a re-interpretation of the existing New Year activities in the Buddhism light. The majority of the people in the country are Buddhists, and as such, the Buddhistic outlook was predominant in transforming the New Year rites to what they are now. Hinduism, on the other hand, existed side by side with Buddhism, in medieval times. New Year practices interpreted in the Hinduism way developed among the Hindus. Buddhism and Hinduism were historically connected with each other. Their philosophies were running along parallel dimensions, except for certain ultimate truths concerning the self, the way to achieve emancipation and the nature of a creative god (which Buddhism denies) and nirvana. There was no serious contradiction in New Year rituals that are found among the Buddhists and Hindus. The mythological backdrop of the New Year is probably based on Hindu literature. The Prince of Peace called Indradeva descends upon the earth to ensure peace and happiness. He comes in a white carriage wearing on his head a white floral crown seven cubits high. He first dips, like a returning space capsule plunges, breaking earth's gravity, into a \`Kiri Sayura' or sea of milk. Modern-day activities related to the celebration of the traditional New Year is based on auspicious times given by the astrologers. The New Year celebration, therefore, can be thought as a complex mix of Indigenous, Astrological, Hindu, and Buddhist traditions. Celebrations Yak Erabadu is associated with the advent of the New Year|alt=|left Kokis are a popular snack eaten during the New Year Konda Kavum another dish eaten during the New Year The month of Bak, which represents prosperity in the Sinhalese calendar (or in the month of April according to the Gregorian calendar), is when the sun moves (in an astrological sense) from the Meena Rashiya (House of Pisces) to the Mesha Rashiya (House of Aries) in the celestial sphere; Sri Lankan people of Sri Lanka begin celebrating Sinhala New Year or Aluth Avurudu (in Sinhala). It marks the end of the harvest season and also coincides with one of two instances when the sun is directly above Sri Lanka. However, unlike the celebration of the new Gregorian calendar year at midnight on 31 December, the Sinhalese traditional New Year begins at a time determined by astrological calculations. Also unlike 31st night celebrations, where an old year ends at midnight and new year begins immediately afterwards; the ending of the old year, and the beginning of the new year occur several hours apart from one another (this span of time is usually 12 hours and 48 minutes, which starts when the sun, as a disk, starts to cross the astrological boundary between 'House of Pisces' and 'House of Aries' and ends when the crossing is complete. The halfway point is considered as the dawn of the new year). This period is, referred to as the Nonagathe (or the 'neutral period' or 'Auspicious Time' ). During this time Sri Lankans are, according to tradition, encouraged to refrain from material pursuits, and engage solely in either religious activities or traditional games. Cultural rituals begin shortly after the beginning of the Sinhalese New Year, with the cleaning of the house and lighting of an oil lamp. In some communities, women congregate to play upon the Raban (a type of a drum) to announce the incipient change in the year. Families carry out a variety of rituals, the exact timings of which are determined by astrological calculations - from lighting the fire to making the Kiribath (milk rice) to entering into the first business transaction and eating the first morsels. The rituals vary slightly based on the locale. However, the core of the celebrations remains the same. The approach of each auspicious time for various rituals is heralded by the unmistakable sign of very loud firecrackers. Although loud firecrackers are an environmental concern, and a safety hazard, especially for children, this remains an integral part of the celebrations throughout Sri Lanka. Once the important rituals are done, the partying begins as families mingle in the streets, homes are thrown open and children are let out to play. The ubiquitous plantain is dished out alongside celebratory feasts of Kavum (small oil cake) and Kokis (crisp and light sweetmeat, originally from the Netherlands). However, the extent of outdoor activities depends largely on the neighbourhood. The suburban communities tend to have such social gatherings than urban or city dwellers. The blossoming of the flowers of the Yak Erabadu is associated with the advent of the Sinhalese New Year. Aluth Aurudu is an important national holiday for both the cultures of the Sinhalese people and the Tamil people of Sri Lanka. The celebrations are given wide coverage and patronage from state- owned media as well as private media. Harvest Festival The date upon which the Sinhalese New Year occurred, while determined by astrological calculations, also tends to coincide with one of the paddy harvest seasons. For farming communities, the traditional new year is a festival of harvest as well. Cuckoo bird A type of cuckoo bird, the Asian koel, has a strong association with the new year celebrations in traditional literature around the festival period. The mating season of the bird roughly coincides with the festival season. The mating call of the male is regarded as a heralding sign of the traditional new year. This bird is known as the Koha (‡∂ö‡∑ú‡∑Ñ‡∑è) in Sri Lanka by the Sinhala language. The melodious call Koo-ooo of the male bird is heard throughout Sri Lanka during the breeding season of the bird that roughly spans from March to August.

Tura is a singer, musician (he plays the piano, guitar, drums, accordion and harmonica), composer and songwriter. He is married to Jenny Swinnen, with whom he has a son David (born 16 October 1974) and a daughter Sandy Tura (born 21 November 1975). Career Tura started singing when he was only nine years old, covering Gilbert B√©caud and Nat King Cole. Tura's first producer was Jacques Kluger, and later his son Jean Kluger. Will Tura's first hit was Eenzaam zonder jou (Eng, Lonely without you) in 1963, for which he wrote the melody, and Ke Riema the text. In a newspaper survey, the song got elected the biggest hit in Flanders ever, and it has a place in the Eregallerij (an honorary gallery of the Flemish song, an initiative of Belgian copyright collective SABAM and radio station Radio 2) since the first edition in 2000. Many hits followed in various musical styles, including rock 'n roll, gospel, country and rap (Moa vent toch, from 1992, in the West Flemish dialect). In 1984 he made a tribute album to Elvis Presley, together with Elvis' band. In 1992 he also released his first Tura in Symfonie, performing with a symphonic orchestra. In 1987 Will records the album Ouvertura, together with the London Symphony Orchestra and Robert Groslot. In 2002 one of Tura's dreams came true, recording an album entitled De Mooiste Droom (Eng, the most beautiful dream) with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1988 Will had a car accident, and the song Mooi, 't leven is mooi (Eng, Beautiful, life is beautiful) about it becomes a megahit in Flanders, and becomes the most frequently played song of 1989 according to SABAM, with Clouseau's Anne in second place. In 1990, various rock 'n roll artists from Flanders created Turalura, a tribute album for the artist. In 2005, Tura's 65th birthday was celebrated elaborately in the Flemish media, along with the release of the cd Viva Tura. In 1993 Tura sang Ik mis je zo (Eng, I miss you so) and Hoop doet leven (Eng, Hope gives life) at the ceremony for the deceased King Baudouin of Belgium. In 2014 he reprised \\"Hoop doet leven\\" at the funeral of Queen Fabiola. At the engagement party of Prince Philippe and Princess Mathilde in 1999 he gave a mini-recital.

The state highway runs from U.S. Route 17 Business (US 17 Business) in Chesapeake north to SR 337 in Norfolk. SR 165 is a C-shaped route that connects Chesapeake and Norfolk in the Hampton Roads metropolitan area indirectly via Virginia Beach. The highway's east-west segment connects the Chesapeake communities of Deep Creek and Great Bridge with the Princess Anne part of Virginia Beach. SR 165's northwest-southeast portion connects the Princess Anne area with Virginia Beach's Salem and Kempsville communities and with Norfolk. Within Norfolk, the state highway parallels Interstate 64 (I-64) while passing through the eastern and northern areas of the city near Norfolk International Airport and Naval Station Norfolk. Much of SR 165 is a multi- lane divided highway, but there are significant two-lane stretches in all three of the independent cities the highway serves. Route description View north along SR 165 near SR 149 in Virginia Beach Chesapeake and Virginia Beach SR 165 begins at an intersection with US 17 Business (George Washington Highway) next to the business route's crossing of the Dismal Swamp Canal in the Deep Creek section of the independent city of Chesapeake. The state highway heads east as Moses Grandy Trail, which begins as a two-lane road but expands to a four-lane divided highway one block east of US 17 Business. SR 165 heads east through a forested area and crosses New Mill Creek before intersecting the eastern end of its old alignment, Cedar Road. The state highway's name changes to Cedar Road at its intersection with US 17 (Dominion Boulevard). SR 165 continues east through a densely populated suburban area toward the Great Bridge area of Chesapeake. Just west of the Chesapeake municipal complex, the state highway reduces to three lanes--two lanes heading east and one lane toward the west--for the last segment of the highway east to SR 168 Business (Battlefield Boulevard), a five-lane road with center turn lane. After a short concurrency with SR 168 Business, SR 165 turns east onto Mt. Pleasant Road, which is a four-lane divided highway until just east of its partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 168 (Great Bridge Bypass). The state highway reduces to two lanes and crosses a creek and has a grade crossing of the Chesapeake and Albemarle Railroad. East of Centerville Turnpike, SR 165 enters a rural area in which it passes to the north of Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Fentress. The state highway curves north through a swamp, within which the highway enters the city of Virginia Beach by crossing the Chesapeake and Albemarle Canal at its eastern end at the North Landing River. SR 165 heads northeast through farmland to the Virginia Beach municipal center in the Princess Anne area of Virginia Beach, within which the highway meets the western end of SR 149 (Princess Anne Road), which heads northeast toward the Virginia Beach Oceanfront. SR 165 continues northwest on two-lane Princess Anne Road through a rural area. The state highway enters a suburban area with scattered farmland and expands to an eight-lane divided highway just east of Dam Neck Road, which leads to the Virginia Beach Sportsplex and Veterans United Home Loans Amphitheater. SR 165 continues past the Virginia Beach campus of Tidewater Community College and passes through the Salem area of the city, where the highway intersects Independence Boulevard and Lynnhaven Parkway. A short distance west of Lynnhaven Parkway, two lanes in each direction split off to the west as Ferrell Parkway at a partial interchange; the missing movements are made via Salem Road. SR 165 continues northwest as a four-lane divided highway to the Kempsville are of Virginia Beach. There, the state highway intersects SR 190, which heads south as Kempsville Road and north as Witchduck Road. Norfolk SR 165 crosses the upper reaches of the Eastern Branch Elizabeth River before entering the city of Norfolk at its intersection with SR 403 (Newtown Road), which connects SR 165 with I-64 (Hampton Roads Beltway) and I-264 (Virginia Beach Expressway) and provides access to the Newtown Road station of Hampton Roads Transit's Tide Light Rail. The state highway continues north as Kempsville Road, which passes under I-264 just east of its interchange with I-64. SR 165 reduces to two lanes between its intersection with US 58 (Virginia Beach Boulevard) and its underpass of I-64. SR 165 crosses Lake Taylor and turns west onto six-lane Northampton Boulevard for a brief concurrency with US 13 and SR 166. At the next intersection with Military Highway, SR 166 continues west as Princess Anne Road toward Downtown Norfolk, US 13 turns south onto Military Highway toward Chesapeake, and SR 165 turns north onto Military Highway toward Naval Station Norfolk. SR 165 has a grade crossing of a rail line just south of another underpass of I-64 and intersection with Robin Hood Road, where the highway becomes a five-lane road with center turn lane. Robin Hood Road is used for ramps with westbound I-64; there is also a direct ramp from eastbound I-64 to southbound SR 165 and a ramp from eastbound I-64 to Robin Hood Road. Robin Hood Road and the next two major streets SR 165 intersects, SR 192 (Azalea Garden Road) and SR 247 (Norview Avenue), are used to reach Norfolk International Airport to the east. North of the airport area, SR 165 follows Military Highway to its conclusion at SR 170 (Little Creek Road). SR 170 heads east toward Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek; SR 165 turns west onto Little Creek Road, another five-lane road. Just to the west, the state highway intersects SR 194 (Chesapeake Boulevard). SR 165 becomes a divided highway again at Sewells Point Road, just east of its single-point urban interchange with SR 168 (Tidewater Drive). In the Wards Corner area of Norfolk, the state highway has a partial interchange with I-64 that allows access to points to and from the direction of Virginia Beach. SR 165 becomes a four-lane undivided highway at its grade crossing of Norfolk Southern Railway's rail line to Sewell's Point. West of the rail crossing, the state highway intersects US 460 (Granby Street), which to the north provides access to westbound I-64 and I-564 (Admiral Taussig Boulevard), the main highway onto Naval Station Norfolk. SR 165 continues west through a densely populated residential area to its northern terminus at SR 337 (Hampton Boulevard) south of Naval Station Norfolk and Norfolk International Terminal.

A bale wrapper is a farm implement for wrapping bales in plastic, for them to turn into silage. Bale wrappers come in three main forms - Turntable type, Satellite type and In-line Type. Satellite Bale Wrapper A Satellite Bale Wrapper usually consists of hydraulic driven bale supporting rollers and a Hydraulic driven rotating satellite arm which carries the plastic film roll and Dispensing unit. The rotation of the support rollers and the satellite arm are synchronized so that an even cover of plastic film is applied to the bale as the wrapping process takes place. High speed satellite wrappers have two rotating satellite arms which effectively halves the time taken to wrap a bale. TurnTable Bale Wrapper The wrapper has a loading arm, much like a bale handler, at the side, that scoops up a bale and places it on the wrapping table. The wrapping table usually consists of two rollers, and four belts which slowly spin the bales while the table itself revolves. As the bale turns, plastic film is pulled through the dispensing unit and wrapped tightly on the bale. When the table has revolved at least 16 times, the bale can be ejected. This is done by a hydraulic ram which tilts the wrapping table, so that the bale can be tipped off. The film is cut and then tied to the wrapper for the next bale. All this is controlled via a computer inside the cab of the tractor. In-Line Bale Wrapper Best suited for high volume producers the In- Line Wrapper places bales in neat rows along fields and yards. The bale is placed on the wrappers saddle or table and is driven forward by a push ram allowing the producers to consecutively wrap each bale into one long tube. This also allows for producers to save time and money in the process, by eliminating the need for an extra working hand and save on plastic wrap costs.

It launched on 3 July 2012 as Heat and was originally based on the magazine of the same name. The channel replaced Q. The channel featured daily celebrity gossip show Heat's Huge News, as well as a 60-minute programme rounding up weeks stories, titled Heat's Huge Week of News, which was produced by ITN. In addition, ITN Productions co-produced celebrity documentary series Real Stories with Box Television. Heat also featured The Heat-Ometer, its pick of the 20 biggest music videos narrated by Heat editor, Lucie Cave. Box Upfront broadcast current and future mainstream pop music videos 24/7. On 2 April 2013, all Box Television channels went free- to-air on satellite, apart from 4Music which went free-to-view. As a result, the channels were removed from the Sky EPG in Ireland. However, Heat launched on Freesat on 29 April 2013, alongside Magic, following the addition of four other Box Television channels on 15 April. On 25 May 2016, the channel was rebranded as Box Upfront. On 1 November 2019, the channel temporarily rebranded as a Christmas music channel called BoXmas, a role also occupied by sister channel Magic (albeit not temporarily rebranded). As the impending shutdown was announced during the rebrand, the channel kept the BoXmas branding, but shifted to a playlist similar to Box Hits on 26 December.

Biography Born in Blackville, South Carolina, Sease started as a gospel artist, joining a gospel group called the Five Gospel Crowns, located in Charleston, South Carolina. After singing with them, Sease then left at age 20 for New York City. At this young age settling into New York, he then joined another gospel group called the Gospel Crowns. Having a preference for the musical style of R&B;, Sease left the gospel circuit to form his own R&B; group. In this group Sease was accompanied by his own three brothers, and named the backing band Naglfar. This band did not find popularity and eventually broke up. He did not quit performing musically, but began to cover songs that started a career with a recurring gig at the Brooklyn club, Casablanca. In 1986, he recorded a self-titled album, featuring one of his more popular songs, \\"Ghetto Man\\". This started his professional career with his fans in the South's circuit of bars, blues festivals, and juke joints. While promoting his self produced and publicized debut album, he entered a recording contract with Polygram. With this contract, he was able to launch his music nationally with the re-release of his self-titled LP on Mercury Records in 1987. This updated release of his previous material also included the new ten-minute track \\"Candy Licker\\", which became an instant success for Sease through the South.Chitlin' Circuit , Memphis Magazine (July 1, 2006) Success had finally come to Sease without the help of airplay, which deemed his sound too explicit for the audience.Blues: Good for the soul, The Dallas Morning News (February 7, 2007) (\\"Marvin Sease's raunchy yet soulful lyrics made him popular on Southern soul circuits\\") Sease's success with \\"Candy Licker\\" ensured a strong female-based following. He was said to have a comparable sound to Johnnie Taylor and Tyrone Davis, but without the commercial success. Over the next decade Sease released several more records for Mercury and Jive Records. His only nationally charting hit, \\"Tonight\\", reached # 86 on the US Billboard R&B; chart in 1991. Sease died of complications from pneumonia in Vicksburg, Mississippi, on February 8, 2011, eight days before his 65th birthday.Blues singer Marvin Sease dies at 64 (February 8, 2011).

After beginning his career in Italy in 1872, Talbot performed Italian opera in England in 1877‚Äì1878 with Mapleson's Italian Opera company. He was then engaged by Richard D'Oyly Carte in 1879 to originate the role of Frederic. After his critical disaster in the role, Talbot toured unsuccessfully with several American opera companies, settling in California in 1881, where he became a successful voice teacher. Life and career Early life and career Born at Portobello Barracks near Dublin to Edward Brennan and his wife Margaret, Talbot was the fifth of six siblings. He and his family moved to London by 1851, where he was reportedly a choirboy as a youth and later clerked for a lawyer. An amateur tenor by 1868, Talbot sang with such groups as the Moray Minstrels.G√§nzl, Kurt. \\"'Frederick save us...'. The tale of 'Ugo Talbo'\\", Kurt of Gerolstein, 20 April 2018 By 1872, Talbot travelled to Italy to study music, where he began to perform under the name Signor Ugo Talbo in 1872, appearing in Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto,Stone, David. \\"Hugh Talbot\\", Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, November 30, 2005 as the title character in Faust and as Alvaro in La Forza del destino, among other roles, and in concerts until at about 1876. He returned to Britain in 1877 and became a principal tenor at Her Majesty's Theatre with Mapleson's Italian Opera company. Still performing as Ugo Talbo, he first sang the Duke in Rigoletto. While The Times review praised him generally, it commented that he still had much to learn. The Era, however, called him \\"a new tenor of considerable merit. ... He has an excellent voice, of good compass, and sympathetic in quality. It is brilliant and effective especially in the upper portion. ... Signor Talbo has, besides, a good stage presence and his acting is characterised by earnestness.\\" He also played the title role in Faust opposite Christina Nilsson. By the end of the season, The Musical Times stated that Talbot \\"has gradually worn out the welcome accorded to him on his debut\\". In August that year, he embarked on a two month long concert tour in Scandinavia. After Christmas, Talbot rejoined the Mapleson company as Fabrizio in L'Ombre by Friedrich von Flotow, earning another warm review from The Era. He subsequently toured in 1878 with Mapleson as Carlo in Linda di Chamonix, but afterwards he was seen only in a few concerts with the company and in a few concerts elsewhere. D'Oyly Carte experience In the autumn of 1879, Richard D'Oyly Carte sent one of his theatrical companies to play the first authorized production H.M.S. Pinafore in America, and the company also prepared for the opening of the next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, The Pirates of Penzance, for its premi√®re in New York. Pinafore opened at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York City on December 1, 1879, and Talbot was cast in the leading tenor role of Ralph Rackstraw. The opening night review of Pinafore in The New York Times commented , \\"The Ralph Rackstraw, Mr. Hugh Talbot, has a light, pleasant tenor voice, which was not thoroughly under his control last evening, and he is also the best actor who has appeared here in the character\\".The New York Times, December 2, 1879 On 31 December 1879, he created the role of Frederic in The Pirates of Penzance. Talbot's Frederic was perhaps the most roundly criticized performance of any Gilbert and Sullivan opera's opening night. Nearly every critic eviscerated him in reviews. The New York Times reviewer wrote: > The essential part of the young pirate apprentice received inadequate > attention from the tenor. His make-up resulted in his appearing, in the > first act, to be of advanced age; he was not, apparently, acquainted with > his lines, and his singing was weak and tame. But the others were so > spirited and generally enthusiastic that the effect of the opera was not > materially injured by this weak spot in the cast.Allen, p. 106 The World was not much kinder: \\"Mr. Talbot sang some of the airs allotted to the tenor admirably, but he was utterly innocent of any appreciation whatever of the humor of the situations and shamefully ignorant of his lines.\\" The Herald added: \\"The members of the company were not all perfect in their parts, Mr. Talbot seriously interfering with the full effect of some good points by groping after his cue in a most vague manner.\\" Unkindest of all was the Sun, whose critic said: \\"Mr. Talbot, the tenor, had unfortunately apparently not thought it necessary to commit his lines, and made nonsense of much of his role, reflecting no credit upon himself, and nearly bringing the play at times into confusion\\". Similar sentiments were reflected in the Mirror, the Tribune, and The Hour. Sullivan, for his part, was equally displeased, writing to his mother on January 2, 1880: \\"Our Company and all the Chorus are charming people and devoted to us, and spared themselves no pains or trouble to do their work thoroughly well. All except the Tenor, who is an idiot ‚Äì vain and empty- headed. He very nearly upset the piece on the first night as he didn't know his words, and forgot his music. We shall, I think, have to get rid of him\\". Talbot remained with the company in New York until March 6, 1880, when he left the company following an argument with Gilbert.Stedman, p. 174 In the interim, he had briefly travelled to Philadelphia to play Frederic for the opening of Carte's Second American Company. He apparently played at some additional performances in March and April in Boston and New York. W. S. Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther noted, \\"The Sorcerer, H.M.S. Pinafore and The Pirates of Penzance are bound together by their tenor heroes. But Gilbert had problems with his tenors ‚Äì George Bentham ... and Hugh Talbot. ... It is not surprising, therefore, to see that in the next two operas [Patience and Iolanthe] the tenor roles are much smaller and less significant\\".Crowther, p. 118 After D'Oyly Carte After leaving D'Oyly Carte, Talbot appeared on tour with Tagliapietra's Opera Company in the US in such operas as Il Trovatore, Faust and Martha. He next joined the Blanche Roosevelt English Opera Company as Epitmethius in an unsuccessful production of B. C. Stephenson and Alfred Cellier's The Masque of Pandora in Boston in 1881. Again performing as Signor Ugo Talbo, he then joined an opera company, organized by Max Strakosch Clarence Hess, for a few weeks, in Faust and Mefistofele. After this, in August 1881, he moved to San Francisco, California, where he joined Inez Fabbri's opera company in Carmen and La Dame blanche, but the season was a failure. Nevertheless, Talbot lived for the rest of his life in California, singing in concerts and becoming a successful singing teacher. Talbot died in Stockton, California, in 1899.

States that there were \\"13 arbitration judges\\", not 14. At midnight on January 22, 2002 the Press Ministry pulled TV-6 off the air. The frequency was temporarily filled with programming from the NTV Plus Sports satellite channel. The auction for TV-6's old frequency took place on March 27, 2002. The Media-Sotsium partnership won the frequency auction, becoming the licensee and broadcaster, with the employees of the former channel TV-6 forming much of the production staff. On June 1, 2002 TVS began broadcasting. On July 22, 2002 the Moscow Arbitration Court ruled that MNVK was taken off the air unlawfully. Editorial policy Many Russians and foreigners consider TVS' editorial policy to be critical towards the government of Vladimir Putin and Mikhail Kasyanov. It was considered to be the last channel with completely independent editorial policy. Closure Suffering from low ratings (the main channel projects, Dengi series and reality show Za steklom 3: Teper ty v armii failed) and poor advertising revenue,Leonid Parfyonov's Namedni: 2003 summing up TVS had many financial problems. TVS's debt to Vneshekonombank (the Bank for Foreign Economic Activity) came to about US$100 million. TVS also owed more than $6 million in back pay to employees, who had not been paid for some three months. Mostelekom (the city-owned cable operator that carried TVS in Moscow) began switching TVS' signal off Moscow's cable television networks on June 2, 2003, which rendered more than 90% of Moscow residents unable to view it. Mostelekom demanded that the TV company's shareholders pay off arrears of RUB 245,672m ($8 million). On June 17, 2003 TVS editor-in-chief Evgeny Kiselyov announced that lack of funding had made it impossible for the company to continue operating, and that after June 23 the channel suspended broadcasting. Stating it was \\"for viewers' benefit\\" the Ministry of Press switched off all TVS broadcasts on June 22, 2003 ‚Äì 24 hours before the shutdown planned by station management was to happen. Like the closure of TV-6 the year before, the regularly scheduled programming was suddenly interrupted by a brief announcement that the channel was \\"taken off the air\\" before switching to a testcard.\\"Farewell! We are taken off the air\\" It was widely speculated in the press that such a hurried closure was performed to prevent the final broadcast of Evgeny Kiselyov's \\"Itogi\\" show, the only remaining opposition political broadcast at the time.

Theater Leaving New Orleans at the age of 16, she attended the Semple School. Yale University student Jock Whitney took her to the Richman Club where vocalist Helen Morgan heard her singing and encouraged her to attend auditions being conducted by Florenz Ziegfeld. Beginning with Have a Heart (1917). Fears performed in ten Broadway productions, including the Ziegfeld Follies of 1925. In Ziegfeld's No Foolin (1926) she appeared with Edna Leedom and the Yacht Club Boys plus a chorus line with Paulette Goddard, Susan Fleming, Clare Luce and Baby Vogt. By 1932, with Child of Manhattan (written by Preston Sturges), Fears became a Broadway producer. Her only motion picture appearance is the role of Gaby Aimee in The Lottery Lover (1935). In 1971, Louise Brooks, a former lover to Fears by her own account, wrote for Sight & Sound about meeting Peggy Fears and W.C. Fields in 1925: :The fifth floor dressing-room lost its exclusive atmosphere when Peggy Fears, who had also transferred from Louie the 14th to the Follies, decided to become my best friend. She was a darling girl, with a sweet singing voice, from Dallas, Texas. Her smooth chestnut-coloured hair was untouched by dyes or permanent waves. Instead of the expensive gowns of a Follies girl, she wore schoolgirl sweaters and skirts. Perhaps it was her whimsical sense of fun that attracted her to me. And what could be more fun than Peggy, the most popular girl in the show, becoming friends with its most abominated member-- me? One night she crashed our dressing-room carrying a Wedgwood teapot full of corn whiskey and, knowing my literary pretensions, two disgustingly vulgar magazines, Broadway Brevities and the Police Gazette. A week later we were living together in the Gladstone Hotel off Park Avenue, where swarmed Peggy's friends until September when she went on tour with the Follies and I went into The American Venus at Paramount's Long Island studio. :It was through Peggy Fears that I came to know Bill Fields. Before the matin√©e, at the Rosary Florist, she would select a bouquet to be wrapped in waxed paper and presented to Bill in his dressing-room. It touched his heart. Bill adored beautiful girls, but few were invited to his dressing-room. He was morbidly sensitive about the skin disease which inflamed his nose and sometimes erupted on his hands, making it necessary for him to learn to juggle wearing gloves. After several devastating experiences with beautiful girls he had decided to restrict his choice of girl friends to those less attractive whom he would not find adrift with saxophone players. :Bill entertained Peggy and me with distinction. His bar was an open wardrobe trunk fitted with shelves, planted, as if it were an objet d'art, beside his chair. While Shorty, the silent dwarf who was his valet and assistant on the stage, went about preparing our drinks, Peggy and I would dance around Bill who sat at his make-up shelf, listening to our nonsense with gracious attention. Marriages and relationships On June 19, 1927, she married Alfred Cleveland Blumenthal. As Broadway producers during the early 1930s, they co-produced Music in the Air, written by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II. The show had a run of 342 performances in 1932-33. Blumenthal earned $15 million during the first three years of their marriage. Fears purchased five Rolls-Royce autos and a $65,000 chinchilla coat, retaining only $300 in her bank account. The couple fought and split up. Eventually, they reunited and renewed their vows during three different marriage ceremonies. In 1950 Fears and Blumenthal separated permanently. Fears entertained in night clubs, and Blumenthal lived in Mexico. Although she had been married, Fears is described by those who knew her as having been bisexual or lesbian, primarily preferring the company of women in her private life. According to actress Louise Brooks, she and Fears were involved with one another, but Brooks never allowed herself to let the affair develop into a serious relationship. Death of mother In 1938, her mother was found dead from gas asphyxiation. Real estate Fears built Fire Island Pines, New York's original Yacht Club. Part of the construction was a cinderblock hotel which still stands today. She invested $10,000 and bought an inlet on Great South Bay. In 1959, she paid off the last of her debt on her property. It was then valued at $350,000. While a resident of Fire Island, she had a stormy romantic relationship with Tedi Thurman, famed in the 1950s as the sexy voice of Miss Monitor on NBC's Monitor. Thurman was interviewed about her life with Fears for Crayton Robey's documentary film, When Ocean Meets Sky (2003), which features Sara Ramirez as the voice of Peggy Fears.When Ocean Meets Sky In 1966 she sold out her interest to John B. Whyte. Fears died August 24, 1994 at the age of 91 in La Crescenta-Montrose, California. See also * List of caricatures at Sardi's restaurant References Sources * Brooks, Louise. Lulu in Hollywood.

The target chamber area is at the far wall (upper left). Argus was a two-beam high power infrared neodymium doped silica glass laser with a output aperture built at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 1976 for the study of inertial confinement fusion. Argus advanced the study of laser-target interaction and paved the way for the construction of its successor, the 20 beam Shiva laser. It was known from some of the earlier experiments in ICF that when large laser systems amplified their beams beyond a certain point (typically around the gigawatt level), nonlinear optical effects would begin to appear due to the very intense nature of the light. The most serious effect among these was \\"Kerr lensing\\", where, because the beam is so intense, that during its passage through either air or glass the electric field of the light actually alters the index of refraction of the material and causes the beam at the most intense points to \\"self focus\\" down to filament like structures of extremely high intensity. When a beam collapses into extremely high intensity filaments like this, it can easily exceed the optical damage threshold of laser glass and other optics, severely damaging them by creating pits, cracks and grey tracks through the glass. These effects became so severe after just the first few amplification stages of early lasers, that it was seen as essentially impossible to exceed the gigawatt level for ICF lasers without destroying the laser itself after just a few shots. In order to improve the quality of the amplified beams, LLNL had started experimenting with the use of spatial filters in the single-beam Cyclops laser, built the previous year. The basic idea was to extend the laser device into a very long \\"beamline\\", over which any imperfections that accumulated in the beam would be successively removed after every amplification stage. A series of tubes with lenses on either end would focus the light down to a point (the focal point) where it would pass through a pinhole which would reject stray unfocused light, smoothing the beam and eliminating the high intensity spots which would have otherwise been further amplified causing damage to down-beam optics. The technique was so successful on Argus it was often referred to as being \\"the savior of laser ICF\\". After the success of Cyclops in beam smoothing, the next step was to further increase the energy and power in the resulting beams. Argus used a series of five groups of amplifiers and spatial filters arranged along the beamlines, each one boosting power until it reached a total of about 1 kilojoule and 1-2 terawatts per beam. These intensities would have been impossible to achieve without the use of spatial filtering. Argus was designed primarily to characterize large laser beamlines and laser-target interactions, there was no attempt to actually achieve the fusion ignition state in the device as this was understood to be impossible at the energies Argus was capable of delivering. Argus however, was used to further explore higher yields of the so-called \\"exploding pusher\\" type targets and to develop x-ray diagnostic cameras to view the hot plasma in such targets, a technique crucial to characterization of target performance on later ICF lasers. Argus was capable of producing a total of about 4 terawatts of power in short pulses of up to about 100 picoseconds, or about 2 terawatts of power in a longer 1 nanosecond pulse (~2 kilojoules) on a 100 micrometer diameter fusion fuel capsule target. It became the first laser to perform experiments using X-rays produced by irradiating a hohlraum. The reduced production of hard X-ray energy via the production of hot electrons while using frequency doubled and tripled laser light (as opposed to the infrared light directly produced by the laser itself) was first noticed on Argus. This technique would also be later validated in the direct drive mode (at both the LLE and Novette laser) and subsequently used to enhance laser energy to target plasma coupling efficiency in experiments on nearly all subsequent laser inertial confinement devices. Argus was shut down and dismantled in September 1981. Maximum fusion yield for target implosions on Argus was about 109 neutrons per shot.

His father made him Duke of Alsace in 867. Hugh's name was not a Carolingian royal name, but it was common among the Etichonid family of Alsace, his mother's relatives. His name suggests that his father did not originally intend him to succeed him as king, but instead to rule in Alsace, where his maternal relatives were prominent. After Lothair repudiated his wife, Teutberga, shortly after their marriage in 855, he sought to have his relationship with Waldrada and his children with her, including Hugh, legitimized.Hans J. Hummer, Politics and Power in Early Medieval Europe: Alsace and the Frankish Realm, 600‚Äì1000 (Cambridge, 2006), pp. 171‚Äì72. In December 861, Hugh was probably recognized as legitimate by uncle, King Charles of Provence, and great uncle, King Louis of East Francia. The three royal families all signed the memorial book of the abbey of Remiremont as equals at that time. By 863, however, Lothair's request for a divorce had led to strong opposition from the church and an international crisis. It was in this situation that Lothair gave his son the duchy of Alsace during a stay at the court of Louis of East Francia. At his request, Louis then took both his kingdom and his son Hugh under East Frankish protection.Hummer, Politics and Power, pp. 174‚Äì76. When his cousin Louis the Stammerer, king of West Francia, died in 879, he seized authority in Lotharingia west of the Rhine and the Annales Fuldenses accuse him of \\"playing the tyrant in Gaul.\\"T. Reuter (ed.), The Annals of Fulda (Manchester, 1992). It is likely that he refused to recognise the succession of Louis's young sons, Louis III and Carloman, to the West Frankish kingdom, as with Boso in Provence. He had a sizable following in Lotharingia, but Louis the Younger, son of Louis the German, came to the defence of the young Louis and Carloman. In 880, he sent men against Hugh's castle at Verdun and defeated his army, burning down the fortress. After his Easter court (23 April) in 882, Louis the Younger enfeoffed Hugh with Alsace, but the latter rebelled and Louis chased him in Burgundy. In 883, Hugh murdered Bernarius, Count of Charpeigne, the second husband of Friderada (widow of Engelram, Chamberlain to Charles the Bald), and married her as her third husband. He also murdered his guardian Wipert of Nantes, son of Lampert III of Nantes, as both Bernarius and Wipert opposed his ambitions. Also in 883, Hugh's sister Gisela married Godfrey, the Viking leader ruling in Frisia. With this alliance, Hugh plotted to seize his father's old kingdom, but in 885, Charles the Fat heard of the scheme and called both Hugh and Godfrey to court, where the former was blinded and the latter killed. Hugh was sent first to Sankt Gallen, then to Fulda, and finally to Pr√ºm in his own country. Notes Further *E. Dummler, Geschichte des ostfr√§nkischen Reiches (Leipzig, 1887‚Äì88) *E.

History Early years The track and right of way was bought from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1982 when the B&O; discontinued operations on the old Northern Subdivision between Foxburg and Kane.Burns 1999, p. 5. This line was a part of the old Pittsburgh and Western Railroad, originally a narrow-gauge line created in the latter third of the 19th century from a merging of various earlier narrow-gauge lines.Burns 1999, p. 2. When the segment of the B&O; from Foxburg to Knox was taken out of service, shipping raw materials, mostly glassmaking sand, to Knox Glass became difficult. To ease this situation, a connection with the Conrail (originally the New York Central Railroad) line through Shippenville was put in place. The B&O; and NYC crossed each other not too far west of Shippenville for many years, but there had never been provision for interchange between the two roads. Operations in to Knox, which had been the original southern terminus of the K&K;, were discontinued around the time the only real customer in Knox, the Knox glass bottle company, ceased operations. This ended the use of the Shippenville interchange. After the Knox segment was embargoed, the southern terminus became what was known as North Clarion Junction, where there was a fibreboard plant and a wye, the tail track of which had been the P&W;'s line across to the east side of the Clarion River to the borough of Clarion (county seat of Clarion County). This branch was discontinued at around the time the B&O; purchased the P&W.; The bridge over the Clarion River needed replacement and the railroad requested that the town help with funding the project. Clarion's town fathers declined this honor, so the railroad cut back service to the west side of the river, which was eventually abandoned as well. At one time, the K&K; derived some revenue from shipping out car loadings of coal from what had once been an extensive coal mining complex in and around the village of Lucinda, a few miles north of North Clarion Junction. During the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s, under B&O; ownership, coal loadings from this area were quite extensive. A conductor's report from one northbound freight train (Foxburg to Kane) in the early 1960s showed in excess of fifty loads of coal shipped north out of Lucinda, most of it bound for ports on the Great Lakes. The last coal shipper on the line, Zacheryl Coal, went bankrupt not too many years after the K&K; acquired the line, which materially reduced shipping over the line, and thus reduced income. Tourist The K&K; also operated a tourist railroad operation over the segment of the line from Kane to Marienville (originally the site of another of the Knox Glass Bottle Company's plants), and back to Kane. A portion of the Erie Railroad was purchased so that the tourist trains could cross the Kinzua Bridge. A Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works-built 2-8-2 steam locomotive 58 was acquired to power the tourist trains. 58 was built as SY1658 in 1989. It was imported new to the Knox and Kane, (one of only six steam engines imported from China after the end of steam in the States). The K&K; had a much older 2-8-0 steam locomotive, Knox & Kane 38, built by Baldwin for the Huntington and Broad Top Mountain Railway 38 had not run since the 1980s, but was under restoration to be returned to steam. A new tender tank had been built. As the B&O; never saw a need to turn locomotives at Marienville, there was no wye or turntable in that community. So the K&K; built a turn table there, specifically to turn its steam locomotive. There was also a four bay roundhouse built in Marienville. Today, the roundhouse is in a considerable amount of disrepair, with three of the four tracks having been removed. The coaches used on the Knox & Kane were mostly an old type of Long Island Rail Road commuter cars. They were called Ping-Pong cars as they had round windows on the ends and being commuter cars going back and forth they resembled a ping pong ball going back and forth across the ping pong table. This type of car had been dubbed ping pong cars because of their tendency to rock and bounce all over, even when new on well maintained track. The cars were also notorious for rusting, making maintenance one these cars a constant chore. This collection of old and new equipment made for one of the more distinctive tourist train operations in the country, although it was often overlooked because of its remote location. Final years In the spring of 2006, the K&K; ceased both freight and tourist service. One reason was that freight shipments over the line had declined seriously over the years. An additional reason the line was abandoned as a tourist operation was that the main attraction of the ride was a trip over the Kinzua Bridge. The viaduct was extensively damaged by a tornado in 2003. When the State of Pennsylvania, which owns the viaduct, could not afford to repair it, the railroad lost its major tourist draw. In another devastating blow, on early Sunday March 16, 2008 the locomotives used to carry sightseers across the Kinzua Bridge were severely damaged by a fire set by arsonists. The fire, which burned the Biddle Street building used to house the trains in Kane, Pennsylvania caused $1 million in damage. This further dampened the dream of reopening the railroad. End of the line On October 10 and 11, 2008, the K&K;'s rolling stock was auctioned off as part of a liquidation sale. The Kovalchick Corporation (which also owned the East Broad Top Railroad) bought the property. According to an article published in the Bradford Era newspaper immediately following the auction, the Kovalchicks reportedly had \\"little interest in resuming tourist rides along the rails.\\" In the spring of 2010, Kovalchick removed the rail crossings between Clarion and McKean counties. The section between the Bridge State Park and Center St. and Peterson St. (Mount Jewett) is now the Knox Kane Rail Trail.

He was a prominent member of the business and political elite of Vancouver, British Columbia from the 1920s until his death in 1971. He was a newspaper publisher, a Liberal MLA from 1924‚Äì1928, co-founder of the Non-Partisan Association in 1937, temperance advocate, one of the first directors on the board of governors that oversaw the new Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and a Canadian ambassador. He fought in the Second Boer War, World War I and World War II.http://www.library.ubc.ca/spcoll/AZ/inventories/rescolo.html Odlum family fonds at the University of British Columbia Early life Odlum was born in Cobourg, Ontario, the son of Edward Odlum (1850‚Äì1935), a historian and supporter of British Israelism. (A small street in Vancouver is named after the senior Odlum). When Victor was 6, his family moved to Japan for four years before moving to Vancouver, British Columbia in 1889. At age 19, Odlum fought in the Boer War with The Royal Canadian Regiment; upon his return, he became a newspaperman, serving as a reporter and then editor-in-chief of the Daily World. By the time he was 25, he was editor of the Vancouver World. First World War With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Odlum received a commission as major of the 7th Battalion of the First Canadian Division of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, second-in-command under Lieutenant-Colonel William Hart-McHarg. Second Battle of Ypres Odlum's battalion moved into the front lines in April 1915, and only days later was subjected to the first gas attacks on the Western Front that heralded the Second Battle of Ypres. Odlum showed great personal bravery during the battle. On a reconnaissance with Hart-McHarg, the two suddenly came under heavy small arms fire from a concealed group of Germans. They took cover in a shell-hole, Hart-McHarg seriously wounded. Realizing Hart-McHarg needed immediate medical attention, Odlum left the safety of the shell hole and zig-zagged up a hill under heavy fire in order to locate a medical officer. Despite Odlum's bravery, Hart- McHarg's wound proved fatal, and Odlum was subsequently promoted to command of the 7th Battalion, reporting to Brigadier-General Arthur Currie, commander of the 2nd Brigade. Odlum's battalion was almost immediately transferred to the 3rd Brigade under Brigadier-General Richard Turner and moved to the vicinity of St. Julien. The next day, the entire 3rd Brigade came under intense attack. After repulsing several attacks, Odlum's battalion desperately needed reinforcements and ammunition, but calls and messages to Turner's headquarters went unheeded. An ammunition party composed of Odlum's brother Joseph and several others attempted to resupply the front-line trenches; Odlum, from his command post, watched with shock as a shell landed in the midst of the party, killing his brother and several others.Cassar 2010, p. 170 Odlum eventually was forced to withdraw his brigade before it was completely overwhelmed, but organized the withdrawal so well that his men suffered minimal losses. Remainder of the war Brigadier General Odlum (3rd from left) beside a Renault FT light tank, 1918 Odlum's abilities under fire were noted by General Arthur Currie, and Odlum was promoted regularly, eventually attaining the rank of Brigadier General by the end of the war. He often was in the front lines with his men, personally led several attacks with pistol drawn, and was wounded three times during the war. Because he was a strict teetotaller, he insisted on non-alcoholic substitutes for his troops' traditional daily rum ration, earning him the derisive nicknames \\"Pea Soup Odlum\\" and \\"Old Lime Juice\\". In 1917, Odlum and fellow officer David Watson helped their commanding officer Arthur Currie avoid charges of embezzlement by loaning Currie enough money to repay a large sum he had borrowed from regimental funds before the war. Prominent citizen of Vancouver After the war Odlum returned to Vancouver, where he became a prominent financier, founding the investment firm Odlum BrownOdlum Brown Limited in 1923 with Colonel Albert \\"Buster\\" Brown. Odlum and fellow soldiers of his old 7th Battalion erected a memorial tablet in Christ Church, Vancouver, to perpetuate the memory of their original commanding officer, William Hart-McHarg, killed during the Second Battle of Ypres.Cassar 2010, p 136 Odlum also served as a member of the Provincial Legislature from 1924‚Äì1928. At the same time, he returned to the world of journalism, becoming the owner of the Vancouver Daily Star. As with his rivals in the business at the time, Odlum used the paper to aggressively promote his views and advance his pet political causes, such as the temperance movement, as well as descending to sensationalist yellow journalism to boost circulation. In 1924, his paper stirred up anti-Chinese fervour by suggesting a Chinese houseboy employed by a posh Shaughnessy neighbourhood couple had murdered a Scottish nursemaid, Janet Smith, employed in the same household. Although the evidence instead suggested that the nursemaid had been accidentally killed by one of her employers during a domestic dispute, Odlum's paper suggested the Chinese houseboy, Wong Foon Sing, who had discovered the body, was the guilty party. Wong was subsequently kidnapped by vigilantes and tortured to elicit a confession; upon being freed, he was charged by police, but eventually released due to a total lack of evidence against him. Odlum was virulently anti-Bolshevik and anti-union, and shut down the Star rather than give in to his employees, who had unionized and refused to accept a pay cut. During the 1930s, he helped coordinate and train Special Constables hired to break a strike on Vancouver's waterfront. After the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was formed in 1936, Odlum served on its board of governors until the outbreak of World War II. Soldier turned diplomat Although Odlum had left the Canadian Army in 1919 and had also resigned his commission in the militia in 1924, with the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he lobbied the government for a position in the expanding Canadian Army. Eventually, through the efforts of his friend Ian Mackenzie, who was in the federal cabinet of William Lyon Mackenzie King, Odlum was promoted over several Permanent Force officers to the rank of Major General and command of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. However, instead of preparing his forces for modern warfare, Odlum devoted much time to \\"extraneous matters\\" such as regimental brass bands and arm patches. Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (the professional head of the British Army), thought him a \\"political general\\", and was prompted to write to General Andrew McNaughton that Odlum was \\"too old...too set...to adapt his ideas\\" for the war. In order to remove him from command, Odlum was appointed the High Commissioner to Australia from 1941 to 1942, and from 1942 to 1946, he was the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to China. In 1947, he was appointed Canada's first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Turkey, where he served until 1952. Personal Odlum was a zealous reader, and in 1963, he donated his collection of 10,000 books to the library at the University of British Columbia. His son, Major Victor E.C. Odlum studied at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario in 1923, student # 1713, and served in the Royal Canadian Engineers during the Second World War.

Call To Action's goals are to change church teachings in such areas as mandatory celibacy for priests, the male-only priesthood, the selection process for bishops and popes, and opposition to artificial contraception. The organisation has from its beginning inspired considerable controversy within the Catholic Church in the United States. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re of the Congregation for Bishops said in 2006 that some of CTA's views are \\"in contrast\\" with the Catholic faith. The Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska has placed the group under the ban of excommunication within the diocese, and several other bishops have censured the organization.  History  In 1971, Pope Paul VI wrote that the laity of the Catholic Church should \\"take up as their own proper task the renewal of the temporal order\\". He further wrote that, \\"it is to all Christians that we address a fresh and insistent call to action.\\"Pope Paul VI. 'Octogesima Adveniens, ¬ß48 In anticipation of the American bi-centennial, the bishops of the United States held a \\"Call to Action Conference\\" in Detroit, Michigan in 1976. At the conclusion of the three-day conference, the 1,340 delegates voted that the Catholic Church should \\"reevaluate its positions on issues like celibacy for priests, the male-only clergy, homosexuality, birth control, and the involvement of every level of the church in important decisions,\\" though they never explicitly proposed changing the Church's position on these issues. Extract of page 249 Russell Shaw describes the conference as \\"a raucous, controversial, non-representative dud.\\" Many bishops were unhappy with the results. As a result, the Call to Action organization that was born out of the Detroit conference was run by laity. Based in Chicago, it takes its name from the original conference. A conference of over 400 people was held in October 1978, and Chicago Call To Action was launched as a local organization.  Controversies involving Call to Action   Ideological aspects  Call To Action's goals include 1) women's ordination, 2) an end to mandatory priestly celibacy, 3) changes in the church's teaching on a variety of sexual matters including artificial contraception, and 4) the selection process for bishops and popes. In ‚ÄúCatholic Social Activism ‚Äì Real or Rad/Chic?‚Äù, Father Andrew Greeley saw the old social- justice action in labor schools, worker priests, and community organizing that ‚Äúmastered the politics of coalition building with the system.‚Äù On the other hand, the ‚Äúnew‚Äù Catholic action came out of the Berrigan brothers' experience during the Vietnam war and the peace movement, and was thus involved in confrontation and protest. Call to Action, it would seem represents that \\"new\\", tradition.\\"Andrew Greeley, \\"Catholic Social Activism: Real or Rad/Chic?\\" The National Catholic Reporter February 7, 1975. This approach, however, is opposed by many Catholic groups.c.f. George A. Kelly, The Battle for the American Church (Doubleday, 1979), and Joseph Bottum, \\"When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano\\", First Things, October 2006, pp. 30-31 \\"Call to Holiness\\", held its first conference in 1996 to oppose a conference organized by Call to Action.  Reactions from the Catholic hierarchy and theologians  Catholic church leaders have also criticized Call to Action, primarily because they believe that the moral and juridical positions of the organization run counter to the teachings of the Catholic Church. Some, however, have given public support. At the 1995 Call to Action conference, for example, the former Bishop of √âvreux now titular bishop of Partenia, Jacques Gaillot, popularly nicknamed The Red Cleric;Reuters.French Against Vatican Sacking of \\"Red Cleric\\" 17 January 1995 the auxiliary Bishop of Detroit Thomas Gumbleton, and theologian Hans K√ºng (whose authority to teach theology in a Catholic institution was rescinded), were among the featured speakers. Other theologians, such as Charles Curran and Benedictine Sister Joan Chittister are also supporters of the organization. In recent years, Bishop Gumbleton (now retired) has been the only member of the U.S. Catholic hierarchy to publicly support Call to Action. When Call to Action sponsored a speech by Gumbleton in Tucson, Arizona in February 2007, the Bishop of Tucson, Gerald F. Kicanas, refused permission for it to be delivered on diocesan property.Arizona Daily Star, Jan. 30, 2007, online at  Excommunications in Lincoln, Nebraska  Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz of the Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska issued, under certain conditions, an automatic interdict (which escalates after one month to an automatic excommunication) on members of several organizations within his diocese, including Call to Action.Statement issued by Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz (published in Southern Nebraska Register, March 22, 1996 The excommunications did not apply beyond the Diocese.

In the early 1900s Lieutenant Commander Huse was stationed in the Philippines, where he commanded the gunboat . This was followed by nearly five years at the Naval Academy as, among other things, instructor of mathematics. Midshipman Harry Huse, U.S. Naval Academy photo Promoted to the rank of Commander in 1907, Huse was commanding officer of the monitor and later of the supply ship . After his next promotion, to Captain late in 1909, he was Captain of the Yard at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, commanded the battleship and, in 1914-1915, was Chief of Staff to Rear Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher. He attended the Naval War College, graduating in 1915. Huse reached the rank of Rear Admiral in mid-1916, while at the War College. He held Navy Department positions through the World War I years, followed in 1919 by command of the Atlantic Training Fleet. From late 1919 to early 1921 he served abroad, initially as senior U.S. Navy representative on the Inter-Allied Naval Armistice Commission and the Naval Inter-Allied Commission of Control, then as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in European Waters, with the temporary rank of Vice Admiral. After returning to the United States he was Commandant of the Third Naval District, headquartered at New York City, and as a member of the Navy's General Board. Rear Admiral Huse left active duty in December 1922, later receiving the retirement rank of Vice Admiral. Huse was a Washington, D.C., resident for the rest of his life. He co-authored a book on genealogy entitled The Descendants of Abel Huse of Newbury (1602‚Äì1690), published in 1935. Harry Huse died at Bethesda Naval Hospital, in suburban Maryland, on May 14, 1942. He is buried with his wife, Mary Sheward Whitelock, in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington County, Virginia. Medal of Honor citation As a result of his conduct during the landings at Vera Cruz, Mexico, in April 1914, Captain Huse was awarded the Medal of Honor. His official Medal of Honor citation reads: His first name was given as Henry on the citation. Citation: :For distinguished conduct in battle, engagements of Vera Cruz, 21 and 22 April 1914. Under fire, Captain Huse was eminent and conspicuous in the performance of his duties; was indefatigable in his labors of a most important character, both with the division commander in directing affairs and in his efforts on shore to get in communication with the Mexican authorities to avoid needlessly prolonging the conflict. Namesake In 1943, was named in honor of Vice Admiral Harry M. P. Huse.

She first outlined her own version in her own magazine called Sonnenwind (Solar Wind), and then expanded these ideas into a book called The Cosmic Ordering Service: A Guide to Realising Your Dreams. In the United Kingdom, disc jockey and TV game show host Noel Edmonds has become the main media promoter of Mohr's work. Exponents Noel Edmonds, the British television host, became interested in the subject after being introduced to The Cosmic Ordering Service by his reflexologist. Need a lover or a house? Call on the cosmos The Daily Telegraph April 4th 2006. After having not worked on television since the end of his BBC TV show Noel's House Party in 1999, one of Edmonds' wishes was for a new challenge. Later he was offered the chance to return to television to work on Deal or No Deal.DEAR COSMOS, CAN I HAVE A HIT SHOW? Daily Record, April 3rd 2006. Edmonds later went on to write his own book titled Positively Happy: Cosmic Ways To Change Your Life. Presenter Laura Hamilton claims to have used cosmic ordering to get a place on the series Dancing on Ice. Self-help author Stephen Richards believes cosmic ordering changed his life, when he changed from being in poverty to becoming a millionaire. Big Brother winner Brian Belo claimed that cosmic ordering helped him to win the 2007 show. Similar concepts In the Great Depression of the 1930s, Napoleon Hill popularised similar ideas in his book Think and Grow Rich. Hill's ideas were adopted for Christianity in the 1970s by radio and television evangelist Reverend Ike, who was widely heard over radio and television stations claiming that \\"You can't lose with the stuff I use.\\" Similar ideas were taken up by a stream of televangelists such as Kenneth Copeland, Bob Tilton and Jim Bakker of the failed PTL television empire. Criticism Cosmic ordering has been criticised as \\"nonsense\\" by the Right Reverend Carl Cooper. He describes it as goal setting dressed up in spiritual language. He also distinguishes cosmic ordering from intercessory prayer, noting that prayer is not \\"divine room service\\". Cosmic ordering is satirized as \\"space-star ordering\\" in the \\"Something Happened\\" episode (Season 4, Episode 3) of The IT Crowd. In the episode, Douglas Reynholm joins the \\"Spaceologists\\" and makes wishes to the stars for what he wants. His wishes for a helicopter and the ability to apply tattoos come true after he buys himself a helicopter and a tattoo book, while his wish to have a metal hand comes true when his self-inked helicopter tattoo becomes infected and leads to the amputation of his hand. Douglas uses the successful fulfillment of his wishes to try to convince the IT team to join the Spaceologists. Academia In 2007, cosmic ordering was put forward as a solution to women's inequality in academia. Proponents advocate asking the cosmos for a promotion to help equal the playing field with men.'Cosmic ordering' cure for campus sex war The Daily Telegraph April 28th 2007 Opponents of the concept described the approach as \\"scandalous\\" and \\"an opiate to dull the pain of reality\\".South Bank head defends 'Cosmic Ordering' workshop, Educational Guardian April 27th, 2007 The idea is connected to the New Age movement and other concepts such as the Law of Attraction.

Biography  Harris was born to parents Chris and Clara Harris in Kispiox. In 1957, Harris became the hereditary Chief of the Fireweed Clan, assuming the name Chief Geel from his uncle. His crest is the killer whale. In the 1960s, during his partnership in a small lumber mill and working as a carpenter, Harris worked on the reconstructed village of 'Ksan, at Hazelton. This led him to enrol at the Gitanmaax School of Northwest Coast Indian Art in 1969, studying jewellery under Jack Leyland, wood carving under Duane Pasco and Doug Cranmer, and attended seminars on Northwest Coast graphic design given by Bill Holm. He was eventually named senior carving instructor for the period 1972- 1985. Harris and his wife, Sadie, had five children and twenty grandchildren. His two sons, Rodney and Richard, also pursued the carving tradition, working with him on several projects, as did his sister Doreen Jensen. The Canadian federal government appointed Harris to the Fine Arts Committee in 1978. The Committee selects and assists in the purchase of indigenous art from across Canada. In 1987, Harris suffered a massive stroke, followed by major heart surgery in 1990. Harris died on January 12, 2009.  Major works  In the early 1970s Harris, assisted by other 'Ksan carvers, raised the first traditional totem pole in modern times. Other major commissions include a wood panel for the Canadian embassy in Paris and a limestone killer whale for the entry of to the House of Commons in Ottawa. His work is also in the Vancouver International Airport, San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, Victoria Island in the Ottawa River, a Westar Sawmill office in Japan. Other pieces include four large screens for the Royal Bank of Canada in Vancouver, a set of massive red cedar doors for UBC's Museum of Anthropology, totem poles in Rochester, New York, and Baltimore, Maryland, and a large killer whale carving for the Vancouver Art Gallery.

He served as a spy in the United States, as a military advisor in China, and gained fame under his nom de guerre as General Kl√©ber, leader of the International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War.  Early life  He was born into a Jewish family in northen Moldova (now Hlyboka Raion, Chernivtsi Oblast, Ukraine), a province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire on the border between Romania and Ukraine. He studied medicine at the University of Vienna.  World War I and the Russian Revolution  Drafted into the Austro- Hungarian army at the beginning of World War I, he was captured by the Tsarist army and taken to a prisoner of war camp in Siberia. Freed by the October Revolution, he became a Bolshevik and joined the Red Army. He led a partisan unit in Siberia against the White Army of Admiral Kolchak and fought in Mongolia against the warlord \\"bloody\\" Baron Ungern von Sternberg and his ally, the religious leader Bogd Khan. In 1921 he was elected to the Constituent Assembly of the short-lived Far Eastern Republic. After the Civil War, he returned to Moscow and enrolled in the Frunze Military Academy. Upon graduation, in 1924, he joined Walter Krivitsky in the Red Army's Fourth Department (the GRU, or military intelligence). He was assigned to the Comintern and acted as an instructor in its military schools.  Espionage career  In 1929, Stern became the GRU's chief spy in the United States. Based in New York City and operating under the cover name of Mark Zilbert, he managed a network of sources and agents involved in the theft of military secrets. In one operation they stole the plans for a new American tank. Another operation was foiled by a source who went to U.S. Naval Intelligence and continued to deliver faked documents to the Soviets. The apparatus kept a safe apartment on West 57th Street, owned by Paula Levine, later part of a Soviet spy ring in Paris, and kept a photographic studio on Gay Street in Greenwich Village. There \\"Charlie,\\" in actuality Leon Minster, GRU operator of a front, the Ellem Radio Equipment Shop, microfilmed the stolen documents. German sailors acted as couriers to the GRU in Europe. (These details come from Witness, the 1952 memoir of Whittaker Chambers. Deleted here was Whittaker Chambers' incorrect statement claiming a family connection between the Ministers and Soviet official Vyacheslov Molotov. Veronica Zolina, granddaughter of Leon and Bess Minster, personal communication (2016).)  Military advisor in China  After handing off to Alexander Ulanovsky in New York, Stern traveled in 1932 to Shanghai where he served as the Comintern's military advisor to the newly created Jiangxi Soviet. Stern's activities in China remain veiled in mystery. In a report to the Moscow Comintern, he claimed that he tried to forge an alliance between the Chinese Red Army and a rebel Nationalist army whose officers had seized control of nearby Fukien province. However, this alliance failed and the National Revolutionary Army, under the command of Chiang Kai-shek, encircled the Chinese Red Army, forcing them to abandon their base in Jiangxi and to begin the Long March. Stern returned to Moscow in 1935 and worked briefly for Otto Kuusinen in the secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Comintern (ECCI).  \\"General Kl√©ber\\" and the Spanish Civil War  Stern arrived in Spain on a hot day in September 1936, disguised inappropriately as a \\"furrier.\\" He adopted the name of one of Napoleon's generals, Jean-Baptiste Kl√©ber, and posed as an Austrian- born Canadian citizen. He served as a military advisor to the International Brigades against Franco's rebel army. During the Battle of Madrid in November 1936, he led the 3,000 member XI International Brigade. At a time when it appeared all was lost ‚Äîthe Republican government of Largo Caballero had already abandoned the capital‚Äî the arrival of Kl√©ber and the International Brigade boosted the morale of Madrid's Republican defenders when the loyalist troops fought from street to street and held the line at Casa de Campo, repulsing the Nationalists. Soviet propaganda broadcast the 'Victory over Fascism' throughout the world and ‚Äîdespite General Miaja's and General Vicente Rojo's crucial role‚Äî heralded General Kl√©ber as the \\"Savior of Madrid\\". The New York Times correspondent Herbert Matthews interviewed Stern shortly after the battle. \\"Listening to General Kl√©ber,\\" he wrote, \\"one gets the impression of great dynamic force. He is a character possibly destined to play a great part in the troubled years which face the world... In thinking about him it is hard not to ponder on the ironical fact that Hitler is not the only native of Austria who is playing a great part in the Spanish Civil War.\\"Castells Peig, Andreu (1974). Ariel, ed. Las brigadas internacionales de la guerra de Espa√±a (1¬™ edici√≥n). Barcelona. p. 103. . In 1937 he led the newly established 45th Division, but a leadership dispute caused Kl√©ber to be replaced by Hans Kahle as leader of the Republican Infantry division.Ronald Radosh, Mary R. Habeck, G. N. Sevost πianov, Spain Betrayed: The Soviet Union in the Spanish Civil War, 2001; p. 329 Even so, Stern remained in Spain as liaison agent with the Republican Government and still enjoyed military prestige among Spanish Communist Party members. He left Spain when the International Brigades were withdrawn in October 1938.Carlos Engel, Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del E. P. de la Rep√∫blica, 1976; p. 306  Recall to Moscow, imprisonment, and death  The NKVD chief in Spain, Alexander Orlov, knew that Stern's recall meant certain imprisonment and death because in Moscow Joseph Stalin and Nikolai Yezhov were busy purging the Red Army. He offered to employ Stern as a member of the NKVD. While awaiting orders, Stern spent his final months in Spain relaxing at a small orange plantation and entertaining his young Spanish mistress. Kliment Voroshilov denied his transfer and ordered his return to Moscow. In May 1939 a Military Collegium condemned Stern to fifteen years of hard labor. He became a non-person. His name was deliberately withheld from official Soviet histories of the Spanish Civil War. The remaining years of his life were spent in the Gulag and he died of exhaustion at a labor camp in Sosnovka on February 18, 1954.

It is one of the few bands in Argentina of the punk rock genre - they are also labeled as power pop punk - that has been featured in mainstream radio and television. Villanos has released four official studio albums, two independent albums and a live album.  History   Formation  Villanos formed in the neighborhood of Villa Celina, a working class district on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, and first played at a bar called Planta Alta in Floresta, Buenos Aires, on April 8, 1995. In January 1996 they made their first trip to the Atlantic coast to play at Villa Gesell. In late 1998 they were elected as one of the groups by the Suplemento Si of Clar√≠n. In early 1999 they recorded their debut album entitled Sacate Todo! in the studio Abasto al Pasto which was produced by Paul Guyot. The album was released independently with distribution by Universal. In April 1999 they were chosen to open the show Kiss in the River Plate Stadium. Villanos members are: * Niko Villano (voice and lead guitar) * Vare Villano (bass) * Herni Villano (guitar)  No Disparen!  Villanos on Canal 7 In mid-2000 they released their second CD No Disparen!, produced by Paul Guyot and Alfredo Toth, with songs such as \\"Putas\\", \\"No No Disparen\\" (with Ciro of Attaque 77 as a guest in the video), \\"Fuera de Moda\\", and \\"Hasta la muerte\\". In September 2000 Villanos were invited by Attaque 77 on their tour around the center and north of the country. In 2001 they released an album of 15 tracks entitled Acusticosas I, recorded live at several night clubs in Buenos Aires including at Niko Villano's birthday party. In 2002 they published Acusticosas II consisting of 20 tracks recorded live at Peteco's in Lomas de Zamora. In May 2004 made Villano al Poder, produced by Niko Villano. The videos for \\"Digo que Si\\" and \\"Dios es Argentino\\" were both directed by Stephen De Miguel, the producer of Filmic.  Superpoderosos!  A new album Superpoderosos! was made in December 2004 containing six new songs including \\"Sin Mi\\" and \\"Yo te Doy\\". The album also included 4 covers: \\"Te hacen falta vitaminas\\", \\"Mi alma lloro\\", \\"Si yo soy asi\\" and \\"El Se√±or de Galilea\\". The new songs were recorded and mixed by Amilcar Gilabert and produced by Niko Villano. During the same month the video of \\"Sin Mi\\" was made with William Constanzo as director on Super 8 at the premises of Parque de la Ciudad. \\"Sin Mi\\" climbed to the top of the rankings. During January and February 2005 the toured the Bonaerense Coast and appeared at Gesell Rock in January and Cosquin Rock in February. Warner Bros. Records decided to republish the entire catalog of Villanos and in March 2005 the CD re-issues of Sacate todo! and No Disparen! were remastered by Amilcar Gilabert. The second track \\"Chau Corazon\\" gained first place in all television and radio rankings. The video was filmed in the delta of Tigre in Buenos Aires, and it was filmed in style to parody the style of Argentinian film of the 1970s. Throughout 2005 they toured the country in the \\"Superpoderosa!\\" Tour. Contacto At the official presentation of Acusticosas in ND Ateneo After a recital given in the Pepsi Music series in 2006 Villanos started work on their next album titled Contacto. This was of 13 songs that revolve around the overdose of information, lack of communication, love, loneliness and freedom. The album included a special bonus track: \\"Me he quedado solo\\" by Mexican singer Juan Gabriel. The album was produced by Mauricio Claveria and Sylleros Andres (ex La Ley). The first advance track released, \\"Contacto\\", was widely available on radio and TV. The videos for the songs from Contacto were directed by Gabriel Grieco and Niko Villano. The second video was \\"Me He quedado solo\\" and Villanos are shown playing with their fans through the streets of La Boca and Gesell ending on Niko calesita perteciente Boulevard in the city. Acusticosas and return to independence 2008 was not an easy year for Villanos when they separated from Warner Music Group. They toured cities including Buenos Aires and travelled to Uruguay with the last recitals of the tour Sigo de largo announced at the official presentation and launch of Acusticosas El CD on November 29 in the ND Ateneo. The first video clip from the CD is \\"Sale Caro\\", which shows Villanos in the ND Ateneo and the appreciation of their fans.  Discography   Studio Albums  * Sacate Todo! (1999) * No Disparen!

Full power was achieved in July 1963. The facility shut down on September 27, 1964 to resolve reactor problems. In May 1966, Consumers Public Power District rejected their option to purchase the facility from the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). In response, the AEC announced its plan to decommission the facility in June, 1966. The facility operated for 6,271 hours and generated 192,458,000 kW-hrs of electric power. It was located near Hallam, about 25 miles southwest of Lincoln. Description The Hallam Nuclear Reactor Structure The sodium-cooled graphite-moderated reactor (SGR) design (of which HNFP was a demonstration) targeted economical commercial nuclear electricity. The liquid metal coolant enabled operation at temperatures sufficiently high to produce steam conditions identical to those used in fossil-fueled power plants, enhancing power conversion efficiency and making use of commodity steam turbines. It also enables low-pressure operation. The graphite moderator enabled operation with low-enriched nuclear fuel as well the potential use of the thorium fuel cycle. These benefits were expected to overcome the added complication of a using chemically reactive coolant. The reactor was initially fueled with 3.6% enriched uranium-10 molybdenum alloy with stainless steel cladding. The graphite moderator was clad in stainless steel hexagons with each corner scalloped to make room for the process tubes which contained the fuel clusters and control rods. Three sodium heat-transfer loops (each with a radioactive primary loop and a non- radioactive secondary) moved heat to three steam generators. Steam fed into a common header to a single turbine-generator. The primary hot leg temperature was 945 ¬∞F and the secondary hot leg temperature was 895 ¬∞F. Uranium carbide was selected for the second core, at 4.9% enrichment. Proposal, Development, and Construction Partial Assembly of Moderator Elements in the Core Tank Grid plate with 141 moderator can supports placed preparatory to security the supports to the grid plate Reactor vessel of type 304 SS viewed during radiographing of final weld joints, showing support pads and keyways on the bottom of the vessel Hallam was proposed in March 1955 in response to the first round of invitations by the Atomic Energy Commission's Power Demonstration Reactor Program. It used technology being developed in the smaller Sodium Reactor Experiment (SRE), also built by Atomics International. Lessons from SRE applied to HNPF include: * Fuel rod blowing * Poor control of sodium convection flow * Stratification of sodium in intermediate heat exchanger * Difficulties due to freeze-seal sodium pumps * Difficulties in preheating of sodium systems Because HNPF was more than ten times larger than SRE, a components development and test program was performed to provide final design data. All major components, including fuel, control rods, instrumentation, pumps, and valves were tested. The fuel handling machine was assembled and tested. Scale model of a steam generator was tested in a sodium loop along related equipment and instrumentation. A formal three-session training program for operators was conducted in 1960. 30 personnel attended the first session for six months. Each person received approximately 900 hours of training. Construction began on April 1, 1959. Employment during construction peaked at 270 in March, 1961, and 107,600 person-days total were required to complete the construction. A variety of construction assembly interferences were anticipated, and detailed scale models were procured. Labor problems resulted in the loss of 1750 person-days. The entire facility was completed on November 30, 1961, 4 months past the original planned date of completion. Operation and shutdown Initial criticality was achieved in January 1962, followed by wet criticality six months later. Difficulties that arose during operation and required plant shutdown and correction included leaking control rod thimbles, seizure of secondary sodium pumps, leaking steam generator instrumentation and pipe flanges, difficulty of adjusting fuel channel flow orifices, and failure of primary and secondary sodium throttle valves. The most serious issue was the ruptures of moderator elements. Seven elements ruptured in February, 1964. The ruptures and subsequent absorption of sodium into the graphite reduced the thermal neutron flux in the core and caused a reduction in local power. The moderator elements swelled as well, reducing coolant and process space. Examination disclosed that failure was caused by low ductility stress-rupture leading to a one inch long crack about three inches below the top of each element. Chauncey Starr, the president of Atomics International, testified that they had identified and claimed to have fixed the issue with the moderator can. He proposed a repair operation involving attaching snorkels to each moderator can into the cover gas space, which would cost $1.8M and require 6-9 months. Nonetheless, the AEC under Milton Shaw decided to terminate their contract with the utility. Consumers in turn chose to not purchase the plant, and it was instead decommissioned with the nuclear components sealed in concrete. The plant's single 75 MWe reactor operated from 1963 to September 27, 1964. Decommissioning was completed in 1969.State's First Nuclear Power Plant ;Present day Currently the site holds a fossil-fuel plant, Sheldon Power Station. The site is monitored from 17 monitoring wells and no radioactivity above background levels in any samples has been detected.

Seligman & Co., founded in 1864, was a prominent U.S. investment bank from the 1860s to the 1920s, until the divestiture of its investment banking arm in the aftermath of the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act. The firm was involved in the financing of several major U.S. railroads in the 1870s and the construction of the Panama Canal in the early 1900s. Seligman was also involved in the formation of Standard Oil and General Motors. The firm was acquired by Ameriprise Financial in November 2008. Today, the firm operates an investment management business under the Seligman Investments brand. Seligman provides separately managed accounts and retirement services and also operates a series of mutual funds. History Establishment and early history The firm was founded by Joseph Seligman and his brother James Seligman in New York in 1846 as an importing house, with their younger brothers, William, Jesse, Henry and Leopold, also participating in the venture. Later, two other brothers, Abraham and Isaac, would also join the firm. The brothers were all born in Baiersdorf, Bavaria, to David Seligman and Fannie Steinhart. In 1850, William, Jesse, Henry and Leopold moved to San Francisco, where they set up a store in 1851. After eight years, Jesse and William returned to New York and opened a dry goods store in the city. Through William's efforts, the store received government contracts to supply soldier's uniforms for the Union Army in the American Civil War. These contracts amounted to several millions of dollars. After the American Civil War ended, the eight Seligman brothers decided to go into the banking business and a year later, Jesse Seligman went to Frankfurt, Hesse-Nassau, to open a bank, where they were the first American banking firm to sell United States Government bonds in Europe. The firm became fiscal agent for the conversion of existing war bonds to new ones and acted for years as fiscal agents for the Department of State and Department of the Navy. Soon after, Abraham Seligman opened a bank in New York City, followed by the London branch, established by Isaac and Leopold Seligman, and the Paris branch, established by William Seligman. In the post-Civil War robber baron era, the firm invested heavily in railroad finance, in particular acting as broker of transactions engineered by Jay Gould. Among the companies in the Seligman portfolio were The Missouri Pacific, the Atlantic and Pacific, the South Pacific, and the Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas railroad companies. Later, in 1876, the Seligmans joined forces with the Vanderbilt family to create public utilities in New York. The Seligmans financed the construction of the Panama Canal. The eight Seligman brothers produced 36 sons, but only Isaac Newton Seligman, Joseph's second son, assumed a leadership, becoming head of the firm in 1894. In the 19th century, the U.S. partnership of J.& W. Seligman & Co. Inc. had affiliates in Paris, Frankfurt and elsewhere. These entities became independent in 1897. The London partnership, Seligman Bros., was bought by S. G. Warburg & Co. in 1957. 20th century In the early 20th century, the firm backed the construction of the Panama Canal. In this period, J.& W. Seligman & Co. Inc. underwrote the securities of a variety of companies, participating in stock and bond issues in the railroad and steel and wire industries, investments in Russia and Peru, the formation of the Standard Oil Company, and shipbuilding, bridges, bicycles, mining, and a variety of other industries. The landmark building at 1 William Street in New York City was constructed for J.& W. Seligman from 1904 to 1905 and became the firm's home office. In 1910, William C. Durant of the fledgling General Motors Corporation gave control of his company's board to the Seligmans and Lee, Higginson & Co. in return for underwriting $15 million worth of corporate notes. From 1927 to 1929, Seligman owned a controlling interest in the Victor Talking Machine Company, which it bought from its founder, Eldridge Johnson. Speyer & Company partnered with Seligman in the transaction. Two years later, the company was sold to Radio Corporation of America. In 1930, Seligman began managing its first mutual fund, Broad Street Investing Co., later known as the Seligman Common Stock Fund. Meanwhile, the firm's investment banking business declined by the 1930s. In 1938, in response to the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act, the firm spun off its securities underwriting business as Union Securities. Union Securities was bought by securities broker Eastman Dillon & Co. in 1956 to form Eastman Dillon Union Securities & Co. In 1979, Eastman Dillon (later Blyth, Eastman Dillon & Co.) was acquired by securities broker Paine Webber, which in 2000 became part of financial conglomerate UBS AG. Parts of J.& W. Seligman & Co. Inc. continue as a close-end investment company, Tri-Continental Corporation (NYSE: TY) (established in 1929), and as Seligman mutual funds. From 1940 to 1974 J. & W. Seligman & Co. was headquartered at the American Express Company Building in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City. In 1980, Seligman, which had been owned by its employees in a partnership, restructured into a private corporation, owned by 43 employees. In 1989, the company was acquired through a $52.6 million management buyout, led by a number of its directors, most notably William C. Morris, formerly of Shearson Lehman/American Express. The buyout was financed by a consortium of insurance companies. In 1991, Seligman entered into a joint venture with Henderson plc, one of Europe's largest independent money managers. The venture, known as Seligman Henderson Co., was designed to provide the firm with a more global reach than it had achieved on its own. The firm left behind its downtown offices at 130 Liberty Street and moved to new offices on Park Avenue in 1993. Seligman focused its efforts on institutional investors after selling its high-net-worth business to U.S. Trust Corp. in 1995. In 1997, Seligman began offering its first offshore mutual funds, Seligman Global Horizon Funds, to non-US investors. Seligman experienced significant growth in the 1990s on the back of the performance of its star mutual fund investor, Paul Wick. The Seligman Communication & Information Fund, managed by Wick, was among the best performing of the mid-1990s,Blink, and you may miss out on a star manager's newest fund.

New York Times, May 18, 1997 However, the collapse of the internet bubble heavily impacted Seligman. The firm's Communication & Information Fund, which had been a high flier in the 1990s, lost nearly half of the $11 billion of assets it had at the peak in March 2000. 21st century The company was nearly sold in 2003, but the existing shareholders insisted on retaining a controlling interest. In November 2008, Ameriprise Financial acquired J. & W. Seligman & Co. Incorporated for total consideration of $440 million.

The route is one of four auxiliary routes of US 422 in Pennsylvania. Its western terminus is at an interchange with US 222 and US 422 in Wyomissing. Its eastern terminus is at an interchange with US 422 in Reiffton. US 422 Bus. heads east from US 222/US 422 along Penn Avenue, passing through Wyomissing and West Reading. The route has an interchange with the US 422 freeway before it crosses the Schuylkill River into Reading. US 422 Bus. passes through downtown Reading on the one-way pair of Franklin Street eastbound and Washington Street westbound, intersecting the southern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 183 (PA 183) and crossing US 222 Bus. The business route heads into the eastern part of the city southeast on Perkiomen Avenue before following the one-way pair of Perkiomen Avenue eastbound and Mineral Spring Road westbound into Mount Penn. US 422 Bus. continues along Perkiomen Avenue to St. Lawrence, where it intersects the western terminus of PA 562 and turns southeast. The route passes through Reiffton before it merges into eastbound US 422. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the road between Harrisburg and Reading was designated as part of US 22, which ran along what was designated the William Penn Highway in 1916 and PA 3 in 1924 as well as PA 13, while the road between Reading and Philadelphia was designated as US 120, which ran concurrent with PA 13. In 1928, the US 120/PA 13 designation between Reading and Philadelphia was changed to US 422/PA 17 in order to provide for one number for the Benjamin Franklin Highway. The concurrent state route designations were removed from US 22 and US 422 by 1930. US 22 headed into Reading on Penn Street and continued east to 9th Street, where it turned north and US 422 continued along Penn Street and Perkiomen Avenue east out of Reading. US 22 ran concurrent with PA 83 between 2nd and 9th streets while US 422 ran concurrent with PA 73 between Chestnut Street in Reading and 23rd Street in Mount Penn. In 1931, US 22 was moved to a more direct alignment between Harrisburg and Allentown, and US 422 was extended west along the former alignment between Harrisburg and Reading. In the 1930s, US 422/PA 73 was shifted to Mineral Spring Road between Reading and Mount Penn in the 1930s and a one-way pair along Perkiomen Avenue and Mineral Spring Road in the 1950s. US 422 was shifted to the Warren Street Bypass and West Shore Bypass, and US 422 Bus. was designated onto the former alignment through Reading. The concurrent PA 83 and PA 73 designations were removed by 1966. In the 1970s, US 422 Bus. was shifted to its current one-way pair through downtown Reading. Route description US 422 Bus. eastbound in West Reading US 422 Bus. begins at an interchange with the US 222/US 422 freeway (Warren Street Bypass) in the borough of Wyomissing in Berks County. The business route begins at the point US 422 splits from Penn Avenue to merge with northbound US 222 on the Warren Street Bypass, with the business route continuing east as four-lane divided Penn Avenue. After splitting from US 422, the route passes over Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line and crosses under US 222 (Warren Street Bypass), with interchange ramps providing access. Past this interchange, the road continues northeast between the railroad tracks to the north and residential areas to the south. US 422 Bus. heads further south from the railroad and continues past a mix of homes and businesses as a two-lane undivided road. The route curves east and passes to the south of the VF Outlet Village. Past this, the road enters the borough of West Reading and becomes three lanes with a center left-turn lane, passing a mix of homes and businesses before running through the commercial downtown. Farther east, US 422 Bus. passes more businesses, widening to a four-lane divided highway as it crosses under Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line #1 before reaching a cloverleaf interchange with the US 422 freeway (West Shore Bypass). Past the US 422 interchange, the business route crosses the Schuylkill River and then the Schuylkill River Trail on the Penn Street Bridge and enters the city of Reading. Here, US 422 Bus. becomes Penn Street and passes over Norfolk Southern's Spruce Street Industrial Track and River Road near Reading Area Community College before it reaches an intersection with 2nd Street after descending off the bridge. At this point, US 422 Bus. splits into a one-way pair. The eastbound direction heads south on one-way, three-lane South 2nd Street before turning east onto one-way, two-lane Franklin Street while the westbound direction follows one- way, three-lane Washington Street west and one-way, four-lane North 2nd Street south to Penn Street. At the intersection of North 2nd and Washington Streets, westbound US 422 Bus. intersects the southern terminus of PA 183. The business route continues east along the one-way pair of Franklin Street eastbound and Washington Street westbound into the commercial downtown of Reading, intersecting US 222 Bus. at 5th Street. US 422 Bus. heads east, with the westbound direction passing north of the Berks County Courthouse, and crosses Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line #2 at-grade eastbound and on a bridge westbound, where the eastbound direction passes north of the former Franklin Street station at the railroad tracks before heading south of the BARTA Transportation Center serving BARTA buses. Following this, the business route heads out of the downtown area, with the westbound direction of Washington Street becoming two lanes. The route heads through urban areas of rowhomes and businesses before it reaches 11th Street. At this point, westbound US 422 Bus. follows one-way North 11th Street northbound between Penn and Washington Street and runs northwest on two-way, two-lane Perkiomen Avenue east of the 11th Street intersection. Eastbound US 422 Bus. joins the westbound direction of the route at South 13th Street, at which point both directions of the route continue southeast along two-lane undivided Perkiomen Avenue past homes. Upon reaching Chestnut Street, US 422 Bus. splits into another one-way pair. The eastbound direction continues southeast along two-way Perkiomen Avenue, curving to the east at South 14th Street, while the westbound direction runs along two-way, two-lane Mineral Spring Road. The one-way pair continues east through residential areas to the south of forested Mount Penn. Westbound US 422 Bus. widens to a four-lane undivided road and passes over 19th Street on a bridge, at which point it becomes Howard Boulevard. The one-way pair continues into the borough of Mount Penn and passes between Aulenbach Cemetery before Howard Boulevard heads southeast to join Perkiomen Avenue at the 23rd Street intersection in residential and commercial areas. At this point, US 422 Bus. continues east on two-lane undivided Perkiomen Avenue past a mix of homes and businesses. The route crosses into the borough of St. Lawrence and reaches an intersection with the western terminus of PA 562. Past this, US 422 Bus. turns to the southeast and becomes a four-lane undivided road continuing through developed areas, crossing into Exeter Township. The road continues through suburban residential neighborhoods in the community of Reiffton. Farther southeast, the route runs through business areas and reaches its eastern terminus at the point it merges into eastbound US 422 at the eastern end of the West Shore Bypass freeway. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, the route heading west from Reading toward Lebanon was designated as Legislative Route 149 and the route heading east from Reading toward Pottstown and Norristown was designated as Legislative Route 146. In 1916, the road between Reading and Harrisburg became a part of the William Penn Highway, an auto trail that ran from Pittsburgh to New York City. In 1924, the William Penn Highway was designated as PA 3 with the establishment of the first state route numbers in Pennsylvania. With the establishment of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the road between Harrisburg and Reading was designated as part of US 22, which ran concurrent with PA 3/PA 13, while the road between Reading and Philadelphia was designated as part of US 120, which ran concurrent with PA 13. The same year, plans were made for the Benjamin Franklin Highway, which would connect Philadelphia and Omaha, Nebraska, following US 120 between Philadelphia and Reading and US 22 between Reading and Harrisburg. A request was made to renumber the section of US 120 between Philadelphia and Reading to US 422 as to provide a common number for the Benjamin Franklin Highway, which US 422 followed west of Ebensburg and was connected by US 22 between Reading and Ebensburg. In 1928, US 120 between Philadelphia and Reading was renumbered to US 422, and the concurrent PA 13 designation was replaced with PA 17. In addition, PA 13 was removed from US 22/PA 3 to the west of Reading. By 1930, the concurrent PA 3 designation was removed from US 22 and the concurrent PA 17 designation was removed from US 422. At this time, US 22 entered Reading from the west along William Penn Highway and crossed the Schuylkill River into the city, where it headed east along Penn Street. US 22 ran concurrent with PA 83 between 2nd and 9th Streets. At 9th Street, US 22 turned north and US 222/PA 83 headed south, while US 422 continued east on Penn Street. US 422 turned southeast onto Perkiomen Avenue and ran concurrent with PA 73 between Chestnut Street in Reading and 23rd Street in Mount Penn. In 1931, plans were made to reroute US 22 and the William Penn Highway to a more direct alignment between Harrisburg and Allentown by way of PA 43. As a result of the rerouting of US 22, the road between Harrisburg and Reading would become a western extension of US 422 while the road between Reading and Allentown would become a northern extension of US 222. The changes were approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials on June 8, 1931. Signs were changed to reflect the new designations on May 31, 1932, with the new route designations officially in place on June 1, 1932. In the 1930s, US 422 through the western suburbs of Reading was renamed to Penn Avenue. Also, US 422/PA 73 was rerouted to use Mineral Spring Road between Reading and Mount Penn. In the 1950s, US 422/PA 73 was split into the one-way pair of Perkiomen Avenue eastbound and Mineral Spring Road westbound between Reading and Mount Penn. In 1964, US 422 was routed off city streets in the Reading area, using the Warren Street Bypass and the newly completed West Shore Bypass. As a result, US 422 Bus. was designated onto the former alignment of US 422. By 1966, the concurrent PA 83 and PA 73 designations in Reading were removed. In the 1970s, US 422 Bus. was split to follow a one-way pair in downtown Reading along Franklin Street eastbound and Washington Street westbound. On June 22, 2000, the section of US 422 Bus. between PA 562 and the eastern terminus at US 422, along with US 422 between US 422 Bus. and Shelbourne Road, in Exeter Township was designated by an act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly as the Albert Boscov Commemorative Highway in honor of Albert Boscov, the longtime CEO of the department store chain Boscov's.

The lyrics are notably obscure, however the song appears to be a love song in which a pair of lovers reminisce about the way in which they met. The exact timing of this meeting appears to change throughout the song, with the chorus being in present or future tense (\\"Cause this is gonna be/The day that we will meet\\"), while the opening lines talk about \\"That day you saw me cry\\", implying a past tense situation. The song takes its title from the last lines of the chorus - \\"When heaven comes so down to earth/To say hello from Mars\\". The song was performed twenty-first on the night, following Poland's Ich Troje with \\"Keine Grenzen-≈ªadnych granic\\" and preceding Belgium's Urban Trad with \\"Sanomi\\". At the close of voting, it had received 5 points (all from Estonia), placing 24th in a field of 26. Thus requiring Latvia to qualify from the semi-final at their next Contest appearance.

History  The band's origin dates back to the late 80s when the original trio formed by Daniel Guti√©rrez on vocals and guitar, Manuel Leyva on bass and Edwin Sours on drums (the latter being replaced by Germ√°n Arroyo after a couple of years) began to establish themselves in Mexico City's underground rock scene. After several years of small gigs in bars and clubs, they recorded their first studio album in 1996, Merlina, which was well received. The band added guitarist Jorge Vilchis (ex-member of Guillotina) the following year, which contributed to the evolution of a more characteristic sound, reflected in their second studio album, Superbee. La Gusana Ciega opened for Oasis in 1998 as one of Mexico's main indie rock groups. They traveled to the US in 1999 to record their third album, Correspondencia Interna. Having gained considerable popularity, the band toured Mexico and select US cities in 2000, culminating in the release of their live album, lagusanaciega. The following year, they continued their American foray with an English EP entitled Edici√≥n Limitada. One of these songs, Sunday Fever, was included in the Latin American edition of the American Pie soundtrack. La Gusana Ciega broke up suddenly in May 2002, despite their growing popularity. The members pursued other musical projects during the following three years, with the exception of Manuel, the bassist, who moved to the US. Daniel played with Cosmonova, while Germ√°n and Jorge joined Pardo VanDaik. In early 2005, they announced a reunion tour with the notable substitution of Lu, Cosmonova's bass player, for Manuel. This was followed by the release of a best-of anthology, together with a DVD of their videos, entitled Super Especial. They headed back to the studio in 2006 and released La Rueda del Diablo, their fourth full-length album. In 2008 they released Jaibol, an album consisting of covers and one new song. Conejo en el Sombrero was released in 2011 as a digital download, CD, and vinyl album. Their latest album, Monarca, was released in 2014, earning a nomination for Best Rock Album at the 2015 Latin Grammy Awards.  Discography  Their discography includes seven studio albums, one live album, one EP, and a best- of anthology. *Merlina (1996) *Superbee (1997) *Correspondencia Interna (1999) *lagusanaciega (2000) live *Edici√≥n Limitada (2001) EP *Super Especial (2005) best-of *La Rueda del Diablo (2006) *Jaibol (2008) *Conejo en el Sombrero (2011) *Monarca (2014) *Borregos en la Niebla I (2017)  External links  *La Gusana Ciega official website *official MySpace *Superbee LGC Superbee, unofficial website band *Cosmonova official website *Pardo VanDaik official website *Naranjada Records Germ√°n and Daniel's recording studio *lgcfans MySpace of fans Category:Mexican rock music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1993 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2002 Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2005 Category:1993 establishments in Mexico ","title":"La Gusana Ciega"},{"id":"7229991","text":"Argentine ice hockey player from the ice hockey Federation, not the AAHHL The Argentine Association of Ice and In-Line Hockey () is the Argentine national governing body for ice and inline hockey, responsible for national men's and women's team, the selection of hockey inline, part of the IIHF World Championships.

Early life Tony Hunt was born in 1942 at the Kwakwaka'wakw community of Alert Bay, British Columbia, and was the oldest of six sons of Henry Hunt and Helen Hunt. The youth received early training from his maternal grandfather Mungo Martin. Through his maternal line, Hunt was a hereditary chief of the Kwakwaka'wakw. His father was a professional woodcarver. Hunt and his brothers are also descendants of the renowned ethnologist George Hunt (Tlingit), who collected hundreds of Kwakwaka'wakw artworks for an exhibition at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Career After his grandfather Martin's death in 1962, Hunt became assistant carver to his father Henry Hunt at Thunderbird Park in Victoria, B.C. His younger brothers, Richard Hunt and Stanley C. Hunt, also became professional carvers. In 1970 Hunt opened the Arts of the Raven Gallery in Victoria. In 1984 Kraft Foods, Inc. commissioned Tony Hunt to carve a replacement totem pole, Kwanusila (Thunderbird), for a Kwakwaka'wakw pole donated by James L.

As a senior at Sikeston High School, Woods became the first Missouri high school athlete to top 60 ft (18.3 m), setting a Sikeston school record that still stands to this day. He would go on to attend Southern Illinois University. Woods competed at the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics. After winning the US Olympic track and field team trails in 1968, he was overtaken by fellow American shot putter Randy Matson (Texas A&M;) in the Mexico City games, settling for the silver medal behind Matson‚Äôs Olympic record performance. Four years later in 1972, he again entered the games as the American Olympic trials champion and the favorite for Olympic gold. He came close, but was again denied Olympic gold. Wladyslaw Komar, a virtual unknown from Poland, set an Olympic record at 21.18 m (69 ft 5¬æ in) on his first throw. Woods responded, steadily and methodically, reaching 21.17 m (69 ft 5¬Ω inches) in the fourth round. While Komar never approached his opening effort throughout the series, Woods couldn‚Äôt pick up the final centimeter on his remaining throws. He would settle for another silver medal. Woods would win the U.S. trials again in 1976, but finish seventh at the Olympics. Woods had a great indoor career, winning national championships in 1967‚Äì1969 and 1973. His 1973 meet record of 69 ft 9¬Ω in stood as the meet record for 20 years. A year later in 1974, Woods set the indoor world record at 22.02 m (72 ft 3 in), a mark that would stand for 11 years. He ranks 5th among shot putters all time indoors, and his record throw is the 10th longest indoor effort of all time. His outdoor best ranks him in the top 40 putters of all‚Äìtime worldwide, an amazing statistic after nearly 30 years. Woods was inducted to the USATF National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 2007.

The air base was decommissioned in 1946, and part of the land was annexed by Costa Mesa in 1953.Historic California Posts: Santa Ana Army Air Base The air base was used for basic training, although it did not have planes, hangars or runways. The base was , and the main section of the base was located between Baker Street to the north, Harbor Boulevard to the west, Wilson Street on the south, and Newport Boulevard on the east. The land formerly occupied by the air base is today the home of John Wayne Airport, the Orange County Fairgrounds, and Orange Coast College. Origins and development On 1 January 1942 the United States Army Air Corps activated Santa Ana Army Air Base and established the West Coast Air Corps Training Center at Santa Ana, California. The West Coast Air Corps Training Center at Santa Ana commanded flying training (basic, primary and advanced) at airfields in the Western United States. On 31 July 1943, was redesignated as the Western Flying Training Command. Santa Ana Army Air Base was an air base without planes, hangars or runways. The original locations were at Maxwell Field, Montgomery, Alabama, Randolph Field, San Antonio, Texas and Moffett Field, Sunnyvale, California. These three Centers were to train a total of 7,000 pilots per year. However the national program was increased to 30,000 pilots per year in August 1940. Many contract training schools were started to help fill this quota. In February 1941, the Army initiated three Air Corps Replacement Training Centers. These were induction centers for new recruits entering the Army Air Corps with no military experience. Each center was to provide for the classification and preflight instruction for pilots, navigators and bombardiers. The locations were to be at existing air corps facilities. This was the case except for the West Coast Air Corps Training Center at Moffett Field, near Sunnyvale, California. The United States Navy wanted to use the field exclusively for its lighter than air \\"blimp\\" base so the Army Air Corps had to look elsewhere for a new facility. A search of sites in southern California was conducted. The City Council of Santa Ana wanted the new center located near it so they arranged to lease a 409-acre site for $6,400 per year from M. H. Whittier Co. Ltd. with an option to buy at $500 per acre. The government could sublet from the city for $1 per year. The Army selected the Santa Ana site on 16 June 1941. The City leased the land on 21 August 1941. National Training Center Santa Ana Army Air Base (SAAAB) was a huge basic training camp. Plans were also made to move the entire Army Air Force administrative offices at Moffett Field to the Santa Ana area. Santa Ana Army Air Base California 1943 Classbook The master plan called for the construction of 145 buildings that would include: 79 barracks, 3 warehouses, quartermaster supply office, 4 school buildings, 10 administration buildings, 13 day rooms, 13 supply rooms, 4 cadet messes, 2 officers' quarters, a motor repair shop, post office, gasoline service station, utility buildings, theater, 2 recreation buildings, commissary buildings, chapels, dispatchers' office, officers' mess, fire station, guard house, two post exchanges, and a 151-bed hospital and all utilities. This would amount to a new city in the middle of bean and tomato fields. The construction contract for the 177 buildings at SAAAB was awarded to the Griffith Company on 24 October 1941 for $2 million. The work was to be completed in 120 calendar days The Base would not have a flying field as a part of its facilities. It would receive air cadets from civilian life and give them basic ground training prior to their advancement to one of the contract primary aviation schools for flight training. The Orange County Airport was also selected as the site for the Headquarters Squadron originally located at Moffett Field. Arrangements were also made for the Air Corps lease five acres of land for a small facility at the adjacent airport to serve as a sort of \\"taxi service\\" for the Army Air Force officials to permit them to contact various points of flying activity along the West Coast. The first set of buildings was completed on 15 May 1942; however, the officers and men began to move into the base on 16 February 1942. General Orders No. 14 made it official on 3 March 1942. The base grew rapidly as the need for pilots and air crews skyrocketed. Newly inducted soldiers, earmarked for the Army Air Forces, were given 9 weeks of basic training and then testing to determine if they were to be pilots, bombardiers, navigators, mechanics, etc. From SAAAB, they went on to other bases for training in their specialties. It planned to accommodate 2,500 to 3,000 cadets, 83 officers and 806 enlisted men, and to cost about $3.2 million to construct. The first group of 50 cadets arrived on 20 February 1942. On 25 February 1942 the Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron with its enlisted men and approximately 2,000 cadets arrived to begin training. By March there were 5,000 cadets on the base. Cadets lived in tents until the new barracks could be completed. Instruction began in March for a nine-week course. In May 1942 the base was organized into Wings, Groups and Squadrons. A wing consisted of ten squadrons, divided into two Groups. A squadron usually had about 180 men. This was broken into flights and then squads. The first class of 2,601 cadets graduated on 1 July 1942. By the end of 1942 the annual rate of graduates from the Pilot School was over 45,000. To carry out this program, the Air Force had recruited a faculty of over 250 well-trained and experienced high school, college and university teachers who later became officers in the Air Corps. In the Fall of 1942 SAAAB became an Overseas Replacement Depot (ORD) housing Army Air Forces personnel awaiting transportation overseas. Turnover was rapid so that by the end of the year 23,470 soldiers had passed through SAAAB. By the end of 1943 that number jumped to 57,895. The Base reached its maximum strength by the fall of 1943, with a population of some 26,000 servicemen. In November 1943 members of the Women's Air Service Pilots (WASP) began training at the base, followed shortly by members of the Women's Army Corp (WAC). Being close to Hollywood and with such a large turnover of service personnel, the base attracted a lot of Hollywood celebrities who put on shows at the base. Preflight training at the SAAAB peaked in the latter part of 1943. Pilot class 44D, the largest, completed training in October 1943. By then, the Army Air Forces had enough aircrews for the foreseeable future. On 31 May 1944 aircrew classification ceased at the SAAAB, only about two years since a began. The Pilot School closed on 22 May 1944. It had received 73,923 cadets and graduated 70,464 for flying schools. By the end of 1944 most pilot training schools were being closed by the Army Air Forces. On 1 November 1944 the SAAAB was turned over to the Army Air Forces Personnel Distribution Command with General Arthur E. Easterbrook in command. At the time it had 800 buildings on the Base. Most of the remaining cadets were sent to San Antonio, Texas. From its inception until this transfer the SAAAB Classification Center had received 149,425 men. Of that total, 82,252 were classified as pilots, 21,842 as bombardiers and 14,230 as navigators. Classification eliminated 28,388 to ground crew and 188 to radio operator school. At its close 2,525 remained unclassified. 7 May 1945 V-E day was the close of the fighting in Europe. Suddenly SAAAB's role changed 180 degrees and it worked around the clock to become a separation center. By November 1945 81,000 combat veterans had been returned to private life. In late 1945 Japanese aliens from the alien internment camps being returned to Japan by the Immigrations and Naturalization Service (INS) were housed here while awaiting transportation to Japan Finally on 13 March 1946 the Army deactivated the SAAAB. On 4 May 1946 the title to the SAAAB passed from the Army to the War Assets Administration.

In 1953 the City of Costa Mesa was incorporated. In June 1955, the former SAAAB property was annexed to the City. For a period of time in the mid-1950s a portion of the Base served as a Nike guided missile training base. The three-battery missile compound had been made operational in January 1956. Two years later, in June 1958, the Air National Guard received a five-acre parcel of land and the remaining 260 acres, including the five-acre air base water facility, was declared surplus and turned over to the GSA. The western portion of the land that was the SAAAB is currently Orange County Fairgrounds, and the eastern portion is currently John Wayne Airport. On 29 June 1979, a plaque was dedicated to \\"all pilots, bombardiers and navigators who trained here that contributed to an early victory in World War II\\". This plaque was placed on the Air National Guard base, which is the last active duty post on the original location of the SAAAB. In popular culture In literature, Santa Ana Army Air Base is notable as being one of the two main settings for the novel Catch-22 by Joseph Heller, and subsequent film and television adaptations of the book. Heller acknowledges at the beginning of the novel that he has heavily-fictionalized the other main setting ‚Äì the Italian island of Pianosa ‚Äì suggesting that SAAAB is depicted more realistically.

Gilroy won a bronze medal for Ireland at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne at Bantamweight. As a professional, he took the Commonwealth (British Empire) and European Bantamweight titles in 1959 and contended for the World Bantamweight Title in 1960. Early life and career Frederick Gilroy was born on 7 March 1936 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Getting an early career start, he joined the St. John Bosco amateur boxing club at the age of nine. At the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, he won a bronze medal in bantamweight boxing. After a first round bye, Gilroy defeated Boris Stepanov of the Soviet Union by a third-round knockout. He then beat Mario Sitri of Italy on points, before losing to Wolfgang Behrendt of Germany on points.

On 10 January 1959 he defeated Peter Keenan decisively in an eleventh round TKO in Belfast, Northern Ireland, to take the Commonwealth (British Empire) Bantamweight title. Most effective in the match was Gilroy's left hook. Keenan was floored in the third by a left hook, and was down for an eight count in the eighth. In the tenth, Keenan was twice down for counts of nine, before a towel from his corner signaled the end of the bout.

Gilroy won when a cut to Caldwell's eye prevented him continuing the bout. He retained his British Empire Bantamweight title, and immediately announced his retirement from his short but successful boxing career. He died at the age of eighty in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 28 June 2016. His funeral was at Holy Cross Church in Belfast.

He is portrayed by Italian actor Raf Vallone. In the film Lamberto is the cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church favoured to succeed Pope Paul VI. He is visited by Michael Corleone on the advice of Don Tommasino. Michael tells him of the swindle at the hands of corrupt Vatican bank officials Frederick Keinszig, Licio Lucchesi, and Archbishop Gilday. Lamberto encourages Michael to confess his sins; initially reluctant, he eventually does so under the Cardinal's gentle prodding; breaking down in tears when confessing his ordering of the murder of his brother Fredo. Upon the conclusion of the confession, Lamberto tells Michael that he deserves to suffer for his terrible sins, yet absolves him and tells him he still has a chance for redemption. Upon the death of Paul VI, Lamberto is elected the new pontiff; he takes the name John Paul I upon his accession. A moral, thoroughly honest man, he immediately calls for an investigation into the activities of the Vatican Bank and requests a meeting with Keinszig, the Bank's chief accountant. However, Keinszig has left Rome with a large sum of money and several documents. Fearing that their corruption will be exposed, Keinszig, Lucchesi, and Gilday plot to murder the Pope. Gilday poisons the pontiff's tea, killing him in his sleep. Inspiration The character of Lamberto and the film's depiction of the events which led to his murder are based upon one of the conspiracy theories surrounding the sudden death of the real-life Pope John Paul I, Albino Luciani. Like the Lamberto character, Luciani was discovered dead in his bed in 1978, 33 days after his election to the papacy. Various theories, such as the one outlined in David Yallop's 1984 book, In God's Name, have suggested that Luciani was murdered because he was investigating and planning reforms for the Vatican Bank, in light of the Banco Ambrosiano scandal.

The state highway runs from U.S. Route 17 (US 17) in Chesapeake north to US 60 in Virginia Beach. Route description View north at the south end of SR 166 at US 17 in Chesapeake SR 166 begins at an intersection with US 17 (Dominion Boulevard) just north of the Dominion Boulevard Steel Bridge over the Southern Branch Elizabeth River in the independent city of Chesapeake. The state highway heads north as Bainbridge Boulevard, a two-lane road that parallels the river through an industrial area. SR 166 passes under Interstate 64 (I-64) with no access, meets the western end of SR 190 (Great Bridge Boulevard), and crosses Newton Creek. The state highway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 13 and US 460 (Military Highway); within the interchange, SR 166 descends to pass under Military Highway and Norfolk Southern Railway's Norfolk District. SR 166 heads north concurrent with US 460. The highways pass under I-464 and cross Milldam Creek, and continues north as a four-lane undivided highway into the South Norfolk area of Chesapeake. SR 166 and US 460 pass under another Norfolk Southern rail line and meet SR 337 at the junction of Bainbridge Boulevard and Poindexter Street. SR 337 heads north on Bainbridge Boulevard and west on Poindexter Street toward an interchange with I-464 and the Jordan Bridge across the Southern Branch Elizabeth River to Portsmouth; SR 166 and US 460 head northeast on two- lane Poindexter Avenue. At SR 246 (Liberty Street), the two highways turn west for one block before continuing northeast on four-lane 22nd Street, which crosses over the Norfolk District rail line and another rail line. SR 166 and US 460 veer onto two-lane Wilson Road at Berkley Street, where the road enters the city of Norfolk. SR 166 and US 460 expand to a four-lane divided highway just south of Indian River Road, north of which the highways meet SR 168 (Campostella Road) at an acute intersection that does not allow access from northbound SR 168 to southbound SR 166. SR 166, US 460, and SR 168 head north as a six-lane divided highway across the Eastern Branch Elizabeth River on the Campostella Bridge. The boulevard's name changes from Campostella Road to Brambleton Avenue at its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-264. There is no access from eastbound I-264 to northbound SR 166 or to westbound I-264 from either direction of SR 166. Just north of the interchange, the three highways pass under the Tide Light Rail next to the NSU station and SR 166 turns northeast onto Park Avenue while US 460 and SR 168 continue northwest toward Downtown Norfolk. SR 166 follows the four-lane divided street along the western edge of the Norfolk State University campus and intersects US 58 (Virginia Beach Boulevard) before turning onto four-lane undivided Princess Anne Road, which heads west as SR 404. SR 168 has a grade crossing of Norfolk Southern's rail line to Sewell's Point and expands to a divided highway as it passes along the northern edge of an industrial area, where the highway meets the southern end of SR 194 (Sewells Point Road). SR 166 follows Princess Anne Road to its eastern end at Military Highway, which is US 13 heading south and SR 165 heading north. The three highways continue east on six-lane Northampton Boulevard. At the next intersection, SR 165 splits south onto Kempsville Road. SR 166 and US 13 continue east across Lake Wright and meet I-64 (Hampton Roads Beltway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. The interchange includes a flyover ramp from southbound SR 166 to eastbound I-64 but does not include ramps from northbound SR 166 to westbound I-64 or from eastbound I-64 to southbound SR 166; those movements are made via Military Highway to the north. SR 166 and US 13 enter the city of Virginia Beach at Wesleyan Drive, which leads south to Virginia Wesleyan College. SR 166 diverges from US 13, which continues to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, onto Diamond Springs Road.

Founded in 1504, Azua is one of the oldest European settlements in the Americas. The town is located 100 kilometres west of the national capital, Santo Domingo. History The territory was part of the chiefdom of Maguana, one of the five Taino chiefdoms in the island. Christopher Columbus encountered great difficulties that forced him and his companions to take refuge in the Bay of Ocoa, in the eastern part of the Azua territory. There he met the resistance of the Great (Cacique) of Azua Cuyocagua, whom the Admiral tried to subdue without success. The town of Az√∫a de Compostela was officially founded in 1504 by Diego Vel√°zquez de Cu√©llar (conqueror of Cuba), during the government of Don Nicol√°s de Ovando. The famous conqueror of Mexico Hern√°n Cort√©s also resided in the town for several years (1504-1511). During his stay in Azua he used to spend his hours of leisure on the Monte R√≠o beach. Economy Azua has an active population (of working age) of 23,242 people of which 16,167 work, 69% of the economically active population. Of those who work, 20% are public servants (3,232 people). Most of the area of the municipality is concentrated in medium-sized properties, in which combined technology is used, with a predominance of mechanization. Large properties, with more than 800 tasks (one task = 628.83 m¬≤), are in the hands of a few large producers. The municipality has been one of the most benefited with the installation of agro-industrial companies covered by Law 409, which has stimulated the development of the public and private financial sector.

It was directed by George Seaton and produced by William Perlberg, from a screenplay by George Seaton, based on the 1953 novel The Magnificent Bastards by Lucy Herndon Crockett. The film stars William Holden and Deborah Kerr with Thelma Ritter, Dewey Martin, William Redfield and Peter Hansen in supporting roles. Plot In Noumea, New Caledonia 1943, Lee Ashley (Deborah Kerr), the widow of a Paramarine lieutenant killed on the Battle of Bloody Ridge on Guadalcanal has joined the American Red Cross on the island to entertain American servicemen. Her leader at the service club, Kate Connors (Thelma Ritter) had initially been reluctant to have her assigned to New Caledonia lest she use her position as a pilgrimage to find out about her late husband. In addition to entertaining, serving the soldiers and giving French lessons, the Red Cross women are expected to help with the wounded ‚Äî which Lee initially refuses to do. A Marine Raider battalion comes to New Caledonia after fighting in the South Pacific. Their commander, Lieutenant Colonel Black (William Holden) objects to the Red Cross women treating his men softly; he states that the only place for women in war are \\"skirts\\" that the men chase and the \\"sweethearts\\" that wait for them back home. He changes his mind when he tries to seduce the attractive Lee, who initially refuses his advances. Black decides to gain her interest by pretending he knew Lee's late husband and was with him shortly before he died. Though Lee despises the Colonel's arrogance and demands, she is fascinated by him and falls in love with him. Another member of the battalion is the Navy chaplain, Lieutenant Junior Grade Holmes (William Redfield) whom Kate notices is a changed, silent, and saddened man since she last knew him. During a battle the Chaplain had gathered some Marines together in prayer. A Japanese soldier, thought to be dead, used the group as a target for his hand grenade, killing several and wounding their sergeant with a spinal injury. Black demotes the wounded sergeant in rank because he should have known better than to let his men gather in the open. Black constantly harasses the Chaplain by never letting him forget that his presence caused their deaths, with the bodies of the Marines shielding the Chaplain from any injury. Holmes's guilt is compounded by a tropical fever and exhaustion from working that has taken its toll. Another man in the battalion is Private Eddie Wodcik (Dewey Martin) whom Kate had adopted and raised in New York when his parents and sister were burned to death in a tenement fire. Kate loves him like her own child and he reciprocates when he is not being watched by his fellow Marines. Eddie feels that Lee looks exactly like his sister would have if she hadn't died and becomes her protector, promising violent retribution against anyone who doesn't show Lee respect. Eddie demonstrates his ability by giving a disrespectful sailor (Ross Bagdasarian) a jiu jitsu throw to the floor. Lee and the colonel have dinner on board an American warship. A former neighbor of Lee is now a naval officer (Peter Hanson) on the ship and is present at dinner. Lee and the naval officer spend the evening talking about their pre- war civilian lives in a wealthy community. An angry Black later relates to Lee his life of childhood poverty as a half Indian in Montana. When the Raiders are shipped out for a couple of months, Lee discovers she is pregnant and that the colonel has a wife in Washington. She later learns things about her husband that she never knew. The hot-headed Eddie also discovers what his colonel has done to Lee. Cast * William Holden as Lt. Col.

She traveled with Basil O'Connor, national chairman of the American Red Cross, during the war as his secretary and speechwriter. An author of nine books, she wrote the 1953 book The Magnificent Bastards about her experiences with the U.S. Marine Corps. Filming The film was made with Defense Department cooperation in the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with production design reflecting New Caledonia in 1943. Technical advisors were Major John W. Antonelli former 1st Marine Raider Battalion and Mary Louise Dowling, Louise A. Wood and Margaret Hagan of the American Red Cross. Paramount picked up the film rights for The Magnificent Bastards in 1954 and announced Deborah Kerr for the lead. Paramount also stated they would release the film under a different title.http://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_050154 Score and original music Composer Victor Young wrote the film's score. Ross Bagdasarian Sr. wrote a tie-in song The Ballad of Colin Black. Reception Critical response Film critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote in his review: \\"ANOTHER exhaustive contemplation of the effects of a wartime romance on a sensitive and susceptible woman is put forth in The Proud and Profane, a William Perlberg-George Seaton production for Paramount that came to the Astor yesterday. The lady who runs the emotional gamut for all to behold in this film is an American Red Cross worker at Noumea in the South Pacific during World War II, and the gentleman with whom she dilly-dallies more than somewhat is a major of American marines. With Deborah Kerr as the lady and William Holden as the marine, two earnest and versatile performances are initially guaranteed. That is the virtue of this picture. Miss Kerr does a continuously interesting job as a nervous and self-pitying widow of a marine killed on Guadalcanal who falls for the rough, tough, ruthless major that Mr. Holden plays. And he, in turn, commands attention with the unrelenting vigor and sting that he gives to this hardbitten soldier who starts the chase with only one thing in mind.\\" Release The Proud and Profane was released in theaters on June 13, 1956. Awards The Proud and Profane was nominated for two Academy Awards, for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White (Hal Pereira, A. Earl Hedrick, Samuel M. Comer, Frank R. McKelvy) and Best Costume Design, Black-and-White (Edith Head).

Formed in 1990 by guitarist and vocalist Sanford Allen and bassist Patrick Sane; at the time, both were members of the band Evil Mothers, the band has churned out a substantial catalog of releases that have received critical praise from home and abroad. The angular, genre-jumping disks have drawn comparisons to Pere Ubu, Howlin‚Äô Wolf, The Birthday Party, Muddy Waters, Captain Beefheart, Eric Dolphy and The Fall, among others. Sane has also played with Pigface, Genesis P-Orridge, Reverend Vince Anderson & s.p.a.s.m. The band has changed personnel numerous times, frequently shuffling drummers. Its current percussionist is Aaron Seibert, previously of the bands Gorch Fock and the Snails. In addition to his work with Boxcar Satan, Allen is a published author of horror and dark fantasy short stories and prose poems.  Discography  Boxcar Satan's first full-length studio recording, Days Before the Flood was released in July 1999 on Compulsive Records. It was recorded at Tribal Studios in San Antonio, Texas by Chad Garrett and Bobdog Catlin and featured cover art by James Cobb. The follow-up, Crooked Mile March was released in October 2001 on DogFingers Recordings. Again recorded at Tribal Studios in San Antonio, Texas by Chad Garrett and Bobdog Catlin with cover art by James Cobb. October 2003 saw the release of Boxcar Satan's third long player Upstanding and Indigent, again for DogFingers, expanding its already diverse sonic palette by ornamenting its noisy, post-punk take on pre-war blues with touches of Cajun music, gospel and even tasteful prog rock. Honing their songs with a newfound melodicism and complexity, the Boxcars spin tales of train-wreck lives, bandit queen Phoolan Devi and carnival freakshow stars. And their take on the Depression-era song \\"How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live?\\" seems all too appropriate in the current political environment. Recorded after the addition of former Worm, 1.0 and Shit City Dreamgirls drummer Ken Robinson, at Tribal Studios in San Antonio, Texas by Chad Garrett. Cover art by James Cobb. In April 2006 Boxcar Satan released their first DVD collecting videos for seven of their songs by Texas filmmaker Brant Bumpers along with a 10-song live concert. No One at the Wheel features videos for the songs Calamity Jones, Slow Learner, Traveling Man, Best Be Gone, Ghost of a Chance, Pig in a Dress, and Silent and Automatic. It also includes Boxcar Satan's full performance at the San Antonio Contemporary Art Month's 2004 CAM Carnival. It was released on DogFingers Recordings with cover art by James Cobb. In 2007, Boxcar Satan collaborated with \\"folk-punk troubadour\\" Ghostwriter on the full-length CD Hobo Nouveau. The release features songs written both by Ghostwriter and Boxcar Satan in addition to a handful of folk and country covers. It has a more raw feel than previous disks since it was rehearsed and recorded over a four-day period. The band recorded and released another studio CD, Trouble All Its Own, in 2009. The 15-track disk is more of a return to the band's stylistic roots, pairing up raw, swampy blues with abrasive no-wave elements. It includes a cover of Blue Oyster Cult's \\"Dominance and Submission\\", which the band often played at live performances.  Touring & shows  Boxcar Satan has toured the United States numerous times, playing everywhere from smoky dive bars and bingo halls to highbrow art galleries and San Francisco's Church of Satan.

It is produced by BKN and premiered in October 2006 as part of the Jetix block on Toon Disney. Subsequently, the two-part premiere, \\"Trial by Fire\\" was shown as a Jetix Blockbuster on ABC Family in August before all Jetix programming moved to Toon Disney. In the UK, the first 26 episodes have aired across CBBC. It premiered in Summer 2005 on the CBBC channel. The last thirteen episodes of the show aired in Australia on Network Ten's Toasted TV from 19 March 2008 and ended in 2012. Synopsis The show starts when the previous Golden Dragon has passed on to the afterlife and Ang and Ling Leung, seventeen-year-old fraternal twins, born in the year of the Dragon, are next in line for the Golden Dragon power band and user of its mystical abilities to defend the mortal world from evil. Ang has no belief that he will become the Golden Dragon, as Ling is the best fighter at the Dragon dojo. Ling is positive that she will become the Golden Dragon. However, when Master Chin calls upon the power of the Golden Dragon to choose who will be the next golden Dragon, it chooses Ang. Humiliated and furious, Ling storms out of the temple and is tempted by the ultimate dark and evil power of the shadow Dragon. From then on, Ang is forced to fight his own twin sister. In the final episode of Season One, Double Dragon, Ling is overtaken by even greater shadow magic by the revived Emperor of the Darkest Ying, who orders her to win the mystical power-band of the Golden Dragon from Ang. However, Master Chin reveals to Ling that the only way for her to rightfully claim the power-band is to kill him. Horrified, Ling fully breaks free of the darkness that has overwhelmed her so long, as she cannot end her own twin brother. Impressed, Chin says how it was all a test for Ling to follow her true path. He explains that, as Ang's twin sister, she can now become a Golden Dragon herself. Chin merging the both the positive and negative energies of the Golden Dragon power-band and the Shadow Dragon band bestows even greater Dragon Fire power onto Ang and Ling as double Golden Dragons; and are now twice as strong when they work together as one. The second and final season (which consisted of just thirteen episodes) begins with the reformed Ling finally back home as the second Golden Dragon alongside her twin brother. Now they, Chin, and the fellow Guardians of the Tiger and Monkey Temples are ready to put an end to the Zodiac Master and the Emperor of the Darkest Ying once and for all. However, the Emperor is on the move to regroup at the Temple of the Shadow Dragon, but not before he attacks and disintegrates the Temple of the Golden Dragons, leaving Ang and Ling's power- bands on the verge of powerlessness. Luckily, Chin suggests going to long-lost Temple of the Shadow Dragon and utilize its vast amounts of negative energy to rejuvenate their power-bands. As Ling was exposed to the evil energies of the Shadow Dragon for quite some time, she becomes easily tempted by the temple's negative influence on both her mind and spirit. However, with the wisdom of Master Chin, she and Ang successfully recharge their power-bands with no negative effects. Elsewhere, the Emperor manages to release his younger sister Yin Wi, the Guardian of the Shadow Rat, who had been imprisoned by one of the previous Golden Dragons for one thousand years. The two siblings concoct plans to conquer the modern world, and have their vengeance on all twelve guardians of yang; the Golden Dragon in particular. As they head to the Temple of the Shadow Wolf, the heroes get there first and encounter K-Lo, the Shadow Wolf Guardian who was one of Ling's allies during her dark times as the Shadow Dragon and who seems to have quite an interest in her, now that she has become a Golden Dragon. Characters Main characters *Ang Leung (voiced by Alan Marriott) is seventeen years old. He is highly accomplished in martial arts and knows of the ancient philosophies of the Golden Dragon, along with his twin sister, Ling. Ang has always thought that Ling would be the next Golden Dragon, mainly because she is the better fighter. They both go with Master Chin to the Dragon Temple to select the Temple's new Guardian: to the amazement of both twins, the Powerband selects Ang as the next Golden Dragon, not Ling. To power up, Ang must say \\"Empower the Dragon\\". His Powerband is gold colored with an orange-gold gemstone which makes him muscular, lets him shoot orange/gold fire blasts and fly (\\"Dragon Fire\\"). Ang is torn once he finds out that Ling has joined the Zodiac Master and become the Shadow Dragon. Throughout the first season, Ang tries again and again to bring Ling back to the light of yang, but Ling, though she does help him out from time to time, is still bent on getting his Powerband. Ang still strongly cares about her, even if she is working for Zodiac Master. In Season 2, Ling has become the 2nd Golden Dragon making them \\"Double Golden Dragons\\". With new abilities, they can fly, teleport, as well as become a Dragon. Ang's best friends are Xuan Chi, Guardian of the Temple of the Monkeys, as well as Beingal, Guardian of the Temple of the Tigers. Ang likes computer games and music: in fact, he devotes much of his spare time to these activities. *Ling Leung (voiced by Larissa Murray) is seventeen years old. She is highly accomplished in martial arts and knowledgeable of the ancient philosophies of the Golden Dragon. She has a twin named Ang. Ling has always thought that, since she was the better fighter, she would be the next Golden Dragon. When Ang is selected, she is left filled with hatred, depression, anger and humiliation. After leaving the Dragon Dojo, Ling is approached by the Zodiac Master, who asks her to join him with the promise that he will make her a Dragon. Ling agrees and becomes the Shadow Dragon. Her first attack on Ang fails, as he defeats her with one energy blast: she sticks with the Zodiac Master, who is trying to gain at least four of the Powerbands (preferably all of them) and revive the Emperor of Darkest Yin. Ling still cares about her twin brother, even though they are now enemies by her choice. Ling loves animals and will never harm an innocent animal. Her allegiance to the Zodiac Master often wavers based on personal or family issues. Most of the time, she fights for him, but there are occasions when she helps Ang and his friends. To power-up, Ling must say, \\"Empower the Shadow Dragon\\". Her Powerband is a dark blue/gold color. Later, she also becomes a golden Dragon and returns to the side of good, this time when they are together they must say \\"Empower the Double Golden Dragon\\" to power up. Her powerband now looks just like Ang's. In the series finale, \\"The Heart of the Dragon,\\" they can use their \\"Double Golden Dragon\\" powers to turn into a Dragon with two heads, a red body and a golden stomach. Ling's only romantic interest seems to be K-ho the Shadow wolf guardian. Whenever the team needs to split up, Ling is always willing to partner with K-ho. In the last episode, Ling is seen shopping for clothes that K-ho will find attractive. *Beingal (voiced by Lucy Porter 1st season, Elly Fairman 2nd season) is the barefoot Guardian of the Temple of the Tiger. The Temple is hidden on an island far away, deep in the jungle behind a waterfall. The Temple is filled with Tiger statues down each side of the aisle. She is tough and when transformed, she can fire long nails from her hands to injure her enemies. She has fallen in love with Ang, getting very angry when another girl wants to steal Ang away. She is seen to be pretty by all the other temple guardians but Ang does not notice because he has always known her. Throughout the series, subtle hints that something is going to happen between her and Ang are given away. To Power up, Beingal must say, \\"Empower the Tiger\\". Her Powerband is green colored with a red/orange gemstone, gives her Tiger stripes, lets her fire her Tiger claws at her enemies and shoot green power blasts. All of the guardians can shoot power blasts which are the color of their powerbands gemstone. An exception is Beingal whose power blasts are green. *Xuan Chi (voiced by Marc Silk) is the barefoot Guardian of the Temple of the Monkey. He is the only Temple Guardian that does not wear his Powerband, mainly because Temple Raiders raided his Temple and supposedly took his band when they kidnapped him. He escaped from them and went to the Dragon Dojo for help. Later on, he travels back to his temple to discover his Powerband was always there. The Temple Raiders came back to take it, but they lost it and Xuan has since been on a wild goose chase for his Powerband, eventually managing to get it back from the Zodiac Master. During the two-part episode \\"The temple of the shadow Dragon\\" the Emperor of the Darkest Yin, the Zodiac Master and some backup attempt to destroy the Dragon temple so that no one will be able to defeat him in the future. When a power blast from the Emperor and the Double Golden Dragons hit Xuan Chi, the power from these blasts was enough to turn him into a Monkey. His Powerband is white colored with a light green gemstone and gives him extra agility. Xuan loves his bananas and often acts like a Monkey. He is sometimes seen by others as rude and stupid, but he has been Ang's best friend since they met. His role in the series is mostly comedy relief. *Master Chin (voiced by Dan Russell) used to be the Guardian of the Temple of the Pig. He now runs a little dojo/school for younger people to be hopeful future Guardians, such as Ling, Ang and Beingal. He taught Ang and Ling as their personal mentor. He is skilled in fighting and often uses old proverbs to teach Ang and his friends. He teaches Ang how to be the Golden Dragon and how to improve his skills. He is always ready for every attack. Ironically, he taught Zodiac Master before he turned evil. *The Zodiac Master (voiced by Dan Russell) is the main antagonist in season 1 of Legend of the Dragon. He got demoted to a secondary villain when his evil master, the Emperor of the Darkest Yin, immediately took over and deposed his loyal underling to his place. The Zodiac Master's real name is Woo Yin. He was born in the year of the Snake and thought he was going to be the Snake Guardian. Ultimately, the Snake Powerband selected someone different, thus he chose the powers of the darkest yin as a result. His dream is to get all the Powerbands of the Chinese Zodiac, making him invincible. His main goal is clear: Get four Powerbands and revive the Emperor of the Darkest Yin. He mainly goes after the Snake Powerband since he feels it should be his. He has a pet Snake called King Cobra and uses it as a spy or to help him in fights. When empowering a stolen Powerband, like the Snake, he would normally say \\"Empower the Darkest Yin, Snake\\". He is always a great threat to every Guardian, but Ang the Golden Dragon often saves the day. On an interesting note, despite supposedly being very powerful, he is often easily defeated even in situations in which he has the clear advantage (such as having three Powerbands to Ang only using his Dragon Powerband). *The Emperor of the Darkest Ying (voiced by Gary Martin) is the main antagonist from Episodes 26-39 in a total of fourteen episodes. He was the previous shadow Dragon prior to Ling before being locked up and he also has a younger sister named Yin-Wi, the shapeshifting Shadow Rat Guardian. *Lo Wang is the Guardian of the Temple of the Rooster, an excellent strategist. His appearance and voice are based upon a young Sean Connery. His Powerband color is white with a purple/blue gemstone and gives him armor that resembles a Rooster. His character is an obvious parody of James Bond. *Chow (voiced by Dan Russell) is the Guardian of the Temple of the Dog. His Powerband is gold colored with a purple/blue gemstone and gives him more body hair, longer claws and longer teeth. *Shoong is the Guardian of the Temple of the Pig. His Powerband is black colored with a light purple gemstone, makes him more muscular than fat and gives him armor. In one episode, Shoong appears to be Ang and Xuan Chi's Master. Supporting *Ming (voiced by Lucy Porter) is the Guardian of the Temple of the Rat. Her Powerband is black colored with a deep pink gemstone and gives her a long plait like a Rat tail and long metal 'claws' and armour. She also has similar features to the Rat, such as the teeth and her ponytail looking very similar to a Rat tail. The Rat power-band allows Ming to change into whoever she wishes. However this transformation is not perfect as there is always something noticeable one can tell the difference (such as when she turned into a Snake the Gem was seen on the back of her neck, as well as when as Ang she still had her ponytail present). Her counterpart is the Shadow Rat, who happens to be the Ying Emperor's younger sister. *Robbie is the Guardian of the Temple of the Ox. An eight-year-old boy, but when he empowers the Ox, he turns into an older man. His Power-band is gold colored with an orange-pink gemstone and gives him armor with an Ox-horned helmet. *Billy is the current Guardian of the Temple of the Ram. His power-band is gold colored with a turquoise gemstone and makes him look half-Ram half-human with curly Ram horns and rock-like skin, he is able to create small earthquakes. Like all twelve Guardians, he has a natural spiritual connection with past Ram Guardians; such as Ang and Ling's (supposedly) late mother, Me Ying. To activate his power- band, he calls out Empower the Ram!. *Cobra (voiced by Larissa Murray) is the Guardian of the Temple of the Snake. Her Powerband is red colored with a bright yellow gemstone and gives her green, Snake-like skin, as well as venom and a very elasticated body. *Hye is the Guardian of the Temple of the Rabbit. Seeing as she cannot afford to allow herself strong emotions, she cannot quite feel anything much for Ang, but tells Beingal that she is Ang's comrade-in- arms, as well as that she can not ever be replaced. Her Powerband is green colored with an orange gemstone but she is never seen empowered. Her first appearance is in the episode \\"Sister Sister\\". *Mana-Ho is the Guardian of the Temple of the Horse. A tall blonde woman whose laugh is reminiscent of a Horse's whinny. Her powerband color is red colored with a blue gemstone but she is never seen empowered. However, in \\"The Last Dragon\\", the Zodiac Master empowers it along with the Ram band so it probably looks similar to that. *K-Ho (voiced by Alan Marriott) is the Guardian of the Temple of the Shadow Wolf. Ling seems to be head over heels for this handsome young man, but Ang, on the other hand seems to dislike this \\"Lone Wolf\\". K-ho shows some signs that he likes Ling but does not let it interfere with his concentration. He is, unlike most of the Shadow Guardians able to care about the universal balance, not taking over the world. In the later episodes K-ho teaches Ang and Ling skills to be better Dragons, teleporting in particular. His powerband is very similar to the old shadow Dragon band before it was turned to a golden Dragon band, with a dark bluish color. To power up, he must say \\"Empower the Shadow Wolf\\". *Yin Wi (voiced by Elly Fairman) is the Guardian of the Temple of the Shadow Rat and the Emperor's younger sister. She had been imprisoned for thousands of years by an unnamed Golden Dragon of the distant past. *Victor is the Guardian of the Temple of the Shadow Ox. Like the light Ox guardian he is also a kid. *Chang Wo is the Guardian of the Temple of the Shadow Ape. *Sabre-Claw is the Guardian of the Temple of the Shadow Tiger. He is rather cocky but, loyal towards the Emperor of the Darkest Yin. He is convinced that the power of the tiger is the strongest force to come about. He will stop at nothing to obtain Beingal's power band to unite the power of the Tiger, thus doubling his own power. *The Jaguar God is an ancient Mayan god, possibly Bahlam, worshipped by Mayan kings and their subjects, further hinted to with his mortal/human form resembling a long dead Mayan king, which strongly believed in jaguars. He has two other forms which he can transform into without powering up the Shadow Tiger, and later, Tiger bands as well as switch back with ease. His first form is a powerful black/dark greyish-blue jaguar with no spots, slightly resembling the jaguar statue he was summonded/brought back to life from using the Shadow Tiger power band, with black outlined yellow eyes. His second form is a black/dark grey were-jaguar with black spots on the sides of his torso and no tail. He appears in the episode, \\"Spellbound\\", as well as falls in love with Beingal, hypnotizing her so that she becomes his queen consort. *Tex: He is the evil counterpart of the Guardian of the Horse, and is therefore Guardian of the Shadow Stallion Temple. It is not known if Tex is his real name or just an insulting nickname Yin Wi gave him. Similar to K-Ho, he does not want to join forces with the Emperor of the Darkest Ying or Yin Wi, seeming to care more about the universal order and concord. *May Ying: Ang and Ling's mother and the loving wife of the previous Golden Dragon, whose first and last appearance is in Episode 24, Lost and Found. In her younger years, she was the Guardian of the Ram, where she frequently fought alongside the Golden Dragon against the Zodiac Master. In time, she fell madly in love with the powerful Guardian of the Dragon Temple, and he with her. After their marriage and giving birth to her twins Ang and Ling, she chose to step down as Guardian of the Ram to carry out her duties as wife and mother. She was attacked by the Zodiac Master and survived, but forever lost all memory of her husband and twin children. Master Chin had then hid her away to a far off land, where she has been caring for infant goats over the next seventeen years. Although she does not recall her earlier life as Guardian of the Ram Temple, the mystical power-band recognized her as its previous wearer and shielded her from the Zodiac Master's evil magic. *May Ying's Husband/Ang and Ling's Father: He was the previous Guardian of the Golden Dragon Temple, and defender of the world from the Zodiac Master and any other adversaries, whom his own twin son has now succeeded. He eventually befriended and, as time went on, fell in love with the Guardian of the Ram Temple, May Yin. As his twin children began training with Chin, he showed deep concern for their very lives, knowing that his enemies would try to use young Ang and Ling to get to him. Therefore, he had made Chin magically erase all recollection of him from his only children. In The Last Dragon he appeared before his twin son in a vision, telling him to \\"watch, listen and learn\\". The hard truth about his actions are revealed in flashbacks between Ang and Ling when they finally regain their childhood memories of their late father. His name remains unknown.

She attempted once before but Jack caught her and made her promise not to try again. She agreed but asked him not to tell his father. He has suffered intermittent guilt for not preventing her death and wishes he had told his father. At age 18, he enlisted in the U.S. Army (at his father's urging) and served for six years in the 82nd Airborne Division before returning to Pittsburgh, suffering from depression. Jack tried to commit suicide once at age 25 by driving his car into a telephone pole, but when asked about it, he claims that he fell asleep at the wheel. His wife, who knows the truth, later uses this information against Jack. Having taken a year off after leaving the service, Jack returned to college, where he received his bachelor's and his master's degree in psychology. Without a Trace His marriage imploded after he had an affair with his subordinate, Agent Samantha Spade (Poppy Montgomery), and because of his long work hours. Although he later returned to his wife Maria, a lawyer, she left him at the end of the second season, moved to Chicago, and obtained full custody of their two daughters, Hannah and Kate (Vanessa Marano and Laura Marano). Jack's long work hours and troubled family history was used against him during the custody battle, though in the end he decided it would be better for them if they stayed with their mother. He still remains in close contact with the girls but struggles with his relationship with Hannah. Hannah resents him for the divorce and frequently refuses to speak to him. He is concerned about the future of his relationships with his daughters. In the fourth season, Jack dealt with the death of his father (played by Martin Landau) from Alzheimer's Disease and started a new relationship with Anne (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), the widow of a fellow agent. Soon after they started dating, he learned that Anne was pregnant, which was an unpleasant surprise to both of them. In the fifth season, Jack is dealing with the aftermath of a hostage standoff involving Anne and with her unexpected pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage. The miscarriage abruptly ends their relationship. In Season 6, Jack is dealing with a human trafficking for a good part of the season. During the middle part of the season, Jack is shot by the leader of the human trafficking ring Franklin Romar. He is left for dead, but the rest of his team finds Jack and Romar is arrested. Jack is left to recover in the hospital when he finds out that one of the victims he felt attached to is being targeted by one of Romar's men. Jack leaves the hospital to search of the girl. He finds her just in time before she is again abducted. In the season finale, Jack is demoted for his handling of the human trafficking investigation. In the season seven premiere (Closure, 7x01), Jack has been replaced by Special Agent Clark Medina (played by Steven Weber). Jack was offered another job and considered taking it, but turned it down. A few episodes later, Clark gets Jack his job back before leaving for a better job. Over the last episodes of the 6th season and the first episodes of the seventh season Jack and Sam began to grow closer. In episode eight (Better Angels, 7x08), Jack and Sam headed to Los Angeles for a case, and rekindled their relationship. Also revealed in the episode is that Jack's daughter Hannah has been acting up and is going to come to New York to live with Jack. Reception As of 2004, Jack Malone was named one of the 10 best current characters by Zap2it.

The 147th episode overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 4, 2006. In the episode, named in a play on words after the 1960s counterculture slogan \\"Make love, not war\\", Cartman, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny enjoy playing the popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft. When a high- level player goes around killing other players in the game, they start playing the game every day to try to stop him. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. In 2015, he and co-creator Matt Stone listed it as their third favorite episode of the series. Despite worries from Trey Parker near the end of production, the episode went on to receive critical acclaim, with critics praising its lampooning of nerd culture, and is considered by many fans and critics as one of the best episodes of the series. The episode additionally went on to win a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for programming less than one hour). Plot A griefer repeatedly kills Cartman, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny's characters in the online game World of Warcraft. Stan's father, Randy, becomes interested in the game, but does not survive long before being killed by the griefer, a high-ranking player character who kills other player characters at will; the griefer in reality is a middle-aged obese man who represents the stereotypical comic book, PC gamer nerd. Cartman gathers all the kids of South Park and convinces them all to log in at the same time in order to execute a retaliatory attack on the griefer. However, once the battle begins, the griefer summons giant scorpions and easily dispatches the kids' characters. This causes everyone to lose hope and stop playing except for Cartman, who, after calculating exactly how much time it would take for him, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny to gain as many experience points as the griefer, convinces them to keep playing as well. For the next two months, the boys play the game for 21 hours a day, killing low- level boars in the game's forests to gain experience points. In the process, the boys become lazy, long-haired, obese (morbidly in Cartman's case), and acne-ridden. The boys' characters earn experience points so quickly that the Blizzard Entertainment executives, who have also been monitoring the griefer but have been unable to close the account due to the ridiculously high level, take notice and believe they might have a chance. Determined to help the boys slay the griefer, the executives decide to give the boys the Sword of a Thousand Truths, a weapon so powerful that it was removed from the game and stored on a 1 GB USB flash drive. A man in accounting had actually foretold a prophecy of a group of characters who would show themselves worthy of wielding it. Unaware of the executives' plan however, the boys have already initiated what becomes a seventeen-hour battle against the griefer. The executives arrive at Stan's house with the flash drive, unaware that the boys are actually at Cartman's house. Randy tells the executives that he can log in with the sword and give it to the boys' characters online. Eventually logging onto a demo of the game at a Best Buy, Randy gives Stan the weapon, but Randy's character is mortally wounded by the griefer in the process. Enraged, Stan attacks the griefer with the sword, draining his shields and mana spells, allowing Kyle and Kenny to attack with effect. Cartman approaches him and proceeds to smash the griefer's head with a hammer (much to the man's shock). Numerous World of Warcraft players celebrate the griefer's demise, praising the boys as heroes. As Stan contemplates what they do now, Cartman says, \\"What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.\\" With Cartman making suggestions to boost their characters, the boys begin playing the game as they originally intended. Production Machinima was used extensively in \\"Make Love, Not Warcraft\\". Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny's characters stand above the slain griefer. The episode uses machinima in many of its scenes to create a better emulation of the game. It was originally scheduled to air as the 145th episode, but was delayed because of difficulties in creating the machinima. Collaboration South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone collaborated with Blizzard Entertainment to craft the machinima used in the episode. They stated in their commentary for the episode that they were completely shocked that the company was on board to help them out. The machinima scenes were created using shots of the in-game footage, and re- creation of the characters in Maya, with Blizzard Entertainment providing their own character models and computers to test with. Blizzard also gave the producers permission to use the alpha server of the expansion pack World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade on which to shoot the scenes. Michael Morhaime, president and co-founder of Blizzard Entertainment, issued a statement over the collaboration: > \\"We were excited to hear that the creators of South Park were interested in > featuring World of Warcraft in the opening of their new season, and we > really enjoyed collaborating with them to make this happen. We're looking > forward to sharing the experience with our employees and our players as well > when the season debuts this week.\\" As a reference to the episode, certain South Park Season 10 DVDs include a 14-day free trial for World of Warcraft. This did not affect the UK release of this season in 2009. Since the airing of the episode, the fictitious Sword of a Thousand Truths was featured in the World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade beta test as a reward to the game's arena system, although it did not have the same capabilities as in the episode. The episode features the song \\"Live to Win\\" by KISS vocalist Paul Stanley. Production length Although the planning of the episode and data-collecting began on September 1, 2006, the actual production of the machinima was done in five \\"shooting\\" days, the first being September 20, 2006, which lasted about 3‚Äì5 hours, and the last being October 3, 2006, the day before the episode aired. The regular South Park animation was created simultaneously, with all the other non-machinima episodes of the series routinely finishing within 12 hours of their airing as well. Parker was deeply unhappy with the episode the day before its broadcast, telling to the show's producers, \\"I've lost it. I don't know how to do this anymore.\\" He begged executive producer Anne Garefino to call Comedy Central and inform them that the show would not air, remarking, \\"I don't want the South Park legacy to be ruined, and this show is going to ruin it, because it's so bad.\\" Parker went home unable to sleep and was surprised the following day that the episode was so well received. Reciprocation In patch 3.0.2, preceding the release of the World of Warcraft expansion pack, Wrath of the Lich King, Blizzard included a \\"Make Love, Not Warcraft\\" PvP achievement, gained by using the \\"hug\\" emote on a dead enemy before they release their spirit. The fictitious video game played by Butters, Hello Kitty: Island Adventure, was referenced in a 2008 April Fools' Day joke by the actual MMORPG Hello Kitty Online, announcing an \\"Island Adventure\\" expansion for the game, boasting a reduction of content rather than an \\"expansion\\", leaving players stranded on a tropical island. Also, in the Wrath of the Lich King remake of the Naxxramas raid instance, a sword called Slayer of the Lifeless was added, bearing the flavour text \\"Foretold by Salzman\\", as a reference to Salzman from accounting and a weapon capable of killing that which has no life. The model of the weapon is the same as the one used for the Sword of a Thousand Truths. Reception \\"Make Love, Not Warcraft\\" received critical acclaim. IGN, a multimedia news and reviews website, reviewed the episode and gave it an overall rating of 9.3, labeling it as \\"one of the funniest episodes ever produced\\". The original television airing of the episode drew 3.4 million viewers, most between the ages of 18 and 49. This popularity made the episode Comedy Central's highest-rated midseason premiere since the year 2000.TV/Radio notes, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, October 12, 2006 However, the highest ratings for the tenth season belong to the season's premiere, \\"The Return of Chef\\", which drew more than 3.5 million viewers. In 2007, this episode won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour). Fans voted the episode into 1st place in a major 2011 South Park voting held under the \\"Year of the Fan\\" iTunes promotion. Home release \\"Make Love, Not Warcraft\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Parks tenth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 21, 2007. The set includes brief audio commentaries by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for each episode.

Formed in 1980 by previous members of an earlier band, The Leyton Buzzards, the band achieved a string of UK chart hits before the original band broke up in 1985. Andy Kyriacou reformed the band in 1999 who continue to perform the band's music. Band history Geoffrey Deane and David Jaymes formed Modern Romance in 1980, having previously been the mainstays of the punk parody band the Leyton Buzzards which they formed in 1977. The band split up in 1980 though Deane and Jaymes continued working together, embracing the burgeoning electronic style of dance music that was becoming popular in London clubs at the time. They found a new manager and created a limited company called Business Art Productions, and signed to WEA. In 1980, their first release, eponymously titled \\"Modern Romance\\", was unsuccessful. After a second unsuccessful single, \\"Tonight\\", the band then opted to lessen the predominantly electronic sound in favour of a Latin-American dance style with emphasis on bass, percussion and brass. They recruited trumpet player John Du Prez into their new line-up. The band released a new single, \\"Everybody Salsa\\" in summer 1981, which reached the UK Top 20. However, prior to the release, they recruited a new drummer, Andy Kyriacou, who began promoting the single with the band, and in fact set up their first personal appearance in a club. They followed this later in the year with similarly themed \\"Ay Ay Ay Ay Moosey\\", which reached the UK Top 10. Despite these two hits, the band's debut album, Adventures in Clubland, was not a success. However, in the US they scored a number 2 hit on the Billboard Dance chart with \\"Can You Move\\", a mostly rap variation of \\"Everybody Salsa\\". After further UK Top 40 hits with \\"Queen of the Rapping Scene\\" and a cover of the 1955 hit \\"Cherry Pink And Apple Blossom White\\", Deane departed the band in 1982 to pursue solo projects. Michael J. Mullins took over the mantle of lead vocalist, and their next release saw the band reach their highest UK chart position with \\"Best Years of Our Lives\\" in late 1982. Further hits followed in 1983: \\"High Life\\" (UK No. 8), \\"Don't Stop That Crazy Rhythm\\" (UK No. 14), and the ballad \\"Walking in the Rain\\" (UK No. 7). Both \\"Best Years of Our Lives\\" and \\"Walking in the Rain\\" earned Silver discs. Despite being regularly featured in teen pin-up magazines, the band's commercial hot streak waned and further singles were less successful. The band released a compilation album for the Christmas 1983 market entitled Party Tonight. Though it only peaked at No. 45 in the UK, it became their most successful album and was certified Gold for sales in excess of 100,000 copies within six weeks of release. John Du Prez then left the band, and after disagreements with their record company, WEA, the band signed with RCA in 1984. This brought about a change of image ‚Äì from bright coloured suits and wedge hairstyles to long hair and leather jackets. The band released a new single, a cover of The Temptations' 1971 hit \\"Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)\\", but the single was not a success. Modern Romance released a final album, Burn It!, in 1985. The album was received poorly and the band called it quits after releasing the stand-alone single \\"Tarzan Boy\\" ‚Äì a cover of the Baltimora hit from earlier that year ‚Äì and an anthology mix of their biggest selling songs titled Best Mix of Our Lives (also 1985). Post career After leaving Modern Romance, former lead vocalist Geoff Deane reappeared in 1983 as 'Geoff Deane & The Valley Girls' to release the single \\"Navy Lark\\", then again for the solo \\"What About Romance\\", and he also wrote \\"You Think You're A Man\\" for Divine. Deane later became a scriptwriter and television producer, scripting for television programmes such as Birds of a Feather, Babes in the Wood, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, Chef!, Last Man Standing, and A Many-Splintered Thing. In 2005 he wrote the film Kinky Boots starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, and a year later It's a Boy Girl Thing for Elton John's Rocket Pictures. David Jaymes has since moved into the management and consultancy side of the music industry. He worked as the music supervisor on the film Fascination (2004) starring Jacqueline Bisset and James Naughton. He has also worked again with John Du Prez, composing music for commercials and feature films. Jaymes has managed artists such as Sin√©ad O'Connor, Justin Adams, Miles Hunt of The Wonder Stuff, Republica and Drum Club. He has also worked as consultant for Harry Nilsson, Jimmy Webb, George Fenton, and Chuck Mangione. In 2010 he worked with a host of musicians on the Haiti earthquake disaster single (a cover version of \\"I Put a Spell on You\\"), including Shane MacGowan, Nick Cave, Chrissie Hynde and Johnny Depp. In 1999, Andy Kyriacou reformed Modern Romance with a new line-up, joining the burgeoning British 1980s revival scene. The new line-up features no original band members (Kyriacou himself had first appeared on the Modern Romance single, \\"Ay Ay Ay Ay Moosey\\", although he had remained their drummer until the band split in 1985). In 2002, the new line-up released the album, Back on Track, which consisted mostly of re-recorded Modern Romance hits. Back on Track was also released as Moves 2 Fast, with a slightly different track listing. Andy Kyriacou's Modern Romance continues to play the 1980s festival circuit and appeared as the opening act at the 2010 Rewind Festival in Henley-on-Thames, which also included Boy George, Rick Astley, Level 42, T'Pau, Kajagoogoo and Heaven 17. 2012 saw the band play Let's Rock The Moor, a boutique festival in Cookham, Berkshire, England, with other 1980s acts including Go West, Toyah, Nick Heyward and Billy Ocean. During their set they aired one of their new songs, \\"Rhythm Is My Lover\\", from the forthcoming album The 7th Day (penned by Kyriacou and guitarist Peter J Pinto). In 2019, Kyriacou successfully defeated an attempt by Geoff Deane to appropriate the band's name by trademarking it, despite his absence from the band for 36 years. The Intellectual Property Office ruled that Geoff Deane's involvement with the band ended in 1982 and with it any claim to the name.

Plot Fifteen-year-old Matt Freeman is the youngest member to be inducted into his school's Honor Society. His hard-working, middle-class parents, Dan, and Susan Freeman are thrilled that they have one good child as they are trying to control their older rebellious daughter, Alex. During math class, Matt meets Francesca Howell, daughter of the rich Dr. & Juliana Howell. Seeing she is struggling in mathematics, Matt offers to tutor her. Very quickly, Francesca & Matt develop feelings for each other and eventually start going out. Francesca admits to Matt that she already had sex with other people, finding it to be a stress reliever from having to live up to her parents' high expectations. One day after school, Matt ditches his best friend, Blair, goes over to Francesca's house and has sex with her. The next day, he admits to Francesca that he isn't ready for that kind of relationship, and asks to remain good friends. Not long after, Francesca noticed that she is gaining weight and struggles to keep it hidden from her parents, especially her mother, who is overly critical of her appearance. A few days later, she tells Matt her period is late, walks to a nearby convenience store, where Matt steals a pregnancy test, which comes back positive. Francesca's parents quickly notice something is wrong with her but thinks she is on drugs. Her father finally realizes what is wrong when he sees her throwing up one morning. Dr. Howell calls Matt's mother, who is completely shocked and angry, but is quick to assure Matt that she loves him. Matt tells Blair, who is quick to blame Francesca for the pregnancy and confides to Matt that she is worried that what happened will destroy their friendship. Susan calls Dan, who is on a business trip and is unable to make it back in time to meet with the Howells. At the meeting, the Howells explain that Francesca is five months pregnant, so the pregnancy cannot be terminated. He also explains that their health insurance covers prenatal care up to 80%, leaving the Freemans to pay the rest. More importantly, Dr. Howell explains to Matt that he believes a closed adoption in an out-of-state placement is the only way to provide the baby with a good solid home and to give both Matt and Francesca their lives back. Matt seems hesitant about placing his child for adoption but reluctantly agrees when his mother explains it is the only way to safeguard his future. A little later, Susan receives a call from Matt's school principal informing her that Matt and Francesca are being involuntarily transferred to a local alternative school for teenage parents, as per school policy. Susan begs the principal not to remove Matt, citing how much he loves school and how upsetting it would be to him and his academic future. The principal sets up a meeting for Susan and Matt to present their case. All around tensions become high. Dr. Howell is not allowing Matt to see Francesca, Alex is clashing with her parents who are insisting she go to college instead of taking a year off to work, and his parents are struggling to help pay Francesca's prenatal care expenses. Much to his mother's shock and fury, at his school appeal meeting, Matt tells his principal that he wants to transfer to the alternative school with Francesca. He tries to explain to his mother that he feels obligated to go and that he will now be able to get a job to help pay the bills. Matt gets a job at a pizza parlor, but tensions in the family still continue to increase. Matt excels at his job, even though his boss forces him to work later than is legally allowed. Though he gives all of his earnings to his parents, the bills remain high, so Matt starts selling his video games to make extra money. Quickly noticing how tired he is, Matt's mother demands that he keep some of his wages for emergencies and allow her to bring him to and from work every day. She tells Matt how proud she is of him for the way he has acted since Francesca became pregnant. Closer to Francesca's due date, the Howells and Freemans meet with a lawyer, who asks Matt and Francesca to sign papers agreeing to surrender the baby to an adoption agency. The lawyer explains that the child's birth certificate will be re-issued to show only the adoptive parents, with no mention of any adoption. Matt, who has been struggling with placing his child, reluctantly signs the paper. One night, when Matt catches his mother looking through his baby book, he admits that he can't stand knowing that he will never see any pictures of - or even know - his baby. Matt's mother understands and asks Dan if he would consider helping Matt raise the baby. Dan is hesitant, saying that the family made a decision and they would have to stick with it. Meanwhile, Susan and Dan mend relations with Alex and apologize for making her feel like a loser because her dreams and goals differ from their intended plans for her. In mid-June, Dr. Howell calls the Freemans to tell them Francesca is going into labor. Dan warns Susan not to go with Matt to the hospital because they'll both get too attached to the baby, but Susan and Matt go anyway. At the hospital, Dr. Howell explains, rather rudely, that Francesca gave birth to a baby girl and didn't want to hold the baby. He tells them the baby is in the nursery and will remain there until she is given to her adoptive parents. Susan and Matt go to the nursery to see her, and Matt immediately falls in love with the baby. Dr. Howell is furious to see Matt holding the baby since Matt has technically signed away his parental rights. Susan tells Dr. Howell that Matt has every right to see his baby and reminds him that the adoption won't be final for six months. Back at the house, Alex convinces her father to go with her to the hospital to see the baby. With the family all together at the nursery, Matt begs his parents to let him keep his daughter, and both agree without hesitation. Matt goes back to the lawyer and gets his parental rights returned. He names his new daughter Genevieve and brings her home, where she receives a warm welcome from Susan, Dan, Alex, and Blair. Cast and characters *Paul Dano as Matt Freeman, Genevieve's father.

Weidemann had started in 1864 as manager of one of the pioneer companies in Trondheim. Weidemann resigned from his manager position in 1871 and founded Trondhjems mekaniske V√¶rksted the following year.Sophus August Weidemann The company grew gradually until the turn of the century, when it had over 700 employees and was one of Norway's largest companies. For many years TMV was the biggest employer in Trondheim. When Germany invaded Norway in 1940 it pressed TMV into war service. German authorities seized the ship , which TMV had launched in 1939 and was completing for a British shipping company, and assigned it to the Deutsche Dampfschiffahrts- Gesellschaft \\"Hansa\\" (DDG Hansa). In 1960 the Norwegian holding company Aker bought the majority of TMV's shares, merging them into the Aker Group. The company was closed in 1983. The former location of the company's shipbuilding business is still referred to as TMV by some citizens of Trondheim. The site currently houses the offices of the Nedre Elvehavn borough of Trondheim. The entire area has been subject to an urban renewal project. Solsiden shopping centre was built on the grounds in October 2000, and the surrounding area now has several apartment buildings and a hotel. The history of the area as a shipyard is preserved; the dry docks, many of the company buildings and even some of the shipbuilding equipment (such as a large crane) is still present. When a pedestrian bridge connecting Nedre Elvehavn to the city centre of Trondheim was built in 2003, it was named Verftsbrua, meaning \\"the (ship)yard bridge\\".

Biography Starobinski was born in Geneva, Switzerland. He studied classical literature, and then medicine at the University of Geneva, and graduated from that school with a doctorate in letters (Docteur √®s lettres) and in medicine. He taught French literature at the Johns Hopkins University, the University of Basel and at the University of Geneva, where he also taught courses in the history of ideas and the history of medicine. His existential and phenomenological literary criticism is sometimes grouped with the so- called \\"Geneva School\\". He wrote landmark works on French literature of the 18th century - including works on the writers Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot, Voltaire - and also on authors of other periods (such as Michel de Montaigne). He has also written on contemporary poetry, art, and the problems of interpretation. His books have been translated in dozens of languages. His knowledge of medicine and psychiatry brought him to study the history of melancholia (notably in the Trois Fureurs, 1974). He was the first scholar to publish work (in 1964) on Ferdinand de Saussure's study of anagrams.

Early life Halsey Lewis Hall was born in New York City's Greenwich Village on May 23, 1898.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 18 His parents initially named him Smith Lewis Hall, but subsequently renamed him \\"Halsey\\" after his paternal grandfather, Halsey R.W. Hall.Thornley, Holy Cow!, pp. 13, 18 Halsey Lewis Hall was the son of Smith B. Hall, a prominent Minneapolis newspaperman, and the New York stage actress Mary Hall. His great-uncle, Harlan P. Hall, founded the St. Paul Dispatch, which later merged with the St. Paul Pioneer Press. Hall's parents divorced when he was a small child and he was raised by his father's family in Minnesota. He spent his early years in the Ramsey Hill neighborhood of St. Paul. When he was eight, the family moved to Portland Avenue in Minneapolis.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 24 In June 1916, Hall graduated from Central High School in Minneapolis.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 26 After briefly attending the University of Minnesota, he joined the United States Navy during World War I. He spent his time in the service as a recruiter in Duluth, Minnesota. Sports writing career After his discharge from the Navy, Hall followed in the footsteps of his father and great-uncle and became a newspaper journalist. He began his career as a sports reporter for the Minneapolis Tribune in September 1919.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 29 He moved to the St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1922 and then in 1926 he took a position as a sportswriter for the Minneapolis Journal.Thornley, Holy Cow!, pp. 32-33 Hall developed a large readership for his sports writing, especially his baseball writing. In 1927 he became the Minneapolis Journal's baseball beat writer covering the Minneapolis Millers, a AAA minor league baseball club.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 35 Although the Twin Cities did not have a Major League Baseball team until the Twins arrived in 1961, Hall covered the World Series for the Minneapolis Journal in the 1920s and 1930s.Thornley, Holy Cow!, pp. 39-43 Hall witnessed Babe Ruth's famous \\"called shot\\" home run at Wrigley Field during Game 3 of the 1932 World Series between the New York Yankees and the Chicago Cubs.Thornley, Holy Cow!, pp. 42-43 In 1934 Hall received one of the great honors of his career when he was elected president of the American Association of Baseball Writers.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 44 Hall's tenure at the Minneapolis Journal ended in 1939 when the newspaper was purchased by John Cowles, Sr. After acquiring the Journal, Cowles merged it with the Minneapolis Star, thus creating the Minneapolis Star-Journal. Cowles would rename the newspaper the Minneapolis Star in 1947. Hall nevertheless remained a prominent and featured sports writer under the new ownership.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 48 In 1941 Cowles purchased the Minneapolis Tribune. With the Star and Tribune both owned by the Cowles family, Hall wrote a sports column for both newspapers until 1960.Thornley, Holy Cow!, pp. 49, 57 He gave up his Star and Tribune sports columns to become the full-time television and radio broadcaster of the Minnesota Twins.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 57 Sports broadcasting career In the spring of 1934 Hall became the radio broadcaster of the Minneapolis Millers.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 66 Hall announced Millers games for the next 27 years. During home games, he called the radio play-by- play from the press box at Nicollet Park, the team's home stadium. Like most radio broadcasters of the day, he did not travel with the team. Instead, he announced the Millers road games from WCCO's Minneapolis studio, reading the Western Union wire account of the game into a radio microphone.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 67 But Hall's impassioned description of events gave listeners the impression he was watching the game in person. In the fall of 1934 Hall became the radio broadcaster of the Minnesota Gophers football team. Over the years Hall announced the games on KSTP radio, WCCO, and WLOL.Hartman, Sid!, p. 230Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 70 He also hosted a Sunday morning radio show with Gopher Football Coach Bernie Bierman.Hartman, Sid!, p. 229 Hall broadcast Gopher football games for nearly 40 years, retiring after the 1973 season.Thornley, Holy Cow!, pp. 69-70 Although Hall continued to write for the Minneapolis Tribune and the Minneapolis Star, radio broadcasting became his principal focus by the 1950s.Hartman, Sid!, p. 231 Sid Hartman, a legendary Minnesota sports writer, served as Hall's sports editor at the Tribune. Although Hartman and Hall were close friends, Hartman did not like supervising Hall. \\"Deadlines did not mean a thing to Halsey,\\" Hartman recalled years later. In the 1940s and 1950s, Hall served as the sports anchor for the 10 p.m. news on WCCO radio alongside the news anchor, Cedric Adams. The Adams- Hall news program was exceptionally popular, commanding 70% of the radio audience in the state. According to Sid Hartman, \\"Airplane pilots would report that, flying over the Minnesota prairie, they could tell when it was 10:30 P.M. That was when the 'CCO news was over and the lights in all the farm houses would go out.\\" When the Washington Senators moved to Bloomington and became the Minnesota Twins in 1961, Hall was a member of the original WCCO radio broadcast team and WTCN television broadcast team along with Ray Scott and Bob Wolff.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 75 When Wolff left in 1962 to cover NBC's national baseball game of the week, Herb Carneal joined the Hall and Scott broadcast team. When Scott left to become the lead NFL announcer for CBS television, Merle Harmon joined the Hall-Carneal broadcast team. Unlike his radio career with the Millers, Hall broadcast in person Twins road games as well as home games at Metropolitan Stadium. He reveled both in announcing Twins games and in traveling with the team across the country.Hartman, Sid!, p. 232 As Sid Hartman put it, \\"Halsey was in heaven. He loved baseball, he loved the radio, and he loved the fact he was able to drink for free on the road.\\" A cigar smoker, Hall accidentally set his sport coat on fire during a 1968 Twins broadcast at Comiskey Park in Chicago. Jerry Zimmerman, the Twins catcher, said afterwards, \\"Halsey's the only man I know who can turn a sports coat into a blazer.\\" Hall retired from Twins broadcasts after the 1972 season. Family In 1922 Hall married Sula Bornman in London, Wisconsin.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 115 Sula's brother, a Moravian minister, presided at the wedding ceremony. The daughter of German immigrants, Sula grew up in Pennsylvania.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 113 Her father died when she was four, and her mother died when she was 13. Upon her mother's death, Sula moved to North Dakota to live with her sister, Katie Marcks. A graduate of Fargo High School and Moorhead Normal School, Sula was a school teacher. She met Halsey in Duluth when she was teaching at Fairmount Elementary School and he was a Navy recruiter.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 114 After their marriage, Halsey and Sula lived in the same house on Ramona Avenue (later renamed Alabama Avenue) in St. Louis Park for 55 years, until Halsey Hall's death. They had a daughter, Suzanne \\"Sue\\" Eugenia Hall, who was born in 1928.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 193 Sue Hall married William \\"Bill\\" Charles Kennedy in 1949 at Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church in Minneapolis.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 123 Sue and Bill Kennedy had three children--William Halsey Kennedy, Kathryn Sula Kennedy, and Cynthia Eugenia Kennedy--and raised their family on Sunnyside Road in Edina, not far from Halsey and Sula's home.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 123-4 Catch phrases Halsey Hall originated the huzzah \\"Holy cow!\\" as a home run exclamation on WCCO radio long before Harry Caray and Phil Rizzuto used it.Thornley, Holy Cow!, pp. 7-8 Hall also originated the practice of adding \\"Golden\\" before \\"Gophers\\" when describing the University of Minnesota's football and basketball teams. Hall was inspired by the golden uniforms the Gopher football team adopted under Coach Bernie Bierman in the 1930s.Ray Christensen, Tales from the Minnesota Golden Gophers Golden Gophers is now the official name of the University's athletic teams. Death and legacy Halsey Hall died of a heart attack at his home on December 30, 1977. He was buried at Fort Snelling National Cemetery. After his death, he was voted the most popular Minnesota sportscaster of the 1970s. As his biographer Stew Thornley explained, \\"Halsey Hall was an institution\\" for Minnesota sports fans.Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 3 In the words of Minnesota Twins Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew, Halsey Hall \\"was the most unforgettable man I ever knew.\\"Thornley, Holy Cow!, p. 9 Hall was inducted into the Minnesota Sports Hall of Fame in 1989. In 2001 he was inducted into the Minnesota Broadcasting Hall of Fame. The Minnesota chapter of the Society for American Baseball Research is named after Halsey Hall. Twenty years after Hall's death, Sid Hartman observed that \\"Halsey Hall was the most beloved character this area has ever had.\\" References Further reading * Sid Hartman, Sid!

Buildings There are four divisions within the entire campus: The Thacher Building (preschool‚Äìkindergarten) named for former headmaster Nick Thacher; The Welles Building (Grades 1‚Äì4; also called \\"Lower School\\"); The Middle School (Grades 5‚Äì6); and The Stevens Building (Grades 7‚Äì9; also called \\"Upper School\\"), as well as one administrative and functional building, the Grace House, or Main Building. The ninth grade year is a unique pre-preparatory program that emphasizes teaching leadership and independent thinking skills. A fully staffed placement office works with students to coordinate placement in top boarding and day schools. The Stevens Building was opened in September, 2007, with science labs, art studios, and expanded classroom and meeting facilities for use by students in Grades 7‚Äì9. The building was recognized by the U.S. Green Building Council with the LEED (Leadership in Energy Efficient Design) Silver Award. On Earth Day, Senator Judith Freeman presented a proclamation from Governor Jodi Rell in recognition of its being the greenest school building in the state of Connecticut. History New Canaan Country School was founded as the Community School in 1916, under the leadership of co-principals, Miss Effie Dunton and Miss Edith Dudley. Ten members of the Board of Trustees administered the school, assisted by teachers‚Äô and mothers‚Äô committees. This tradition of parent support and involvement has been the wellspring of the school's vitality and perhaps is its most valued heritage. In 1936, the Community School moved to Ponus Ridge and established itself as the New Canaan Country School. Soon after, Henry Welles became headmaster and set the school on a course that has always been directed toward the ‚Äúpursuit of excellence.‚Äù Henry Welles retired in 1963 and was succeeded by George E. Stevens. Under his resourceful direction, the school's curriculum and organization were gradually changed to meet the needs of modern life. Mr. Stevens was also instrumental in the creation of the Horizons Student Enrichment Program and helped the school to focus greater efforts toward enrolling students from diverse backgrounds. In 1979, Nicholas S. Thacher became the school's third headmaster. During Mr. Thacher's tenure, the school's enrollment reached 500 students. In 1994, Country School was recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as a National Exemplary ‚ÄúBlue Ribbon‚Äù School for Excellence in Education. In 2000, Timothy R. Bazemore was named the school's fourth head. Under his leadership, the school's enrollment, faculty, and commitment to excellence have been as strong as ever. In 2007, in recognition of the school's environmental commitment, the first LEED-certified building opened on campus. Throughout its history, Country School has emphasized the value of childhood and the role of experience in learning. For nearly 100 years, teachers have blended an outstanding academic program with an appreciation for patience, simplicity and the power of imagination. The longstanding tradition of parent support and involvement continues to be a vital element of the school. The character and accomplishments of New Canaan Country School alumni provide powerful testimony to the success of the school's approach.

Walker also in 1834. The early history of Milwaukee was marked by the rivalry between Juneautown and Kilbourntown, mostly due to the actions of Byron Kilbourn. Kilbourn had been trying to isolate Juneautown to make it more dependent on Kilbourntown. For example, when he laid out his street grid in 1835, he paid no attention to the existing street layout of Juneautown. Kilbourn's maps showed Juneautown as a blank space, and when steamers delivered goods to Kilbourn's west side docks, he ordered the captains to tell passengers that Juneautown was an Indian trading post. The three areas were incorporated into the village of Milwaukee in 1839. The bridges In 1840, the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature, finding the ferry system on the Milwaukee River to be \\"inadequate\\", ordered the construction of a bridge. This first bridge was built over Chestnut Street (now Juneau), with Solomon Juneau's support. That same year Kilbourn built a bridge across the Menominee River. Three more bridges were built over the Milwaukee: at Spring Street (now Wisconsin) in 1842, at Oneida (now Wells) in 1844, and one between Walker's Point and Juneautown at North Water Street. Kilbourn was opposed to the Chestnut, Oneida, and North Water bridges, as he felt they would be a hazard to ships visiting his docks. The war On 3 May 1845, a schooner rammed into the Spring Street bridge which was supported by Kilbourn's west ward. Rumors spread that east ward residents, angry at the west warders for refusing to pay for bridge maintenance, had paid the schooner's captain to damage the Spring Street bridge. West warders held a meeting and decided that the Chestnut Street bridge (supported by Solomon Juneau) had become an \\"insupportable nuisance\\". The west warders gathered tools and took down the west half of the Chestnut street bridge, collapsing it. Angry east warders gathered weapons, included an old cannon (loaded only with clock weights) that they rolled up to the east side of the river. The cannon was aimed at Kilbourn's home, but the east warders held their fire when they learned that Kilbourn's young daughter had just died. The village trustees voted to remove the Oneida bridge and use the pieces to repair the Spring Street bridge. This would have removed both of the east warder's preferred bridges. Angered by this, east warders gathered on 28 May and destroyed the Spring Street bridge, followed by the bridge on the Menominee. The next few weeks were tense: east and west warders on the \\"wrong side\\" of the river were attacked and injured, east warders spread rumors of an attack on Kilbourn's Milwaukee river dam, and by early June the trustees ordered that all bridge work be done under armed guard. Tempers slowly cooled as the year went on. In December, the trustees put together a plan for three new bridges, and drafted a city charter. Finally, on 31 January 1846, the city of Milwaukee was formed. An echo of the differences between east and west Milwaukee can still be seen today. Many of the modern bridges across the Milwaukee River run at an angle, reflecting the difference in the street layouts between what was once Juneautown and Kilbourntown.

It operated from 1991 until September 30, 2006, when it became the first people-mover system in Japan to cease operations. History The planning of the line started in 1971 along with the planning of T≈çkadai New Town, a planned city outside Komaki designed for 54,000 people. The decision to choose a people mover system was made in 1974, with a projected ridership of 43,000 passengers per day (ppd) and a budget of 24.5 billion yen, and a second stage to K≈çz≈çji planned. However, in 1978, the town's planned size was cut down to 47,000 people and the ridership estimate was cut to 23,000 ppd. Construction started in 1981 based on this estimate. In 1984, the town's design was again downsized to 40,000 people and the ridership to 20,000 ppd. A decision was also made to operate the line manually instead of in fully automated mode. The line was opened on March 25, 1991, charging ¬•300 for an end-to-end trip, but by this time the ridership projection had been cut to just 12,000 passengers per day. However, between 1991 and 2004 the line only averaged 2,670 passengers per day, amounting to only 6% of the original estimate and 22% of the opening-day projection.Â∞èÁâßÂ∏ÇÂΩπÊâÄ (March 2005).

The maintenance of the line required some 11.5 billion yen per year, a tenth of Tokadai New Town's budget and, compared to construction costs of 31.3 billion yen, the equivalent of rebuilding the line from scratch every three years. According to calculations by the local chapter of the Japanese Communist Party (disputed by some town councillors), the building of the line had increased the original sale prices of apartments in the area by approximately one million yen. In 2005, the option of converting the line to use Toyota's experimental IMTS (guided bus) technology was considered, but this was rejected by Aichi Prefecture in November as it was too difficult and risky. The decision to close the line was made in December, and the line ceased operating on September 30, 2006. , the Peachliner's track is still in place, though totally unused.

Life and work Early years Collins was born in Hampstead, north London, the son of landscape and genre painter William Collins. His older brother was the novelist Wilkie Collins. He was educated at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire. Painting career Collins met John Everett Millais and became influenced by the ideas of the Pre-Raphaelites, completing his painting Berengaria's Alarm in 1850. This depicted the wife of King Richard the Lionheart noticing her missing husband's girdle offered for sale by a peddlar. The flattened modelling, emphasis on pattern making, and imagery of embroidery were all characteristic features of Pre-Raphaelitism. Millais proposed that Collins should become a member of the Brotherhood, but Thomas Woolner and William Michael Rossetti objected, so he never became an official member. Collins fell in love with Maria Rossetti, but she rejected him. He became increasingly ascetic and introspective. These attitudes were expressed in Collins's best-known work, Convent Thoughts, which depicted a nun in a convent garden. Collins went on to exhibit many highly devotional images. Literary career In the late 1850s, however, he abandoned art to follow his brother into a writing career. His most successful literary works were humorous essays collected together under the title The Eye Witness (1860). Later life Collins married Charles Dickens's daughter Kate in 1860, and later was engaged to illustrate Dickens' unfinished novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood. He completed the cover but was too ill to do the rest. He died from cancer in 1873 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.Lucinda Hawksley, Katey: The Life and Loves of Dickens's Artist Daughter, New York, Doubleday, 2006.

Her feminist writings and views sparked controversy in the late 19th century. She was also an advocate for animal rights and civil liberties, and played a part in advancing the interests of the New Woman in the public sphere. Life and writings Alice Mona Alison was born in Ryde, Isle of Wight, the elder daughter of John Alison of Midlothian, Scotland, who some biographies claim to have invented the vertical boiler, and Matilda Hector, who the 1871 census records state was born in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Her parents were married on 21 June 1853 in St Leonards (near Glenelg, South Australia), her father being based in Melbourne and her mother Matilda the eldest daughter of a prominent citizen.John Hector Caird wrote stories and plays from early childhood that reveal a proficiency in French and German as well as English. One childhood friend was the art critic Elizabeth Sharp, who married William Sharp. In December 1877, she married James Alexander Henryson-Caird, son of Sir James Caird. Her husband farmed some 1700 acres (688 ha) of estates in Cassencary, Scotland. Some eight years older, he supported her independence. While he lived at Cassencary and Northbrook House, Micheldever, Hampshire, she spent much time in London and abroad. She associated with literary people, including Thomas Hardy, who admired her work, and educated herself in the humanities and science. The Cairds had one child, a son born on 22 March 1884 with the names Alison James (see England and Wales birth records), but whom she called Alister. Her husband died in 1921. Caird published her first two novels, Whom Nature Leadeth (1883) and One That Wins (1887), under the pseudonym \\"G. Noel Hatton\\", but they drew little attention. Her subsequent writings bore her own name. She came into prominence in 1888 when the Westminster Review printed an article by her, \\"Marriage\\", in which she analysed indignities historically suffered by women in marriage, calling its present state a \\"vexatious failure\\" and advocating equality and autonomy between marriage partners. London's widely circulated Daily Telegraph quickly responded with a series called \\"Is Marriage a Failure?\\", which drew a reported 27,000 letters from around the world and continued for three months. Feeling her views had been misunderstood, she published another article, called \\"Ideal Marriage\\", later that year. Her numerous essays on marriage and women's issues written in 1888‚Äì1894 were collected in The Morality of Marriage and Other Essays on the Status and Destiny of Women in 1897. Caird next published the novel The Wing of Azrael (1889), which deals with marital rape. In it, Viola Sedley murders her cruel husband in self-defence. Next came a short story collection, A Romance of the Moors (1891), where in the title story, a widowed artist, Margaret Ellwood, stirs up a young couple by counselling them to each become independent and self-sufficient. Her best-known novel, The Daughters of DanausThe Daughters of Danaus (1894), tells of Hadria Fullerton, who aspires to be a composer, but finds that her obligations to her family and parents, and as a wife and mother, allow little time for it. This has since been seen as a feminist classic. Also well known is a short story \\"The Yellow Drawing-Room\\" (1892), where Vanora Haydon defies the conventional separation of spheres of men and women. Such works of hers have been called \\"fiction of the New Woman\\". Active in the women's suffrage movement from her early twenties, Caird joined the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1878, and later the Women's Franchise League, the Women's Emancipation Union, and the London Society for Women's Suffrage. Her essay \\"Why Women Want the Franchise\\" was read at the 1892 WEU Conference. In 1908, she published the essay \\"Militant Tactics and Woman's Suffrage\\" and took part in the second Hyde Park women's suffrage demonstration. She was also opposed to vivisection, writing much on the subject, including \\"The Sanctuary of Mercy\\" (1895), \\"Beyond the Pale\\" (1896), \\"The Ethics of Vivisection\\" (1900), and a play, \\"The Logicians: An episode in dialogue\\" (1902), where characters argue opposing views on the issue. Caird was a member of the Theosophical Society from 1904 to 1909. Among her later writings is an illustrated volume of travel essays, Romantic Cities of Provence (1906), and novels: The Stones of Sacrifice (1915), showing harmful effects of self-sacrifice on women, and The Great Wave (1931), a work of social science fiction attacking the racism of negative eugenics. Mona Caird died on 4 February 1932, in Hampstead at the age of 77.

Performed by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. Helmet During live performances and in the black and white promotional television clip, Brown performed the song wearing a burning helmet. The helmet was improvised with a leather skull cap onto which was bolted a metal dish that held lighter fluid or petrol. As the cap was not insulated, the heat from the burning fuel quickly conducted through the fixing bolt to the top of Brown's head, causing him considerable pain.Polly Marshall, The God Of Hellfire, the Crazy Life and Times of Arthur Brown, , SAF Publishing, 2005, page 60 Versions Two studio mixes of \\"Fire\\" have been officially released, one in stereo and one in mono. The mono mix features no brass. Both versions are included on the CD reissue of The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single B-side, \\"Rest Cure\\", was another track from the album. Composition The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period, though its lack of guitars or bass guitarthe pounding bass was made with bass pedals played by Vincent Crane distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond organ, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation \\"I am the God of Hellfire\\" became a lasting catchphrase. The song ends with the sound of a wind from Hell along with one of Brown's trademark banshee screams.

In 2003, APFA played a major role in keeping American Airlines solvent and out of bankruptcy by giving back an employee bailout of $340 million in annual salary and benefits, for a total of over $3 billion. APFA had been in negotiations with American for almost four years when the carrier filed for chapter 11-bankruptcy protection on November 29, 2011. Bankruptcy timeline and APFA strategy to protect its membersAPFA Historical Timeline Apr 2003: American Airlines, following total losses of $5.3 billion in 2001 and 2002, undergoes what was called a ‚Äúvirtual bankruptcy.‚Äù Management uses the threat of bankruptcy to achieve concessions from unionized employees in the amount of $1.8 billion annually. Despite the new cost structure, American lost money through 2011. Nov 2011: After years of losses, plunging stock prices, contract negotiations, and failed business strategies, American Airlines files for Chapter 11 protection in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Arpey resigns as CEO and is replaced by longtime American executive Tom Horton. In a statement, Horton says he intends to use bankruptcy to ‚Äúreduce our labor costs to competitive levels.‚Äù Dec 2011: Shortly after the filing, the US Trustee appoints the Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC). All three of the unions on the property are awarded a seat, as are the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), Boeing Capital, Hewlett-Packard, and three major bond-holders. The UCC represents the interest of parties who are owed money by the bankrupt company and who do not have any collateral standing behind their claim. The committee becomes the de facto Board of Directors throughout the restructuring. Although the APA and TWU send representatives to the UCC, Laura Glading chooses to sit on the committee herself. Jan 2012: The PBGC sends a public signal in support of American‚Äôs unions when its director, Josh Gotbaum, states that his agency is prepared to fight to prevent American from using bankruptcy to shed its pension plans. The PBGC is the federal agency that backstops retirees‚Äô benefits when a company pension plan fails. Feb 2012: American releases its Term Sheets detailing the concessions it will seek from labor under Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code. Section 1113 allows for bankrupt companies to void their labor contracts and impose new concessionary agreements with only the approval of the Judge necessary. Typically, the threat of imposed draconian contracts motivates unions to achieve mutual agreements on concessionary contracts. The term sheet American executives offers APFA include dramatic cuts to wages, benefits, and work rules, and the loss of hundreds of flight attendant jobs. Mar 2012: Facing pressure from APFA, Allied Pilots Association (APA), Transport Workers Union of America (TGWU), the PBGC and others, American backs off its original demand to terminate pensions and instead offers to freeze them. The pension freeze allows employees to keep full benefits accrued before the time of the freeze. Apr 2012: APFA, APA, and TWU announce that they reached agreements with the management team of US Airways and that the three major unions at American support a merger between the two carriers with the US Airways team in control. This development is without precedent in major airline bankruptcies and is a remarkable move by organized labor to exercise control over its own destiny. APFA‚Äôs bridge agreement with US Airways provides a temporary contract while the two carriers merge followed by a guaranteed network-rate contract. Additionally, the agreement includes a Voluntary Early-Out Program that allows flight attendants to take a lump sum payment and retire. Like the demands from American, the deal with US Airways is concessionary. However, US Airways‚Äô plan for the merged airline allows the company to grow and compete, offering long- term job stability. Aug 2012: Faced with the prospect of living under American‚Äôs draconian term sheet, APFA approves management‚Äôs Last, Best, and Final Offer (LBFO). Although the LBFO represents substantial improvements to the term sheet, including the VEOP, it is still a very concessionary agreement. APFA, APA, and TWU remain committed to achieving a merger with US Airways inside of bankruptcy. As part of this strategy, TWU also ratifies a concessionary deal. APA rejects its first tentative agreement but a ‚ÄúMe Too‚Äù letter, secured by APFA, guarantees that the labor savings from the Pilots Agreement are equivalent to the savings achieved in the flight attendants‚Äô CBA. Sep 2012: US Airways and American begin to exchange confidential information regarding operations and finances. This cooperation is subject to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) between the two parties which includes a mandatory ‚Äúquiet period‚Äù during which no party can speak publicly about the merger talks. Also bound by this agreement are the members of the UCC, including APFA. Nov 2012: APA negotiates a second TA and sends it out for a membership vote. On December 7, the Pilots ratified the TA. APFA Negotiating Team is reviewing the new agreement in order to quantify any improvements the pilots may have achieved. The ‚ÄúMe, Too‚Äù Letter secured in August mandates that the value of the changes to the Pilots‚Äô Agreement and flight attendants‚Äô Agreement are equivalent. Feb 2013: AA and US Airways announce their plans to merge. AA Flight Attendants will have lived under bankruptcy cuts for approximately one year (10/1/12 LBFO to Fall 2013 BK exit). This is the shortest amount of time any flight attendant workgroup will have had to live under a contract in bankruptcy. 1993 strike More than 90 percent of the 21,000 members honored the 11-day strike called on November 18,New York Times virtually shutting the airline down.

Its home port is on Lake Winnipesaukee in Laconia, New Hampshire, in the United States. The historic ship makes several ports of call around the lake during her scenic cruises in the spring, summer and fall months. Ice-Out is declared when the Mount Washington can get to all of its ports of call. History Paddle steamer Mount Washington (the \\"Old Mount\\") Original Mount Washington c. 1920 The history of the MS Mount Washington dates back to 1872 when the original paddle steamer Mount Washington was launched from Alton Bay. The Mount was the largest of all the steamers on the lake at in length, with a beam of . She was driven by a single cylinder steam engine of that operated at approximately 26 RPM. Power was transferred from the vertical cylinder to the paddle wheel shaft by the walking beam, high above the upper deck, oscillating at the frequency of the paddle wheels. She was built by the Boston and Maine Railroad Company with the intent of transporting cargo and passengers around the lake. By the late 19th century it was not uncommon for her to transport over 60,000 passengers in a single season. In the 1920s, with the rise of the automobile and declining train usage, the Boston and Maine Railroad Co. made the decision to sell the steamer to Captain Leander Lavallee. Captain Lavallee operated the Mount as a tourist attraction, still drawing crowds of over 60,000 a season. The \\"Old Mount\\" graced Winnipesaukee for a total of 67 years before being destroyed on December 23, 1939, by fire. She was tied up at dock when a fire started at a nearby railway station. The fire spread down the dock and engulfed her at her home port. Efforts to cut the Mount loose were to no avail as it was a time of extremely low water and the hull was stuck fast in the mud of the lake bottom. SS, MV and MS Mount Washington Soon after, a local company was formed to build a new ship. Europe was already at war and obtaining steel in the USA was impossible because of pre-war munitions stock- piling. Instead, they purchased an old sidewheel vessel on Lake Champlain: the 1888 Harlan & Hollingsworth-built Chateaugay, a , iron-hulled sidewheeler that was being used as a clubhouse for the Burlington yacht club. It was cut into sections and transported to Lake Winnipesaukee on rail cars. A new twin-screw vessel was designed for the hull being welded back together at Lakeport. Powered by two steam engines taken from another ocean-going yacht, the new Mount Washington made her maiden voyage on August 15, 1940. M.V. Mount Washington (1930s postcard) Two years after her launch, the new Mounts engines and boilers were removed for use in a navy vessel during World War II. After the war, the Mount Washington returned to the water but with diesel engines, hence the \\"M/V\\" prefix designating \\"motor vessel.\\" The ship was a success in the post-war tourist boom although she became a money-maker in the 1980s under the ownership of Scott Brackett. In 1982, the Mount was cut open and extended with an additional hull section to add larger lounge and food service facilities. The larger size upped the ship's designation to M/S or \\"motor ship.\\" More popular, the Mount makes one or two round-trips on the lake per day during the summer season, as well as numerous dinner dance cruises in the evenings. In March 2010, the Mount was cut open, the unserviceable circa 1946 motors were removed (Enterprise DMG18 motors: 8cyl 615 hp), and the ship was repowered with two 'green' Caterpillar motors, giving more power and economy to the ship.

He was the official historian for the Winnipesaukee Flagship Cooperation (WFC) fleet. In his years with WFC he wrote several books on the history of the fleet as well as many others about Lake Winnipesaukee and New Hampshire. In 1994 the purser's office aboard the Mount was dedicated in his name for his 30 years of service and countless contributions to recording the history of the WFC fleet and Lake Winnipesaukee. *Monty the Mallard is the official cruise mascot. Current operation Seasonal cruises Mount Washington plying the waters on its route toward Wolfeboro The Mount cruises the waters of Winnipesaukee from late May through late October. At the height of summer she will embark on up to four cruises a day. The Mount has five ports of call: Meredith Bay, Center Harbor, Wolfeboro, Alton Bay, and her home port of Weirs Beach. At night the boat travels the lake with no stops at ports for a scenic dinner dance cruise. Winter harbor In the winter the Mount stays at its winter home at the port in Center Harbor. Bubblers in the water around the Mount keep the water from freezing and protect the boat from ice damage. There is also a marine railway at Center Harbor that can be used to pull the massive ship entirely from the water. The task of pulling the Mount from the lake is a large one and only undertaken when a major maintenance job requires it. Sister ships The MS Mount Washington has two smaller sister ships in the fleet. Both were constructed from spare boat parts from the US Navy following World War II. MV Doris E The Doris E makes daily scenic island cruises and stops in the port of Meredith. The Doris is in length and has its own snack bar, drinks, and bathroom. MV Sophie C The Sophie C is in length and was built by General Ship and Engine Works in East Boston, Massachusetts. She was christened \\"Sophie C\\" after Sophie Hedblom, wife of Carl Hedblom and mother of Byron Hedblom, owners of General Ship and Engine Works as well as the Winnipesaukee Steamship Corporation. The vessel was built to offer service on Lake Winnipesaukee while the M/V Mount Washington was out of commission due to the U.S. government having confiscated her engines for the war effort. The Sophie C is the oldest floating post office (and only inland floating post office) in the continental United States, and is the fifth boat to deliver mail on the lake. It cruises daily except for Sunday, delivering the mail to island residents.

History  Founding and early history Alexander Brown Alexander Brown (1764 -- 1834), an Irish linen merchant, emigrated in 1800 from Ballymena in Ulster to the United States, settling in Baltimore, Maryland, where he established the first investment banking firm in the U.S. In 1808, the company organized the first initial public offering in the U.S., that of the Baltimore Water Company. Alex. Brown & Sons Building in Baltimore, Maryland In 1810, Alexander Brown was joined in business by his sons, William, George, John, and James, and the firm was named Alex. Brown and Sons, Inc. By the 1820s, Alexander Brown had expanded his business interests into sterling exchange and international trade, including tobacco and cotton. Brown's sons eventually started related businesses in various locations, beginning with William. William founded William Brown and Company in Liverpool, England, which later became Brown, Shipley & Co. In 1818, John and James started Brown Bros. & Co. in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. James subsequently opened a branch in New York City in 1825, a predecessor to Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. George remained at the firm's Baltimore headquarters, where he took a leading role in the founding of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1827. Upon Alexander Brown's death in 1834, George became the head of Alex. Brown and Sons, which proclaimed itself \\"America's foremost international banking enterprise in the nineteenth century.\\" Some historical records of Alex Brown & Sons are housed in the manuscript collections at New- York Historical Society.

Born in Battersea, London, he went to work on the railways and joined the National Union of Railwaymen in 1919. He joined the Labour Party, but after Black Friday moved to the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). After studying with A. E. E. Reade, he came to support Leon Trotsky and the International Left Opposition. Elected to the executive of the Young Communist League in 1926, Wicks attended the International Lenin School in Moscow and the Sixth World Congress of the Comintern. He began working with the Balham Group of Trotskyists, and was expelled from the CPGB in 1932. He became a founding member of the Communist League and met Trotsky in Copenhagen but disagreed with Trotsky's advice to join the Independent Labour Party. The Communist League split with the tendency opposed to joining the ILP continuing as the Marxist League, which later worked within the Labour Party. He also chaired the British Committee for the Defence of Leon Trotsky. In 1936, Wicks and several others signed a letter to the Manchester Guardian defending Trotsky's right to asylum and calling for an international inquiry into the Moscow Trials.The other signatories were: H.

However, Wicks and the remnants of the former Marxist League soon left and formed the Socialist Anti-War Federation. In 1940, this group dissolved and he joined the Independent Labour Party. At the end of the Second World War, Wicks joined the Labour Party and became active in NALGO. In 1971, he became involved with the Trotskyist movement again, joining the forerunner of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) the International Socialists. He was part of the 1976 split which formed the Workers League. He would later work with the SWP in various campaigns but never rejoined it. Not long before his death he wrote an autobiography, Keeping My Head: The Memoirs of a British Bolshevik, with the help of Logie Barrow.

Reynolds Stadium is a former baseball park in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The home field of the Oklahoma State University Cowboys college baseball team, it was named after former OSU and New York Yankees baseball great Allie Reynolds. History Allie P. Reynolds Stadium has a listed capacity of 3,281 people and was opened April 4, 1981, against then-Big 8 foe Missouri. The stadium was officially dedicated on April 24, 1982, in a ceremony attended by Allie Reynolds and Yankee legends, Bill Dickey and Mickey Mantle, and Braves legend, Warren Spahn. In addition to the dominating Cowboy baseball teams of the 1980s, the ballpark has hosted nine NCAA Regional tournaments in its history. The stadium's $200,000 lighting system, installed in 1981, was instrumental in attracting the Regionals to Stillwater. Major renovations, funded primarily by the private contributions to the Reynolds Stadium Development Fund, through the years have helped keep the stadium up-to-date. The biggest changes to the stadium have been the expanded seating, new perimeter fences, and new dressing rooms in 1993. A new clubhouse was built in June 2005 along the third base dugout. The facility cost approximately $700,000 and includes a modern locker room, lounge, and media equipment. Other renovations to Reynolds Stadium include a re-landscaping of the playing surface in 1992, a new scoreboard in 1995, a padded fence in 1997, a new indoor hitting facility in 2001, a new sound system in 2002, and another new scoreboard in 2004. Major upgrades to the bullpen areas, warning tracks, and playing surface were made in the fall of 2005. Allie P. Reynolds will be replaced by the new O'Brate Stadium, aimed at attracting Super Regional round games. The new ballpark has a permanent capacity of 3,500, slightly smaller than that of Reynolds, but is expandable to 8,000 for major events such as NCAA tournament games. The Cowboys had planned to play their first 14 home games of the 2020 season at Reynolds, ending on March 15 with the last of a three-game series against Fresno State. O'Brate Stadium was then to open on March 20 for the Cowboys' 2020 Big 12 opener against TCU with former President George W. Bush scheduled to throw out the first pitch. However, on March 13, the baseball season ended when the Big 12 announced that all spring sports were canceled due to coronavirus concerns, both postponing the O'Brate opening and apparently closing Reynolds early. The apparent last game was played on March 11 against Saint Louis, a 7‚Äì1 Cowboy victory.

The current company was founded in 1873, and its much smaller theatre (pictured) was built that same year next to the Porte Saint-Martin at 20 boulevard Saint-Martin, in the 10th arrondissement. Besides performances of musical theatre, Feydeau's farces were first produced in this theatre, and plays by Victorien Sardou.

It spent its entire term of service in the western United States. History Most of the 1st California was recruited from August to October 1861, with the exception of Company K, which was organized the following February. Many of its companies were formed from companies of the California Militia taken intact into federal service others from individuals drawn from the militia. James H. Carleton served as colonel, Joseph R. West as lieutenant colonel and Edwin A. Rigg as major. It came under the command of the Department of the Pacific (later it would come under the Department of New Mexico). After some training at Camp Downy near Oakland and Camp Latham near Los Angeles. Companies D, F and G were sent to establish and garrison Camp Wright, in November 1861. Detachments from the camp captured Daniel Showalter's party near Warner's Ranch, November 20‚Äì29, 1861. In December, 1861, five companies of the regiment were sent to Fort Yuma on the Colorado River and the others to various posts around Southern California. The regiment was assigned to a force called the California Column, which was commanded by Carleton and composed of one infantry regiment (the 5th) and parts of two cavalry regiments (the 1st and 2nd) of California volunteers and a company of Regular artillery. The Column was formed to drive the Confederate Army of New Mexico out of the eastern part of the New Mexico Territory. Due to supply problems, the force did not move out until February 1862. The 1st Infantry saw fighting at the Battle of Picacho Pass (only Company I) and the Battle of Apache Pass (this battle was against Apache warriors, not Confederates). The regiment continued marching across the New Mexico Territory to Fort Craig. Picacho Pass was the only engagement against Confederate forces, since they had retreated back into Texas before the California Column reached eastern New Mexico and they made no attempt to recover the territory they lost. For the remainder of the war, the 1st California Infantry was engaged in garrison duty dispersed in posts across New Mexico Territory and Texas and fighting Apache and Navajo Indians in these places and in the Utah Territory.

Extremely popular, it became the seminal bands of the 1990s Argentine music scene. Unlike most suburban outfits, however, their style evolved significantly with each successive album, not only developing a unique style for the band but also incorporating elements of murga, candombe, and tango to an electric guitar base. This plus generally tight and at times memorable songwriting by frontman Ciro, has set them apart from the legions of suburban bands, and has made them one of the most popular bands in modern Argentine rock, with a strong following across Latin America and Europe, unusual for a band in their subgenre of Argentine rock. Their popularity remains undiminished.

They began doing so in the pubs of the far-flung western suburbs of Buenos Aires, a similar beginning as countless other suburban rock bands. In 1991, they headed to Europe to participate in an anti-racist music festival in France, where they played with groups from Mali, Burkina Faso, Cuba, and Spain. Los Piojos made their commercial debut in 1992 with Chactuchac. Receiving the very favorable blessing of Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, did not hurt. Ay Ay Ay followed in 1994, and both did reasonably well. But the band could not beat back the domination by the Nuevo Rock Argentino rock (\\"New Argentine Rock\\") of the first half of the 1990s, so Los Piojos did not achieve a total breakthrough in spite that by the second album Ciro's songwriting was beginning to flourish. The band's third studio album, Tercer Arco, benefited from the suburban rock explosion of 1996: that year alone La Renga released their seminal album Despedazado por Mil Partes, Viejas Locas released their debut with the hit single \\"Intoxicado\\", among other events that sent suburban rock to the mainstream and ended new Argentine rock's dominance. But Tercer Arco was a great album on its own right, which made the overall result all the more explosive given the reigning musical environment. By the second half of the year Los Piojos were filling arenas and small stadiums. And by the start of 1997, Tercer Arco had gone double-platinum in a swift manner. The single \\"El Farolito\\" was at the top of rotation in most radio stations, and the video for \\"Marad√≥\\" (about former football player Diego Maradona) as well as that for \\"Verano del 92\\" made top 10 on MTV (probably the only time in the history of rock music where a song based upon an Afro- Uruguayan chant did so!). 1997's gathering power which Los Piojos achieved simply confirmed that they had arrived in the big leagues of Argentine rock, and that suburban rock was now in the driver's seat.Los Piojos www.rock.com.ar (Spanish) To many, 1998's follow up studio album Azul is the best from the group. The band's assimilation of all types of eastern Argentine musical rhythms became clear with this release, and their eclectic nature did not cut into their popularity, in fact it made them more accessible to a wider Latin American taste, and so Los Piojos went on tour in Mexico and the United States. Ritual saw the light in 1999 as the 5th album for the band. The third millennium arrived and saw Los Piojos still on top of things. They performed several concerts with sellout numbers alongside other suburban rock flag- bearers such as Divididos, La Renga, Viejas Locas, and ska-Latin band Los Aut√©nticos Decadentes. The group released Verde Paisaje del Infierno in 2000, another solid effort from \\"The Lice\\" (which is what their name means in Spanish). In 2003 the band came out with their 7th full-length, M√°quina de Sangre. Becoming one of the best selling albums of the year, it showed that Los Piojos were still current, and that their place in the history of Argentine and Spanish-language rock was largely assured. They would sell out 70,000 seat River Plate Stadium, something only achieved locally by bands such as Soda Stereo, and the most important foreign musical acts.

Woodson. The thesis of Dr. Woodson's book is that blacks of his day were being culturally indoctrinated, rather than taught, in American schools. This conditioning, he claims, causes black people to become dependent and to seek out inferior places in the greater society of which they are a part. He challenges his readers to become autodidacts and to \\"do for themselves\\", regardless of what they were taught: > History shows that it does not matter who is in power... those who have not > learned to do for themselves and have to depend solely on others never > obtain any more rights or privileges in the end than they did in the > beginning. Here is a quote from the book: > \\"When you control a man's thinking you do not have to worry about his > actions. You do not have to tell him not to stand here or go yonder. He will > find his 'proper place' and will stay in it. You do not need to send him to > the back door. He will go without being told. In fact, if there is no back > door, he will cut one for his special benefit. His education makes it > necessary.\\"Aalbc.com  Chapters  Chapter 1 ‚ÄúThe Seat Of The Trouble‚Äù in this chapter Dr. Carter Woodson explains how African Americans can feel out of place as they are subjected to despise themselves within the given educational system. He identifies how African Americans are often influenced to become a ‚Äúgood negro‚Äù in order to become successful, and this ideology urges them to downplay their ‚Äúblackness‚Äù to advance in the social ladder, but being educated and moving up the social ladder does not eliminate one's blackness. This problem could possibly be avoided if African Americans had equal opportunity to learn about their culture and black history. Chapter 2 ‚ÄúHow We Missed The Mark‚Äù in this chapter Woodson explains how the educational system failed to support African Americans because of how their schools were unable to properly teach them, when compared to predominantly white schools that were fully furnished and had the means to give their students the right education. Woodson believed that African Americans should experience different means of education to develop and show their individual skills rather than to be educated practically. Chapter 3 ‚ÄúHow We Drifted Away From The Truth‚Äù In this chapter Woodson discusses how African Americans are separated from the truth of their actual contributions to history due to it being ‚Äúwhite-washed.‚Äù He analyzed many cases in which this makes white people believe they are superior by taking away the important contributions from black people. He also shows how black teachers are often no help in fixing the problem as they continue to teach white-washed versions of history to the future generations of students. Chapter 4 ‚ÄúEducation Under Outside Control‚Äù in this chapter Woodson speaks on how African Americans are given educationally less valuable opportunities despite whether the institution is historically black or predominately white. Woodson believes that equal education opportunities have an effect on individuals and the life that they create for themselves. He also encourages African Americans to create better opportunities in many aspects for themselves so they can live better lives. ‚ÄúThe program for the uplift of the negro in this country must be based upon a scientific study of the negro from within to develop in him the power to do for himself what his oppressors will never do for him.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Failure to Make a Living‚Äù highlights a lot of the problems that black people who attend college face when presented with how to apply that knowledge to the working world, or more specifically owning and operating a business. One of the main problems that Woodson introduces is the lack of support systems that many black Americans don‚Äôt have, especially when compared to those of a similar standing who happen to be white. ‚ÄúThe Educated Negro Leaves the Masses‚Äù discusses the estrangement that many educated black people have from the black church and the lack of support the black church receives from the educated as a result. According to Woodson, some of the things educated black people are doing instead of supporting the black church are switching to predominantly white denominations, or not attending church altogether. Woodson emphasizes the importance of the black church as ‚Äúthe only institution that the race controls.‚Äù In ‚ÄúDissension and Weakness,‚Äù Woodson discusses the lack of tolerance those in rural areas have for dissension and differences in denomination around them. Woodson, once again, refers back to the lack of guidance and presence educated black people have in the black church and the effects of it; which includes children becoming more involved with gambling, drinking, and smoking. ‚ÄúProfessional Education Discouraged‚Äù discusses the discouragement many black Americans face in academic settings. Some of the prime examples Woodson brings to light are how black Americans are told there will be no job opportunities in particular field should they choose to study them, being told they are not fit for certain fields, and being discredited or ignored despite being well educated in a particular field. The next chapter, ‚ÄúPolitical Education Neglected,‚Äù begins with some examples as to how African Americans have been previously kept from learning about American politics, one example being when a bill that would print the Constitution of the United States in all schools was turned down because ‚Äúit would never do to have Negroes study the Constitution of the United States.\\" Woodson also lays out a brief history of other times when African Americans were kept from learning about laws that govern their everyday life and the policies that were keeping them subservient. ‚ÄúThe Loss of Vision‚Äù describes how Woodson feels the black population of America has lost sight of a common goal. In this chapter he brings up how in what he calls ‚Äúour so-called democracy, we are accustomed to give the majority what they want rather than educate them to understand what is best for them. We do not show the Negro to overcome segregation, but we teach them how to accept it as final and just.\\" Woodson expresses the need for African Americans to overcome segregation by proving that they are just as good as an asset to society as white Americans. ‚ÄúThe Need for Service Rather than Leadership‚Äù describes the stifling of African Americans‚Äô ambition and roadblocks that keep them from becoming leaders. Woodson also lies out the reasons as to why this, but mostly shifting the blame to the lack of unity within the African American community; often referring back to points made in ‚ÄúThe Educated Negro Leaves the Masses‚Äù and how there is too much internal conflict and dissention within the community to allow for upward mobility for the community as a whole. In ‚ÄúHirelings in the Places of Public Servants,‚Äù Woodson brings up the lack of African Americans in positions of power in the workplace. Woodson brings up many examples of African Americans put in management positions not being given the same respect and attention their white counterparts are given, and why this is. In the chapters ‚ÄúUnderstanding the Negro,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe New Program,‚Äù and ‚ÄúVocational Guidance‚Äù there where multiple themes that Woodson covered throughout this section. He talks about lack of negro presence throughout the school system and how that not only affects black students but white students as well. A good portion of that comes from black people not being mentioned at all in the schools curriculum. The only time they are mentioned is to be demonized or if something that is negative, because of the false information black students are given about their people they seem to try to assimilate with the white population then turn continue to circulate these negative views on their own people. Woodson actually conducted an interview with a professor of a black college who exact words were when asked how does he plan to teach black students about their people his response was \\"We do not offer here any course in Negro history, Negro literature, or race relations. \\"We study the Negro along with other people.\\" When Woodson questions him on his answer he then goes on to say \\"Why do you emphasize the special study of the Negro?\\" \\"Why is it necessary to give the race special attention in the press, on the rostrum, or in the schoolroom?‚Äù This is the mindset that most teachers he came across or looked over had towards black studies and how it should be taught to black children. In ‚ÄúThe New Type of Professional Man Required,‚Äù Woodson discusses the many hardships black lawyers and doctors encounter in their professional careers. One of the problems he discusses for black lawyers would be how they are often forced to focus on the particular laws that disproportionately affect African Americans. He seems to take issue with many black doctors and their motivations for going into such work, he says, ‚ÄúToo many Negroes go into medicine and dentistry for selfish purposes, hooping thereby to increase their income and spend it on joyous living.\\" He also discusses the exclusion of African Americans from the arts. ‚ÄúHigher Strivings In The Service Of The Country‚Äù. In this chapter, Woodson emphasizes his political views. Woodson believed that African Americans should not just focus on themselves and addressed issues that only apply to them but should address issues that apply to everyone. ‚ÄúReward the dead for some distant favors from the past‚Äù Woodson, in this chapter, is trying to inform African Americans that because their ancestors were influenced by‚Äîand died‚Äîfor certain rights in the past does not mean they should always be followed. Woodson strongly enforced that Africans Americans should not enforce a particular political party because of this. He strongly felt like this because of some African Americans siding with Republicans only because of Abraham Lincoln. Not only was he strong about politics but he was also strong about having African Americans participating more in the United States economy, because he believed that African Americans playing a role in the US economy would improve their social life and makes others want to contribute to the advancement of society. Woodson stated that African Americans should pursue economic and social change. In chapter 18, ‚ÄúThe Study of the Negro,‚Äù Woodson emphasizes the importance of again knowing the history and the importance of African American culture. He strongly believed that Blacks need to study their history more. Dr. Woodson believed that blacks have come to hate their history due to slavery and being treated unfairly but are strongly taught to learn and respect other cultures‚Äô history.  Reception  Many praised Woodson and his work as a glimpse into the problems that plague African Americans' social advancement. Ron Daniels, with the Michigan City said, ‚ÄúCarter G. Woodson, one of our most distinguished historians, and the founder of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, was convinced that the dilemma of racial consciousness and identity was not an accident. [...] Our history, culture and identity should serve as a basic for a group cohesion, and the collective pursuit of an African-American agenda for moral, social, economic and political advancement.‚Äù Another had to say, ‚ÄúThe result was a caustic and uncompromising litany that seemed to go on forever. Negro education, Woodson charged, clung to a defunct ‚Äúmachine method‚Äù based on the misguided assumption that ‚Äúeducation is merely a process of imparting information.‚Äù it failed to inspire black students and ‚Äúdid not bring their minds into harmony with life as they must face it.‚Äù theories of Negro inferiority were ‚Äúdrilled‚Äù into black pupils in virtually every classroom they entered. And the more education blacks received, the more ‚Äúestranged from the masses‚Äù they became.‚Äù The Journal of Black Studies on Woodson himself said, \\"Carter G. Woodson believed that education was much more than the trans-feral of knowledge from teacher to student: He believed that authentic education would not only teach students to think and recite information also allow students to ask difficult epistemological and ontological questions about life, political systems, social and economic inequities, and the very purpose of humankind.\\" The title of Lauryn Hill's 1998 best-selling album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is a reference to the book's naming.

He is known as one of comics' foremost cheesecake artists, and one of the best known and most distinctive comic book cover artists. Throughout his career Hughes has provided illustration work for companies such as DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Dark Horse Comics, Lucasfilm, Warner Bros. Pictures, Playboy magazine, Joss Whedon's Mutant Enemy Productions, and Sideshow Collectibles. He is also a fixture at comics conventions where his commissioned sketches command long lines. Early life Adam Hughes was born on May 5, 1967 in Riverside Township, New Jersey and grew up in Florence, where he attended a private elementary school.Hughes, Adam (June 29, 2010). Cover Run: The DC Art of Adam Hughes. DC Comics. p. 76. He stayed in Florence until he was 24.\\"Adam Hughes Sketching 13\\". YouTube. August 21, 2010. Retrieved September 10, 2010. Career Early work Hughes, who had no formal training in art, began his career in 1987.\\"Adam Hughes Sketching 3\\". YouTube. August 21, 2010. Retrieved September 10, 2010 His first comic book work was a pinup in Eagle #6. He penciled two short stories and the first issue of Death Hawk, created by Mark Ellis. In 1988 Hughes became the penciller on writer Mike W. Barr's detective series Maze Agency, as his portfolio bore samples of both that series and Mike Gustovich's Justice Machine. Maze Agency, published by Comico, and edited by Michael Eury, became Hughes' first regular series and his first color work. Despite wanting to draw action-oriented superhero stories at the time, he credits his work on Maze Agency, whose scripts Barr composed in the full script format, with improving his skill and confidence at storytelling. In a 2004 interview, he stated that this work also developed his preference for character-oriented stories over action-oriented ones, both as an artist and a writer. Hughes' interior pencils were inked by Eury's longtime friend Rick Magyar, and because Hughes aspired to ink his own work one day, he took Barr's suggestion that he produce pinups on each issue's back cover as an advertisement for the next issue to practice inking his own pencils. It was around this time that Hughes switched to inking with a brush on the advice of Dave Stevens when Stevens looked at Hughes' samples. Hughes stayed on the series for a year. After two years of providing background art or interior pencils on independent books, writer/artist Bill Willingham, who like Hughes, had done work for Comico, introduced Hughes to Andy Helfer, the editor on the DC Comics series Justice League America. Helfer was impressed by Hughes' portfolio and asked Hughes to contact him when his contract expired. A few months later, after Comico went out of business, Helfer contacted Hughes, hiring him initially to draw inventory covers for issues like Mister Miracle #19, one of Hughes' favorite creations by Jack Kirby. Hughes was then made the regular artist on Justice League America, with issue #31 being his first published DC Comics work.Hughes (2010). p. 8. At the time he began on that book, he was still working at a comics shop two days a week.Hughes (2010). Back cover. He continued doing covers and interior art on the title for two years, before switching to providing covers only. At the age of 24, Hughes moved to Atlanta, Georgia to join Gaijin Studios, believing that working more closely alongside fellow artists would improve his own skills. Hughes stayed with Gaijin Studios for 12 years. That same year, he penciled Comics' Greatest World: Arcadia #3 for Dark Horse Comics, which featured the first appearance of the supernatural character Ghost. He drew that character subsequently in the 1994 one-shot Ghost Special. When that character was given her own series in 1995, Hughes penciled the first three-issue storyline, \\"Arcadia Nocturne\\". From 1994 to 1995, Hughes drew the satirical storyline \\"Young Captain Adventure\\", which appeared in the first several issues of the adult comics anthology magazine Penthouse Comix. Hughes also provided a painted cover for issue #2, and a pinup in issue #26 in 1997. In a 2011 interview, he indicated that while he did not regret that work, he felt shame at the time he produced it, as he feared it might end his future prospects with companies like Marvel Comics and DC Comics, and because he feels that depicting full nudity is less fulfilling than merely suggestive art. Hughes explains:\\"Spotlight On: Adam Hughes\\". Comic Vine. May 2011.

In 1995 Hughes wrote and illustrated the 1996 two-issue miniseries, Gen¬π¬≥: Ordinary Heroes from WildStorm, his first writing assignment. Because he did that at the WildStorm offices in La Jolla, California, he spent evenings in the suite where the studio's books were colored, where he learned how to color with Photoshop from colorists Homer Reyes, Ben Dimagmaliw and Laura Martin.Hughes, Adam (2010). p. 184. In late 1998 he began a four-year run as cover artist on DC's Wonder Woman, producing 49 covers for the series. He also provided cover art on Tomb Raider from Top Cow Comics. He would eventually gain a reputation as one of the best known and distinctive comic book cover artists. 2000s When Wizards of the Coast created their 2000 d20-based Star Wars RPG, Hughes created designs for both the original and revised core rulebooks, as well as the Star Wars: Invasion of Theed adventure game mini- RPG. When he reused his portrait of the Jedi guardian, Sia-Lan Wezz (his favorite character), for the cover of the 2005 one-shot Star Wars: Purge as a gag, there was such editorial interest that she was written into the story as one of Darth Vader's early victims. In May 2007, Sideshow Collectibles debuted a miniature statuette of Mary Jane Watson, a perennial love interest of Spider-Man's, based on artwork by Hughes. The statue, which depicts Mary Jane wearing a cleavage-revealing T-shirt and low-cut jeans that expose the top of a pink thong while bending over a metal tub holding Spider-Man's costume, generated controversy among some fans who felt that the statue was sexist. Marvel addressed the matter by stating, \\"The Mary Jane statuette is the latest release in a limited edition collectibles line. The item is aimed at adults that have been long-time fans of the Marvel Universe. It is intended only for mature collectors and sold in specialty, trend, collectible and comic shops ‚Äì not mass retail.\\" Sideshow Collectibles stated, \\"Our product is not produced to make a political or social statement but is fashioned after entertainment properties currently in the market place (sic). We suggest that if you do find the Mary Jane product offensive that you refrain from viewing that web page.\\" Elizabeth McDonald of girl-wonder.org, an organization dedicated to \\"high- quality character depiction\\" in the comics industry, was incredulous at the statue's design, though she stated, \\"Honestly, the difficulty with this statuette is that if you're a woman who likes comics, it's not even noteworthy. Many male comic fans can't understand the outrage it's generated, since this is fairly tame within the industry. This portrayal of Mary Jane could be considered superior to some in the industry, since her clothes don't seem to be actively falling off her\\". The Toronto Star's Malene Arpe echoed this, pointing to female characters with even more revealing appearances, such as Black Cat and Witchblade. Gary Susman of Entertainment Weekly lamented that the statuette was not issued some weeks earlier, so that it could have been included in the website 10 Zen Monkeys' list of \\"Ten Worst Spiderman Tie-Ins\\". Sideshow subsequently released several other statues, or \\"comiquettes\\", based on Hughes' depiction of other female Marvel characters, including Black Cat, She-Hulk, and various X-Men-related characters.\\"Adam Hughes Marvel Comiquette Collection Inside Look\\".

Retrieved April 16, 2019. \\"Real Power of the DC Universe\\", a poster created by Hughes for the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con In 2008 DC Comics hired Hughes to create a poster of the major female characters in the DC Universe as a giveaway for that year's San Diego Comic-Con, to promote DC's upcoming projects. The poster, called \\"Real Power of the DC Universe\\", features 11 female characters, standing and sitting abreast of one another, as in a Vanity Fair gatefold layout. The characters are mostly clad in white outfits rather than their familiar superhero costumes, as per DC's request, so Hughes, wanting to avoid making the poster look like a bridal magazine layout, gave each outfit a slightly different color temperature. He also gave each character a distinctive style. For example, the garment worn by Wonder Woman, for example, resembles a Greek-style tunic, while the one worn by Poison Ivy features a floral trim. Because the Catwoman series was coming to an end, DC instructed Hughes to leave her off the poster, but Hughes, who was fond of the character, drew her on the far left, figuring that he would Photoshop her out of the final art. At the last minute, however, DC, having seen his progress, decided that it liked her inclusion, and told Hughes to leave her in. She is dressed in a black latex evening gown, with only a white shawl, because Hughes had less than 24 hours after DC revised their decision to include her, and found it easier to render her in a black outfit. Hughes reasoned that Selina would be irritated at being intentionally left out and then being included as the last minute, and wore the blackest thing she could out of spite. The poster, which according to ComicsAlliance has become an iconic one, with a long-lived popularity, and has resulted in requests for Hughes to do various other similar ones with men, Marvel characters, etc. It is one of the images for which Hughes has gained a reputation as one of comics' foremost cheesecake artists. About this status, Hughes has said: For an article by Hal Niedzviecki on the impact of blogs, social networks and reality television in the February 2009 Playboy magazine, Hughes illustrated a double-page spread depicting a group of voyeurs observing a topless woman in front of a computer.Niedzviecki, Hal. \\"Peep Culture\\".

YouTube. August 21, 2010. Retrieved September 10, 2010. His website indicated that after the current Catwoman series ended with issue #82, he would cease his DC cover work, and would focus on producing the six-issue All Star Wonder Woman series, though he stated in an October 2010 interview with NJ.com, after the Catwoman assignment had concluded earlier that year, that All Star Wonder Woman was still on hold. At the 2010 Chicago Comicon, editor Mark Chiarello offered him the art duties on the four-issue miniseries Before Watchmen: Dr. Manhattan, one of eight tie-in prequels to the seminal 1986-1987 miniseries Watchmen, which would be written by J. Michael Straczynski, and which would require Hughes to delay finishing All-Star Wonder Woman. Hughes accepted the job of drawing that miniseries, which was announced in February 2012, and premiered August 22, 2012. Hughes commented: \\"I love Alan Moore's canon of work, with special affection for Miracleman, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and most definitely Watchmen. I hope to do some sort of justice to Dave Gibbons' brilliant art: he's one of the all time great illustrators ever to work in the field of comics...I'm fairly stoked to be working with the fabulous J. Michael Straczynski I loved his Thor run, especially. The man knows how to craft amazing tales, so I feel like you & I are in good hands.\\" Between 2009 and 2012, DC Collectibles produced a series of statues of various female DC characters that were based on Hughes' cover art called Cover Girls of the DC Universe.

Materials  The penciling process Hughes employs for his cover work is the same he uses when doing sketches for fans at conventions, with the main difference being that he does cover work in his sketchbook, before transferring the drawing to virgin art board with a lightbox.Coulson, Steve. \\"Adam Hughes - Anatomy of a sketch, Pt2 - The Process\\". YouTube. May 15, 2006. Retrieved September 8, 2010. When penciling his convention drawings, Hughes prefers 11 x 14 Strathmore bristol vellum paper, because it prefers that paper's rougher surface, although he uses smoother paper for brush inking,Coulson, Steve (May 15, 2006). \\"Adam Hughes - Anatomy of a sketch, Pt3 - The Tools\\".

As he explained during a sketch demonstration at a comic book convention, during this process he uses a Sanford Turquoise 4B lead, a soft lead, though when working at home in Atlanta, where the humid weather tends to dampen the paper, he sometimes uses a B lead or 2B lead, which acts like a 4B in that environment. However, his website explains that he uses 6B lead, with some variation. For pieces rendered entirely in pencil, he employs a variety of pencil leads of varying degrees of hardness. After darkening in the construction lines that he wishes to keep, he erases the lighter ones with a kneaded eraser before rendering greater detail. For more detailed erasures, he uses a pencil-shaped white eraser, and to erase large areas, he uses a larger, hand-held white eraser, which he calls a \\"thermonuclear eraser\\", because it \\"takes care of everything\\". For inking, which is Hughes' least favorite part of the illustration process,Hughes (2010). p. 82. he uses a size three Scharff brush and Dr. Ph. Martin's Black Star Hi-Carb ink. Hughes also favors Faber-Castell PITT artist pens, which come in a variety of points, including fine, medium, bold and brush tips, which Hughes uses for brush work on convention sketches. Though he stated in a 2006 interview that he favored PITT pens for convention sketches, but never for cover work, he later used them to illustrate the cover of ImagineFX magazine #67 in 2011, and for an illustration of Fire and Ice for a Justice League card game.Hughes (2010). p. 18. He occasionally will use Copic markers in both warm and cool gray tones to render covers in grayscale.

Retrieved September 8, 2010. though when rendering an attractive female, he begins with the face, so that in the event that he fails to capture her good looks, an entire rendered illustration has not been wasted. He uses Sharpie markers to fill in larger areas, which he feels would be too tedious to render in pencil, such as the costumes of characters like Batman, which he believes should be rendered in black rather than blue. He uses Photoshop to color his cover work. He initially colored his covers after inking them traditionally, but beginning with Wonder Woman (Vol 2) #195, he switched methods to one in which he renders the greyscale stage in pencil, pen and marker like a painting, and then uses Photoshop's Layer tool to colorize each element in the image separately.Hughes (2010). p. 92. Hughes sometimes uses colored markers to embellish parts of a convention sketch, as when he uses red for female characters' lips, or a silver pen to render scenes set in outer space.Coulson, Steve. \\"Adam Hughes - Anatomy of a sketch, Pt5 - The Finish\\".

Until the expansion of the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples, this plot centered exclusively on the courtship rituals between a man and a woman and the obstacles that faced the potential couple on its way to the nuptial payoff. The marriage plot became a popular source of entertainment in the 18th and 19th centuries with the rise of the middle class novel. The foremost practitioners of the form include some of the more illustrious names in English letters, among them Samuel Richardson, Jane Austen, George Eliot and the Bront√´ sisters. Use in novels Post-1980 deconstructionist criticism has highlighted how the plot was a profitable publishing and ideological production that served to ensure the ascendancy of the middle class. The marriage plot was the liberal age's reformulation of the medieval romance, which excluded all but aristocratic ladies and their chivalrous knights from its epics of love. The marriage plot promises to liberate romance by making it available to greater sections of society: the middle class and to some extent, the working classes, who are relegated to comic relief in 16th- and 17th-century theater, suddenly become serious moral subjects. Today, few doubt the ennobling qualities of love, but giving that nobility of soul to anyone but nobles was an innovation to be found foundationally in the marriage plot, perhaps pioneered by Richardson's Pamela, wherein a lowly but virtuous maid is raised beyond her birth through her insistent chastity and her subsequent marriage to the lordly Mr. B. Use in film Film, which supplanted the novel as the most popular narrative form in the 20th century, did not abandon this innovation of the novel. Rather, the marriage plot has enjoyed a continued efflorescence, visible to this day in the popular film form known as the \\"romantic comedy\\". At its most formulaic, critics have asserted, the conventions of the marriage plot, with the cathartic closure that its marriage ending delivers to its believers, ultimately renounces politics and engagement in the world in favor of privacy and domestic bliss. We may see this, for instance, in the film You've Got Mail, which resolves the political opposition between mega-bookstore boss Tom Hanks and bookshop- around-the-corner owner, Meg Ryan, by uniting its lead characters in a union that effaces the unequal distribution of capital that originally put them at odds.

The school is located in the Truxton Circle neighborhood of Northwest Washington, two blocks from the intersection of New Jersey and New York avenues. Dunbar, which serves grades 9 through 12, is a part of the District of Columbia Public Schools. From the early 20th century to the 1950s, Dunbar became known as the classical academic high school for black students in the segregated public schools. As all public school teachers were federal civil servants, its teachers received pay equal to that of white teachers in other schools in the district. It attracted high-quality faculty, many with advanced degrees, including doctorates. Parents sent their children to the high school from across the city because of its high standards. Many of its alumni graduated from top-quality colleges and universities, and gained professional degrees. History Originally named the Preparatory High School for Colored Youth from 1891 to 1916 it became known as M Street High School. The school was founded as an educational mission at the Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church. The school was one of America's first public high school for black students. When its location was changed from M Street, the school was renamed in 1916 for the noted African-American poet, Paul Laurence Dunbar, who died in 1906. Dunbar High School, Washington DC in 1917 As more high schools had been established, Dunbar was designated as the city's academic high school, with other schools providing more vocational or technical training. Dunbar was known for its excellent academics, enough so that some black parents moved to Washington specifically so their children could attend it. All the public school teachers were federal employees, and Dunbar's faculty was paid well by the standards of the time, earning parity pay with Washington's white school teachers. The school boasted a high number of graduates who went on to higher education and a generally successful student body. In the 21st century, Dunbar is similar to Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Baltimore, Maryland and Fort Worth, Texas, as all three schools have a majority African-American student body and are of major importance to the local African-American community. All three schools are also highly regarded for their athletic programs within their respective school district in the sports of football, basketball and track. There is also a Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Lexington, Kentucky. One of Dunbar's first principals in Washington, DC was the first black graduate of Harvard College. Almost all the teachers had graduate degrees, and several earned PhDs. By the 1950s, Dunbar High School was sending 80 percent of its students to college. According to columnist Thomas Sowell's 2015 appraisal, this all changed after the landmark United States Supreme Court Case Brown v. Board of Education that ruled for integration of public schools: > \\"For Washington, the end of racial segregation led to a political > compromise, in which all schools became neighborhood schools. Dunbar, which > had been accepting outstanding black students from anywhere in the city, > could now accept only students from the rough ghetto neighborhood in which > it was located. Virtually overnight, Dunbar became a typical ghetto school. > As unmotivated, unruly and disruptive students flooded in, Dunbar teachers > began moving out and many retired. More than 80 years of academic excellence > simply vanished into thin air.\\" Since its inception, the school has graduated many well-known figures of the 20th century, including Sterling Brown, H. Naylor Fitzhugh, Nannie Helen Burroughs, Charles R. Drew, William H. Hastie, Charles Hamilton Houston, Robert Heberton Terrell, Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., Paul Capel, III, Robert C. Weaver, and James E. Bowman. Its illustrious faculty included Anna Julia Cooper, Kelly Miller, Mary Church Terrell, A. A. Birch Jr., Carter G. Woodson, and Julia Evangeline Brooks, who was also a graduate of the school. Among its principals were Anna J. Cooper, Richard Greener, Mary Jane Patterson, and Robert Heberton Terrell. An unusual number of teachers and principals held Ph.D. degrees, including historian Carter G. Woodson, the second African American to earn a Phd. from Harvard (after W. E. B. Du Bois) and the father of 'Black History Month'. Up until 1954, Fairfax County, Virginia, had no secondary schools for black students.

The northwestern terminus of the Chicago Transit Authority's Blue Line, it is a subway station with two island platforms serving three tracks, situated under the parking garage for Terminals 1, 2, and 3. Trains are scheduled to depart from O'Hare every 2‚Äì7 minutes during rush-hour periods and take about 40 minutes to travel to the Loop. It is the westernmost station of the Chicago 'L' system. It is also the only station without coordinates in Chicago's grid system, It is the only underground terminus, and is the only terminal that does not directly connect to any CTA or Pace buses. It is also one of two terminals (the other being on the Yellow Line) that does not have a yard assigned to it (the yard is located at , one stop east). History O'Hare destination sign O'Hare station opened on September 3, 1984, as the terminus of an extension of the West-Northwest route from its former terminal at River Road. It was built to a design by the architectural firm Murphy/Jahn. Introduction of premium fare For the first 28 years of O'Hare station's operations, the fare passengers paid the same fare to enter it as they would at any other \\"L\\" station. The premium fare was imposed on O'Hare passengers in 2013; first (in January 2013), only passengers buying single-ride tickets had to pay the surcharge; by July of the same year, the surcharge was imposed on most other passengers (those using a Chicago Card or a Chicago Card Plus) as well. Accident On March 24, 2014, a train approaching the station on the middle track collided with the bumper, then jumped the tracks and crashed into the escalators, injuring 32 people.Commuter Train Derails at Chicago Airport (Yahoo News) The station reopened on March 30, 2014, at 2:00 p.m. Architecture The station was designed by Helmut Jahn of Murphy/Jahn in the distinctive Postmodernism style.

The mosque's dome has been temporarily removed for repairs. Shavei Shomron (, lit. Returnees of Samaria) is an Israeli settlement in the northern West Bank. Located to the west of Nablus (Shechem) on the road to Tulkarm, it is organised as a community settlement and falls under the jurisdiction of Shomron Regional Council. In it had a population of , mostly religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox Jews. Its municipal jurisdiction is 664 dunams, of which 272 dunams are built up. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. History In late 1976, supporters of the Gush Emunim (Bloc of the Faithful) staged a takeover of the abandoned Sebastia railroad station, located outside an Arab village of the same name. The location is in proximity to the ruins of Samaria, the capital city of the northern Kingdom of Israel, built by King Omri. Using this as justification to secure the Israeli claim to the region, the demonstrators demanded that settlement be initiated in this region. With the support of newly elected Prime Minister Menachem Begin, a residential community was built the following year alongside a military base at a strategically valuable crossroads by residents of nearby Netanya, and with the assistance of the Amana settlement organisation. According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from two nearby Palestinian villages in order to construct Shavei Shomron: 680 dunums of land were taken from An-Naqura,An Naqura Village profile, ARIJ, p. 15 while 236 dunums were taken from Deir Sharaf. Deir Sharaf village profile, ARIJ, pp. 15-16 Intifada and disengagement Like all Israeli settlers, the residents of Shavei Shomron traveled through and conducted business in Nablus and neighboring Arab villages. However, as tensions increased following the First Intifada, Israeli travel to Nablus was restricted, and new roads were built to bypass certain villages. Twenty-four hundred dunums were confiscated from Palestinian villages to build a bypass road from Shavei Shomron to the Mt. Ibal military installation. In 2002, the Israeli Supreme Court approved the construction of part of the West Bank barrier around the community. Many local residents opposed its construction, fearing that it may become a future border between Israel and a Palestinian state. Others were concerned that an incident like the one earlier in the year, when a terrorist infiltrated the community and targeted the kindergarten with grenades and firearms before being shot by a local resident, could be repeated without such measures. In August 2005, the community hosted mass demonstrations in opposition to the Israeli disengagement from Gaza, which included the forced evacuation of four settlements to the north of Shavei Shomron, and brought a potential frontier to the settlement's backyard. Following their evacuation and demolition, the community hosted some of the former residents of Homesh and Sa-Nur. As of 2008, residents of Shavei Shomron were being trained by Mishmeret Yesha in counterterrorism tactics and the use of guns. Demographics The community boasts a swimming pool, ulpan (Hebrew classes) for newcomers, and picturesque views of the Samarian hills, which serve to attract a population including many olim (Jewish immigrants) from English- speaking countries as well as Russian Jews from the former USSR, Yemenite Jews, Bnei Menashe, and some Incan Jewish families from Trujillo, Peru that converted to Orthodox Judaism.

On that Saturday, around 12:30 pm, the centre section of the south lane of an overpass ( section of a three-lane overpass) collapsed in Laval, a suburb of Montreal, on Boulevard de la Concorde running over Autoroute 19. The collapsed section crushed two vehicles under it, killing five people and seriously injuring six others who went over the edge while travelling on the overpass. The north-lane half, along the same bridge, did not collapse. The autoroute was closed for almost four weeks, \\"disabling an important north-south link between Montreal and its northern suburbs as well as the Laurentian region\\". Immediately before A number of people had noticed that the overpass was not in good shape: #\\"People living near de la Concorde and Highway 19 told The Gazette they had noticed the overpass had begun to crumble in recent months\\" #Carole Hackenbeck, less than a month before the collapse, noticed that there were \\"unusually large gaps and misaligned spacing in the deck-support structure underneath\\". #\\"One witness told TVA television network that he noticed the road had sunk an inch or two when he travelled over the overpass minutes before the collapse, and he called emergency dispatchers\\". #Also, \\"several motorists told the French-language all-news network Le Canal Nouvelles that they had called police up to an hour before the collapse to report seeing fissures appearing in the overpass roadbed and chunks of concrete falling to the road below\\". Responses to calls When the Quebec Ministry of Transport was contacted regarding blocks of concrete falling onto Autoroute 19 from the Concorde Boulevard overpass above, a patroller was sent to do a sight and sound test to gauge whether the road should be closed and to clear away the concrete hazards; this was 30 minutes before the collapse. Neither roads were closed as the official concluded that the bridge presented no immediate danger. The patroller however did demand that an inspection be carried out as soon as possible, but was told \\"that an inspector would show up only on Monday, two days later\\". The Ministry also sent out messages to journalists and traffic reporters warning of the concrete debris; this was confirmed by Josee Seguin, a spokeswoman for the Ministry. Bridge history and design problems The overpass on the Boulevard de la Concorde (Concorde Boulevard) was built in 1970 and was expected to have a life span of 70 years, of which it only lasted 36. David Lau, as part of an article for the Ottawa Citizen, suggests that this estimation of 70 years was inaccurate. They underestimated traffic volumes; they also did not take into account that \\"the amount and weight of trucks [on] today's roadways are significantly higher\\". He noted, \\"30 or 40 years ago, engineers could not anticipate the traffic some of their bridges would be forced to accommodate in the coming decades\\". The design of the overpass was considered innovative at the time; however, this design made it nearly impossible to inspect thoroughly, as the entire deck would have had to be removed for such an inspection. Report of the Commission of inquiry into the collapse , October 7, 2006, page 53. Michel Despres (Transport Minister of Quebec) stated that it was inspected once a year, and got a more in-depth inspection once every three years, as per the usual inspection requirements in Quebec, last being May 2005. Ken Bontius, a civil/structural engineer at Hatch Mott MacDonald adds that the bridge was examined bi-annually by structural engineers. The aftermath After the collapse of the overpass, the government moved quickly to rescue survivors, remove the dead, and clear away the debris. The Minist√®re du Transport du Qu√©bec (MTQ) immediately requested that any overpasses of similar design in Quebec be identified. Of several such overpasses, only the de Blois overpass adjacent to the collapsed overpass was confirmed as similar. Indeed, this overpass was built in the same construction project as the de la Concorde overpass and was later found to have had the same flaws. It was closed to traffic less than three hours after the collapse and subsequently demolished. Behavioural effects The Monday (October 2) following the collapse, as everyone was trying to get to work, three major expressways into Montreal from Laval were gridlocked with vehicle line-ups stretching for kilometres. \\"Traffic was backed up as early as 6:00 am on Autoroute 25 and Autoroute 15\\". Normal traffic flows along Autoroute 19 amount to 57,000 vehicles per day in both directions. The collapse caused some changes to these figures with motorists choosing different routes (mainly official detour routes), changing the time they left for work (earlier or later) or change in mode (to bus, metro, etc.) being the main responses. Agency responses In response to the incident, the Quebec government instigated several strategies to speed the recovery effort and to minimise the inconvenience of commuters. The Quebec government made it a priority to rescue survivors, remove the dead and the debris from Autoroute 19. The demolition work (of the Concorde Boulevard) closed Autoroute 19 for a little under four weeks and caused \\"motorists [to] get up earlier and use special buses to commute into the city\\". These buses were shuttles provided to ferry commuters between new park and ride sites and subway stations. The government also put detour routes in place, urged commuters to take public transport and to carpool. CAA-Quebec, a non-profit organisation also has urged commuters to consider carpooling as an alternative to driving, suggesting their free carpool ride-sharing program which allows drivers and passengers to network to organise carpools. Transit authorities in Laval and Montreal also increased services on some routes to accommodate more commuters: * An extra commuter train (on loan from Ontario's GO Transit commuter rail to assist with higher rider numbers) * Extra park-and-ride parking lots including a free bus shuttle to subway stations - to encourage commuters to not use the already overtaxed detour routes * Reserved bus lanes extended * Adding 6 km (3.5 mi) to two high-frequency bus routes * More buses Montreal Gazette transit journalist Andy Riga (2006) interviewed Marc LaForge, from the Societe de transport de Laval, about the transport department suing Transport Quebec to pay for all these extra services: > \\"Laval's transit authority - the Societe de transport de Laval - is asking > for $312,500, for now. That's $12,000 for each of the 25 weekdays from > October 2nd to November 3rd on which it provided extra services for > commuters whose routes were affected by the collapse\\". Costs also included paying overtime to drivers. Detour routes The official detour routes were as follows: * Autoroute 25 * Autoroute 15 * Autoroute 40 * Autoroute 440 * Route 335 * Route 148 Donations from other provinces To aid Laval commuters, and to help the province cope with traffic problems, Ontario donated a \\"GO Train\\" to increase ridership in the wake of the weekend collapse. Ontario's premier Dalton McGuinty - \\"[Quebec officials] tell me there has been an increase, [a] fairly dramatic increase, in demand for the rail.\\" Also \\"There's a rail line that runs along the site of the tragedy, and more and more people want to use that rail line\\". Official inquiry On October 3, 2006, the Government of Quebec called a commission of inquiry to determine the cause of the collapse. Just over a year later, on October 15, 2007, the Inquiry Commission released a report of its findings. This report recounts the events just before, during, and after the collapse, discusses the overpass design and history, identifies the cause of the collapse as well as other contributing factors, suggests who is directly responsible for the collapse, and makes recommendations to prevent such an event from recurring. Determined causes The commissioners agreed that the overpass collapsed due to shear failure in the southeast abutment. This was due to a horizontal plane fracture that had slowly grown over the years. The fracture allowed the part of the abutment below it to break away from the part above, causing the collapse. The three main causes of the fracture and subsequent collapse were: * During design, the steel reinforcement was concentrated in one layer, causing a weak plane. This did not contravene the code provisions of the time. * During construction, the reinforcement was not put into the proper locations, as defined in the design, exacerbating the design weakness. The contractors and inspecting engineers were blamed by the commission for this cause. * A low quality concrete was used in the abutments, causing poor freeze-thaw behavior. This was blamed on poor communication at all levels, including that of the government-defined requirements at the time Three other contributing causes were identified by the committee, but not agreed to by all the experts. * All thick reinforced concrete slabs should have shear reinforcing, and this is a deficiency in the existing bridge design code. * Proper waterproofing was never installed, even during the bridge repairs done in 1992. * Extensive concrete removal and rebar exposure caused during the 1992 repairs caused weakening of the structure. The final report names four individuals who were responsible for unprofessional work on the overpass: * Marcel Dubois, engineer with Desjardins Sauriol et Associ√©s (DSA), for improper supervision during construction * Claude Robert, president of Acier d'Armature de Montreal (AAM), for poor quality control caused by passing off responsibilities * Tiona Sanogo, engineer, for the damage caused during the 1992 repairs * Christian Mercier, engineer, for an incomplete inspection of the overpass in 2004 Policy changes This event, and another similar overpass collapse in 2000, have increased scrutiny of Quebec's infrastructure and has led to increased efforts to detect signs of wear in aged structures. Accused of consistently putting off repairs to pass balanced budgets, the Quebec government has since increased spending on highways and projects and has increased infrastructure spending for future budgets. This was welcome news to the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers (CCPE) as they had been campaigning for infrastructure renewal and maintenance. \\"Hopefully this tragic event did not happen in vain and we, as a society, will learn from it and make the conscious decision to re-invest in infrastructure using a long-term, holistic approach as well as life-cycle management guidelines\\", Marie Lemay the CEO of CCPE said. \\"Long-term adequate financial resources are needed from all levels of government in order to support a sustainable and planned approach over the full life cycle of any infrastructure project\\". In July 2007, incidentally just weeks before the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse, the Quebec department of transports issued a list of 135 overpasses that were considered potentially unsafe. These overpasses were put under close scrutiny and closed to all overweight trucks (in excess of 20 tonnes). Also, the City of Montreal issued a list of a few overpasses under its own responsibility, citing that those were also under close scrutiny and closed to overweight traffic. The day after the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse, the City of Montreal revised its policies for one of those, the Henri-Bourassa overpass above Pie IX Boulevard, closing it completely to all trucks. This overpass has since been demolished and replaced with an at-grade intersection. As of April 2008, 28 bridges in Quebec are slated to be demolished due to structural deficiencies, and 25 are to receive major repairs.

Early life and union career Born in New York City, Glazer was a graduate of Brooklyn College. He eventually moved to Akron, Ohio, where he performed for the United Rubber Workers throughout his career and also served as education director from 1950 to 1962. Glazer was also a member of the Textile Workers Union of America Joe Glazer, Labor's Troubadour, pp. 1-149. as well as an adviser to the United States Information Agency.Glazer, Labor's Troubadour, pp. 150-211 According to his obituary in The Washington Post in 2006: \\"Mr. Glazer in 1961 joined the Foreign Service staff of the U.S. Information Agency, then headed by Edward R. Murrow, and was sent to Mexico as labor information officer. He transferred to the State Department in Washington as a labor adviser in 1965.\\" His younger brother is sociologist Nathan Glazer.Glazer, Labor's Troubadour, p. 4 Singer and songwriter Some of his more acclaimed songs include \\"The Mill Was Made of Marble,\\" \\"Too Old To Work\\" and \\"Automaton.\\" He recorded \\"In Old Moscow\\" (\\"My Darling Party Line\\"), a song which ridiculed the Communist Party USA's Stalinist reversal following the 1939 Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. In 1954 Glazer released two albums of music from the Industrial Workers of the World, including one entirely of songs by Wobbly songwriter Joe Hill, released by Folkways Records. In 1960 Glazer collaborated with Edith Fowke to publish Songs of Work and Freedom, which included 10 of his original compositions. He went on to dedicate numerous albums to specific trades, including coal mining, newspaper printing, steelwork, textile mills, and woodworking. In 1970 Glazer founded Collector Records, originally to issue his own recordings, and, later, recordings by other performers. Collector's first release was Glazer's 1971 album Garbage and Other Songs of Our Times backed by jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd and his trio. The title track became one of Glazer's most well-known songs after Pete Seeger performed it on Sesame Street and recorded versions of it both for the children's music and environmentalism markets. In 1979, Glazer invited 14 other labor musicians to the George Meany Center for Labor Studies in Silver Spring, Maryland, to share musical and written compositions, and to discuss the effective use of music, song, poetry and chants in labor activism. The three-day event became an annual one, becoming known as the Great Labor Arts Exchange (GLAE). Over the next five years, the concept of \\"labor culture\\" and how the labor movement and the arts interacted, which Glazer and others promoted, expanded. In 1984, Glazer incorporated the Labor Heritage Foundation as a parent body for GLAE as well as to curate and promote the culture of the American labor movement.Glazer, Labor's Troubadour, pp. 212-215. In 2002, Glazer released his autobiography, Labor's Troubadour, published by the University of Illinois Press. Glazer was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the World Folk Music Association in 2002. Death and legacy Glazer died on September 29, 2006 at the age of 88 due to the progression of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, at his home in Silver Spring, Maryland.

She had few educational qualifications but was revered for her kind-heartedness and self-sacrifice. Indo-Fijians in Suva called her Hamari Mataji (Our Honoured Mother). She did her work with dedication but was sometimes eccentric and independent minded. Mission sister in India Hannah Dudley was born in 1864 in Morpeth, New South Wales, Australia. She served as a teacher in New South Wales before joining the British Methodist Missionary Society as a mission sister in India. She worked hard, without regard to her health and after six years her health broke down. She returned to Australia for medical treatment and was refused permission to serve in India again on medical grounds. Arrival in Fiji In February, at the Conference for Overseas Missions, she heard of the need for a mission sister for Indian work in Fiji. She offered her services and with her knowledge of Urdu was happily accepted. Women's organisations linked to the Methodist Church in Australia raised funds for her trip and she arrived in Fiji on 24 August 1897. There were no facilities to accommodate her in Suva, and being determined to live close to the Indians, she found a room with a verandah in the Indian quarter of Suva. Early years in Fiji She established the first school for Indian children in Suva, on her verandah, where she taught Urdu and English to 40 children. Her time-table was: School from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., visiting homes from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and three nights a week of night school for young men until 9:30 p.m. On Wednesday nights she held a class for Christian instruction and on Sundays she held services on her verandah. On Sundays she also walked three miles to the local gaol to speak to 400 prisoners and pray with condemned prisoners about to be hanged. Initially, she was paid only ¬£50 p.a. and this was raised to ¬£75 p.a. in 1899. With this meagre sum she supported herself and later five children as well. In 1900, her mother, Lily Dudley, came to live with her and assist her in her work. This was an unofficial arrangement and Lily taught music to earn money for herself and the mission.thank you... Indian Mission Hall As the Church realised the extent of her work, erection of two native school buildings at Nausori and Davuilevu were authorised and she was allowed to use the Jublee Church for her day classes and for her Indian services on Sundays. She wanted a wooden church and collected money to have one built and it dedicated on 19 December 1901 at the site of the present Dudley High School, called the Indian Mission Hall. Adopted children During her first year of arrival in Fiji, she began adopting orphans. She started with two girls and a boy but soon the number of adopted children had grown to eleven. The most famous of these was a boy given to Hannah Dudley by his father when the mother deserted him. He took his foster-mother's name and became Raymond Dudley. He went on to become the President of the New Zealand Methodist Conference in 1956. As her adopted family grew, the Church decided to build an orphanage for her at Davuilevu but she refused to move there. In 1904 an orphanage was built at Davuilevu, called The Dudley Orphanage for Indian Children. On 26 July 1905, she suddenly left for Bengal to join the Faith Mission, taking the children with her under her own name. Weeping Indians on the Suva Wharf showed the general feeling of the Indian community but the Mission Board in Sydney was annoyed with her for relinquishing her work. Indian mission work in Suva suffered in her absence. She returned to Suva in July 1908. Two of the children that she had taken with her had died in India. Later years She again devoted herself to her work but her influence had waned. She had seen the effect that the indenture system had had on Indians in Fiji, particularly on women, and did her best to have the system abolished. She left Fiji in August 1913 because of illness, taking five girls and young Raymond with her. Australian immigration laws forced her to move with her children to Auckland. In 1924, she again offered to return to Fiji but her offer was declined because of her age and her independent habits. She died in Auckland on 3 May 1931 at the age of sixty-eight. She has left behind her legacy in Suva - the Dudley High School and the Dudley Memorial Church.

It was a standard production model junior coaster from Zierer. It was known for having the longest train of any coaster (with 20 two-seat cars) at Geauga Lake, and it was also the only coaster in the park to complete a full circuit twice while in operation. Its height restrictions were among the most accommodating in the whole park. This ride was installed as \\"Roadrunner Express\\" during the transition to Six Flags Ohio in 2000, and was one of three identical coasters installed in Six Flags parks that year. The other two are at Six Flags New England and Six Flags Discovery Kingdom. In March 2004, Six Flags sold Geauga Lake (then named Six Flags Worlds of Adventure) to Cedar Fair for $145 million. Any references to Looney Tunes and DC Comics characters had to be removed from the park before opening day. This change affected several rides and attractions, including Roadrunner Express. Cedar Fair renamed the coaster to Beaver Land Mine Ride. On September 21, 2007, Cedar Fair announced that Geauga Lake would no longer operate as a traditional amusement park, and instead become solely a waterpark, Wildwater Kingdom. As a result, September 16, 2007 was the last day the ride would operate at Geauga Lake. With that announcement, the rides from the amusement park side began to be relocated to other theme parks.

Demy made Model Shop, which was his first English-language film, following the international success of his film The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Aim√©e reprises the title role from Demy's 1960 French-language film Lola. Model Shop makes explicit the fact that Demy's films take place in the same narrative universe. It weaves together the plots of Lola, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, and Bay of Angels. Catherine Deneuve appears as herself on the cover of a coffee-table magazine in Lola's apartment. Plot summary In 1969 Los Angeles, 26-year-old architect George Matthews (Gary Lockwood) is floundering. He's unemployed and in debt, his live-in girlfriend, aspiring actress Gloria (Alexandra Hay), is tired of him, and his car is about to be repossessed. Going round to friends to scrounge $100 to stave off the finance company, he sees a beautiful foreign woman (Anouk Aim√©e) in a white convertible and follows her to a mansion in the hills. On the street, he sees the beautiful woman again and follows her. She enters a model shop, a tawdry studio where customers can take erotic photographs, and he books a session with her, but she is uninterested in his attentions. When calling his parents, he learns that his draft notice has arrived, and he must report for Army duty the next week. For the first time, he comes face-to-face with his own mortality. At home, he finds that Gloria has landed a job with a new admirer, who is taking her out for the evening. Obsessed with the enigmatic foreigner, he returns to the model shop and books another session with her. She tells him she is French, named C√©cile but working as Lola, and recounts some of her problems. Abandoned by her husband Michel for a female gambler named Jackie Demaistre, she is trying to make enough money to return to France and her son. In a tender night of drinking and lovemaking at Lola's apartment, George and Lola talk of their failed romances, their dashed dreams, philosophy, and mortality. Through their conversation, they each find the willpower to continue living, and George gives her the money he had borrowed to save his car. The next morning, when George goes home, he finds Gloria packing to leave. He phones Lola, but her roommate tells him she flew to Paris that morning, having enough cash for a plane ticket. As they talk, a tow truck outside is removing his car. He tells the roommate: \\"I just wanted to tell her that I love her. I wanted her to know that I was going to begin again. It sounds stupid, I know. But a person can always try.\\" Production Jacques Demy later told the Los Angeles Times: > I came here for a vacation, not to make a movie. But I fell in love with LA. > I just had to make a film. It's so marvellous. When I left Paris it was > dead. Now I've missed the revolution and everything. But I had been so > depressed, so discouraged. I said I must go someplace where something's > happening.

Demy initially wanted to have a new face in the leading role, and chose the then-unknown Harrison Ford. Columbia Pictures, however, had no confidence in Ford's abilities and demanded that Demy hire a more experienced actor.Harrison Ford: ¬´Jacques Demy avait foi en moi¬ª, Le Figaro, 8 April 2013 Gary Lockwood was eventually cast on the basis of his performance in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Demy says Lockwood \\"had nothing to do in Space Odyssey but he knew how to move. He's very natural, very simple.\\" Alexandra Hay was cast after Demy saw her in The Beard. She was under contract to Columbia, who financed the film. \\"Alexandra is a free bird\\", said Demy. \\"In a certain way she is like Jeanne Moreau ... She has the same strong will. She will succeed because she wants to act. I think maybe Bette Davis was that way too.\\" Filming began in June 1968. Anouk Aim√©e did not arrive until four weeks into filming, well after she was expected. Rumours said that this was due to her affair with Omar Sharif (Aim√©e was married at the time). Eventually, after Columbia Pictures sent her an ultimatum, Aim√©e arrived and filming resumed. \\"I did Jacques's first film so it has to be that I do his first American film\\", said Aim√©e. Carole Eastman (under the name Adrien Joyce) did some work on the script. The Los Angeles rock band Spirit both appears in the film and recorded a soundtrack that would not be released commercially for another 36 years after the film appeared in theaters. Reaction The film performed poorly at the box office. Demy's wife Agn√®s Varda later said Demy \\"was less than happy with what Columbia did with Model Shop. They killed it! I don't say it was the greatest picture but opening it in double features in the suburbs! Columbia really let him do what he wanted but he didn't get the point early enough: if you make a cheap movie they don't think anything of it.\\" Critic Jonathan Rosenbaum views Model Shop as one of director Jacques Demy's most critically underrated and neglected films, writing that \\"the play between actuality and artifice is the most complex and unconventional\\" in the film. Adrian Martin also celebrated the \\"still-too-little seen\\" Model Shop. He notes how it is \\"keyed into the mild eventfulness of the fait divers, undeniably emotional and momentous events happening to, or resonating within, derisory bodies that can scarcely support, transmit, narrate or pass on that emotion.\\" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club is also a major proponent of Model Shop, writing that Demy's film is \\"obsessively escapist\\" and that \\"every film [Demy] made, whether it had singing in it or not, was essentially a musical; he could make the sad streets of Nantes into an MGM back lot.\\". He later includes it in his \\"Cine- Autobiography\\", a list of unranked films which \\"opened doors or made [him] turn a corner.\\". Charlotte Garson notes how the films of Demy, as in the works of Balzac and Proust, create a universe in which not only themes but characters reappear. A few of the recurring motifs in Model Shop are chance making or marring relationships, lovers parted by war, women surviving by near-prostitution and the US as a world of sunshine where people drive open- top cars. C√©cile is not only a character from Lola, which also featured her husband Michel, her lover Frankie and her child, but was mentioned in Les Demoiselles de Rochefort as well. Another mention is of the gambler Jackie from La Baie des Anges.(French) Model Shop is included on Sight and Sound 's list of 75 most neglected films. Films on the list were selected by 75 international critics as \\"unduly obscure and worthy of greater eminence\\". When promoting Model Shop, Demy said he wanted to make an all-singing musical in America about students called The Interview. It was never made. Legacy A brief portion of the film is seen at the beginning of the season seven episode of Mad Men, \\"Field Trip\\", when the character Don Draper is shown watching it in a theater. The plot of the episode mirrors that of the film; Don is in a failing marriage with his actress wife Megan. Brief clips of the film are used in the music documentary Echo in the Canyon to help set the feeling of 1960s Los Angeles. Los Angeles pop culture historian Alison Martino named Model Shop \\"the inspiration for Echo in the Canyon. Apparently the directors caught it playing on Turner Classic Movies. The filmmakers consider it particularly evocative of mid-1960s sensibilities. It definitely embodies the feel of that era. Perhaps that's why Don Draper is watching this movie in episode 7.3 [of Mad Men]\\".

The mill was powered by the Wissahickon Creek and is located on Mather's Lane near Skippack Pike (Pennsylvania Route 73), and just west of the historic Bethlehem Pike in the village of Whitemarsh (near Fort Washington), Pennsylvania, in the United States. The water-powered gristmill was built around the year 1690 by Edward Farmar. Farmar's father was a British army officer living in Ireland who had purchased a parcel of land in Pennsylvania from William Penn. This tract contained most of what is present-day Whitemarsh Township. Farmar's father died before he could move his family to America, but his mother brought the family to American in 1685, settling in the area of present-day Fort Washington. Farmar Mill was the original terminus for Skippack Pike, which was established in 1713. By 1722, a road also existed from Farmar Mill, through the village of Three Tuns, to Richard Saunders' ferry, on the Neshaminy Creek (later the village of Bridge Point, now Edison) in Bucks County. In 1740, Quaker businessman Samuel Morris bought a one-half interest in the mill, and bought the remaining half interest after Farmar's death in 1746. During the period of 1743 and 1748, Morris was building his country mansion \\"Whitemarsh Estate\\" (later known as Hope Lodge) a mere stone's throw from Farmar's Mill. After Morris' death in 1770, his brother Joshua sold the mill and of land to Isaac Mather, whose son Joseph built the present mill in 1820. Farmar Mill is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Today, Farmar Mill is part of a museum and historic site at Hope Lodge operated by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. Due to concerns of structural integrity, the building is not open to the public. See also *List of the oldest buildings in Pennsylvania *Mathers Mill from Historic American Buildings Survey.

Bengali theatre is produced mainly in West Bengal, and in Bangladesh. The term may also refer to some Hindi theatres which are accepted by the Bengali people. Bengali theatre has its origins in British rule. It began as private entertainment in the early 19th century. In the pre-independence period, Bengali theatres played a pivotal role in manifesting dislike of the British Raj. After the independence of India in 1947, leftist movements in West Bengal used theatre as a tool for social awareness. This added some unique characteristics to the art form that still have strong effects. These groups differentiate themselves ideologically from commercial Bengali theatre. Types Play Tohar Gaon Bhi Ek Din staged by Sreejansena group The many theatres in West Bengal can be broadly divided into Kolkata-based theatres and rural theatres. Outside Bengali-speaking areas, the term \\"Bengali theatre\\" primarily refers to Kolkata-based groups, as the rural theatres are less well- known. The two types are similar in form and content, but the Kolkata-based theatres are better funded and staffed. This is mainly due to the influx of expertise from rural areas to Kolkata in search of a larger audience. There are also Bengali folk theatres. There are many dialects of Bengali spoken in West Bengal and Bangladesh. The larger Bengali theatres use the dialect spoken in Kolkata, Bengali folk theatres have performances in some of the other Bengali dialects. There is another category of Bengali theatre called Jatra, which is run commercially in rural West Bengal and Bangladesh. This traditional Bengali theatre form is mostly performed by travelling troupes. The most prominent characteristics of Jatra are melodramatic contents and presentation, exaggerated expressions and movements, and an extensive use of traditional musical instruments. Jatra originally explored subjects concerning the tales of Radha-Krishna. But at present, it has been modernized to feature crisis through stories. Many popular Bengali film artists participate in Jatra. Hindi theatres which are accepted by the Bengali people include the productions of Rangakarmee (established 1976) directed by Usha Ganguly, and productions by Padatik (established 1972) under Shyamanand Jalan, who started with Anamika in 1955. Following the independence of Pakistan in 1947, religion-based nationalism was strong and affected the theatre in eastern Bengal. In East Pakistan (modern-day Bangladesh), playwrights emerged such as Ibrahim Khan (1894-1978), Ibrahim Khalil (b. 1916), Akbar ad-Din (1895-1978) and others. These playwrights would create plays related to the Islamic history of the subcontinent and Middle East, glorifying past Muslim rulers as well as the history of the Pakistan Movement. Music The late 19th- and early 20th-century theatres had their own Bengali music. This form was pioneered by Girish Chandra Ghosh; the era of Bengali theatre before him laid the groundwork, and after his death Bengali theatre music became more experimental. During the era of Girish Chandra, all stage-plays included some form of traditional Bengali music, and dancer-singers who performed before and between the acts. Mythological plays would have Kirtan-anga songs, epics would include indigenous styles such as khyƒÅmtƒÅ, and comedies and farcical plays often included tappƒÅ songs by Nidhu Babu.

It was named after Jean-Charles de Borda (1733‚Äì1799), the French mathematician, physicist, naturalist and sailor, by the Baudin expedition to Australia during January 1803. It has been the site of an operating lighthouse since 1858 and is currently located within the Flinders Chase National Park.  Description  Cape Borda is located in the gazetted locality of Cape Borda about west of Kingscote. It is the most north westerly point of the Kangaroo Island coast. It is the termination for a pair of coastlines ‚Äì the western coastline extending from Cape du Couedic in the south and the northern coastline extending from Point Marsden in the east. It is described as ‚Äòa bold cliffy headland, high‚Äô with ‚Äòthe upper half of the cliff is formed of white limestone, and the lower half is very dark volcanic rock‚Äô and that ‚Äòthe hills at the cape rise to a height of more than and are covered with small scrub.‚Äô  Formation, geology & oceanography  Cape Borda was formed when the sea reached its present level 7,500 years ago after sea levels started to rise at the start of the Holocene. The cliff line which includes Cape Borda consists of base strata of a metasandstone belonging to the Kanmantoo group bedrock such as Middleton Sandstone and Balquhidder Formation, overlaid by a relatively thick capping of Bridgewater Formation calcarenite rock. The water adjoining the cliff face at Cape Borda drops to depths ranging between to .  History   Aboriginal use  By 1999, the literature had not cited any archaeological discoveries specific to Aboriginal use of land in the immediate vicinity of Cape Borda.  European discovery  Cape Borda was named in January 1803 by the Baudin expedition of 1800-03 in the memory of Jean-Charles de Borda (1733‚Äì1799), the French mathematician, physicist, naturalist and sailor.  Navigation aid  The lighthouse at Cape Borda was the third of three provided for by legislation; the others being erected at Cape Willoughby and Troubridge Shoals (now called Troubridge Island). The light was officially lit on 13 July 1858 and was named the ‚ÄòFlinders Light‚Äô in August 1858 in memory of Matthew Flinders.

It was the largest plesiosaur, and perhaps the largest marine reptile in New Zealand waters at the time. Numerous specimens have been attributed to this genus in the past, but a 2017 paper restricts Mauisaurus to the lectotype and declares it dubious.Norton Hiller; Jos√© P. O‚ÄôGorman; Rodrigo A. Otero; Al A. Mannering (2017). \\"A reappraisal of the Late Cretaceous Weddellian plesiosaur genus Mauisaurus Hector, 1874\\". New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics. 60 (2): 112‚Äì128. doi:10.1080/00288306.2017.1281317. Description Restoration At 68 cervical vertebrae, Mauisaurus is notable for having one of the longest necks (in terms of vertebra number) of any plesiosaur. Mauisaurus was fairly large, reaching over in length.Hiller, N., Mannering, A.A., Jones, C.M., Cruickshank, A.R.I. (2005). The nature of Mauisaurus haasti Hector, 1874 (Reptilia: Plesiosauria). Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 25 (3):588-601. Like other plesiosaurs, it had a long slender body, with numerous vertebrae, allowing flexible movement. On its underside, Mauisaurus had two sets of large flippers. These aided in swimming at high speeds, but may have also allowed the plesiosaur to venture onto shorelines for short amounts of time. Mauisaurus was a carnivore, with sharp jagged teeth that would have been used to grip fish or squid. History of discovery Mauisaurus remains have all been found in New Zealand's South Island, near Canterbury. One Mauisaurus fossil was even found battling a mosasaur from the New Zealand region. Mauisaurus gardneri was described in 1877 based on cervical vertebrae and a humerus from the Gault Clay of Folkestone, but was later declared a nomen vanum in an overview of Cretaceous plesiosaurs published by Samuel Welles in 1962.Welles, S. P. 1962. A new species of elasmosaur from the Aptian of Columbia and a review of the Cretaceous plesiosaurs. University of California Publications in Geological Science 46, 96 pp. Mauisaurus gets its name from the New Zealand MƒÅori mythological demigod, MƒÅui. MƒÅui is said to have pulled New Zealand up from the seabed using a fish hook, thus creating the country. Thus, Mauisaurus means \\"MƒÅui lizard\\". Mauisaurus gets its scientific last name from its original finder, Julius von Haast, who found the first Mauisaurus fossil in 1870. The specimen was then first described in 1874. Cultural references Mauisaurus is one of the few New Zealand prehistoric creatures, and so, has had much publicity in the country. On 1 October 1993, a set of stamps was released to the general public. Although it depicted many other dinosaurs and prehistoric life, Mauisaurus was featured hunting fish on the $1.20 stamp.

Mall St. Matthews is a Louisville, Kentucky shopping mall located at 5000 Shelbyville Road (US 60) in the eastern suburb of St. Matthews. History Interior view of Mall St. Matthews, showing entrance to JCPenney, April 2016 Originally named simply \\"The Mall\\", the facility was the first enclosed suburban shopping mall in the state of Kentucky. It was developed by the Rouse Company and opened on May 30, 1962. Located next to the Watterson Expressway, the mall had A & P, Kaufman-Straus, and Rose's as its anchor stores. The JCPenney anchor store was added in a later mall expansion in the 1960s. The mall's features included a children's play area (including some turtle characters to climb on) near Rose's (which is now a food court), an oversize chess set near Kaufman-Straus, and numerous fountains. The name of the mall was changed to The Mall in St. Matthews as other malls were built, but the mall gradually declined with stores moving to newer malls. In the late 1980s, the mall name was simplified to Mall St. Matthews and remodeled to include a food court in the early 1990s, The Limited/Express, a wing dedicated to Limited Brands was added, and expanded the former Kaufman-Straus store (which had become both a Stewart Dry Goods and L. S. Ayres before closing) to accommodate a Bacon's department store which relocated from its freestanding location at 3937 Shelbyville Road. As more retail stores wanted to move to the mall after these changes, a new wing was built which resulted in the re- routing of Sherburn Lane to the west of the new wing. The mall formerly has a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre which operated from 1982 until Christmas day 1991. The mall expanded again in 1995 with a new wing and the addition of Dillard's, and in 1997 Lord & Taylor followed suit. In 1998 the Bacon's chain was merged into Dillard's, and the former Bacon's location became the Dillard's Men's, Children's & Home store. In 2000 Nordstrom tentatively agreed to build a store, but withdrew in 2001 before a concrete agreement was reached with Rouse. Lord & Taylor closed their store in early 2004, a portion being occupied by regional junior department store Dawahares until early 2007. The mall took out 2 fountains in 2007, one in the food court area and the other in front of Kay Jewelers and Starbucks. Floor tiles replaced the fountains along with new tables and seating. The mall currently has over and includes the anchor stores of JCPenney and separate Dillard's locations for Women (in the 1995 Dillard's building) and Men's, Children's & Home (in the former Lord & Taylor building). The Dillard's Men's & Home store relocated to the former Lord & Taylor building in late 2007, and Dillard's then turned over the former Bacon's store to the mall owner, potentially for redevelopment. On February 21, 2012, Forever 21 moved into the vacated Dillard's/Bacon's store. The mall is currently owned by Brookfield Properties Retail Group, which also owns Oxmoor Center on the other side of the Watterson Expressway. Its major stores include a Dillard's store divided into two sub-stores and JCPenney. A 10-screen Cinemark multiplex that opened on May 16th, 2013 is physically attached to the mall, but is separately owned and has no access to the rest of the mall. On December 26, 2015 a disturbance occurred at the mall involving as many as 2,000 people ‚Äì mostly teenagers ‚Äì some of whom were fighting each other and shoving or pushing mall customers, and the mall was closed early in response to the incident. Following the incident, the mall had a temporary policy requiring visitors between ages 10 and 17 to be accompanied by someone at least 21 years old after 4 pm on Fridays and Saturdays. On August 10, 2017, it was announced that the mall's food court will be getting a major renovation which will include new floor tiles and furniture, removal of the railing and elevated platform seating, new furnishings, upgrades to a nearby restroom, downsizing Forever 21, to 30,000 square feet only on part of the first floor which was announced on June 6, a Dave & Buster's on the second floor of the Forever 21 building also announced on June 6 which is scheduled to open in 2018, and an Ulta Beauty on the remainder of the first floor of the Forever 21 building. The mall may even get a partial upper level with stairs, elevators, and escalators. The renovations will be complete by November 6.

Hall, and by Devon Graye, Dominic Janes, and Maxwell Huckabee as a youth. In both the novels and the TV series, Dexter is a forensic blood spatter analyst who works for the fictitious Miami-Metro Police Department. In his spare time, he is a vigilante serial killer who targets other murderers who have evaded the justice system. He follows a code of ethics taught to him in childhood by his adoptive father, Harry, which he refers to as \\"The Code\\" or \\"The Code of Harry\\" and hinges on two principles: Dexter can only kill people after finding conclusive evidence that they are guilty of murder, and he must not get caught. Dexter's novel appearances include Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), Dearly Devoted Dexter (2005), Dexter in the Dark (2007), Dexter by Design (2009), Dexter Is Delicious (2010), Double Dexter (2011), Dexter's Final Cut (2013), and Dexter Is Dead (2015). The eighth and final novel in the series written by Lindsay was titled Dexter Is Dead, and released in July 2015, signifying the ending of the character. In 2006, the first novel was adapted into the Showtime TV series Dexter and its companion web series Dexter: Early Cuts. Season one is largely based on the first novel, Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), but the following seasons veered away from the rest of the book series. For his performance as Dexter, Michael C. Hall has received critical acclaim. In 2009, he was awarded a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series or Drama. Paste ranked Dexter Morgan number 6 on their list of the 20 Best Characters of 2011 In addition, Hall was awarded with a Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Drama in 2007, and was nominated five times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.  Characterization   Psychological profile  Since childhood, Dexter Morgan has felt homicidal urges directed by an inner voice he calls \\"the Dark Passenger\\"; when that voice cannot be ignored, he \\"lets the Dark Passenger do the driving\\". He abides by a moral code taught to him by his adoptive father, Harry, in which he only allows himself to kill people who are themselves murderers. Dexter considers himself emotionally divorced from the rest of humanity; in his narration, he refers to \\"humans\\" as if he is not one himself. He makes frequent references to an internal feeling of emptiness and says he kills to feel alive. He claims to have no feelings or conscience, and that all of his emotional responses are part of a well-rehearsed act to conceal his true nature. He has no interest in romance or sex; he considers his relationship with his girlfriend (and eventual wife) Rita Bennett to be part of his \\"disguise\\". Dexter likes children, finding them much more interesting than adults; accordingly, he treats victims who prey on children with particular wrath. His connection to Rita's children, Astor, and Cody, sometimes supersedes his relationship with Rita herself. For example, in the novels, Dexter continues his relationship with Rita because he realizes that Rita's children are exhibiting the same sociopathic tendencies he did at their age, and he tries to control their violent urges by providing them with \\"guidance\\" similar to that which Harry provided him. In the show, Dexter deviates from his code of only killing murderers to dispose of a pedophile who is stalking Astor. Animals do not like Dexter, which can cause noise problems when he stalks a victim who has pets. The novels reveal that he once owned a dog that barked and growled at him until he was forced to get rid of it and a turtle that hid from him in its shell until it died of starvation. Dexter occasionally behaves in a way that suggests that he does feel some rudimentary human connection. He acknowledges loyalty to family, particularly to his late adoptive father, saying: \\"If I were capable of love, how I would have loved Harry.\\" Since Harry's death, Dexter's only family is his sister Debra, Harry and Doris' biological daughter. Dexter admits that he cannot hurt Debra or allow anyone else to harm her because he is \\"fond of her\\". In the first episode of season one, he says: \\"I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb\\". In the first season, Dexter's relationship with Rita sets in motion his slow but steady introduction to human feelings, progressing further each season. During the episode \\"Shrink Wrap\\", when his current target is a psychologist, Dexter infiltrates the doctor's office by posing as a patient, and the doctor astutely speculates that part of Dexter's problem in admitting to his feelings is his need for control. In the second-season finale, \\"The British Invasion\\", Dexter finally admits that he needs the people in his life. In season three, when he is threatened by a target, Dexter fights to live because he wants to see his unborn child. In season four, before killing a police officer who has murdered her own husband and daughter, Dexter is overwhelmed with the realization that he does not want to lose his new family. He is also horrified when he finds out that one of his potential victims is an abusive husband and father; Dexter vehemently insists he is nothing like that and would never hurt his family. In season five, after Rita is murdered, Dexter realizes that he genuinely loved her and is devastated by losing her.  Modus operandi  In both the books and the show, Dexter selects his victims according to his adoptive father's code and kills them only after he has discovered enough evidence to prove their guilt. For each victim, he ritually prepares a kill site that has some symbolic relevance to the killer (e.g., killing a boxer in a boxing ring or a gambler in a casino's storage shed). He completely drapes the site in clear plastic tarpaulin to catch all spilled blood, and often adorns it with evidence or photos of his victim's crimes. The actual capture of his victims differs between the books and the show. On the show, it usually entails approaching the victims from behind and injecting an anesthetic (specified to be an animal tranquilizer called etorphine hydrochloride, or M99), which renders his victims temporarily unconscious. The injection is a tradition established with his first victim, the hospital nurse. He uses the alias Patrick Bateman (the serial killer protagonist of Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho) to procure these tranquilizers. Other times, Dexter incapacitates his target by using either his hands or a garrote to cut off blood flow to the brain. In the books (and twice in the television program), he hides in the back seat of his victim's vehicle, then wraps a noose of fishing line around his victim's throat when he sits down. Dexter then uses the threat of asphyxiation to force his victim to drive them to his prepared kill site. Once they have arrived, he either strangles them into unconsciousness or uses the noose to drag them to the kill site proper. In such cases, he anesthetizes them once he has informed them of his judgment. When victims awaken, they are naked and secured to a table with plastic wrap, and for stronger victims, duct tape. If he has not already done so, he confronts them with narrative evidence of their crimes. In the novels, the method usually involves an extended \\"exploration\\" with various sharp knives; on the show, Dexter's favored method usually involves an immediately fatal wound to the chest, neck, or gut with a variety of weapons. He occasionally varies his methods to fit particular victims; he kills his brother (and fellow serial killer) Brian by cutting his throat with a dinner knife (with the manner of the death and Dexter's own hesitation at inflicting the wound causing pathologists to conclude that Brian killed himself); he stabs gang lord Little Chino in the chest with a machete. He kills Santos Jimenez‚Äîthe man who murdered his mother‚Äîin the same manner in which his mother was killed, by dismembering him with a chainsaw. On other occasions, he uses hammers, drills, and other power tools. Just before the murder, Dexter collects trophies from his victims so he can relive the experience. Dexter's trophy signature is to slice the victim's right cheek with a surgical scalpel to collect a small blood sample, which he preserves on a microscope slide. In the TV show, Dexter keeps blood slides from all his victims neatly organized in a wooden filing box, which he hides inside his air conditioner. In the novels, he keeps them in a rosewood box on his bookcase. Ultimately, he dismembers the bodies into several pieces, stows them and the plastic sheeting in black, heavy duty, biodegradable garbage bags, then adds rocks from the dock where he keeps his boat as anchor weight, and seals the bags with duct tape. He then takes the wrapped bags out on his boat and disposes of them by dumping them overboard into the ocean at a defined location; in the TV series, his dumping ground is a small oceanic trench just offshore. In one episode, the dump site and remains are inadvertently discovered by scuba divers, so he changes tactics, cutting the bodies into smaller pieces and dumping them further offshore, where they will be dispersed by the Gulf Stream. The books give less detail about disposal, with Dexter usually improvising depending on the victim. He has dumped some victims into the ocean due to the victim's owning a boat and doing the same with their own victims, but uses anchors to weight the bags. He disposes of another body in a vat of hydrochloric acid.  General biography  Dexter was born on February 15, 1971 (though according to Dr. Evelyn Vogel's journal in S8 E4, Dexter's date of birth was notated as ‚Äú2/1/71‚Äù). At the story's outset, Dexter knows very little about his life prior to being adopted by Harry Morgan (a Miami detective) and his wife Doris. Harry only tells Dexter that his parents were killed in a car accident, and Harry brought him home from the crime scene. When Dexter is seven, Harry discovers that the boy has been killing neighborhood pets and realizes that Dexter is a sociopath with a deep need to kill. Consequently, Harry decides to channel the boy's homicidal urges in a \\"positive\\" direction by teaching him to be a careful, meticulous killer of people who \\"deserve it\\"‚Äîmurderers who have escaped justice. Doris died when Dexter was 16, and Harry died when Dexter was 20. In the second season, Dexter's nemesis, Sergeant James Doakes, discovers that Dexter forsook a career in medicine to pursue blood spatter analysis, despite being top of his class at medical school. He also notes that Dexter studied advanced Jiu-Jitsu in college. Both the television show and the first novel gradually reveal Dexter's complete back story. Dexter was born out of wedlock in 1971 to a young woman named Laura (Laura Moser on the show). In the novels, Laura was involved in the drug trade. On the show, Laura was a police informant for Harry Morgan and his secret mistress. Dexter's father (named Joseph Driscoll on the show) was in the US Army and served in the Vietnam War, but later became a drug-addicted criminal. Dexter also had an older brother, named Brian. On October 1, 1973, Dexter and Brian witnessed their mother's brutal murder at the hands of three drug dealers. For two days, the brothers were left in a crate, surrounded by dismembered body parts and sitting in a pool of blood. Harry adopted the three-year-old Dexter, while Brian was left to the child welfare system. Dexter only remembers his mother's murder later in life, when he is called to an extremely bloody crime scene left by his brother‚Äîwho has also grown up to be a serial killer. In the novel, Brian escapes Miami, but returns in Dexter Is Delicious. On the show, however, Dexter catches and (reluctantly) kills Brian, aware that Brian would never stop trying to kill Debra or other innocent people.  Character development in the book series   Darkly Dreaming Dexter  Doris Morgan, Dexter's adoptive mother, dies of cancer when he is 16. When Dexter reaches puberty, he realizes that he is uninterested in sex and needs instruction by his father on how to behave with women. Around this time, Harry discovers that Dexter has been killing neighborhood pets and realizes that the boy has an innate need to kill. Harry decides to channel Dexter's urges in a \\"positive\\" direction by teaching him to kill people who \\"deserve it\\", and to get rid of any evidence so he does not get caught. When Dexter is 18, Harry is diagnosed with cancer and hospitalized. There, Harry gives Dexter his \\"permission\\" to kill his first human victim, a nurse who is murdering her patients with overdoses of morphine. Throughout the novel, Dexter is involved in the investigation of the \\"Tamiami Butcher\\", a serial killer who dismembers his victims and puts the body parts in refrigerated trucks. The killer begins leaving taunting clues for Dexter to draw him in personally. The killer kidnaps Deborah and meets with Dexter in a storage container, and reveals their true connection: he is Brian, Dexter's biological brother. Brian tells Dexter that as children, they witnessed their mother's brutal murder at the hands of drug dealers, and were locked in a crate for two days, surrounded by dead bodies. Dexter persuades Brian to spare Deborah, and instead the two of them kill Lieutenant Migdia LaGuerta (this does not occur in the TV series, in which LaGuerta -- whose first name is changed to \\"Maria\\" -- is a recurring character until her death at the end of the seventh season). At the end of the novel, Deborah learns of Dexter's secret life after he saves her from Brian. She appears to accept it, but in subsequent books feels torn between her duties as a police officer and her loyalty to Dexter, whom she loves as her real brother.  Dearly Devoted Dexter  Dexter's nemesis, Sergeant Doakes, suspects Dexter of being involved in LaGuerta's murder, and starts following him around. Doakes and Dexter are soon forced to work together to stop \\"Dr. Danco\\", a psychopathic surgeon who removes his victims' limbs and sensory organs, leaving them in a state of living death. Doakes' pursuit forces Dexter to spend more time with Rita and her children. While attempting to bond with Astor and Cody, he realizes that they both have \\"Dark Passengers\\" of their own, and he resolves to provide them with the same \\"guidance\\" that Harry had given him. After finding FBI agent Kyle Chutsky's ring in Dexter's pocket, Rita believes Dexter is about to propose to her, and happily accepts before Dexter can explain. At the climax of the book, Danco kidnaps Dexter and Doakes, mutilating the latter by removing his hands, feet, and tongue. Just as Danco is about to turn his attentions to Dexter, however, Deborah bursts in and kills him, saving Dexter's life.  Dexter in the Dark  In Dexter in the Dark, the third novel of the series, third-person narrative reveals through an entity referred to as \\"IT\\" that the Dark Passenger is an independent agent inhabiting Dexter, rather than a deviant psychological construction. Later, Dexter realizes the Dark Passenger is related to Moloch, a Middle Eastern deity worshiped in Biblical times. The Dark Passenger is one of Moloch's many offspring; Moloch had many children (formed through human sacrifice), and learned to share its knowledge with them. Eventually, there were too many, and Moloch killed the majority; however, some of them escaped into the world. In the novel, Dexter learns of the Dark Passenger's true nature when it briefly \\"leaves\\" him, frightening him into researching possible reasons for its existence. By now, Dexter has embraced his role as stepfather to both children, but is annoyed when thoughts of them ‚Äì wondering if Cody had brushed his teeth before bed and if Astor had set out her Easter dress for picture day at her school ‚Äì distract him from hunting an intended victim. By the end of the book, he has begun training Astor and Cody to be careful, efficient killers, with great success: when the novel's antagonist, a Moloch-worshipping cult leader, kidnaps the three of them, Cody saves Dexter's life by killing one of his henchmen. The novel ends with the Dark Passenger returning to Dexter on his wedding day.  Dexter by Design  Dexter by Design opens in Paris, with Dexter and Rita on their honeymoon. There, while visiting an art gallery, Dexter and Rita see an avant-garde performance piece called \\"Jennifer's Leg\\" in which the artist amputates her own limb. When they return to Miami, Dexter crosses paths with a suspicious homicide detective and a serial killer who preys on tourists. In the novel's closing paragraphs, Dexter learns that Rita is pregnant with his child. Dexter is Delicious In Dexter is Delicious, Dexter grapples with raising his infant daughter, Lily-Anne, and wonders if she can help restore his humanity. Brian reappears in Dexter's life, situating himself with Dexter's family. The main event for the Miami Police Department is related to the appearance of cooked, partially eaten bodies and the disappearance of a teenaged girl, Samantha. Dexter has sex with Samantha while under the influence of ecstasy, and tries to prevent Rita from finding out while helping Deborah solve the murders. The novel reintroduces Dexter's brother, Brian, who shows up unexpectedly at Dexter's doorstep and inserts himself into his brother's new family. Dexter is reluctant at first to let Brian back into his life, but changes his mind when he sees him bond with Astor and Cody over their shared bloodlust. Double Dexter In Double Dexter, Dexter is seen by an anonymous Shadow while killing a victim in a secluded house. He continues on with his life until he starts receiving threatening emails from the person who claims to have seen him over a pile of dead body parts. Instead of turning him in, the Shadow, as he is referred to, takes it upon himself to take Dexter down. While Dexter tries to find and dispose of this Shadow, he quickly finds out that this person is much more capable than he initially suspected. Dexter is eventually framed for a murder, at least circumstantially, by his still anonymous Shadow. While on suspension from the police force for being a 'person of interest' in a murder investigation, Dexter finally finds out who his Shadow is: Doug Crowley. When he goes to dispatch Crowley, he finds he is once again being tailed by Doakes. Realizing that no way exists to take down Crowley with Doakes on his tail, he enlists the help of his brother, Brian, and finally thinks that his problems have been taken care of. While Brian is dispatching Doug Crowley, Dexter goes down to Key West with his family. Despite learning from his brother that a Doug Crowley had been taken care of, he finds the body of Detective Hood, the lead detective investigating him for murder, in his hotel suite, with the only explanation being that Brian killed the wrong Doug Crowley. While Dexter is preoccupied with the Key West police, Crowley finally attacks Dexter by abducting his step children, Cody and Astor. Dexter hunts down Crowley to a small island off the coast of Key West. He finally gets the drop on him, and Crowley escapes with Astor on a speedboat. Dexter manages to sneak aboard and overpower Crowley, with some assistance from Astor. They shove Crowley overboard, where he is eaten by a hammerhead shark. With Crowley dispatched, Dexter can finally focus on clearing his name in the murder investigation. He plants evidence in Hood's apartment, thoroughly discrediting him, while Doakes is now under review for excessive force and intimidating a witness. These developments leave Dexter in the clear. Dexter's Final Cut In Dexter's Final Cut, a famous celebrity becomes obsessed with Dexter Morgan after researching him for his new role. When the Big Ticket Network comes to Miami, Deborah and Dexter are assigned as \\"technical advisors\\" to the stars of the show. Deborah is shadowed by female lead Jackie Forrest and Dexter is left with over-the-hill star Robert Chase. Sensing a strangeness in him, Dexter keeps Robert at arm's length. When a series of murders leads Miami Metro's Detective Anderson through a loop, Dexter is assigned to guard Jackie. Deborah and Dexter quickly realize that the string of bodies all bear a striking resemblance to Jackie. Dexter is assigned to protect her in her hotel room. At first, things seem perfectly routine; Dexter accompanies Jackie to the station each morning and returns with her to the hotel at night, but when the killer's identity is revealed to him, Dexter's \\"Dark Passenger\\" leads him out into the streets in pursuit. While working a crime scene where police have found another body matching the pattern of Jackie's obsessed fan, Dexter notices a man fitting the description in a kayak out in the bay watching the scene. Stealing away to his boat, Dexter slips alongside the man and kills him. After a hard day's work, they return to the hotel only to be disturbed in the night by sirens; Jackie's assistant Kathy has been murdered in the room below. The murder seems to fit the pattern, but Dexter notices several errors. That night, Dexter and Jackie fall into bed together and start a brief but intense affair. Dexter thinks he has fallen in love with Jackie, and considers leaving Rita. Dexter is called onto the set to appear as a minor character in the series following a conversation with Jackie and Robert. Suddenly, Dexter gets a panicked phone call from Rita: Astor has disappeared. Fearing the worst, Dexter goes in search of Robert, who had shown a suspicious interest in Astor. He questions the show's director, who confirms that Robert is a pedophile. Moments later, he finds Jackie's dead body in her trailer. Dexter then pieces it together: Robert killed Kathy after she caught him in a compromising position with Astor, and then killed Jackie when she found out what he had done. Dexter follows a hunch and heads to Rita and his new house. Robert catches him sneaking in and knocks him unconscious. Waking some time later, Dexter finds Astor and Robert together in the house. Robert has lured Astor with promises of stardom, and she appears ready to help him to kill Dexter. Thinking quickly, Dexter tells Astor that Robert will be arrested and sent to prison, and is thus useless to her. When Robert tries to take Astor as a hostage, she stabs him to death. Dexter realizes that circumstantial evidence implicates him as the murderer of Robert and Jackie, and that the only person who can exonerate him is Rita. When Dexter searches the house, however, he finds that Rita is dead, murdered by Robert. Dexter sees that his luck has finally run out, and waits for the police to arrive. Dexter is Dead In the final book of the series' Dexter is Dead; Dexter is in jail after being charged with Robert's crimes - thanks to the corrupt Detective Anderson, who has falsified evidence and reports to make it seem that Dexter is guilty. Only Masuoka tries to clear Dexter's good name, but he gets swatted down by everyone from the beat cops to the state attorney. Deborah, meanwhile, disowns Dexter for cheating on Rita and putting Astor in danger, and decides to take custody of his children. Dexter's brother Brian bails him out of prison and gets him the best lawyer in town, but the lawyer happens to be in the pocket of a very powerful Mexican drug cartel led by a man named Raul, who is after Brian. The cartel tries to kill Dexter several times to get to Brian. Eventually, Dexter and Brian find out their lawyer sold them out to the cartel, so they kill him and all the cartel's members, save for one, whom they torture to find out where Raul is holding Cody and Astor. Brian, Deborah, and Dexter team up, storm Raul's yacht, and take the kids back. Deborah and the kids get away, but Brian is killed by a bomb and Raul shoots Dexter in the shoulder. Dexter kills Raul and sets a bomb so no evidence is left, then jumps off the boat into the water and sinks into the ocean. The book leaves it open to interpretation whether he survives.  Dexter in the television show   Season one  By the start of season one, Dexter is a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department; in his \\"secret life\\", he is a serial killer who preys on people who are themselves murderers. In his private life, Dexter maintains superficial relationships - with his sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), his girlfriend Rita (Julie Benz), and Rita's children, Astor (Christina Robinson) and Cody (Daniel Goldman in season one, Preston Bailey in subsequent seasons) to appear normal. Dexter has internal conversations with his late foster father, Harry Morgan (James Remar), who gives him advice about killing and navigating his personal life. Rita's previous, abusive marriage leaves her afraid to have sex, which suits the asexual Dexter perfectly. When she overcomes her demons and becomes more amorous, however, Dexter considers ending the relationship, fearing that she will see him as he really is if they become a real couple. However, during a therapy session with one of his intended victims, psychologist Emmett Meridian (Tony Goldwyn), Dexter is put into a state of deep relaxation, wherein he sees a frightening image of a small boy sitting in a pool of blood. In a heightened emotional state, he runs to Rita's house for comfort, and they have sex. Meanwhile, a serial killer of prostitutes appears in Miami, and Dexter notices that the killer is leaving hidden clues at the scene that have personal significance to Dexter. One day, Dexter receives official notification that a man named Joseph Driscoll is his biological father, and that, since Dexter is the only next of kin, he must come settle the estate and claim the body. Debra's new boyfriend, Rudy Cooper (Christian Camargo), insists that they accompany Dexter and Rita to clean out the house. Dexter doubts that Driscoll is his father, but while cleaning, discovers a thank-you card that he sent his blood donor as a child, as Dexter has a rare blood type (AB-). As Harry had convinced Driscoll to donate the blood anonymously, Dexter had no idea from where it had come. Dexter suspects his father's death was foul play, but the body is cremated before Dexter can obtain proof. The show reveals to the viewer that Rudy murdered Driscoll with an injection of insulin designed to mimic a heart attack. Dexter's rivalry with Rita's recently paroled ex-husband Paul (Mark Pellegrino) turns violent; Paul tries to fight Dexter, who knocks him unconscious. To cover his tracks, Dexter injects Paul with heroin and leaves him to be found. Paul fails a drug test (thus breaking his probation) and returns to jail. Dexter is called to analyze a hotel room flooded with the blood of multiple persons. The sight triggers a panic attack and calls up several memories of himself as a child sitting in blood. His research leads him to discover he witnessed his mother's murder as a child, and he had a brother named Brian. Eventually, the Ice Truck Killer (who turns out to be none other than Rudy) kidnaps Debra after proposing to her, then drugs her and takes her to Dexter's childhood home. When Dexter goes to rescue Debra, he finally recognizes Rudy as his long-lost brother, Brian Moser. Brian proposes that they begin to murder together, and leads Dexter to a bound and drugged Debra, suggests that she be their first kill. After wrestling with internal conflicts from his attachment to his biological brother and need to protect his adoptive sister, Dexter ultimately decides that his loyalty lies with Debra. Later on, Brian begins to hunt down Debra himself, but Dexter apprehends Brian and then ties him down to an operating table in Brian's apartment. Dexter tearfully slits Brian's throat, staging the crime scene to make it look like Brian committed suicide. Eventually, the police find the body and close the case. The season ends with Dexter wondering what it would be like if everyone knew his secrets and imagining being celebrated outside the police station by an adoring crowd.  Season two  In season two, Dexter is so haunted by killing his own brother that he cannot resume killing. To make matters worse, Debra, traumatized by her ordeal with the Ice Truck Killer, moves in with Dexter, which hinders his secret life. Dexter's nemesis, Sergeant James Doakes (Erik King), harbors lingering suspicions about Dexter's possible connection with the Ice Truck Killer, and he begins to tail Dexter everywhere. To throw him off, Dexter reluctantly refrains from killing for a month. Just as Dexter finds a chance to kill again, over 30 bodies (Dexter's victims) are found in a Miami harbor, provoking a massive search for the so-called \\"Bay Harbor Butcher\\". Rita soon figures out that Dexter has been lying to her and concludes that Dexter is a heroin addict, with which he goes along to hide his real secret. Rita forces him to attend Narcotics Anonymous meetings, where he meets Lila Tournay (Jaime Murray), who becomes his sponsor. Lila convinces him to explore his past, and while under extreme duress after confronting and killing his mother's murderer, his relationship with Lila becomes sexual. Dexter confesses to Rita, who dumps him. Lila becomes obsessed with Dexter, believing he is her soulmate. Eventually, however, Dexter's desire to be with Astor and Cody compels him to ask for Rita's forgiveness; she grants it, and they get back together. Dexter learns that Lila is in fact a sociopath who attends NA meetings to vicariously experience emotions she is incapable of feeling, and tells her to leave him alone. Lila retaliates by framing Dexter's colleague and friend Angel Batista (David Zayas) for rape, though he is eventually cleared. Doakes' suspicions subside some when he realizes that Dexter is attending Narcotics Anonymous, but he begins to suspect this is a cover for an even worse secret. As Doakes gets closer to discovering the truth, Dexter provokes him into a physical altercation at work, resulting in Doakes' suspension. In \\"The British Invasion\\", Doakes finally catches Dexter in the act of disposing of a dismembered body in the Florida Everglades. Dexter is forced to take Doakes captive and sets about framing him. Lila discovers the cabin in the Everglades where Dexter is holding Doakes and blows it up (with Doakes inside), to protect Dexter. The police eventually find Doakes' charred body, surrounded by Dexter's murderous paraphernalia, and conclude that Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher, much to Dexter's relief. Dexter pretends to want to run away with Lila, but she soon discovers that he intends to kill her. Lila kidnaps Astor and Cody, and when Dexter finds them at her house, she sets it on fire and leaves the three of them locked inside. Dexter manages to save the children and escape unhurt. Weeks later, he follows Lila to Paris, where he thanks her for showing him his \\"true self\\" before killing her.  Season three  In season three, Dexter finds his life manageable until he discovers that Rita is pregnant. Rita and he tacitly consider terminating the pregnancy, until Rita announces she will keep the baby regardless of whether or not Dexter wants to be a father to the child. Dexter, afraid of what kind of father he would be, considers leaving Rita to parent alone, until Debra convinces him that he would be a great father. After a few failed marriage proposals, Dexter proposes again by mimicking a declaration of love from a criminal. Rita finally accepts, with her children's blessing. Meanwhile, after killing an unknown man in self-defense while attempting to murder a homicidal drug dealer named Freebo, Dexter forms an unlikely friendship with the man's brother, Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits), a popular assistant district attorney. While hunting down Freebo at night, Prado stumbles upon Dexter, bloody from murdering Freebo; Dexter claims he killed Freebo in self-defense. Prado offers Dexter Freebo's bloody shirt as proof that he will not reveal Dexter's secret. The two men grow closer, and Dexter even makes Prado his best man. Prado gradually discerns that Dexter is a serial killer, and they begin to murder together according to Dexter's \\"code\\". When Prado deviates from the code to murder a rival defense attorney, it sets off a game of competing leverage and blackmail between the two men. Dexter discovers the blood on the shirt is actually bovine, meaning that Prado was just using him as an excuse to kill. Angry and hurt, Dexter decides to kill Prado. After being tipped off by Prado, a serial killer called \\"the Skinner\\" (Jesse Borrego), who is searching for Freebo, kidnaps Dexter on Dexter's wedding day. Facing certain death, Dexter resolves to keep fighting so he can live to see his son; he frees himself and kills the Skinner by snapping his neck and throwing his body into an arriving police car. Dexter then kills Prado and marries Rita, with Debra as his \\"best man\\". During the course of the season, Dexter justifies killing two people who do not fit his code: Nathan Marten (Jason Kaufman), a pedophile who is stalking Astor; and his old friend Camilla Figg (Margo Martindale), who is dying of cancer and asks him to end her suffering.  Season four  At outset of season four, Rita has given birth to a baby boy, Harrison. Dexter is happy to have a child of his own, but his responsibilities as a new father leave him too exhausted to kill. Dexter finds it increasingly difficult to keep concealing his secret life, which leads to conflict with Rita and Astor, who has entered adolescence. At Rita's urging, Dexter and she enter couple's therapy. After his first kill of the new season, Dexter falls asleep while driving and has an accident, and the resultant short-term memory loss causes him to forget where his victim's body is. He eventually retraces his steps and disposes of the body. After retired Special Agent Frank Lundy (Keith Carradine) is murdered, Dexter begins his pursuit of the so-called \\"Trinity Killer\\", who has been committing ritualistic murders across the country for 30 years. Once Dexter finds the killer, however, he is shocked to discover that \\"Trinity\\" is actually Arthur Mitchell (John Lithgow), a family man and pillar of his community. Dexter assumes the alias Kyle Butler and begins to insinuate himself into Mitchell's personal life in an effort to learn how Mitchell balances his family responsibilities with his secret life as a serial killer. To that end, Dexter repeatedly puts off murdering Mitchell, thwarts police efforts to apprehend him, and even saves Mitchell's life when he attempts suicide. Upon getting to know Mitchell, however, Dexter realizes that he misjudged him; after spending Thanksgiving with the Mitchell family, Dexter learns that his would-be mentor is an abusive tyrant whose family is terrified of him. After getting into a violent altercation with Mitchell, Dexter insists that they are nothing alike and thinks he may be able to silence his Dark Passenger permanently. When he returns home, Dexter makes arrangements for Rita and him to take a belated honeymoon. He sends Rita ahead and entraps Mitchell as Mitchell tries to skip town. Before Dexter kills him with a hammer, Mitchell tells him that Dexter will not be able to control his violent urges for long, and \\"it's already over\\" -- the same thing Mitchell tells his victims just before killing them. After returning home, Dexter calls Rita's phone to find out if her and Harrison made it alright. He immediately hears Rita's phone start to ring, indicating that she is in the house. Harrison then starts crying and Dexter is devastated to find Rita lying dead in the bathtub, with Harrison on the floor in a pool of his mother's blood; she was Trinity's final victim.  Season five  The season opens with a shocked, guilt- ridden Dexter clutching Harrison as the police respond to his call, in which Dexter says \\"It was me\\". While he means that he killed her by letting Trinity know his identity, the police interpret this as an admission of direct guilt. The FBI, however, soon clear Dexter, as he was with the police at Arthur Mitchell's house at the time Rita was murdered. Dexter spends the next day completely numb, unable to even fake any sort of emotion or grief. As Dexter plans to disconnect and restart, he finds himself confronted by Rankin (Brad Carter), a brash, foul-mouthed hillbilly. When Rankin insults Rita, Dexter kills him in a fit of rage. Harry tells Dexter that this act is the first human thing he has seen Dexter do since Rita's death. Distraught over Rita's death, Astor and Cody leave to go live with their grandparents. A struggling Dexter attempts to move on by hiring an Irish nanny to look after Harrison while he goes out to find his next kill. He settles on Boyd Fowler (Shawn Hatosy), a convicted rapist whose connection to a string of missing women makes him the perfect target. Dexter kills Fowler, only to find Fowler's latest victim, a young woman named Lumen Pierce (Julia Stiles), who is still alive. After debating whether or not to kill her (and thus eliminate a potential witness), Dexter gives in to his better nature and decides to protect her. Lumen is slow to trust Dexter, but comes to realize he means her no harm. She reveals that Fowler was not the only man who raped her. As Lumen gradually becomes integrated into Dexter's life, she begs him to help her to go after her attackers; Dexter reluctantly agrees. They stalk a children's dentist and the head of security for a high-profile motivational speaker named Jordan Chase (Jonny Lee Miller). As the plot thickens, it becomes clear that Chase was also one of Lumen's attackers. Complicating the situation further is Detective Joey Quinn (Desmond Harrington), who believes that Dexter killed Rita and is getting too close to finding out Dexter's secrets. To keep the police occupied, Dexter puts them on Fowler's trail. Dexter becomes personally acquainted with Chase and stumbles onto a photo that proves that all of Lumen's attackers (who are also guilty of torturing, raping, and murdering 12 other women) have known each other since childhood. Dexter eventually finds a vial of blood that Chase wears around his neck. After extracting a sample, he discovers that the blood belongs to Emily Birch (Angela Bettis), the rape club's first victim. She provides Lumen and Dexter with the identity of the mysterious fourth attacker in the photo, Alex Tilden (Scott Grimes). Dexter allows Lumen to kill Tilden by stabbing him in the heart. Dexter and Lumen then become lovers, before continuing their hunt for Chase. As Lumen and Dexter plan to capture Chase, Dexter realizes cameras are in his apartment. Dexter, assuming he is being watched by Quinn, waits for him to return to the surveillance van. As Dexter opens the door to capture Quinn, Stan Liddy (Peter Weller), a private investigator Quinn had hired to tail Dexter, stuns Dexter with a taser. After Liddy calls Quinn to bust Dexter, Dexter attacks Liddy and kills him in self-defense, after Liddy tries to stab him. While Dexter deals with Liddy, Lumen gets a call from Emily. Emily appears frightened of Chase and threatens to call the police, but she is revealed to be setting a trap to allow Chase to capture them. Dexter returns to the apartment to find Lumen gone. He tracks Chase to the camp where the rape club had started. In a fit of emotion, he accidentally wrecks the stolen car he is driving, allowing Chase to take him prisoner. Chase brings Dexter to the building in which he is holding Lumen. As Chase is about to kill them, Dexter frees himself with a knife he had stashed and immobilizes Chase by stabbing him through his foot and into the floor. Dexter cuts Lumen free and knocks Chase out. When Chase wakes up, Dexter allows Lumen to kill him. While they are still in the kill room, preparing to move the body, Debra arrives on the scene, though her view of Dexter and Lumen is obstructed by a sheet of plastic. Dexter and Lumen, trapped, remain silent. Without requesting their identity, Debra warns them that she is about to call in backup and allows them to flee before the police arrive. The next day, when Dexter returns from work, Lumen tells him that she no longer feels the need to kill, and they cannot be together because Dexter's homicidal urges will never leave him. She then leaves to return to the life she had before her kidnapping. The season ends with Dexter surrounded by friends and family at Harrison's first birthday party. Season six About a year later, Harrison is old enough to walk, and Dexter has begun searching for a preschool, though his atheism conflicts with the largely religious preschools to which he applies. He finds a greater understanding through Brother Sam (Mos Def, credited as Mos and later as yasiin bey), an ex-con and murderer whom Dexter once considered killing, who has since become a born- again Christian who counsels other ex-cons. Dexter initially sees Brother Sam's religious conversion as a scam, but Brother Sam proves himself a truly changed man, and even helps Dexter through a crisis when Harrison undergoes an appendectomy. However, things go awry when Brother Sam is shot and mortally wounded in his garage. Dexter realizes that a friend of Sam's, Nick (Germaine De Leon), is responsible, and swears revenge. On his deathbed, Sam forgives Nick and implores Dexter to also forgive him. Dexter considers sparing Nick when he initially appears remorseful, but that proves to be an act; after Sam refuses to press charges on his deathbed, Nick brags about what he did. An enraged Dexter drowns Nick in the surf, reawakening in him the presence of his dead brother, Brian, who begins to guide him in much the same way that Harry's presence once had. Brian convinces Dexter to go after Arthur Mitchell's son Jonah (Brando Eaton), who appears to have also become a killer. Dexter adheres to his father's code, however, causing a schism between his personalities. Dexter finally catches Jonah with the intent of killing him, but relents when he sees that Jonah feels guilty about failing to protect his sister, who committed suicide by slitting an artery in a bathtub, similar to how her father killed his victims. When Jonah and his mother discovered Jonah's sister, their mother blamed the children for their father's shortcomings. This enraged Jonah, who then killed his mother. Learning this new information, Dexter rejects Brian and reaffirms the \\"Code of Harry\\", leaving Jonah alive to forgive himself. In the meantime, Dexter begins investigating \\"the Doomsday Killer\\", a serial killer who models his crimes after the Book of Revelation. Dexter soon finds that the murders are being committed by two people: a fanatically religious college professor named James Gellar (Edward James Olmos) and his prot√©g√©, Travis Marshall (Colin Hanks). Dexter tracks Marshall down, but balks at killing him, believing that Marshall has a conscience and is simply being led down the wrong path. Dexter then resolves to save Marshall from himself. After the death of Marshall's sister, Dexter follows him to the old church and discovers Gellar's body in a freezer, concluding that Marshall had been acting alone the whole time, with Gellar as a dissociative identity. After being forced to accept Gellar's death, Marshall begins to target Dexter, managing to capture him and enact the lake of fire. Dexter escapes, however, and is rescued by a fishing boat carrying illegal immigrants bound for Florida. Marshall kidnaps Harrison to sacrifice him as the \\"lamb of God\\" during a solar eclipse, but Dexter rescues Harrison and takes Marshall to the old church. Debra walks into the church‚Äîseeking to find Dexter after a recent meeting with a therapist helped her realize that she was in love with her adoptive brother‚Äîonly to see Dexter kill Marshall. Season seven In the season-seven opener, Dexter tells a bewildered Debra that he killed Marshall on impulse after Marshall ambushed him. Debra believes him at first, and helps him destroy the old church, with Marshall's body inside. A few days later, however, Debra finds Dexter's knives and collection of blood slides, and asks him point blank if he is a serial killer. Not knowing what else to say, Dexter replies that he is. Debra is horrified, but resolves to help Dexter stop killing by moving in with him and keeping a constant eye on him. After weeks under Debra's surveillance, a stressed out Dexter kidnaps Louis Greene (Josh Cooke), a former coworker with a grudge against him, with the intent of killing him. Dexter relents at the last minute, however, and calls Debra so she can talk him out of it, reassuring her that some good is in him after all. Dexter escapes Debra's watch long enough to dispose of Ray Speltzer (Matt Gerald), a brutal serial killer who had evaded prison on a technicality, and Debra comes to understand why Dexter kills. She makes a deal with him: she will not stop Dexter as long as he does not tell her about it or interfere with Miami-Metro investigations. Dexter sets his sights on killing Hannah McKay (Yvonne Strahovski), a serial poisoner, who as a teenager, had gone on a cross-country killing spree with her boyfriend. Dexter subdues her and prepares to kill her, but stops when Hannah does not appear to fear him. They are both suddenly overcome with attraction and have sex. Dexter falls in love with Hannah, who helps him realize that his \\"Dark Passenger\\" does not control his life. Dexter's romance with Hannah complicates his relationship with Debra, however. Debra is intent on arresting Hannah for the murder of Sal Price, a crime writer for whom Debra had feelings, and Dexter has trouble reconciling his feelings for his girlfriend with his responsibility to his adoptive sister. To make matters worse, Miami-Metro Captain Maria LaGuerta (Lauren Velez) reopens the Bay Harbor Butcher case, convinced that Doakes was innocent and that Dexter is hiding something. When Dexter tries to kill Hector Estrada (Nestor Serrano), the man who ordered Dexter's mother's murder, LaGuerta arrives at the scene, forcing him to let Estrada go so he can escape. Dexter deduces that LaGuerta had orchestrated Estrada's release from prison to set Dexter up. At the beginning of the season, mobster Isaak Sirko (Ray Stevenson) vows to kill Dexter to avenge his lover, Viktor Baskov (Enver Gjokaj), a cop killer and one of Dexter's victims. Fearing for his family's safety, Dexter engineers Sirko's arrest, but Sirko is soon released on bail and resumes his vendetta. Sirko asks for Dexter's protection against his former associates, who fear that he will testify against them; in return, he promises Dexter that he will let him live. Dexter refuses, but ends up inadvertently coming to Sirko's aid when one of his former henchmen attacks them both. Dexter kills the mobster, but is too late to save Sirko, who is mortally wounded during the struggle. As he dies, Sirko tells Dexter that it is not too late for Dexter to find happiness. Debra gets into a near-fatal car accident following a confrontation with Hannah, and insists to Dexter that Hannah poisoned her. Dexter refuses to believe it at first, but he is suspicious enough to order a tox screen on Debra's water bottle found on the driver's floorboard of her car after the accident. To Dexter's horror, the results prove that Hannah had spiked Debra's water with an overdose of Xanax. Left with no other choice, Dexter gives Debra proof that Hannah murdered Price and looks on, heartbroken, as Debra arrests her. LaGuerta has Dexter arrested for the Bay Harbor Butcher murders, but Dexter is released thanks to evidence with which he had tampered to throw LaGuerta off. Dexter is certain that LaGuerta will not give up, however, and resolves to kill her, though doing so would be a violation of his \\"code\\". He kidnaps and kills Estrada to lure LaGuerta in, and then knocks her unconscious, planning to shoot her to make it look like Estrada killed her. At that moment, Debra bursts in, holding Dexter at gunpoint and begging him not to go through with it. LaGuerta regains consciousness and urges Debra to kill Dexter. Seeing no way out, Dexter resigns himself to his fate and tells Debra to \\"do what you have to do\\". Much to Dexter's surprise, however, Debra turns the gun on LaGuerta, and shoots her dead. As the countdown to the new year begins, Dexter wonders if this is the \\"beginning of the end\\". Season eight The eighth season opens six months later, with Dexter growing increasingly worried about Debra, who has quit the police force and spiraled into depression and self-destructive behavior. Dexter goes to her new job as a private investigator and learns that Debra is pursuing, and sleeping with, drug dealer Andrew Briggs (Rhys Coiro). When Dexter confronts her, Debra tells him that she wishes she had killed him instead of LaGuerta. A few days later, Dexter learns that an assassin, El Sapo (Nick Gomez), is going to kill Briggs and Debra, and Dexter goes to Debra's hotel to save her. A scuffle ensues, in which Dexter kills Briggs. He begs Debra to come with him, but she refuses. Soon afterward, El Sapo is found dead, and Dexter is called in to investigate. He discovers that some of the blood at the scene belongs to Debra. She admits to killing El Sapo, and Dexter reluctantly covers up the crime. Dexter meets Dr. Evelyn Vogel (Charlotte Rampling), a neuropsychiatrist consulting with Miami Metro about a serial killer dubbed \\"the Brain Surgeon\\" who removes parts of his victims' brains. She tells Dexter that she knew Harry, with whom she came up with Dexter's \\"code\\". Vogel believes the killer is one of her former patients and asks Dexter to kill him before the killer goes after her. Quinn calls Dexter to tell him that Debra has shown up at Miami Metro, blind drunk, and confessed to killing LaGuerta. Panicked, Dexter rushes over with Vogel in tow, and knocks Debra unconscious with a low dose of the tranquilizer he uses on his victims. He realizes he cannot help Debra and asks Vogel to treat her. Dexter starts looking into another of Vogel's former patients, serial killer A.J. Yates (Aaron McCusker). He saves one of Yates' victims and confronts the killer, who escapes. The following day, Debra asks Dexter to take a drive with her so they can talk. During the drive, she intentionally crashes the car into the bay, intent on killing them both. Debra survives, however, and saves Dexter's life. When Yates kidnaps Vogel, the two of them put aside their differences to track him down. Dexter kills Yates to keep him from harming Debra, and Debra and he reconcile. Dexter sets his sights on a new victim: Zach Hamilton (Sam Underwood), a teenager from a wealthy family who murdered his father's mistress and is now preparing to kill his father. Dexter kidnaps Zach, who admits that he enjoys killing and will do it again. Seeing in Zach a kindred spirit, Dexter promises to teach him how to kill. When Dexter's neighbor Cassie Jollenston (Bethany Joy Lenz) is murdered, he at first believes Zach is responsible and decides to kill him. Dexter confronts Zach, who swears that he did not target Cassie, but another murderer, giving Dexter hope that Zach can be trained after all. That hope is dashed, however, when Dexter finds Zach's dead body in his apartment -- with a piece of his brain missing. Hannah reappears in Dexter's life when she nonlethally poisons Debra and him, to get his attention. Dexter investigates and finds that she has changed her name and married Miles Castner (Julian Sands), a wealthy businessman. Dexter goes to see Hannah, who says she had wanted him to kill Castner, but changed her mind after realizing she is still in love with Dexter. Dexter goes to Castner's boat to protect Castner, but finds that Hannah has already killed him. The two of them dispose of the body, and Dexter arranges for her to leave the country. The night before Hannah leaves, however, Dexter and she have sex, and he realizes that he is still in love with her. They renew their relationship and plan to run away together to Argentina. After investigating, Dexter discovers that Zach's killer is related to Vogel. Vogel tells Dexter that she had a son, Daniel, who as a teenager murdered his younger brother Richard before apparently dying in a fire. Dexter discovers that Daniel set the fire himself to fake his own death, and that he is now living under the identity of Cassie's boyfriend Oliver Saxon (Darri Ingolfsson). Dexter suspects that Saxon is the \\"Brain Surgeon\\" and warns Vogel, who tells him to stay out of it; Dexter is unaware that she is sheltering her son. Dexter makes preparations to move while hunting Saxon, the last \\"loose end\\". He goes to Vogel's house to make sure she is safe -- only to see Saxon slit her throat. Days later, Saxon shows up at Dexter's apartment and offers a truce: he will spare Dexter's family if Dexter will leave him alone. Dexter pretends to accept, but is now more than ever determined to kill Saxon. He finds proof of Saxon's murders, which he turns over to the police so that Saxon will be forced to come after him before he leaves Miami. Dexter then enlists Debra's help in subduing Saxon and prepares to kill him. At the last moment, however, Dexter realizes that his love for Hannah is stronger than his need to kill, and he spares Saxon's life. He calls Debra so she can arrest Saxon, and says his goodbyes to Harry and her. Saxon escapes his bindings, however, and shoots Debra in the gut when she tries to arrest him. In the series finale, \\"Remember the Monsters?\\", Dexter's flight to Argentina is delayed by a hurricane, and he tells Hannah and Harrison to go on without him, intending to take care of Saxon. When he learns what has happened to Debra, Dexter rushes to her side at the hospital, but she tells him to go on and live a good life. Moments later, she suffers a major stroke that leaves her in a persistent vegetative state. Dexter blames himself and realizes that he will always destroy those he loves; he sees at last that he can never have a happy life. After Saxon is arrested, Dexter kills him in his cell, and convinces Quinn and Batista that he acted in self- defense. Dexter goes to see Debra one last time, turns off her life support and buries her at sea. He then fakes his own death by wrecking his boat. The series' final scene reveals that he has assumed a new identity as a lumberjack and begun a new life, alone.

Calling Dexter \\"the thinking woman's killer\\", Wendy Dennis of Maclean's remarked that the show enjoys a high female audience because they are attracted to damaged men who are still sweet, handsome, and dependable. He appeared in Comcast's list of TV's Most Intriguing Characters. Paste ranked Dexter Morgan number 6 on their list of the 20 Best Characters of 2011. Michael C. Hall has received many accolades for his portrayal of Dexter Morgan. In 2007, Hall was honored with a Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Drama. In addition, he was nominated five times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012). He was nominated four times for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series ‚Äì Drama (in 2007, 2007, 2009, and 2011) and won in 2010. He was nominated five times for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series (in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012), and won in 2010. He has been nominated thrice for the Satellite Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Television Series: Drama (in 2006, 2008, and 2010) and won in 2007. He has been nominated seven times for the Saturn Award for Best Actor on Television (in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013) and won in 2006.  Connections to actual crimes   Mark Twitchell  Connections were established between Dexter Morgan and Mark Twitchell, of Edmonton, Alberta, during his first-degree murder trial. After weeks of testimony and evidence presented in court, Twitchell was found guilty of the planned and deliberate murder of 38-year-old Johnny Altinger on April 12, 2011. Twitchell, an aspiring filmmaker, had adopted the persona \\"Dexter Morgan\\" on Facebook and made a movie that was similar to how Dexter operates in the TV show. Prosecutors alleged that Twitchell had begun a double life inspired by Dexter. Twitchell wanted to re- enact the life of Dexter Morgan, and after writing a script for a Dexter movie, began posing as a woman online interested in having an affair with married men. Detective Mark Anstey of the Edmonton Police Service was quoted as saying, \\"We have a lot of information to suggest he definitely idolizes Dexter\\", and Twitchell had posted a Facebook status stating that he believed he had \\"way too much in common with Dexter Morgan\\". A nonfiction book on the case, The Devil's Cinema, detailed how Twitchell had written Facebook status updates under his Dexter Morgan account, including, \\"Dexter is patiently waiting for his next victim ... uh, play date buddy\\", but his followers did not know how true these posts really were.  Andrew Conley  Andrew Conley said the show inspired him to strangle his 10-year-old brother. In an affidavit filed in Ohio County court, police said Andrew stated that he \\"watches a show called Dexter on Showtime, about a serial killer, and he stated, 'I feel just like him.'\\". Even further, after killing his brother, he put a plastic bag over his brother's head, mimicking a practice that Dexter ritualistically commits to dispose of his victims.

It is considered one of China's Seven Military Classics. It is said there were two books on the art of war by Wu Qi, but one was lost, hence leaving the Wuzi as the only existing book carrying Wu Qi's military thoughts. The oldest Wuzi edition that survives dates to the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279). Because of the lack of surviving copies, there is no consensus among modern scholars concerning the latest date of the Wuzi's final composition, but the core of the work is nominally assumed to have been composed around Wu Qi's lifetime (440‚Äì381 BC), in the mid-Warring States period. Historical references indicate that the Wuzi was very famous and popular in both the Warring States period and in the Han dynasty. In addition to strategic/tactical studies and the philosophy of war, the Wuzi pays significant attention to the logistical achievement of war preparedness. The philosophical content of the work mainly consists of a synthesis between Confucianism and Legalism. The work attempts to resolve a humanistic (Confucian) concern for moral values and benevolent government with an administrative (Legalist) need for strict, predictable rewards and punishments. The attempted synthesis between Confucian and Legalist values is common to other military treatises dated more conclusively to the Warring States period. The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. New York: Basic Books. 2007. p. 454. Military theory The present text of the Wuzi consists of six sections, each focusing on a critical aspect of military affairs: Planning for the State; Evaluating the Enemy; Controlling the Army; the Tao of the General; Responding to Change; and, Stimulating the Officers. Although each chapter is less concentrated than the traditional topic headings would suggest, they depict the subject matter and general scope of the book as a whole. The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. New York: Basic Books. 2007. p. 202. As a young man, Wu Qi spent a formative three years as a student of Confucianism. After gaining several years of administrative experience, he came to believe that, in order for benevolence and righteousness to survive in his time, military strength and preparation were necessary. Without a strong military to defend the just, he believed that Confucian virtues would disappear, and evil would dominate the world. Because of his emphasis on the importance of the military for safeguarding civil rights and liberty, the author of the Wuzi states that commanders must be selected carefully, ideally from those possessing courage and who excelled in military arts, but who also possessed good civil administration skills, and who displayed Confucian virtues, particularly those of wisdom and self- control. The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. New York: Basic Books. 2007. pp. 202‚Äì203. Because armies in the Warring States were heavily dependent on the horse, both for transportation and for the power of the chariot, the Wuzi places a greater importance and focus on raising and maintaining a force of cavalry more than on maintaining infantry in its discussions of logistics. Because of the shift away from warfare fought among nobility, towards the mass mobilization of civilian armies, the Wuzi stresses the importance of gaining the strong support and loyalty of the common people. Because of its focus on the importance of civil administration as a necessary aid to military strength, the Wuzi stresses the implementation of Confucian policies designed to improve the material welfare of the people, gain their emotional support, and support their moral virtues. The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. New York: Basic Books. 2007. p. 203. Harmony and organization are equally important to each other: without harmony, an organization will not be cohesive; but, without organization, harmony will not be effective in achieving collective goals. There are three steps to achieving a disciplined, effective fighting force: proper organization; extensive training; and, thorough motivation. It is only after the creation of a disciplined, cohesive army that achieving victory becomes a matter of tactics and strategy. Much of the Wuzi discusses the means to achieve such a force. The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. New York: Basic Books. 2007. p. 204. Regarding the Legalist theories of achieving desired action through the proper exercise of reward and punishment, the Wuzi states that rewards and punishments are, by themselves, insufficient: excessive reward may cause individuals to pursue profit and glory at the expense of the group, while excessive punishment can lower morale, in the worst cases forcing men to flee service rather than face the consequences of failure. In addition to reward and punishment, the general should inculcate (essentially pseudo-Confucian) values into his soldiers: men fighting for what they believe is a moral cause will prefer death to living ignominiously, improving the chances of success for both the individual soldier and the army as a whole. It is only with the combination of both moral focus and effective rewards and punishments that the army will become a disciplined, spirited, strongly motivated force. The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. New York: Basic Books. 2007. p. 204. The Wuzi advises generals to adopt different tactics and strategy based on their assessment of battlefield situations. Factors affecting appropriate tactics and strategy include: the relative terrain and weather of the engagement; the national character of the combatants; the enemy commander's personal history and characteristics; and, the relative morale, discipline, fatigue, number, and general quality of both friendly and enemy forces. In gathering this information, and in preventing the enemy from gaining it, espionage and deception are paramount. The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. New York: Basic Books. 2007. pp. 204‚Äì205. Authorship Because of the lack of archaeological evidence, there is no consensus among modern scholars concerning the date that The Wuzi was composed, and/or last modified. A work known as Wuzi was one of the most widely referenced books on military strategy among the records that existed in the Warring States period. (Notable contemporary records mentioning the Wuzi are the Spring and Autumn Annals and the Han Feizi.) Sima Qian, in his Shiji, equates the popularity of the Wuzi, in both the Warring States and the Han dynasty, with that of Sun Tzu's Art of War. The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. New York: Basic Books. 2007. pp. 191‚Äì192. There is evidence that, in the Warring States, two different texts titled \\"Wuzi\\" existed, but (at least) one of them has been lost. The fact that large portions of the text seem to have been either lost or deliberately excised from surviving editions makes the dating of the work more challenging. The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. New York: Basic Books. 2007. p. 455. There is evidence both supporting the theory that much of the present text was authored in the mid-Warring States, and that it was modified after this date. The most systematic study of the Wuzi's date of composition and authorship, based on historical references and the book's content, concludes that the core of the work was likely authored by Wu Qi himself, but was likely subject to serious losses of content, revisions, and accretions after his lifetime. This theory assumes that Wu Qi's disciples initially continued amending the text, but cannot account for some content that seems to have been inserted as late as the Han dynasty (possibly in an effort to \\"update\\" the work). Wu-tzu Ch'ien-shuo. Peking: Chieh-fang-chun ch'u-pan-she. 1986. pp. 3‚Äì12. The following five points summarize this study's conclusions regarding the Wuzi's date of composition. Historical references The writings of Wu Qi were known to be in wide circulation by the late Warring States period. The assertion of the book's early popularity is based on the comment, from the Han Feizi, that \\"Within the borders everyone speaks about warfare, and everywhere households secretly store away the books of Sun and Wu.\\" The Shiji corroborates this information. The Wuzi continued to be studied both by famous Han dynasty figures, and by those in the Three Kingdoms period. The record of continuous attention supports the view that was continuously transmitted from the Warring States until at least the Three Kingdoms period. The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. New York: Basic Books. 2007. pp. 453‚Äì454. Shared passages between contemporary works The Wuzi shares both concepts and whole passages with other works dated more conclusively to the Warring States period. (The texts with which the Wuzi shares the greatest resemblance are the Wei Liaozi, Sun Bin's Art of War, and the Six Secret Teachings.) The close similarities that the Wuzi shares with other works from the Warring States period suggest that the Wuzi predates these other works, largely because Sun Bin's Art of War had been lost for two thousand years, so passages from Sun Bin's work could not have been lifted to forge the Wuzi (just prior to the Tang dynasty, as was claimed in later Chinese history.) The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. New York: Basic Books. 2007. p. 454. Perspective / occupation of writer Wu Qi was both a civil and military leader, and excelled in both occupations. This dual role was common until the early Warring States period, but disappeared in later Chinese history. The fact that the Wuzi was written from the perspective of an official with both civil and martial responsibilities supports the theory that it dates from the early Warring States. The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. New York: Basic Books. 2007. p. 454. Archaeological support Qing scholastic criticism discounted the possible authenticity of the text based on its mention of military practices then considered anachronous to the Warring States period. The list of items (then) considered anachronous includes: playing pipes in camp; the inclusion of terms not otherwise known to have been invented until after the Warring States; and, the appearance of certain astrological banners used by different units. Because recent archeological discoveries have confirmed that all of these \\"anachronous\\" practices existed by the Warring States, this Qing-era evidence for the Wuzi's forgery is not valid. The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. New York: Basic Books. 2007. p. 454. Remaining criticisms Remaining criticisms which the defenders of the Wuzi's authenticity cannot account for center on the book's description of cavalry as a major, important branch of the military. Because the use of cavalry (presumably) did not become important until the (very) late-Warring States period, the text's emphasis on cavalry implies that present editions must have been edited after Wu Qi's death (unless cavalry became important in central China much earlier than presently believed). Unless evidence is found that cavalry became important in China before c. 300 BC (the date modern scholars generally assume Cavalry became important), then either parts of the Wuzi, or the entire text, must be attributed either to the late Warring States or the early Han dynasty. Modern scholars conclude that the most satisfying conclusion, accounting for the above facts, is that the text was substantially created by \\"Wu Qi himself, but that in the course of transmission and revision, later Warring States strategists (and probably Han students)... added passages on cavalry and otherwise emended some of the terminology.\\" The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China. New York: Basic Books. 2007. pp. 454‚Äì455. By being a work which was the product of a famous historical figure, but amended by future generations of strategists, the Wuzi's composition is very similar to most of the other Seven Military Classics.

He graduated from New York University in 2005 with a B.A. in journalism. He has lectured on his writing and art at Vassar College, Kansas City Art Institute, Columbia College, UNC Chapel Hill, and other universities and museums, including the Museum of Modern Art and the New Museum. In 2012 and in 2015 he taught a graduate course at Sarah Lawrence College called \\"The Contemporary Short Story.\\" Lin lives in New York City. Lin has one brother who also lives in New York; their father is a retired physics professor Critical response Lin's writing has attracted both negative and positive attention from various publications. Gawker once referred to him as \\"maybe perhaps the single most irritating person we've ever had to deal with\\", though he was later \\"pardoned\\". After reading this criticism, Lin retaliated by completely covering the front door of the Gawker office building with stickers bearing Britney Spears's name. Later, Gawker published a piece Lin had written. L Magazine said, \\"We've long been deeply irked by Lin's vacuous posturing and 'I know you are but what am I' dorm-room philosophizing...\\" Sam Anderson, in New York Magazine, wrote, \\"Dismissing Lin, however, ignores the fact that he is deeply smart, funny, and head-over-heels dedicated in exactly the way we like our young artists to be.\\" Miranda July has praised his work as \\"moving and necessary.\\" An article in The Atlantic described Lin as having a \\"fairly staggering\\" knack for self-promotion. The same article said \\"there's something unusual about a writer being so transparent, so ready to tell you every insignificant detail of a seemingly eventful day, so aware of his next novel's word count, yet also remaining so opaque, mysterious \\"inscrutable.\\"\\"Hua Hsu. \\"Terminal Boredom: Reading Tao Lin\\" retrieved August 25, 2010 from www.atlantic.com. Lin's work has increasingly been praised in the UK, including positive reviews from The Guardian and Times Literary Supplement, who, reviewing Taipei in 2013, said Lin was \\"a daring, urgent voice for a malfunctioning age,\\" and a 2010 career overview from London Review of Books. Books you are a little bit happier than i am (2006) In November 2006 Lin's first book, a poetry collection titled you are a little bit happier than i am, was published. It was the winner of Action Books' December Prize and has been a small-press bestseller. Eeeee Eee Eeee & Bed (2007) In May 2007 Lin's first novel, Eeeee Eee Eeee, and first story collection, 'Bed', were published simultaneously. Of the stories, Jennifer Bassett, writing in KGB Lit Journal, said: \\"In structure and tone, they have the feel of early Lorrie Moore and Deborah Eisenberg. Like Moore's characters, there are a lot of plays on language and within each story, a return to the same images or ideas ‚Äî or jokes. And like Moore, most of these characters live in New York, are unemployed or recently employed, and are originally from somewhere more provincial (Florida in Lin's case, Wisconsin in Moore's). However, Lin knows to dig a little deeper into his characters‚Äîsomething we see in Moore's later stories, but less so in her early ones.\\" They were ignored by most mainstream media but have since been referenced in The Independent (who called Eeeee Eee Eeee \\"a wonderfully deadpan joke\\") and The New York Times who called Lin a \\"deadpan literary trickster\\" in reference to Eeeee Eee Eeee. cognitive-behavioral therapy (2008) In May 2008 Lin's second poetry collection, cognitive-behavioral therapy was published. The poem \\"room night\\" from this collection was anthologized in Wave Books' State of the Union. A French translation was published by Au Diable Vauvert in 2012. Shoplifting from American Apparel (2009) In September 2009 Lin's novella, Shoplifting from American Apparel, was published to mixed reviews. The Guardian said, \\"Trancelike and often hilarious‚Ä¶ Lin's writing is reminiscent of early Douglas Coupland, or early Bret Easton Ellis, but there is also something going on here that is more profoundly peculiar, even Beckettian.\\" The Village Voice called it a \\"fragile, elusive book.\\" Bookslut said, \\"it shares an affected childishness with bands like The Moldy Peaches and it has a put-on weirdness reminiscent of Miranda July's No One Belongs Here More Than You.\\" Time Out New York said, \\"Writing about being an artist makes most contemporary artists self-conscious, squeamish and arch. Lin, however, appears to be comfortable, even earnest, when his characters try to describe their aspirations (or their shortcomings) [...] purposefully raw.\\" San Francisco Chronicle said, \\"Tao Lin's sly, forlorn, deadpan humor jumps off the page [...] will delight fans of everyone from Mark Twain to Michelle Tea.\\" Los Angeles Times said, \\"Camus' The Stranger or sociopath?\\" while Austin Chronicle called it \\"scathingly funny\\" and said that \\"it might just be the future of literature.\\" Another reviewer described it as \\"a vehicle...for self-promotion.\\" In an interview aired December 2009 with Michael Silverblatt on KCRW's Bookworm Silverblatt called the novella \\"the purest example so far of the minimalist aesthetic as it used to be enunciated\\" and Lin described the novella's style as deliberately \\"concrete, with all the focus on surface details, with no sentences devoted to thoughts or feelings, and I think that results in a kind of themelessness, that, in its lack of focus on anything else, the theme becomes, to me, the passage of time.\\" In December 2009 clothing retailer Urban Outfitters began selling Shoplifting from American Apparel in its stores. Richard Yates (2010) Published September 7, 2010, by Melville House, Richard Yates is Lin's second novel. In a book review in The New York Times, Charles Bock described the book as \\"more interesting as a concept than as an actual narrative\\", adding, \\"By the time I reached the last 50 pages, each time the characters said they wanted to kill themselves, I knew exactly how they felt.\\" Taipei (2013) On February 23, 2013, Publishers Weekly awarded Taipei a starred review, predicting it would be Lin's \\"breakout\\" book and describing it as \\"a novel about disaffection that's oddly affecting\\" and \\"a book without an ounce of self-pity, melodrama, or posturing.\\" The same month, Bret Easton Ellis tweeted, \\"With Taipei Tao Lin becomes the most interesting prose stylist of his generation, which doesn't mean that Taipei isn't a boring novel...\\" Taipei was published by Vintage on June 4, 2013, to mostly positive reviews. Novelist Benjamin Lytal, writing in the New York Observer, called it Lin's \\"modernist masterpiece,\\" adding, \\"[W]e should stop calling Tao Lin the voice of his generation. Taipei, his new novel, has less to do with his generation than with the literary tradition of Knut Hamsun, Ernest Hemingway, and Robert Musil.\\" According to Slate, \\"Taipei casts a surprisingly introspective eye on the spare, 21st-century landscape Lin has such a knack for depicting.\\" New York Times critic Dwight Garner wrote, \\"I loathe reviews in which a critic claims to have love-hate feelings about a work of art. It's a way of having no opinion at all. But I love and hate Taipei.\\" On June 18, writing for The Daily Beast, critic Emily Witt said in a highly positive review: > Taipei is exactly the kind of book I hoped Tao Lin would one day write. He > is one of the few fiction writers around who engages with contemporary life, > rather than treating his writing online as existing in opposition to or > apart from the hallowed analog space of the novel.

On July 5 The New York Times Book Review awarded Taipei an Editors' Choice distinction. It was the only paperback on the list for the week. On KCRW's \\"Bookworm\\", in a conversation with Lin, Michael Silverblatt called it \\"The most moving depiction of the way we live now,\\" saying that it was \\"unbearably moving.\\" Taipei was included on best book of the year lists by Times Literary Supplement, Village Voice, Slate, Salon, _Bookforum_ , The Week, Maisonneuve, and Complex, among others. High Resolution, a film adaptation of Taipei, was released in 2018. Selected Tweets (2015) On June 15, 2015, Short Flight/Long Drive Books published a collaborative double-book called Selected Tweets by Lin and poet Mira Gonzalez. The book features selections from eight years of their tweets at nine different Twitter accounts, as well as visual art by each author, footnotes, and \\"Extras\\". Emma Kolchin-Miller, writing in the Columbia Spectator, described the book as featuring \\"a selection of bleak, depressed, disturbing, funny, and personal tweets that create a fragmented narrative and show how Twitter can serve as a platform for art, storytelling, and connection.\\" Andrea Longini, writing for Electric Literature, opined: \\"Although Twitter in name implies a kind of chatter or 'twittering,' Tao Lin and Mira Gonzalez have elevated the medium into an art form with the power to transmit authentic observations.\\" Trip (2018) Trip: Psychedelics, Alienation, and Change, a nonfiction account of Lin's experiences with psychedelic drugs, was published by Vintage Books in May 2018. Much of the book is devoted to Lin's continuing fascination with the life and thought of Terence McKenna, as well as an introduction to McKenna's ex-wife Kathleen Harrison. Trip was a Los Angeles Times bestseller.http://projects.latimes.com/bestsellers/titles/trip/ In Scientific American, John Horgan wrote, ‚ÄúIf an aspirant asks for an example of experimental science writing, I‚Äôll recommend Trip.

The term refers to the two most common end- member minerals found within ultramafic rocks which have undergone talc- carbonation or carbonation reactions: talc and the carbonate mineral magnesite. Talc carbonate mineral assemblages are controlled by temperature and pressure of metamorphism and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide within metamorphic fluids, as well as by the composition of the host rock. Compositional controls In a general sense, talc carbonate metamorphic assemblages are diagnostic of the magnesium content of the ultramafic protolith. * Lower-magnesian ultramafic rocks (12-18% MgO as a rule of thumb) tend to favor talc-chlorite assemblages * Medium-MgO rocks (15-25% MgO) tend to produce talc-amphibole assemblages. * High-MgO rocks with in excess of 25% MgO tend to form true talc-magnesite metamorphic assemblages. Thus, the MgO content of a metamorphosed ultramafic rock can be estimated roughly by understanding the mineral assemblage of the rock. Magnesium content determines the proportion of talc and/or magnesite and aluminium-calcium-sodium content determines the proportion of amphibole and/or chlorite. Talc carbonate minerals Several minerals are diagnostic of talc carbonated ultramafic rocks; * Talc * Chlorite, generally magnesian bluish-green * Tremolite- cummingtonite-grunerite amphiboles in greenschist facies rocks * Anthophyllite-cummingtonite amphibole in weakly carbonated serpentinite at greenschist facies or very rarely, uncarbonated amphibolite facies serpentinites * Magnesite, and rarely dolomite in association with amphibolitic compositions At amphibolite facies, the diopside-in isograd is reached (dependent on carbon dioxide partial pressure) and metamorphic assemblages trend toward talc-pyroxene and eventually toward metamorphic olivine. Mineral reactions Serpentinisation of olivine: : + 3H2O ‚Üí + Or by addition of aqueous silica: :3Mg2SiO4 \\\\+ 4H2O + SiO2,aq ‚Üí 2Mg3Si2O5(OH)4 Carbonation of serpentine to form talc-magnesite :2Mg3Si2O5(OH)4 \\\\+ 3CO2 ‚Üí Mg3Si4O10(OH)2 \\\\+ 3MgCO3 \\\\+ 3H2O Occurrence Because carbon dioxide is such a common component of metamorphic fluids, talc-carbonated ultramafics are relatively common. However, the degree of talc-carbonation is usually somewhere between the two end-member compositions of pure serpentinite and pure talc-carbonate. It is common to see serpentinites which contain talc, amphibole and chloritic minerals in small proportions which infer the presence of carbon dioxide in the metamorphic fluid. Talc carbonate is present in many of the ultramafic bodies of the Archaean Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia. Notably, the Widgiemooltha Komatiite shows pure talc-carbonation on the eastern flank of the Widgeimooltha Dome, and almost pure serpentinite metamorphism on the western flank. Carbonation of other rocks Carbon dioxide has less severe impacts on mafic, felsic and rocks of other composition, such as carbonate rocks, chemical sediments, etcetera. The exception to this rule is the calc-silicate family of metamorphic rocks, which are also subjected to wide variations in mineral speciation due to the mobility of carbonate during metamorphism. Felsic and mafic rocks tend to be less affected by carbon dioxide due to their higher aluminium content. Ultramafic rocks lack aluminium, which allows carbonate to react with magnesium silicates to form talc. In rocks with extremely low aluminium contents, this reaction can progress to create magnesite. Advanced carbonation of felsic and mafic rocks, very rarely, creates fenite, a metasomatic alteration caused particularly by carbonatite intrusions. Fenite alteration is known, but very restricted in distribution, around high-temperature metamorphic talc-carbonates, generally in the form of a sort of aureole around ultramafics. Such examples include biotite-rich zones, amphibolite-calcite- scapolite alteration and other unusual skarn assemblages.

Samantha is a Special Agent in the New York City FBI missing persons case squad led by Special Agent Jack Malone. She was raised in a poor, troubled home in the town of Kenosha, Wisconsin and as a result is particularly empathetic to kids in troubled situations. She was very unhappy as a teenager and tried to run away when she was sixteen, but was stopped by her mother and a policeman. She had a short-lived marriage when she was eighteen. She has had an on-again-off-again romantic relationship with Jack Malone, that began with an affair while he was married. She also had a secret office romantic relationship with Martin Fitzgerald, which ended because of disagreements between them on whether or not to reveal it to the rest of the team. She has a son, Finn, with her ex- boyfriend Brian Donovan, who is played by Adam Kaufman, Montgomery's real-life boyfriend at the time. In Episode 18 of Season 5, Sam's estranged older sister, Emily (Molly Price), visited. When Samantha was fourteen, she killed her mother Patricia (Tess Harper)'s then-boyfriend (Joe Henry) with a shovel because she caught him sexually abusing Emily (Episode 19). They buried him in the woods next to the cabin and eventually grew distant from each other. Samantha learns that as a result of this abuse, Emily had a son, Randy, who now has cancer so she sought a bone marrow donor. Sam is not a match but her mother is a possibility. Spade received her name because her mother was a fan of fictional detective Sam Spade from The Maltese Falcon, created by Dashiell Hammett.

He was one of many publishers/editors of the marijuana counterculture magazine High Times, and was later named editor-in-chief of Screw, the self-proclaimed \\"World's Greatest Newspaper.\\" In his memoir I Have Fun Everywhere I Go, Edison recounts his adventures across twenty years of druggy adventurism and his parallel careers as a magazine editor, writer, and musician. His other books include the sprawling history of American men's magazines, Dirty! Dirty! Dirty!: Of Playboys, Pigs, and Penthouse Paupers, An American Tale of Sex and Wonder; the political satire Bye, Bye Miss American Pie; several collaborations including Restaurant Man with Joe Bastianich and The Carnivore's Manifesto with Slow Food USA founder Patrick Martins; and most recently, Sympathy for the Drummer: Why Charlie Watts Matters, a history and appreciation of the Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts, and the history of blues and rock ‚Äôn ‚Äôroll drumming. Edison speaks frequently on free speech, and the American counterculture. Between 2011 and 2018, Edison was the host and producer of the weekly Heritage Radio Network series Arts & Seizures.Arts & Seizures hosted by Mike Edison & Judy McGuire Early life In his memoir, Edison describes growing up in a dysfunctional Jewish household in suburban New Jersey, and discovering marijuana at the age of fourteen. Soon after he had his first LSD experience. He later attended the New York University Film School, and Columbia University, dropping out of both to pursue a career as a musician and writer. Career: Pro wrestling, sex, and the American counterculture Edison earned his first magazine publishing job in 1986, as editor of Wrestling's Main Event, by defeating the incumbent editor in a bloody Loser Leaves Town match.Wrestling's Main Event, Pumpkin Press, October 1986, \\"Bloody Office Battle: Editors Fight to a Finish\\" Between 1985 and 1988 he authored 28 pornographic novels, and in his career on the seamy side of the publishing business, he has written about German whorehouses and Spanish coke dealers for Hustler,Hustler Magazine 1993 and has published a series of erotic ‚Äúconfessions‚Äù for Penthouse Letters. He was also a frequent contributor to Screw magazine, penning chronicles of 42nd Street, then the adult entertainment mecca of New York City. In the late 1980s Edison began writing a featured column about television and politics, \\"Shoot the Tube,\\" for marijuana and counterculture magazine High Times. In 1998 Edison was named publisher of High Times, and soon after took control of the editorial side of the magazine as well.High Times Magazine, 1998-2001 As editor and publisher, he caused a furor among staffers by putting Black Sabbath singer Ozzy Osbourne on the cover, and then leaking to the New York Posts Page Six gossip columnNew York Post, January 267, 1999 that thousands of dollars of pot had gone missing from the photo shoot. After taking the magazine to new heights in sales and advertising,Village Voice, Press Clips, October 27, 1999 he was instrumental in producing High Times first feature film, High Times' Potluck.Washington Square News, October 5, 2003, \\"Dropout Produces Pot Film\\" Edison left High Times in 2001.New York Post, Page Six Following High Times, Edison became the editorial director for upstart Jewish culture magazine Heeb, for whom he went undercover and exposed Jews for Jesus as a Baptist organization.Heeb Magazine, 2003, also The Jewish Telegraph Agency www.jta.org He also covered the 2003 harassment trial of Screw magazine founding editor and publisher Al Goldstein. Edison left Heeb later that year in protest over a cover story on The Passion of the Christ, a rebuttal to the Mel Gibson film. In 2003, Edison was named editor-in-chief of Screw (replacing Al Goldstein), where he began writing 17 years before as a freelancer. In late 2006 he announced that he was leaving the editor-in-chief position. Soon after Screw ceased publication. Edison lives and works as a writer, editor, journalist, and musician in New York City. He continues to write frequently about sex and American culture, and he was the senior editor of music publisher Backbeat Books from 2008 to 2012. His acquisitions at Backbeat ranged from biographies to scholarly and pop histories for all genres of music ‚Äî from soul music to punk rock to classic rock, jazz, classical, country, and beyond. The final title that was published during his tenure, Lisa Crystal Carver‚Äôs Reconsidering Yoko Ono, was excerpted extensively in The New York Times Magazine. He has contributed to many publications and websites, including Spin, The Daily Beast, Huffington Post, and the New York Press, for whom he covered professional wrestling and classical music. In 2010, he won the 26th NYC episode of Opium Magazine‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiterary Death Match,‚Äù when he surprised the audience and judges by pulling former Sonic Youth drummer Bob Bert out of the audience, who proceeded to play bongos while Edison read from his book, I Have Fun Everywhere I Go. After his performance, celebrity judge and Czech supermodel Paulina Porizkova told HuffPost, ‚ÄúMike Edison could be reading a tractor manual and I would be interested.‚Äù Edison has also written bios, press releases, and liner notes for numerous bands, including The Stooges, the Ramones, the New York Dolls, Was (Not Was), Zappa Plays Zappa, and Robert Gordon and Chris Spedding. Edison wrote the extensive liner notes for a series of seven deluxe reissues by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, including the 2010 compilation Dirty Shirt Rock 'n' Roll: The First Ten Years. Jon Spencer has also played on and produced recordings by the Edison Rocket Train.  Books  I Have Fun Everywhere I Go His 2008 memoir is I Have Fun Everywhere I Go: Savage Tales of Pot, Porn, Punk Rock, Pro Wrestling, Talking Apes, Evil Bosses, Dirty Blues, American Heroes, and the Most Notorious Magazines in the World (May 2008, Faber and Faber/Farrar, Straus & Giroux). Reviewing the book, Bookforum called Edison ‚ÄúCooler than Toby Young and more credible than James Frey,‚Äù while the SF Weekly called I Have Fun ‚Äúhigh-spirited sleaze, overeducated yokelry, and intensely American egalitarian humor.‚Äù Kirkus Reviews gave the book a starred review, calling it, ‚ÄúA beer-sozzled, speed-cranked nail bomb of a book‚Äîwhat everybody‚Äôs Saturday night should be like.\\" Edison has also been criticized for spending too much time ‚Äúsettling old scores with his enemies,‚Äù particularly his former co-workers at High Times, which he refers to as ‚Äúthat dope rag.‚ÄùPublishers Weekly In addition, Edison has recorded a \\"beatnik bop and punk rock boogaloo, outerspace soundtrack and spoken word\\" CD, a companion piece to the book, also called I Have Fun Everywhere I Go. The CD, a collaboration with rock musician and producer Jon Spencer, has been called ‚Äúa revolutionary turn for the spoken word record,‚Äù and has been compared to ‚ÄúLenny Bruce, Jack Kerouac, and Richard Pryor.‚ÄùBPM Magazine, April, 2008 ‚ÄúDean of Rock Critics‚Äù Robert Christgau gave the record three stars, giving special praise to the tracks ‚ÄúPornography, Part I,‚Äù and ‚ÄúOzzy, HIgh Times, and Me.‚Äù Edison performed the book numerous times on the subsequent book tour with his band the Space Liberation Army. Spin magazine commented ‚ÄúSmart, filthy, and funny, Mike Edison is no ordinary author... Edison brings the stories from his book to life with the performance chops of a seasoned rock‚Äôn‚Äôroller.‚Äù Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! Edison's 2011 book Dirty! Dirty! Dirty!: Of Playboys, Pigs, and Penthouse Paupers, An American Tale of Sex and Wonder was described by journalist and historian Rick Perlstein as \\"foul-mouthed popular history at its most entertaining.\\" Largely a history of American men's magazines, beginning in the 1950s with Hugh Hefner and Playboy and winding its way through the 1960s and 1970s following Hefner's less genteel proegeny, Hustler publisher Larry Flynt, Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, and Screw founder Al Goldstein, the book covers approximately sixty years of American popular culture and free speech as \\"viewed from the darkside of the newsstand.\\" Also prominently featured in the book are comedian Lenny Bruce and pornographer Ralph Ginzberg among others. The book was well received. Kirkus called it ‚Äúan enthusiastic romp,‚Äù and LA Weekly noted that, \\"Edison is a fast enough talker to move the reader quickly into what turns out to be a well- crafted history of censorship and sex.\\" Jewish culture website Jewcy praised Edison‚Äôs tact in handling the subject of pornography, writing, ‚Äúa prevalent persuasion in the book is Edison‚Äôs staunch feminism,‚Äù and adding that, ‚Äúhe loves people and their freedoms.‚Äù While working on Dirty! Dirty! DIrty!, Edison was named a Writer in Residence at the New York Public Library. He told PopMatters of the experience, \\"I went to write and research in my own space at the big library on Fifth Avenue. It was the best, walking past the lions and up the stairs to my desk to look at dirty magazines.\\" Edison would later lecture on free speech at the Library, as well as the University of Chicago and other venues. In November 2011 Ian's Pizza in Chicago honored Edison by naming a pizza after him, the Mike Edison Dirty Pie.http://bakeanddestroy.net/2011/10/mike-edison-does-chicago/ Bye Bye, Miss American Pie In the run up to the 2012 presidential election, Edison released the novella Bye Bye, Miss American Pie, available exclusively as an ebook, and printed in a hand-bound, limited edition of 300 numbered copies. The book was described as \\"the first bawdy political satire of the 21st century ... Myra Breckinridge meets Breakfast of Champions.\\" Mike Edison Takes on Political Hypocrites, Mr. Skin, 18 September 2012 You Are a Complete Disappointment In 2016 Edison published his second memoir, You Are a Complete Disappointment ‚Äî A Triumphant Memoir of Failed Expectations (May 2016, Sterling Publishing). The title comes from his father‚Äôs very last words to him, delivered on his deathbed. In the memoir, which covers the period before Edison‚Äôs first memoir, I Have Fun Everywhere I Go, Edison discusses growing up in New Jersey with a narcissistic, bullying father, and how he learned to escape from an abusive situation. Eventually he finds forgiveness with the help of a therapist, whom he refers to (‚Äúwith her permission‚Äù) as \\"Dr. Headshrinker\\", comparing her to Jennifer Melfi on the television series The Sopranos, and a rescued kitten named Jeepster, after the song by Marc Bolan. Edison also returns to familiar themes featured in his other books, including space travel, rock and roll, and professional wrestling, using the concept of ‚Äúkayfabe‚Äù ‚Äîwrestling argot for ‚Äúthe portrayal of staged events as real or true‚Äù ‚Äî to discuss his father‚Äôs obsession with his own polished public image. Previously Edison has used kayfabe to discuss the self-perpetuated myth-making of Hugh Hefner in Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! You Are a Complete Disappointment received good reviews. Booklist wrote that ‚ÄúEdison‚Äôs memoir about his troubled relationship with his straitlaced dad is a work of humor and pathos.‚Äùhttps://www.booklistonline.com/You-Are-a-Complete-Disappointment- A-Triumphant-Memoir-of-Failed-Expectations-Mike-Edison/pid=8063929 The Star- Ledger called You Are a Complete Disappointment ‚Äúa total delight,‚Äù adding that ‚ÄúEdison knows what he's doing on the page, is skilled at engaging the reader and is a likeable guy as he lays bare his insecurities, pain and loves.‚Äùhttp://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2016/05/you_are_a_complete_disappointment_is_a_total_delig.html  Sympathy for the Drummer  In 2019, Edison released Sympathy for the Drummer: Why Charlie Watts Matters, (Backbeat Books), a biography and appreciation of The Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts. The book has been described as ‚Äúboth a gonzo rush‚Äîcapturing the bristling energy of the Rolling Stones and the times in which they lived‚Äîand a wide-eyed reflection on why the Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band in the World needed the world's greatest rock 'n' roll drummer.‚Äù Sympathy for the Drummer was critically acclaimed, called, ‚ÄúThe most colorfully graphic and, arguably, the most accurate description extant of the Rolling Stones at the absolute pinnacle of their career‚Äù by All About Jazz. Classic Rock called the book, ‚ÄúRollicking ... highly engaging ... essential,‚Äù and PopMatters said, ‚ÄúSympathy for the Drummer is one of the small number of books that can open your ears. Infectious... a remarkable achievement.‚Äù Embraced by the drumming community, the biography received praise from Clem Burke of Blondie, and Bun E. Carlos of Cheap Trick who called it, ‚ÄúRequired reading for any Stones fan.‚Äù Jim Sclavunos (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, The Cramps, etc.) said that Sympathy is ‚Äúan effusively infectious tribute to art in all of its myriad forms.‚Äù In 2020, Charlie Watts himself called the author to thank him for writing ‚Äúsuch a lovely book.‚Äù Edison narrated and co-produced the audiobook for Sympathy with Jesse Cannon, and featured guests include Jon Spencer, Mickey Finn (Boss Hog), and Pete Zaramba (The Fleshtones). While talking about creating the audiobook, Edison said, ‚ÄúI listened to Bruce Springsteen‚Äôs audiobook and it sounded like he was in sixth grade and telling me what he did on his summer vacation. It made no sense. It was insulting. The book is so great ‚Äî why couldn‚Äôt he bring the same impact to the audio version where truly, you can do anything? I know some audio products are becoming more fleshed out productions, but the industry norm is to not to rock the boat. Jesse and I are trying to change that.‚Äù  Videos and trailers  Edison has created book trailers and video promotion for his work, collaborating with noted visual artist, Guggenheim grant recipient Tricia McLaughlin for the first-ever 3D book trailer for Dirty! Dirty! Dirty!,https://vimeo.com/29725531 in addition to a widely seen performance video, ‚ÄúHugh Hefner Hates Girls,‚Äù featuring musicians Jon Spencer and Dee Pop.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1i_oQ8se0 For his first book, I Have Fun Everywhere I Go, Edison created the ‚Äúlegendary bong guitar video‚Äù which has been described as ‚Äúthe most watched non-fiction book trailer of all time,‚Äù with over 500,000 views on YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcCrTahsLg0 For his most recent book, Sympathy for the Drummer: Why Charlie Watts Matters, Edison created a mock TV ad loosely based on the famous Crazy Eddie ads from the 1970s, and parodies John Zacherle, the late-night horror movie host. Edison gained attention for the outre energy of the ad, which included the veiled threat that ‚Äúnot everyone is gonna be happy, especially not if you are the drummer in Aerosmith.\\" Additionally, a trailer for the audio book was created resembling that of a Hollywood blockbuster. Food and wine Edison was the collaborator with restaurateur and viticulturist Joe Bastianich on his 2012 best-selling memoir Restaurant Man of which author Bret Easton Ellis has said \\"There is no fussiness and not a single boring sentence.\\" Restaurant Man Edison and Bastianich also collaborated to create The Great Led Zeppelin Wine Pairing, a series of \\"wine and music pairings.\\" In 2014 Edison collaborated with Slow Food USA founder Patrick Martins and released The Carnivore's Manifesto, about \\"eating well, eating responsibly, and eating meat.\\" The Atlantic magazine named The Carnivore's Manifesto as one of the \\"Best Food Books of 2014.https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/12/the- best-food-books-of-2014/383713/ Music Edison was the long-time drummer for New York cult-garage band the Raunch Hands (Crypt Records) as well as being a collaborator of punk rocker GG Allin, with whom he wrote a number of songs and recorded two albums. He currently leads his own long-running band, the Edison Rocket Train, and is currently collaborating with popular Spanish blues punk group Guadalupe Plata. The release of their first LP, The Devil Can‚Äôt Do You No Harm, recorded in Seville, Spain, was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is expected to be released in early 2021 on Madrid-based label Everlasting Records. In 1984 Edison joined the Rock Against Reagan Tour, opening shows in San Francisco, Washington, DC, and Dallas for New York hardcore band Reagan Youth. In late 1984 he and three NYU classmates formed the New York post-punk band Killdozer, who released one self-produced LP entitled There's No Mistaking Quality before changing their band name to Sharky's Machine in order to avoid confusion with Madison, Wisconsin's postpunk band Killdozer. Edison joined the Raunch Hands in early 1990 and accompanied them that year on a tour of Japan, later relocating with them to Madrid, Spain. In 1992, while living in Madrid, Edison joined Spanish hardcore punk band The Pleasure Fuckers, and played with them through 1995. In 2001 he formed the Edison Rocket Train, switching to vocals and guitar. The Edison Rocket Train has released two full- length CDs, Yes! Yes!! Yes!!! and East River Delta (produced by Jon Spencer), and several singles, including the traditional gospel number ‚ÄúThis Train,‚Äù and the pro-wrestling themed ‚ÄúI Like to Hurt People,‚Äù featuring Handsome Dick Manitoba of proto -punk band the Dictators. These were later compiled for digital streaming as Go-Go Gospel and the Shakin‚Äô Beat: The History of the Edison Rocket Train, Vol. 1. The Edison Rocket Train continues to perform and record. The current line-up includes Boss Hog keyboard player Mickey Finn and drummer Dee Pop, formerly of the Gun Club, and a founding member of New York No Wave band Bush Tetras. Edison also frequently performs frequently as a solo acoustic act, accompanying himself on guitar and occasionally piano. Spencer also performs frequently with Edison, backing him for spoken word performances with Edison's group the Rocket Train Delta Science Arkestra ‚Äî which has also featured ex-Capt. Beefheart guitarist Gary Lucas ‚Äî and more recently the Space Liberation Army in which Edison also plays electric organ and Theremin. Edison has also appeared frequently with Lucas's band Gods and Monsters. In 2019, The Space Liberation Army (now featuring Mickey Finn and ex-Sonic Youth drummer Bob Bert) were the featured performers at the East Village Arts Festival, hosted by the New York Public Library.

National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC Giovanni Cariani (c. 1490‚Äì1547), also known as Giovanni Busi or Il Cariani, was an Italian painter of the high- Renaissance, active in Venice and the Venetian mainland, including Bergamo, thought to be his native city.  Overview  Adoration of the Shepherds, an early work of c. 1515-17, Royal Collection His father, also Giovanni Busi, was born in Fuipiano Al Brembo which is a hamlet of San Giovanni Bianco (Bergamo), and was appointed a local magistrate for the Venetian authorities. His son, also born in Fuipiano Al Brembo, is known to have lived in Venice starting in 1509, and may have trained with either Giovanni Bellini or Giorgione, and almost certainly was influenced by them. Though he worked often in Bergamo, he died in Venice in 1547. He was strongly influenced by Palma il Vecchio, but had a provincial love of scenery as seen in his Sacra conversazione with a youthful donor. While working in Bergamo (1517‚Äì1523), he likely overlapped with Lorenzo Lotto, who worked there from 1513-1525.  Cariani and the Courtesans  The 1987 BBC Two television play Cariani and the Courtesans, written and directed by Leslie Megahey, presented a fictionalised account of the painter's time in Venice, with Cariani (Paul McGann) interacting with other historical characters, such as Tullia d'Aragona (Diana Quick), Marcantonio Raimondi (Simon Callow), and Francesco Albani (Michael Gough), with a brief \\"cameo\\" by Albrecht D√ºrer (Frederik de Groot), and narrated by Charles Gray. The narrative is woven around the painting of a number of his works, principally Four Courtesans and Three Gentlemen. Megahey had previously used the same narrative device on the 1979 production Schalcken the Painter.

Semantic interoperability is a requirement to enable machine computable logic, inferencing, knowledge discovery, and data federation between information systems.NCOIC, \\"SCOPE\\", Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium, 2008 Semantic interoperability is therefore concerned not just with the packaging of data (syntax), but the simultaneous transmission of the meaning with the data (semantics). This is accomplished by adding data about the data (metadata), linking each data element to a controlled, shared vocabulary. The meaning of the data is transmitted with the data itself, in one self-describing \\"information package\\" that is independent of any information system. It is this shared vocabulary, and its associated links to an ontology, which provides the foundation and capability of machine interpretation, inference, and logic. Syntactic interoperability (see below) is a prerequisite for semantic interoperability. Syntactic interoperability refers to the packaging and transmission mechanisms for data. In healthcare, NHL has been in use for over thirty years (which predates the internet and web technology), and uses the pipe character (|) as a data delimiter. The current internet standard for document markup is XML, which uses \\"< >\\" as a data delimiter. The data delimiters convey no meaning to the data other than to structure the data. Without a data dictionary to translate the contents of the delimiters, the data remains meaningless. While there are many attempts at creating data dictionaries and information models to associate with these data packaging mechanisms, none have been practical to implement. This has only perpetuated the ongoing \\"babelization\\" of data and inability to exchange data with meaning. Since the introduction of the Semantic Web concept by Tim Berners-Lee in 1999, there has been growing interest and application of the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standards to provide web-scale semantic data exchange, federation, and inferencing capabilities.  Semantic as a function of syntactic interoperability  Syntactic interoperability, provided by for instance XML or the SQL standards, is a pre-requisite to semantic. It involves a common data format and common protocol to structure any data so that the manner of processing the information will be interpretable from the structure. It also allows detection of syntactic errors, thus allowing receiving systems to request resending of any message that appears to be garbled or incomplete. No semantic communication is possible if the syntax is garbled or unable to represent the data. However, information represented in one syntax may in some cases be accurately translated into a different syntax. Where accurate translation of syntaxes is possible, systems using different syntaxes may also interoperate accurately. In some cases, the ability to accurately translate information among systems using different syntaxes may be limited to one direction, when the formalisms used have different levels of expressivity (ability to express information). A single ontology containing representations of every term used in every application is generally considered impossible, because of the rapid creation of new terms or assignments of new meanings to old terms. However, though it is impossible to anticipate every concept that a user may wish to represent in a computer, there is the possibility of finding some finite set of \\"primitive\\" concept representations that can be combined to create any of the more specific concepts that users may need for any given set of applications or ontologies. Having a foundation ontology (also called upper ontology) that contains all those primitive elements would provide a sound basis for general semantic interoperability, and allow users to define any new terms they need by using the basic inventory of ontology elements, and still have those newly defined terms properly interpreted by any other computer system that can interpret the basic foundation ontology. Whether the number of such primitive concept representations is in fact finite, or will expand indefinitely, is a question under active investigation. If it is finite, then a stable foundation ontology suitable to support accurate and general semantic interoperability can evolve after some initial foundation ontology has been tested and used by a wide variety of users. At the present time, no foundation ontology has been adopted by a wide community, so such a stable foundation ontology is still in the future.  Words and meanings  One persistent misunderstanding recurs in discussion of semantics is \\"the confusion of words and meanings\\". The meanings of words change, sometimes rapidly. But a formal language such as used in an ontology can encode the meanings (semantics) of concepts in a form that does not change. In order to determine what is the meaning of a particular word (or term in a database, for example) it is necessary to label each fixed concept representation in an ontology with the word(s) or term(s) that may refer to that concept. When multiple words refer to the same (fixed) concept in language this is called synonymy; when one word is used to refer to more than one concept, that is called ambiguity. Ambiguity and synonymy are among the factors that make computer understanding of language very difficult. The use of words to refer to concepts (the meanings of the words used) is very sensitive to the context and the purpose of any use for many human-readable terms. The use of ontologies in supporting semantic interoperability is to provide a fixed set of concepts whose meanings and relations are stable and can be agreed to by users. The task of determining which terms in which contexts (each database is a different context) is then separated from the task of creating the ontology, and must be taken up by the designer of a database, or the designer of a form for data entry, or the developer of a program for language understanding. When the meaning of a word used in some interoperable context is changed, then to preserve interoperability it is necessary to change the pointer to the ontology element(s) that specifies the meaning of that word.  Knowledge representation requirements and languages  A knowledge representation language may be sufficiently expressive to describe nuances of meaning in well understood fields. There are at least five levels of complexity of these. For general semi-structured data one may use a general purpose language such as XML.XML as a tool for Semantic Interoperability Semantic Interoperability on the Web, Jeff Heflin and James Hendler Languages with the full power of first- order predicate logic may be required for many tasks. Human languages are highly expressive, but are considered too ambiguous to allow the accurate interpretation desired, given the current level of human language technology.  Prior agreement not required  Semantic interoperability may be distinguished from other forms of interoperability by considering whether the information transferred has, in its communicated form, all of the meaning required for the receiving system to interpret it correctly, even when the algorithms used by the receiving system are unknown to the sending system. Consider sending one number: If that number is intended to be the sum of money owed by one company to another, it implies some action or lack of action on the part of both those who send it and those who receive it. It may be correctly interpreted if sent in response to a specific request, and received at the time and in the form expected. This correct interpretation does not depend only on the number itself, which could represent almost any of millions of types of quantitative measurement, rather it depends strictly on the circumstances of transmission. That is, the interpretation depends on both systems expecting that the algorithms in the other system use the number in exactly the same sense, and it depends further on the entire envelope of transmissions that preceded the actual transmission of the bare number. By contrast, if the transmitting system does not know how the information will be used by other systems, it is necessary to have a shared agreement on how information with some specific meaning (out of many possible meanings) will appear in a communication. For a particular task, one solution is to standardize a form, such as a request for payment; that request would have to encode, in standardized fashion, all of the information needed to evaluate it, such as: the agent owing the money, the agent owed the money, the nature of the action giving rise to the debt, the agents, goods, services, and other participants in that action; the time of the action; the amount owed and currency in which the debt is reckoned; the time allowed for payment; the form of payment demanded; and other information. When two or more systems have agreed on how to interpret the information in such a request, they can achieve semantic interoperability for that specific type of transaction. For semantic interoperability generally, it is necessary to provide standardized ways to describe the meanings of many more things than just commercial transactions, and the number of concepts whose representation needs to be agreed upon are at a minimum several thousand.  Ontology research  How to achieve semantic interoperability for more than a few restricted scenarios is currently a matter of research and discussion. For the problem of General Semantic Interoperability, some form of foundation ontology ('upper ontology') is required that is sufficiently comprehensive to provide the definition of concepts for more specialized ontologies in multiple domains. Over the past decade, more than ten foundation ontologies have been developed, but none have as yet been adopted by a wide user base. The need for a single comprehensive all-inclusive ontology to support Semantic Interoperability can be avoided by designing the common foundation ontology as a set of basic (\\"primitive\\") concepts that can be combined to create the logical descriptions of the meanings of terms used in local domain ontologies or local databases. This tactic is based on the principle that: If: (1) the meanings and usage of the primitive ontology elements in the foundation ontology are agreed on, and (2) the ontology elements in the domain ontologies are constructed as logical combinations of the elements in the foundation ontology, Then: The intended meanings of the domain ontology elements can be computed automatically using an FOL (first-order logic) reasoner, by any system that accepts the meanings of the elements in the foundation ontology, and has both the foundation ontology and the logical specifications of the elements in the domain ontology. Therefore: Any system wishing to interoperate accurately with another system need transmit only the data to be communicated, plus any logical descriptions of terms used in that data that were created locally and are not already in the common foundation ontology. This tactic then limits the need for prior agreement on meanings to only those ontology elements in the common Foundation Ontology (FO). Based on several considerations, this is likely to be fewer than 10,000 elements (types and relations). In practice, together with the FO focused on representations of the primitive concepts, a set of domain extension ontologies to the FO with elements specified using the FO elements will likely also be used. Such pre- existing extensions will ease the cost of creating domain ontologies by providing existing elements with the intended meaning, and will reduce the chance of error by using elements that have already been tested. Domain extension ontologies may be logically inconsistent with each other, and that needs to be determined if different domain extensions are used in any communication. Whether use of such a single foundation ontology can itself be avoided by sophisticated mapping techniques among independently developed ontologies is also under investigation.  Importance The practical significance of semantic interoperability has been measured by several studies that estimate the cost (in lost efficiency) due to lack of semantic interoperability. One study,Jan Walker, Eric Pan, Douglas Johnston, Julia Adler-Milstein, David W. Bates and Blackford Middleton, The Value of Healthcare Information Exchange and Interoperability Health Affairs, 19 January 2005 focusing on the lost efficiency in the communication of healthcare information, estimated that US$77.8 billion per year could be saved by implementing an effective interoperability standard in that area. Other studies, of the construction industryMicrosoft Word - 08657 Final Rpt_8-2-04.doc and of the automobile manufacturing supply chain,https://www.nist.gov/director/prog-ofc/report99-1.pdf estimate costs of over US$10 billion per year due to lack of semantic interoperability in those industries. In total these numbers can be extrapolated to indicate that well over US$100 billion per year is lost because of the lack of a widely used semantic interoperability standard in the US alone. There has not yet been a study about each policy field that might offer big cost savings applying semantic interoperability standards.

It comprises over 100 tenants in of retail space, with three anchor stores (Macy's, JCPenney, and Von Maur), along with Barnes & Noble (which is the largest non-anchor store in the mall), Forever 21, H&M;, Pottery Barn, and The North Face as junior anchors, and a movie theater (opened as Cinemark, now Celebration Cinema). The mall is owned and managed by Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, who acquired it from its developer, Taubman Centers, in 2006. History Woodland Mall opened in 1968 at the northwestern corner of 28th Street (M-11) and East Beltline Avenue (M-37). The mall was built at a southwest-to-northeast orientation, with Sears at the southwestern end, and JCPenney at the northeastern end. A Kresge dime store was also located in the Sears wing. Another mall, Eastbrook Mall (now Centerpointe Mall), was located on the northeastern corner of the same intersection. A 1975 expansion to Woodland Mall brought a northwesterly- oriented central wing which ended in a third anchor store, Hudson's. After the closure of Kresge in 1987, the store's former space was divided among smaller retailers. Lord & Taylor was proposed in 1997 as a fourth anchor store at the southeastern end of the mall. However, Hudson's attempted to sue the mall, claiming veto power over the addition of new anchor stores, and the Lord & Taylor was never built. A food court (Cafes in the woods) was built next to JCPenney in 1999 as well as a play area in the Sears wing. Also in 1999, RiverTown Crossings opened in Grandville, on the other side of the city. This was the first serious form of retail competition for Woodland Mall, as prior to the opening of RiverTown Crossings, Woodland was the only super-regional mall in Metro Grand Rapids. In the late 1990s Woodland Mall experienced many other renovations including new flooring and curves to the ceiling throughout the mall, new lighting and d√©cor as well as updated entrances to look more modern. Hudson's was converted to Marshall Field's in 2001 in a nameplate consolidation by parent Target Corporation (formerly known as Dayton-Hudson), and then to Macy's in 2006 as the result of an acquisition. A 14-screen movie theater (then owned by Cinemark) and a Red Robin and On the Border restaurant were added to the southeastern portion of the mall in 2006, the same year in which Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust acquired the mall from Taubman. Celebration Cinema purchased the movie theater complex (as well as a former Cinemark at RiverTown Crossings) a year later. Barnes & Noble, in October 2008, announced that it would be relocating from a nearby store to a new location at the mall. On Wednesday, October 21, 2009, the two-story bookstore opened to the public. In 2013 H&M; announced that it would be opening its first location in Michigan outside of Metro Detroit which opened in October 2013. On January 4, 2017, it was announced that Sears would be closing on March 26, 2017. Later it was changed to April 2, 2017. The Sears anchor building was demolished one year later, in March 2018 for a major expansion, including the extension of the Sears wing to feature 10-15 new shops, a Von Maur to be the new anchor at the end of the wing, another additional anchor store on the northwestern portion of the wing, new detached restaurants behind Celebration Cinema, 2 new outparcel stores where the Sears auto center was, all parking lots replaced in the mall, all of the mall and existing anchor exteriors to be updated as well as more improvements throughout the mall with a final completion in Fall 2019. The only stores officially confirmed were the Von Maur and the existing Apple Store to be moving into a new space next store where Justice and Claire's were, it is now double the size. Von Maur opened on October 12, 2019. On August 16, 2019, a group of teenagers broke into the mall by smashing a door. Once inside, they stole cell phones, jewelry and clothing. Police arrested three of the suspects. In May 2020, Celebration Cinemas announced that their theater at Woodland would permanently close.

Martin is a member of the FBI missing persons case squad in New York City led by Special Agent Jack Malone. Biography Season 1 Originally with White Collar Crimes in Seattle, Martin's father, the Deputy Director of the FBI, had him transferred to New York City when the position became available. In the beginning, this transfer is seen by some on the team (particularly Danny Taylor) as favoritism on the part of the FBI brass. Martin's relationship with his father is a sticking point throughout most of the first season with the two as Danny believes that Martin is receiving what he describes as \\"free rein\\" around the office and the OPR as a result of his father; however, Martin does not have a great relationship with his father, especially after the latter attempted to interfere in one of Jack Malone's investigations and made it clear to Martin that Jack was not as great as he might think. The elder Fitzgerald also had the focus of an OPR investigation pulled away from Martin and placed onto Jack, leading Martin to angrily tell his father that he no longer needed his help and could manage his career on his own. Season 2 In the second season, Martin again came under the scrutiny of the OPR after he provoked a suspect in a case by punching him after learning that the man had cut the ear off a ten-year-old girl. The enraged man responded by pulling a knife and Martin was forced to shoot him. The incident is witnessed by a senior agent, Vivian Johnson. Both she and Martin had to keep quiet in order to preserve their careers; however, hours after they were both cleared of any wrongdoing by the OPR, Martin went to Jack and confessed what had been weighing on his conscience. Throughout the rest of the season, Martin experienced disturbing and vivid flashbacks to all of the shootings in which he had been involved. Later in the season, Martin's favorite aunt went missing, and he had to enlist the help of fellow agent Samantha Spade to find her when she goes missing not long after finding out her cancer is going to kill her soon. Season 3 Season three revolved around the inter-office romance between Martin and the agent he had been eyeing since he had first joined the team: Samantha Spade. Their relationship began after Jack announced he was moving to Chicago, leading Sam to ask Martin out. At Sam's request, they kept their relationship a secret, but it bothered Martin that Sam did not want to be seen with him, and he eventually broke up with her midway through the season. In the season finale, Martin and his partner Danny Taylor were transferring a prisoner to a detention center when they were ambushed. Danny survived with a scratch to the head and PTSD while bullet-riddled Martin endured hours of surgery and weeks of agonizing recovery, leading Danny to feel guilty and act carelessly. Only hours after Martin was shot, his controlling father, Victor Fitzgerald, showed up and took control over the rest of the investigation. He eventually realized near the end of the episode that his place was at his son's bedside in the hospital. Like Danny, Samantha also avoided Martin for a while after he was shot, but she eventually came to his bedside and explained to the unconscious Martin that while she has not always been there for him, she was not going to leave this time until he was better. Season 4 In the fourth season, Martin battled an addiction to prescription painkillers following his near- fatal shooting. He also dealt with the fear that he would not be able to do his job properly after he returned from the hospital, and this fear was intensified when Jack told him he had added a new agent to the team. Martin's addiction got worse, even bringing him to steal painkillers from a victim's home. It took the support and concern of Danny and Samantha to finally wake Martin up to the full extent of his situation and lead him to get help. Near the end of the season, Martin casually approached Danny in the office and thanked him for his support, explaining that he had found a sponsor (a retired NYPD officer) and that he was clean and working to stay that way. Seasons 5 - 7 So far from the fifth to current season, Martin has remained sober and committed to his work. However, in the seventh season, Martin starts dating a woman from a case where she was a witness and a threatened jury member. She pulls a gun on Martin when he goes to interview her. He later leaves it out of the report and he then gets involved with her. Martin then finds out that she is a criminal. He ends up giving her a minor gunshot wound, while arresting her.

The last owner when the plant closed was Technicolor. History WEA Manufacturing Inc. was created in 1978‚Äì1979 when Warner Communications Inc. purchased two of its longtime suppliers: the record pressing plants Specialty Records Corporation (Olyphant, Pennsylvania) and Allied Record Company (Los Angeles). The company was headquartered in Olyphant, where the original plant was replaced in late 1981 by a new facility which retained the name Specialty Records Corporation. The Specialty Records Corporation name was dropped in 1996 in favor of WEA Manufacturing. The company invested in CD manufacturing in 1986, matching a $247,000 contribution by economic development corporation Ben Franklin Technology Partners to develop & implement new processes of manufacturing audio CDs and CD-ROMs. BFTP assembled a team of experts in physics, electrical engineering, and thin film technology from the University of Scranton and Lehigh University to carry out the research & development. The Olyphant plant and another plant in Alsdorf, Germany, were expanded to support CD pressing that year, with the Olyphant facility's production commencing first in September 1986. WEA Manufacturing grew to become one of the largest manufacturers of recorded media in the world. The company began manufacturing Laserdiscs in July 1991. The company's DVD division, Warner Advanced Media Operations, helped design the high-density format used in DVDs, and manufactured some of the first DVDs in the late 1990s. The company was sold to Cinram International in October 2003 and no longer exists under the name WEA Manufacturing, but the Olyphant plant continued to operate under its new ownership. In 2005, the company was Lackawanna County's largest employer, with over 2,300 people working at the Olyphant plant. Cinram closed the former Allied plant in 2006, while Technicolor (which purchased Cinram's assets in 2015) closed the Olyphant plant in 2018. Patents WEA Manufacturing held U.S. patents related to compact disc manufacture: * Method of manufacturing a composite disc structure and apparatus for performing the method (filed 2002, published 2005) * Methods and apparatus for reducing the shrinkage of an optical disc's clamp area and the resulting optical disc (filed 2002, published 2005) * Interference of converging spherical waves with application to the design of light-readable information-recording media and systems for reading such media (filed 2001, published 2004) * Print scanner (filed 1990, published 1993) Litigation In 1990, WEA Manufacturing was sued by a Canadian firm, Optical Recording Co. (ORC), for alleged infringement of two 1971 patents related to glass mastering equipment which was used by Time Warner and WEA Manufacturing in the manufacture of approximately 450 million CDs. ORC contended that unlike five other major CD manufacturers in the U.S., Time Warner had refused to license the technology from ORC. In 1992, a jury assessed damages of 6 cents per disc, plus $4‚Äì5 million in interest.

History Cycling was the main sport of the original Grupo Sport Benfica formed in 1906. Upon the merger with Sport Lisboa in 1908, a cycling department established within the new Sport Lisboa e Benfica, and along with football, is one of only two sports referenced in the club's logo. The sport was in activity from 1906 to 1941, 1947 to 1978, 1999 to 2000, and once again for two seasons in 2007 and 2008. In 1931 the Portuguese cycling legend Jos√© Maria Nicolau won the Volta a Portugal and helped Benfica to win the Volta as a team. Benfica won the Volta once again in 1932. In 1934, Benfica won the Volta for the third time with Nicolau being the overall winner, beating his rival Alfredo Trindade from Sporting of Lisbon. After some years without success, Benfica won another Volta as a team in 1939. The benfiquistas had to wait until 1947 (due to the end of the cycling section in 1941) to see once again one of their cyclists winning the Volta. It was Jos√© Martins, who also helped Benfica to win the Volta as a team. In 1963, Benfica won its sixth Volta a Portugal, but had to wait two more years to see a Benfica cyclist winning the Volta. It was Peixoto Alves, who was succeeded by Francisco Valada one year later and another team win. In 1968 Am√©rico Silva won the Volta, but Benfica failed to win it as a team. That happened in 1974, when Benfica won its eighth Volta (and due to the cycling section's end in 1978 the last one for a long time) and its cyclist Fernando Mendes the seventh individual Volta for Benfica. Two years later, in 1976, Firmino Bernardino won the last Volta for Benfica before its end in 1978. It was the Spanish cyclist David Plaza, the first foreigner to win a Volta for Benfica, who won the last individual Volta for Benfica in 1999. It was the same year that Benfica won its ninth and so far last Volta a Portugal. Another Spanish Benfica cyclist, Melcior Mauri, won the Volta ao Algarve. In 2007, the newly created Benfica cycling team around superstar Jos√© Azevedo ended the 2007‚Äì2008 UCI Europe Tour in 27th with 622 points., Teams Results In 2008, Rub√©n Plaza won the Vuelta a Valencia.

Lead management facilitates a business's connection between its outgoing consumer advertising and the responses to that advertising. These processes are designed for business-to- business and direct-to-consumer strategies. Lead management is in many cases a precursor to sales management, customer relationship management and customer experience management. This critical connectivity facilitates business profitability through the acquisition of new customers, selling to existing customers, and creating a market brand. This process has also accurately been referred to as customer acquisition management. The general principles of lead management create an ordered structure for managing volumes of business inquiries, frequently termed leads. The process creates an architecture for organization of data, distributed across the various stages of a sales process, and across a distributed sales force. With the advent of the Internet and other information systems technologies, this process has rapidly become technology-centric, as businesses practising lead management techniques have shifted much of the prior manual workload to automation systems, though personal interaction with lead inquiries is still vital to success. Along with its other related business practices ‚Äì marketing, brand development, advertising, and sales ‚Äì the goal of an effective lead management initiative is to generate new business revenue, increase visibility, and improve the general attitudes of potential clients and the public at large for future business development. While simple in scope, lead (or inquiry) flow process can become complex as clients, prospective clients, and sales professionals interact. Interactions and subsequent actions create a variety of potential outcomes, both productive and counter-productive to business development. This ever-increasing number of scenarios creates functional disconnects, in other words, critical opportunities to mishandle an inquiry that reduces or destroys its potential value. Appropriate management of these scenarios is the function of lead management and is the basis of software such as marketing automation. Lead Management Architecture Lead Generation Generating a lead, or lead generation can relate to myriad marketing technologies and methodologies. Regardless of how it is achieved, however, from an architectural perspective lead generation is simply the ability to attract the interest of a consumer and capture enough data to validate and prioritize their interest, then contact them. Lead acquisition and distribution Lead acquisition is the first, and possibly the most critical potential disconnect in the lead management process. With billions being spent on advertising expenditures, in many cases the value of those expenditures is reduced because relevant information from responses is not collected or distributed. The value of this process is tightly linked to a variety of consumer response theories that highlight the relevance and responsiveness of the customer experience as being key ingredients in turning potential customers into actual customers. Once acquired, the speed, accuracy, and relevance of response can greatly influence a potential consumer's decision to buy, or not buy, a product or service. One relevant example of this process is the use of the Internet, online marketing, and Web analytics for high-level lead generation. A consumer generally uses the Internet and makes Internet inquiries for products and services out of a desire for convenience and efficiency of their time. Consequently, they expect a timely, relevant response to inquiries made. If the acquisition and distribution of data collected during their inquiry is not effective, the consumer experience will be negative. No response, poor response, too-early or too late response equals negative impact on consumer attitudes and behavior. For this particular medium, the lead acquisition architecture generally consists of a Web form to collect consumer data, a database to temporarily or persistently store that information for subsequent distribution, and a software application to distribute the data at appropriate levels. The distribution architecture will vary widely depending upon the objective of the lead generation. Generation for the purpose of selling the inquiry itself to another organization would typically include a methodology for selecting one or more buyers and then transmitting the lead via a variety of potential means, like: XML, name-value pairs, fax, email, telephone. In the case of leads generated for an organization's own use it may simply consist of a web page to render the contents of the lead database or a simple email action from the Web form itself. Marketing & Sales Process Operations Once the lead information is collected and distributed, it is then transferred to a marketing and/or sales management department, who will continue to implement lead management practices in pursuit of completion of a sale. Established lead management practices should provide the needed connectivity and accountability between those two operational units, and when managed properly, enhances the effectiveness of both operations. The architectural relationship is much akin to the order carousel in a short order diner. This carousel is the communication and accountability between the waiter and the cook. Without this simple coordination orders would be lost, prepared incorrectly, or prepared in random order missing the expectations of the customer. For management teams with a solid foundation in lead management principles, the process should create increased efficiency and accountability between marketing and sales activities. As stated previously, the increasing technological foundation of lead and sales management practices provides a number of \\"closed loop\\" data circuits, tracking the overall effectiveness of everything from lead generation, to prioritization, to distribution, to final disposition, and then back again to re-calibrate the process. For marketing, this portion of the architecture primarily manages the analytics of the lead generation, distribution, and disposition. For sales, the architecture provides a fast, accurate method of distribution, in addition to improved management and accountability processes for sales activity. Communications The central hub of the lead management process once the prior architectures are in place is communication. Effective lead management principles requires intensive and accurate high-level communication, both internally within organizations, and externally to the lead inquiries. Communications functions should include intelligent sourcing of inquiry information, and provide appropriate vehicles for overt contacting methods such as phone, email, or other communication forms. In addition to overt communication methods, technologies now also provide marketing systems the ability to do extensive lead nurturing activities through automation systems, which often include opt-in email listings, automated telephone dialing systems, or hard copy mailing lists to increase visibility, touch on customer need, and increase brand visibility. In many cases, especially where inquiries may not be ready to work with businesses immediately, it is crucial to maintain ongoing nurturing communications that cultivate a lead into future sales, and effective lead management practices include these methods. Analytics The analytics architecture is the last, and once the other architectures are in place, the most critical piece of an effective lead management system. This portion of the architecture allows for the dynamic review and analysis of lead actions, marketing channels, and sales performance. Software of this type is called marketing attribution. For many organizations, being a pipeline marketing organization that optimizes for post lead metrics such as revenue can be vital in decision making that improve production, return on investment, and the overall performance and cost benefits of their marketing and sales strategies. Optimizing Lead Management As larger vendors work with partner organizations such as distributors, resellers, brokers and other channel partners, those vendors often distribute leads to their respective partners to provide a local contact to those prospects and also 'feed' partners with new business opportunities. Today there are two major methods for distributing sales leads to partners: Push or Pull. Push The push method sends leads to specific partners assuming that those partners will follow up and work on those leads. The challenge with 'push' is the fact that often the local field sales staff may not be able to engage immediately for various reasons such as they are on vacation. Pull The pull method was created to motivate sales staff to 'pull' leads from an online available system, thereby assigning them to a particular person as they are engaged. Technical Functionality Lead Acquisition The lead acquisition functionality should allow for the simple and efficient acquisition of lead data into the lead management system. The acquisition functions must be able to support a variety of marketing channels and methods of capturing data. Some examples include: * Electronic Data Transfer This acquisition function may include the transfer of discrete lead data via technologies like name-value pairs, XML, RSS, HTTP POST, and FTP. These technologies can be used in conjunction with an organization's own website or third party lead provider. Often lead providers will deliver leads via a standard email. These leads can be electronically captured by parsing the email and then submitting the lead using one of the methods described above. * Batch Imports This acquisition function may include imports of multiple leads' data via technologies like Microsoft Excel, CSV, or other formatted batch data values. These technologies can be used to acquire leads that have been stored in other systems, assembled from lists, or other volume sources. * Quick Apply Web Forms This acquisition function may include Web landing pages or sales interfaces. This technology can be used to acquire discrete lead data via manual input into an application-type form. Lead Filtering and Assessment Every business today has to keep track of all inquiries and sales leads that are generated. There are numerous sources from where different leads are generated. For various organizations it‚Äôs very difficult to manage inquiry and tracking of those leads and most importantly to know the conversion from the source of various sales leads. A good inquiry management system saves a lot of time and efforts and in turn saves a lot of man hours for a company. Most lead management systems will have some intelligent methodology for filtering and assessing lead data into useful categorizations. There are myriad ways to accomplish this process and some of them may be specific to industries. The following is a suggested list of possible functions: * Data verification (i.e., telephone numbers, zip codes, address scrubbing) * Device Intelligence (i.e., device fingerprint, botnet proxy detection, true geo location, true ip detection) * Lead nurturing * Fraud screening * Data appending (e.g., appending third-party data such as credit, preferences, purchase history) * Grading/Lead Scoring * Prioritization References ;Sources *Lead Generation for the Complex Sale () *Managing Sales Leads: How To Turn Every Prospect Into A Customer () *Managing Sales Leads: Turning Cold Prospects Into Hot Customers () () *Sales & Marketing 365 () *Shopper, Buyer, and Consumer Behavior () *Sales Lead Management Association ;Notes Category:Sales Category:Customer relationship management Category:Personal selling ","title":"Lead management"},{"id":"7233449","text":"The 1912 Victorian Football League season was the 16th season of the elite Australian rules football competition.

(For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football). Awards * The 1912 VFL Premiership team was Essendon. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Harry Brereton of Melbourne with 56 goals. * University took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1912. Notable events * On 27 April 1912, the first issue of the VFL's Football Record is published. * For the first time, all VFL players wear a number on the back of their guernsey. The number designates the player himself, rather than his position and, in most cases, he plays his entire career with the same number on his back (however, if he changed clubs, his number would also alter). * University's Round 3 victory over Richmond turns out to be the last win in the club's history.

The State School was created by an act of the Minnesota legislature in 1885 as an effort to provide safe, transitional housing for the state's orphaned, abandoned, and abused children. The goal was to remove at-risk children from harmful situations and place them in the State School, where they would reside in a home-like setting, receive an education, and eventually be placed with suitable farm families. Over 60 years of operation, the State School was home to a total of 10,635 children. The facility closed in 1945 as adoption and foster care came to be preferred over institutionalization. The State School complex became the Owatonna State School (OSS) for children with developmental disabilities. The OSS closed in 1970. After four years of vacancy, the campus was purchased by the city of Owatonna to serve as its new seat of government. The complex was renamed West Hills. The Minnesota State Public School Orphanage Museum on the grounds interprets the history of the site. The main Administration Building of the State School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The larger complex of 19 surviving buildings, including the previously listed Administration Building, were added to the National Register as a historic district in 2010. History The Minnesota State Public School for Dependent and Neglected Children was created by an act of the 1885 State Legislature, which was championed by Governor Lucius F. Hubbard and Reverend Hastings H. Hart, Secretary of the Minnesota Board of Corrections and Charities. Before this facility was created, orphaned, dependent, abused, and neglected children in Minnesota were placed in country poor farms with adult derelicts, petty criminals, alcoholics, and the mentally ill. This school was created to be a haven where these children could be saved from a life of poverty or crime, and transformed into productive members of society. Minnesota chose to follow the cottage system developed by the Michigan State Public School in Coldwater, Michigan, which was created as an alternative to the linear orphanage system. The cottage plan was to offer the children a family-like group atmosphere with about 20-25 to a cottage. Each cottage was managed by a matron who lived in the cottage full-time. Eventually, there were 16 cottages on the grounds in Owatonna. By the 1930s, up to 500 children were housed at the State School at any time. Children were constantly being placed out, and new and unfamiliar children being placed in. These were orphaned, dependent, neglected and abused Minnesota children who had been made wards of the state by the probate courts. The State School was to be a temporary home, preparing the children for adoption or placement in new, \\"good\\" homes. While the intent was to keep the children only for a few months, some stayed on for years and suffered the effects of institutionalization. Self-sufficient institution The State School campus in 1910 The State School was often referred to as the \\"city on the hill\\" or as a \\"city within a city.\\" At the height of its existence in the 1930s, the school housed 500 children in 16 cottages. Other buildings included a nursery, hospital, school, gymnasium, laundry, and residences for employees and the superintendent. The school had its own power plant, greenhouse, ice house, cemetery, and complete farm with cows, horses, swine, and chickens, making it close to being self-sufficient. The State School had electricity before the City of Owatonna did. Many crafts were conducted right on campus. In a normal day a person could visit a functional bakery, cobbler shop, laundry, barber shop, sewing rooms, butcher shop, and carpenter shop. Originally housed on 160 acres, the grounds grew to 329 acres by 1937, with 42 acres for campus and 287 acres for cultivation to feed all the livestock, and fruit/vegetables for its inhabitants. In addition to grains, the State School farm produced potatoes, carrots, beans, squash, strawberries, raspberries, apples, etc. The wards were expected to act as the primary labor force, especially during harvest. Many foods were canned and stored for use in winter. A greenhouse was used to start the vegetables, fruits, and flowers each spring and two root cellars stored the harvested crops over the winter months. The iconic Main Building served as the school nerve center. It was built in five phases, beginning in 1886 at a cost of $50,000 appropriated by the Minnesota legislature. Architect Warren Barnes Dunnell designed the first three sections. The Main Building was completed in 1887 and, when there was funding, the north and south wings were added in 1889. It came to house the library, chapel, offices, employee and children's dining rooms, industrial departments, and living quarters for small boys and employees. Closing of the State School By 1945, state public welfare officials came to believe that early foster care or adoption was preferable to institutionalization, so admissions ceased. In 1947, the Minnesota State Public School for Dependent and Neglected Children (SPS) was officially abolished and all its lands, buildings, property, and funds were transferred to the newly established Owatonna State School (OSS), which provided academic and vocational training for individuals with developmental disabilities. The OSS closed in 1970. After standing empty for four years, the City of Owatonna purchased the campus area from the State of Minnesota in 1974 to house administrative offices and related facilities. Minnesota State Public School Orphanage Museum Minnesota State Public School Orphanage Museum, seen from the southwest in 2017 The Minnesota State Public School Orphanage Museum is located on the former State School grounds, which are now owned by the City of Owatonna. Visitors can learn about the history of the school and the children, watch a 1930s film taken of the children, walk through a restored boys' cottage, and stroll the grounds. The campus is one of the most intact examples of a state cottage school standing in the United States and is significant on a national level. The original school building, now known as Merrill Hall, contains a mural, Mother Goose, created by the WPA artist Miriam Ibling. The museum exists in large part because a former State Schooler, named Harvey Ronglien, believed that the memory of the children who lived at the State School and the way they were treated should not be forgotten. Harvey spent 11 years at the State School, arriving when he was just 5 years old in 1932. After retiring from a career as a lineman (technician) with Owatonna Public Utilities (OPU), Harvey and his wife Maxine began their effort to remember the children. In 1992, the first step was taken to get permission from the Owatonna City Council to have a statue representing the \\"State School Kids\\" erected in front of the former Main Building, which was used as the City Administration Building. For more than twenty years, the Rongliens' work expanded to create the museum that exists today. In 2011, Maxine Ronglien was honored with an Advocacy Award by the Preservation Alliance of Minnesota.\\"Maxine Ronglien, Owatonna\\" Preservation Alliance of Minnesota Over the years, the Rongliens also gave a presentation to hundreds of group tours and school groups about Harvey Ronglien's experiences at the State School, the effects of institutional living, and the importance of family. The museum became a non- profit 501(c)3 organization in 1999, and operates with a twelve-person board of directors. Main Museum The primary museum is located in the central hall of the Owatonna City Administration Building. This u-shaped hall hosts display cabinets with materials both sorted chronologically and by subject. Visitors may also watch two videos and see photos and artifacts that tell the stories of the children who lived this history. Cottage 11 Cottage 11 in 2017 Constructed in 1923 by architect Clarence H. Johnston, Sr., Cottage 11 was originally designed to house 25 boys, but eventually housed 30-35 boys from ages 6‚Äì13. In 2009, the restored cottage opened for tourists. Highlights include the original terrazzo flooring, bathroom fixtures and woodwork; a gift shop; and the opportunity to walk through an original cottage from the orphanage era and learn the story of the boys who lived there. The restoration process included removing walls, sanding floors, scraping paint, adding new furnaces and air-conditioning units, construction projects, painting, finishing floors, finding artifacts, and installing audio systems. Museum founder, Harvey Ronglien, lived in Cottage 11 for eight years and tells his story in the book A Boy from C-11, Case #9164. Children's Cemetery Children's Cemetery In all, 198 State School children have been buried in the Children's Cemetery located in the southwest corner of the campus. The cemetery is open for public viewing, weather permitting. It has been restored by the Museum Board and local friends. The first 47 children were buried with a tombstone. However, the practice was then changed. The next 151 children who died were buried simply with their identification number etched on a slab of cement. Through a community effort, each grave now has a named marker. A memorial boardwalk also leads to the cemetery. Outdoor Audio Stations An outdoor audio station Guests may explore the campus by following the six- station Outdoor Audio Tour. The tour stations lead to historic sites, such as the restored Boys' Cottage 11, the Children's Cemetery, Root Cellar, Flag Pole Plaza, Rock Garden, and 1898 School Monument. The audio stations are active from May 1 through November 1. The Children Remember documentary The Children Remember is an 87-minute film that brings together a revealing and stirring collection of oral history spoken by thirteen candid survivors of life in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s at the Minnesota State School for Dependent and Neglected Children.

Notable events * The VFL formed an independent tribunal to hear charges against players. * Prior to Melbourne's Round 4 match against Fitzroy, six of the club's players went on strike to protest the club committee's failure to support a player charged by police after striking a Carlton player in Round 3. After Melbourne President Dr. William C. McClelland entered the club rooms and personally informed the players they would be expelled from the club if they did not take the field, the players called off their strike. * In the round 14 match against Fitzroy, controversy erupted after VFL Stewards incorrectly reported Essendon follower Bill Walker. * University Football Club's full-forward Roy Park, who stood only 5\\"5\\" (165 cm), was selected as the Victorian Interstate team's full- forward, and kicked 53 of University's 115 goals for the season.

The Fender Stratocaster was designed by Leo Fender and Freddie Tavares with involvement from musicians Rex Gallion and Bill Carson in the early 1950s, and since its commercial introduction in 1954 has become widely used among popular artists in rock, blues, and other genres. The Squier Stratocaster is produced by Fender as a more affordable alternative to the Fender-branded version. Due to the immense popularity of this model, musicians are listed here only if their use of this instrument was especially significant -- that is, they are players who: *have long careers and a history of Stratocaster use. *have a particular guitar that was unique or of historical importance. *have contributed significantly to the popularization of the instrument through their use of it. A‚ÄìE Jeff Beck in Amsterdam, 1979. Ritchie Blackmore in 1977. Eric Clapton in a Switzerland concert on June 19, 1977. *Randy Bachman (born 1943), a founding member of both The Guess Who and Bachman‚ÄìTurner Overdrive (BTO) who recently fronted the project \\"Randy Bachman's Jazz Thing.\\" After a visit to a chiropractor, Bachman was persuaded to switch from a Gibson Les Paul to a lighter Stratocaster. He modified the pickups on his first Strat, putting a Gibson pickup at the neck and a Telecaster pickup at the bridge, while leaving the Stratocaster pickup in the middle.Goodin, Jesse Kinos. \\"Randy Bachman: You can never have just one.\\" Article in the Edmonton Journal on September 24, 2012. Randy favored Stratocasters and custom Strat- style guitars throughout his years with BTO. Though his bands are mostly known for their simplistic rock-radio anthems, Bachman's soloing often revealed complex melodies and jazz-inflected phrasing. Among his Stratocasters used are a '63 standard and a '71 four-bolt hardtail. He has listed guitar influences as varied as Lenny Breau, Leslie West, Wes Montgomery and Hank Marvin. *Jeff Beck (born 1944), a Grammy award-winning rock guitarist, Beck is known for playing for various bands such as the Yardbirds and his own group The Jeff Beck Group. Beck primarily plays a Stratocaster and also has a signature Strat. He is noted for his innovative use of the Stratocaster's vibrato system. Up to 1975 Beck had been, primarily, a Les Paul player. In an interview with Jas Obrecht about switching to the Stratocaster Beck stated \\"With a Les Paul you just wind up sounding like someone else. With the Strat I finally sound like me.\\"Ferguson, Jim (editor): The Guitar Player Book - Revised Third Edition, 1983. GPI Publications. . * Adrian Belew (born 1949), is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer. He is perhaps best known for his work as a member of the progressive rock group King Crimson. He has also worked extensively as a session and touring musician, most famously with Talking Heads, David Bowie, Frank Zappa, and Nine Inch Nails. During much of his career, Belew made extensive use of a weathered-looking Stratocaster, later memorialized in song as \\"The Battered Strat.\\" This guitar was relic'ed by Seymour Duncan. * Ritchie Blackmore (born 1945), a founding member of both Deep Purple and Rainbow, currently a member of the band Blackmore's Night. After starting his career using various Hofner and Gibson guitars, Blackmore switched to a Stratocaster in the late 1960s after seeing Jimi Hendrix perform with one. Blackmore's Stratocasters are modified; the middle pickup is lowered and not used (sometimes disconnected completely) and his Stratocaster fingerboards are all scalloped from the 10th fret up. Through the early/mid 1970s Blackmore was notorious for onstage abuse of his guitars, sometimes destroying them completely. By the late 1970s the guitarist had found a Stratocaster model he was content with and it has remained his main stage and studio guitar up until it had to be refretted. * Tommy Bolin (1951‚Äì1976), a versatile guitarist who is noted for his influence in genres ranging from acoustic blues to hard rock and jazz fusion. He was the lead guitarist for Zephyr, James Gang and Deep Purple. He also had a successful solo career, and collaborated with artists like Billy Cobham and The Good Rats. Bolin played by ear and was known for his improvisational skill. His primary guitar was a stock 1963 Stratocaster. WP2016 JoeBonamassa FFM *Joe Bonamassa When he was 12 years old, Bonamassa played a crimson 1972 Fender Stratocaster. Joe Bonamassa is known for his extensive collection of vintage amplifiers and guitars. In 2018, Bonamassa has said that he has more than 1000 guitars and amplifiers. * Bill Carson (1926-2007), a country and western guitarist credited by Fender as \\"the man for whom the Stratocaster was designed.\\" * Eric Clapton (born 1945), a Grammy-award-winning guitarist who originally played Gibson guitars but has been a Stratocaster enthusiast since 1967. Clapton bought his first Stratocaster that year while a member of Cream, Brownie, which was later used on \\"Layla\\". Blackie, a composite of three different guitars, went into service in 1970 and was regularly played until its retirement in 1985. It was sold at charity auction for $959,500 in 2004. In 1988, Fender introduced the Eric Clapton Stratocaster, the first model in their Signature series. Clapton has been a long-standing client of the Fender Custom Shop. * Kurt Cobain, Lead singer of ground breaking alternative rock band Nirvana. Cobain used many different solid bodied Fender guitars including the Stratocaster. * Ry Cooder (born 1947), a guitarist, singer and composer who is well known for his interest in American folk music, his collaborations with other notable musicians, and his work on many film soundtracks. Cooder's bottleneck slide guitar playing, heard on such works as the soundtrack to the 1984 film Paris, Texas, influenced other guitarists such as Bonnie Raitt and Chris Rea and contributed to the popularity of the Stratocaster as a slide guitar. He uses a 60s Stratocaster for such playing. * Robert Cray (born 1953), a long-time blues guitarist and singer, Cray plays a '64 Strat and had his own Signature model made in 1990. The signature model, manufactured by the Fender Custom Shop, combines aspects of Cray's '59 Strat and the '64, omits the standard Stratocaster whammy bar, and includes custom pickups. * Dick Dale (1937-2019), one of the first owners of a Stratocaster; his was given to him personally by Leo Fender in 1955. Considered the pioneer of surf rock. He has been revolutionary in experimenting with the sound of the guitar by using heavy reverb and a unique playing style. * The Edge (born 1961), lead guitarist of U2, known for his melodic playing and use of delay, has used the Stratocaster as one of his main guitars throughout his career. F‚ÄìJ John Frusciante in 2006. Rory Gallagher in 1987 David Gilmour in 2006. Buddy Guy in 1992. Jimi Hendrix in 1967. * John Frusciante (born March 5, 1970), the current guitarist of Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante owns many pre-70's Stratocasters (most notably his 1962 Strat), and is most known for using them on all the Red Hot Chili Peppers' albums he was involved with, including Stadium Arcadium, By The Way, and Californication,johnfrusciante.com \\"Guitars: [...] '55 Fender Strat, '62 Fender Strat, and earlier in his career on Mother's Milk,johnfrusciante.com \\"A Fender Strat (year & Model type unknown)\\" and Blood Sugar Sex Magik,johnfrusciante.com \\"known to have been used: Various Fender Stratocasters\\" * Rory Gallagher (1948‚Äì1995), an Irish blues rock guitarist, often credited as one of the most influential Irish rock and blues guitarists of all time. Gallagher is well known for his worn 1961 sunburst Stratocaster. He described his battered Stratocaster as \\"a part of my psychic makeup\\". \\"B.B. King has owned over 100 Lucilles, but I only own one Strat, and it hasn't got a name\\". Gallagher's Stratocaster has also been reproduced by the Fender Custom shop, to the exact specs of the original one. * Lowell George (April 13, 1945 ‚Äì June 29, 1979), was an American songwriter, multi- instrumentalist, and producer, who was the primary guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter for the rock band Little Feat. Lowell was proficient on slide guitar employing his trademark tone which he achieved through use of compression and open tunings helping to define his soulful sound as well as giving him the means to play his extended melodic lines. Additionally, he used to swap the bridge pickups of his Stratocasters for Telecaster bridge pickups. * David Gilmour (born 1946), as a solo artist and guitar player for Pink Floyd, Gilmour is credited for his unique, blues-based compositional approach and expressive soloing. Author Tony Bacon stated \\"his solo on 'Comfortably Numb' remains for many a definitive Strat moment.\\" Gilmour's guitar of choice is a custom modified Fender Stratocaster. He is the owner of Strat #0001, which was manufactured in 1954 but was not the first Stratocaster made since Fender does not use sequential serial numbers. Gilmour is considered to be one of the more influential Stratocaster players since the instrument's invention. David's signature black Stratocaster, used frequently in 1970s concerts and on the blockbuster albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall, is featured in a recent book by his long-time guitar tech Phil Taylor: Pink Floyd, The Black Strat‚ÄîA History of David Gilmour's Black Stratocaster.Guitar World, Vol. 29, No. 7 (July, 2008), p. 46. The \\"Black Strat\\" was retired in the 1980s in favour of a Candy Apple Red American Vintage Stratocaster fitted with EMG noiseless single-coil pickups as seen on the Delicate Sound of Thunder and Pulse tours. The Black Strat was briefly used on the documentary Classic Albums: Dark Side of the Moon before being put on display at the Hard Rock Cafe in Miami, Florida. It was finally brought out of retirement by David in 2005 and fitted with a new Charvel neck for the Pink Floyd reunion at the Live 8 concert. David subsequently used it again for his \\"On An Island\\" tour in 2006 and when he played \\"Comfortably Numb\\" with Roger Waters on his tour of \\"The Wall\\" on May 12, 2011 in London. * Buddy Guy (born 1936), an American blues guitarist and singer, Guy is well known for playing the Stratocaster throughout his long career. He is also known for his wild showmanship; Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan both pointed to Guy as an influence on both their playing and their stage shows. Fender has issued several different variations (black with white polka dots, red with white polkadots, white with black polkadots, a two-color sunburst and a honey-blonde finish) of a Buddy Guy Signature Stratocaster since the early 1990s; the guitars generally have gold Lace Sensor pickups and modified circuitry. * George Harrison (1943‚Äì2001), lead guitarist for the Beatles, Harrison got his first Stratocaster in 1965 and used it for the recording of the Rubber Soul album. Fender's Don Randall met with the Beatles to try and convince them to use more Fender products. The band bought several different instruments including Harrison's famous rosewood Telecaster. Harrison hand-painted his original Stratocaster with a psychedelic paint job that included the word \\"Bebopalula\\" painted above the pickguard and the guitar's nickname, \\"Rocky\\", painted on the headstock. He can be seen playing Rocky in the Magical Mystery Tour film as well as The Concert for Bangla Desh. * Eddie Hazel (April 10, 1950 ‚Äì December 23, 1992), was a guitarist in early funk music in the United States who played lead guitar with Parliament-Funkadelic. Hazel was a posthumous inductee of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, inducted in 1997 with fifteen other members of Parliament-Funkadelic. The guitar he used was a Fender Stratocaster. * Jimi Hendrix (1942‚Äì1970), known for developing blues in a modern context, Hendrix's main stage guitar through most of his short career was a Fender Stratocaster. In 1990, the white Stratocaster used by Hendrix at the 1969 Woodstock Festival sold in a Sotheby's auction for $270,000, a record price at the time. Although Hendrix played left-handed, he did not normally use a custom left-handed Stratocaster. Instead, he is noted for playing a conventional right-handed Stratocaster flipped upside down because he preferred to use the controls in that position. Like Buddy Holly, Hendrix was responsible for a large increase in the Stratocaster's popularity, especially in his favorite finish, white. In reference to his famed on-stage Stratocaster burning, Hendrix is quoted as saying, \\"The time I burned my guitar it was like a sacrifice. You sacrifice the things you love. I love my guitar.\\" In 1997 Fender produced a limited edition Hendrix tribute model Stratocaster.Seven Fender Stratocaster Models That Pay Tribute to Jimi Hendrix November 13, 2004 - Modern Guitar Magazine * Buddy Holly (1936‚Äì1959), identified as \\"the first Strat hero.\\" A statue of Holly in his home town of Lubbock, Texas, portrays him playing his Stratocaster, and the guitar is also engraved on his tombstone. Although the initial release of the Stratocaster came in 1954, the guitar did not begin to achieve popularity until Holly appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1957 playing a maple-neck Strat. Holly was also pictured on the cover of The Crickets' 1957 album The \\"Chirping\\" Crickets with a sunburst Stratocaster, inspiring The Shadows' Hank Marvin to adopt the guitar. * Ernie Isley (born March 7, 1952), member of the American musical ensemble The Isley Brothers has developed three custom Zeal Stratocasters from Fender Custom Shop, using his personal design. * Eric Johnson (born 1954), a Grammy-award- winning guitarist from Austin, Texas, Johnson has played Stratocasters regularly during his career and has played many different types of music.

K-P Mark Knopfler in a Hamburg concert on May 28, 2006 *Ed King (1949-2018) is known for his work with the southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd from 1972 to 1975. He used a 1959 model with a black refinish and tortoise pickguard for most recordings and live performances at that time, and also a 1973 model which he used when writing the hit \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\". *Mark Knopfler (born 1949), known for his work with British rock band Dire Straits. Knopfler is known for his very particular and unique fingerstyle playing. The song ‚ÄúSultans of Swing‚Äú, from the first album of Dire Straits, in 1978, was a huge hit that showed the characteristic tone and technique displayed on Knopfler's red Stratocaster. He used the Fender Stratocaster throughout his entire career, in Dire Straits (especially since 1978 and 1982) and solo career, him being a great Fender Stratocaster enthusiast. Fender now produces his Signature Stratocaster. * Greg Koch (born 1966) Known for his incendiary guitar work. Koch was a Fender clinician and ambassador. He played the Stratocaster for many years and even recorded an album called \\"Strat's Got Your Tongue\\" (2012) He is known for his love of Fender guitars. * Bruce Kulick (born 1953), long-time member and lead guitarist of KISS and Grand Funk Railroad. Kulick stated on his personal website that he used a Fender Powerstrat to add a harmony solo line to his song, \\"What Love's All About.\\" He wrote, [T]his solo is sweet. I love when there is a melody you can sing along to for a solo section. I used a red Fender Powerstrat that I used to play live with Grand Funk a few years back. Made in Mexico but it rocks.\\" Kulick used a 1989 yellow Fender Strat Plus, during the recording of the 1996 KISS _Revenge_ album, including for the hit single, \\"God Gave Rock 'n Roll to You II.\\" _Revenge_ reached the Top 20 in several countries. * Michael Landau (born 1958), friend of Steve Lukather and prolific session guitarist of the 1980s, has used many Stratocasters in his career and is working with Fender as of 2016 to create a Michael Landau Signature Stratocaster.\\"Fender Custom Shop Announces Michael Landau Signature\\". www.iguitarmag.com.

Lennon also used the guitar during the Sgt. Pepper sessions. A different Strat was used on the Imagine album. John Lennon acquired a candy apple red \\"Strat\\" with 22 carat gold electroplated brass hardware around 1980. A photo of him playing this guitar in bed one morning in late 1980, shortly before his death, was used an inner sleeve of the album The John Lennon Collection.lennon7 * Alex Lifeson (b. 1953), the Guitarist for Rush since 1968, first recorded with a black Stratocaster on the Rush 1977 album A Farewell to Kings. In 1979, he modified the '77 Strat with a '57 classic humbucker, a Floyd Rose tremolo unit (first ever made), a Gibson toggle switch on the lower bout, and rewired with master volume/tone. He used that same guitar for the leads and direct recording for 1979's \\"Permanent Waves.\\" In late 1980, Alex Lifeson acquired two more Strats in red and white, modifying them exactly the same as the former. * Yngwie Malmsteen (b. 1963), known for his work in the neo-classical metal genre. Influenced by an array of musicians, Malmsteen is regarded as highly influential for his use of heavy classical-style chord progressions, interesting phrases and arpeggio sweeps. He is known for playing Stratocasters with scalloped fretboards. * Hank Marvin (b. 1941), the lead guitarist of The Shadows, Marvin is reputed to be the owner of the first Fender Stratocaster in the UK (given to him by Cliff Richard). The guitar was finished in a shade of Fiesta Red, sometimes referred to as 'Salmon Pink'. This guitar, with its tremolo arm, contributed to the Shadows' distinctive sound. Guitarists such as David Gilmour and Mark Knopfler credit Marvin and The Shadows, who had \\"the first Strat that came to England\\", with influencing their own decisions to buy Stratocasters. * John Mayer (b. 1977), a Grammy-award-winning singer/songwriter has enjoyed recent popularity. Mayer has played Stratocasters throughout his career and has had a Fender Artist Series Stratocaster made in both standard and limited edition form.

Robertson's main guitar choice was a Stratocaster, despite using a Telecaster early in his career. For The Last Waltz Robertson had a Stratocaster bronzed especially for his use in the film. More recently Robertson made a very rare live appearance at Eric Clapton's 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival using a Stratocaster. * Kenny Wayne Shepherd (born 1977 Kenneth Wayne Brobst), lead guitarist and lead/backup vocalist for The Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band. Born in Shreveport, Louisiana, Kenny started his playing career at age 16, while attending Caddo Magnet High School, and has performed internationally with many of the great blues legends. * Richard Thompson (born 1949), an English musician best known for his finger-style guitar playing and songwriting, was a founding member of Fairport Convention before becoming a solo artist. For many years Thompson played a '59 Sunburst Stratocaster, with a maple '55 neck. That guitar is currently unserviceable and Thompson now uses a '64 sunburst Stratocaster with a rosewood fingerboard. * Pete Townshend (born 1945), the guitarist for The Who, used a Stratocaster during the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 and has exclusively used a modified version of the Eric Clapton Signature Stratocaster since 1989. * Robin Trower (born 1945), a British rock guitarist known for his work in the band Procol Harum and his successful solo career, has his own Signature Stratocaster made by Fender. \\"The sight of him onstage with his signature Stratocaster is as characteristic to his fans as his classic songs.\\" Ike Turner in 1997. * Ike Turner (1931-2007), an American guitarist, musician, songwriter and record producer known for his work with the Ike & Tina Turner Revue and the Kings of Rhythm.

Unaware that the guitar's tremolo arm could be used to subtle effect, Turner used it to play screaming, swooping and diving solos. Turner explained his technique by saying: \\"I thought it was to make the guitar scream‚Äîpeople got so excited when I used that thing.\\" Turner was also known to play Telecasters and Jaguars.

He was best known for his participation in concerts and recordings by groups led by his older brother, saxophonist Albert Ayler. An obituary in The Wire praised his \\"buzzing, declamatory trumpet playing, which was part Holy Roller primitive, part avant garde firebrand\\". Biography Ayler was born in born in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and grew up in Shaker Heights, graduating from John Adams High School. He started out playing alto saxophone; however, according to Val Wilmer, he \\"became frustrated when he could not achieve the mobility and sound that had come so easily to his brother. At one point he even put a tenor reed into his alto in an attempt to 'sound like Coltrane'.\\" At the urging of his brother, who was in the process of establishing himself musically, and who was about to leave for a European tour, he switched to trumpet, and began practicing up to nine hours a day, working with his friend and distant relative Charles Tyler, and attending the Cleveland Institute of Music. When Albert returned to the United States, he formed a new band, which included both his brother and Charles Tyler, along with bassist Lewis Worrell and drummer Sunny Murray. Donald went on to tour and record with the group from 1965-1968, participating in the recording of Bells, Spirits Rejoice, Albert Ayler in Greenwich Village, Love Cry, and several other albums, and also worked with Paul Bley and Elvin Jones. Val Wilmer described the band's sound: \\"Don Ayler's skittery, up-tempo streaking, [Albert] Ayler's nagging at an idea like a dog worrying a bone, Murray's shivering cymbal-work and the banshee wail he kept up throughout the performance. The intense, braying ensembles and raggedy bugle-calls and marches - the younger Ayler's idea... became standard practice for any ensemble of the period that considered itself hip. To Ayler... the musicians were playing in a 'spiritual dimension'.\\" In a 1966 interview with Nat Hentoff, when asked how he would advise people to listen to their music, Donald stated the following: \\"One way not to [listen to it] is to focus on the notes and stuff like that. Instead, try to move your imagination toward the sound. It's a matter of following the sound... Follow the sound, the pitches, the colours. You have to watch them move.\\" Other notable performances included a concert with John Coltrane at Lincoln Center on February 19, 1966, featuring an expanded group that included Albert and Donald, Pharoah Sanders, Carlos Ward, Alice Coltrane, Jimmy Garrison, Rashied Ali, and J. C. Moses. Following Coltrane's death on July 17, 1967, the Ayler quartet, now featuring the Ayler brothers plus bassist Richard Davis and drummer Milford Graves, played at his funeral on July 21. They performed three pieces including Donald's Our Prayer. Val Wilmer stated that, at the funeral service, \\"Donald Ayler stood on a balcony beside his saxophonist brother and played a spine-chilling lament. Wildly flagging his trumpet valves and swaying backwards and forwards, he seemed to scream through the instrument.\\" A recording of this performance was released in 2004 on the compilation Holy Ghost. By the late 1960s, Donald began to exhibit signs of mental instability, and had what he called a \\"nervous breakdown,\\" for which Albert apparently blamed himself. In 1968, he departed the band, as \\"Albert's record company was grooming him for the rock market and did not want Donald.\\" Donald managed to start a new band, and in 1969, Albert joined them onstage for a concert. (The Holy Ghost compilation includes recordings of two previously-unreleased Donald Ayler compositions, \\"Prophet John\\" and \\"Judge Ye Not\\", from this concert, which also featured saxophonist Sam Rivers.) However, in late 1970 Albert was found dead in New York, devastating his brother. Donald returned to Cleveland, and did not play music for nearly three years. By the late 1970s, with the help and encouragement of saxophonists Mustafa Abdul Rahim and Al Rollins (who ran a barbershop), Ayler began to play again. In 1981, he performed in Florence, Italy and recorded a three-volume album that also featured Rahim and saxophonist Frank Doblekar. However, \\"he was unable to sustain a career\\", and moved into a managed care facility. He appeared in the 2005 documentary film My Name Is Albert Ayler, where he talked about his and Albert's life, their music and their relationship, and also appeared in archival footage from various years. Ayler suffered a heart attack on October 21, 2007, and died at Northcoast Behavioral Healthcare in Northfield, Ohio. He was survived by his father, and was buried next to his mother in Highland Park Cemetery in Highland Hills, Ohio.

Headquartered in New York City, it has offices in Princeton, New Jersey, and Stamford, Connecticut.  Regional plans  RPA has produced four strategic regional plans for the New York metropolitan region since the 1920s. The chronology of their plans is as follows: # The First Plan in 1929, developed under the leadership of Thomas Adams, provided a guide for the area's road and transportation network. # The Second Plan, published as a series of reports in the 1960s, aimed at restructuring mass transit and reinvigorating deteriorating urban centers. # The Third Plan in 1996, \\"A Region at Risk,\\" recommended improving regional mass transit, increasing protection of open space and maintaining employment in traditional urban centers. # The Fourth Plan in 2017 suggested improving the area's transportation network, making more affordable housing, implementing measures to fight climate change, and restructure the area's public institutions.  Planning philosophy  The RPA program represents a philosophy of planning described by historian Robert Fishman as \\"metropolitanism,\\" associated with the Chicago School of Sociology. It promotes large scale, industrial centers and the concentration of population rather than decentralized development. Its critics point out that this results in windfall real estate profits for downtown interests. Whether this approach to regional planning is efficient, particularly because of the infrastructure and energy required to sustain such concentration, has been questioned by scholars including James Howard Kunstler.  Impact in the Tri- state area  Regional Plan Association's strategic plans have proposed numerous ideas and investments for the New York metropolitan area that have turned into major public works, economic development and open space projects, including: * The location of the George Washington Bridge. * The preservation of the Palisades and the construction of the Palisades Interstate Parkway. * The redevelopment of Governors Island, through the RPA-led coalition Governors Island Alliance. * The establishment of urban national parks like the Gateway National Recreation Area in Jamaica Bay. * The revitalization of the regional centers like Downtown Brooklyn, Newark, and Stamford.

The SCORE race series include the Baja 1000, Baja 500, San Felipe 250, Primm 300, Laughlin Desert Challenge and Las Vegas Terrible's Cup. Fish earned an industrial relations degree at the University of San Francisco. Having first raced in Mexico in 1970, Fish started his entrepreneurial career in desert racing in 1973 when the late Mickey Thompson, founder of SCORE International, recruited him. Fish brought innovation to SCORE, organizing class rules, implementing safety procedures, and transforming the Baja 1000 into one of the most recognized motorsports events in the world today. In 1985 Fish brought unity to the sport when SCORE formed a combined series with Walt Lott and High Desert Racing Association (HDRA).

Israeli Supreme Court decision of 2004  In February 2004, Israel's High Court of Justice Israel Supreme court decisions began hearing petitions from two Israeli human rights organizations, the Hamoked Centre for the Defense of the Individual and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, against the building of the barrier, referring to the distress it will cause to Palestinians in the area. The Israeli High Court of Justice has heard several petitions related to the barrier, sometimes issuing temporary injunctions or setting limits on related Israeli activities. The most important case was a petition brought in February 2004 by Beit Sourik Village Council, and responded to by the Government of Israel and the Commander of the IDF Forces in the West Bank, concerning a 40 km stretch of existing and planned barrier north of Jerusalem. Several other people and organizations also made submissions. After a number of hearings, judgment was made on June 30 The court agreed with both parties that \\"The general point of departure of all parties ‚Äì which is also our point of departure ‚Äì is that Israel holds the area in belligerent occupation (occupatio bellica), \\"and that \\"military administration, headed by the military commander, continues to apply\\" flowing from \\"the principles of the Israeli administrative law\\" and \\"provisions of public international law... established principally in...\\" the Hague Conventions. The court did not rule on \\"[t]he question of the application of the Fourth Geneva Convention\\" because \\"[t]he question is not before us now, since the parties agree that the humanitarian rules of the Fourth Geneva Convention apply to the issue under review.\\" The first claim made by the petitioners was that construction of the barrier was itself illegal. The court ruled that the construction of the barrier for security reasons would be legal even though it would be illegal for political, economic, or social purposes. Since the court accepted the respondent's argument that the part of the barrier under discussion was designed for security purposes, this claim of the petitioners was lost. The petitioners \\"by pointing to the route of the Fence, attempt to prove that the construction of the Fence is not motivated by security considerations, but by political ones\\" argued that if the Fence were primarily motivated by security considerations, it would be constructed on the Green Line. The court rejected their claims, stating: \\"We cannot accept this argument. The opposite is the case: it is the security perspective ‚Äì and not the political one ‚Äì which must examine a route based on its security merits alone, without regard for the location of the Green Line\\" (Article 30) and noted that \\"The commander of the area detailed his considerations for the choice of the route. He noted the necessity that the Fence pass through territory that topographically controls its surroundings, that, in order to allow surveillance of it, its route be as flat as possible, and that a 'security zone' be established which will delay infiltration into Israel. These are security considerations par excellence. ... We have no reason not to give this testimony less than full weight, and we have no reason not to believe the sincerity of the military commander.\\" (Article 29) The second claim made by the petitioners was that the route of the barrier in the region covered by the petition \\"illegally infringed on the rights of the Palestinian inhabitants\\". In this case the court ruled that the existing and planned route failed the principle of \\"proportionality\\" in both Israeli and international law: that harm caused to an \\"occupied population must be in proportion to the security benefits\\". On the contrary, the court listed ways in which the barrier route \\"injures the local inhabitants in a severe and acute way, while violating their rights under humanitarian international law\\". Accordingly, the court ordered that a 30 km portion of the existing and planned barrier must be rerouted. Although many in the Israeli government and security establishment reacted with anger to the court's ruling, the public reaction of the government was one of satisfaction that the court had considered the barrier legal in principle. Prime Minister Sharon promised that the court's order would be followed.  Israeli Supreme Court decision of 2005  The Israeli Supreme Court (sitting as \\"High Court of Justice\\") in the case of Palestinian petitioners against the Government of Israel determined that the government must find an alternative route to lessen the effect on the rights of the resident Palestinian civilians. The petition to the court was submitted on behalf of five villages that are currently trapped in an enclave created by the existing route of the barrier. The court also ruled that the Advisory Opinion issued by the International Court of Justice in The Hague (which relates to the legal status of the barrier) is not legally binding in Israel. The ruling is the second principled ruling regarding the route of the separation barrier (the first was a ruling on the case of Beit Sourik). The petition which was deliberated on by an expanded panel of nine judges, headed by the President of the Supreme Court, Aharon Barak, was directed against the route of the barrier in the area of the Alfei Menashe enclave, to the south and east of Qalqilyah. The court conducted a review of accounts by the IDF, Israelis architects, Palestinian petitioners, military experts and the International Court of Justice, and ruled that the Government of Israel must find an alternative route to lessen the effect on the rights of the resident Palestinian civilians: > Therefore, we turn the order nisi into an order absolute in the following > way: (respondents) must, within a reasonable period, reconsider the various > alternatives for the separation fence route at Alfei Menashe, while > examining security alternatives which injure the fabric of life of the > residents of the villages of the enclave to a lesser extent. In this > context, the alternative by which the enclave will contain only Alfei > Menashe and a connecting road to Israel, while moving the existing road > connecting Alfei Menashe to Israel to another location in the south of the > enclave, should be examined. The court took upon itself the job of examining the fence section by section, even in places where it has already been completed. The International Court of Justice in The Hague determined that all parts of the barrier not on the green line violates international law because it has been built in occupied territory, the Supreme Court determined that the state is entitled to defend itself and its citizens, even in territories defined as \\"under belligerent occupation\\" according to the 4th Geneva convention - but it cannot build a fence in order to annex land. The court conclusion is different from that of the International Court of Justice. According to the Supreme Court: > The main difference between the two judgements stems primarily from the > difference in the factual basis upon which each court made its decision. > Once again, the simple truth is proven: Facts lie at the foundation of the > law, and the law arises from the facts (ex facto jus oritur). The ICJ drew > the factual basis for its opinion from the Secretary-General's report, his > written statement, the Dugard report, and the Zeigler report. The Supreme > Court drew the facts from the data brought before it by the Palestinian > petitioners on the one hand, and the State on the other. The ruling by the court will affect roughly 40 different petitions which are now pending before the court asking for changes of the barrier route in several additional sections.

History   The 1970s  The Shillito's store, at the mall's east end, was three stories, and included a small restaurant on the third floor. The mall featured a Stewart's department store on its west end. A Yudofsky Furriers store was adjacent to Stewart's (the last store before Stewart's on the south side). The central atrium had a large circular fountain. Oxmoor Center once had a Putters Park on the upper level, along with four cinema screens. Other upper level tenants included Farrell's Ice Cream Parlour, Something to Do (a games store now known as Something2Do, which remained in the mall until moving out in July 2014), Modelle's Custom Tailors (still operating at the lower level) and Athlete's Foot. Lower level tenants included Lerner's (women's clothing), a tobacco shop (with a wooden Indian statue, also still in business), a candle store, a small store selling imported gifts called Far East and Thom McAn Shoes. By the 1980s, there were six cinematic auditoriums in operation at Oxmoor Center. The original two larger auditoriums located on the ground floor level (in the northern half of today's Old Navy) had been joined by four smaller screens located on the second floor of the Oxmoor Mall. Opened on July 7, 1971 on the opposing side of the Watterson Expressway from Mall St. Matthews, the mall originally had Shillito's and Stewart's as its anchor stores. In July 1984 the mall opened a new wing over the Middle Fork of Beargrass Creek to include a Sears store that relocated from 4121 Shelbyville Road. The land the mall was built on is a part of Oxmoor Farm and, due to the land being inherited as a trust which stipulated that it not be sold for a certain number of years, was leased to the mall. The deed restriction has since expired which led to the development of Oxmoor Woods subdivision, but the mall does not own the land it sits upon and remains a leaseholder. 1980s ‚Äì present Shillito's was rebranded as Shillito Rikes in June 1982, Lazarus in March 1986, Lazarus- Macy's in August 2003 and Macy's in March 2005. Stewart's would be rebannered six times between November 1985 and September 2003. The store operated as an L.S. Ayres, Ben Snyder's, Hess's, Jacobson's and Von Maur, its most recent conversion. The Famous Blue Boar Cafeteria, a 1971 charter tenant, closed in 1995 along with Rax. In 1989, a food court was created on the mall's upper level. Then, in November 1998, a major reconstruction on the mall was completed. It included a new octagonal main entrance, vaulted ceilings, escalators and an updated north facade. In October 2001, Galyan's Trading Company opened a new, 2-level store that was built in the front parking area. It became a Dick's Sporting Goods location in October 2004 after Dick's purchased the Galyan's chain. The mall currently has over and includes the anchor stores of Macy's, Von Maur, H&M;, and Dick's Sporting Goods, with one vacant anchor space. The retail hub is currently owned by Brookfield Properties Retail Group. In January 2013, the mall announced a major renovation in which the center mezzanine containing the food court and a few retailers would be torn down and replaced with a new center court. The renovation, which added new seating areas plus a play area near the Sears store, was completed in time for the 2013 Christmas shopping season. On October 6, 2017, Sears announced that the store at the mall would be closing on January 14, 2018. It is rumoured that Topgolf will fill the space.

This film co-stars Colleen Porch as the Demon Hunter's sidekick nun, Sarah Ryan, William Bassett as the overseeing church cardinal, Tania Deighton as the succubus, and Billy Drago as the demon of lust, Asmodeus. Plot The movie begins in the middle of an exorcism, while demon hunter Jake Greyman waits downstairs in case the exorcism does not end well. It's quickly seen that Jake has a dark personality and is more than human. He is solely focused on killing demons regardless of what he must do to accomplish his task. He is a half-demon working for the church. A young nun named Sarah assists in the investigation to find a connection between the possessed girls. Upon arriving at the office of a modeling agency Jake and Sarah find a corpse. While Jake searches through the desk a succubus comes through the dead man to taunt Jake - telling him that he has a different purpose in life and that he should take his rightful place in the world. Jake returns to the Church to inform that the girls were prostitutes and that there was a fourth name on the list. Jake and Sarah track down the fourth name on the list, finding her to live in a very large house and that she married a wealthy man. Sarah believes the girl, Nancy, is safer because of this though Jake does not. The Demon has summoned Nancy and she leaves in a limo to the cemetery, where the Demon is hiding. Jake and Sarah, staked outside of Nancy's home, follow her there. At the cemetery Nancy leaves flowers at a grave and sees the demon. She informs her guards that the man is an old friend of her husband's and that they are to wait for her because she wants to speak to him in private and she then follows into the crypt where she saw the demon. Despite following Nancy to the cemetery Jake and Sarah are too late; they approach Nancy's guards just in time to find her stumbling back to the group of men in a daze and already showing signs of demonic possession. Jake knows he must kill Nancy before she has a chance to give birth to the demon's child, just as he did with the previous girls. A fight ensues between Jake and Nancy's guards, Nancy flees and Jake yells to Sarah for her to follow. Jake finds Sarah on the ground, alone, and gets angry when he realizes that she can not kill the girl possessed because she sees the women as victims and believes they could have been saved. Jake tells Sarah to return to the convent and walks away, in which she replies that he is a soulless bastard. At this point the demon had witnessed Jake's fight with the guards and his disappointment in Sarah and he calls to Sarah to come to him and to seek comfort with him. Jake interrogates one of Nancy's guards and walks back to the car where Sarah is waiting. Sarah talks Jake into letting her stay with him by claiming while she can't kill the girls or him, if he turns and joins the demons (knowing now that he is half- demon and more susceptible to becoming evil after hearing Nancy refer to him as half-breed) but that she is willing to die for her convictions and that when Jake goes against this demon she may be the only edge he has. Jake and Sarah follow a lead down to an abandoned hotel where Nancy may be hiding. The demon is seen snatching a prostitute in the alley of the hotel, he then watches Jake and Sarah enter the building and then lies beside the unconscious prostitute and begins licking her. Inside the hotel Jake and Sarah come across a naked and dying man, he speaks of Nancy who is responsible for his condition and falls back into unconsciousness as Jake and Sarah continue deeper into the hotel now knowing that they are on the right trail. The next scene brings take place at a hotel room where the demon and his succubus are talking about the half breed (Jake) and Sarah. The succubus points out that the demon has become infatuated with Sarah because of her innocence. The succubus wishes to have Jake; she believes he will be a powerful ally. The demon tells her he is too dangerous and that he is to be destroyed. However, the succubus eventually persuades the demon to allow her to have him to enslave his soul and control him. As Jake and Sarah walk the halls of the hotel they come across rooms with various couples having sex. Jake determines the demon they are looking for is Asmodeus, the demon of lust. His power is what draws the prostitutes to the hotel, so he must be somewhere inside. Jake and Sarah come across Nancy and, after a brief scuffle, Nancy runs off. Jake tells Sarah to wait in the hallway and he goes after Nancy. While searching one of the rooms Jake is confronted by the succubus who attempts to seduce him while Asmodeus shows up in the hallway where Sarah is waiting. Asmodeus once again calls for Sarah to follow him. She does but with her weapons ready for use against him. Sarah is assaulted in the hallway by Nancy, but uses her cross to burn Nancy and she then flees with Sarah chasing after her. Jake is seen rolling on the floor and kissing the succubus, which brings him closer to his cross and distracts the succubus enough for him to grab the weapon and kill her. Nancy is found by Sarah and after Nancy attempts to pounce Sarah shoots her with a gun in an attempt to slow her down to kill her but Asmodeus appears to Sarah following the shots which were also heard by Jake. Sarah shoots at Asmodeus but the bullets do nothing to him and the gun runs out of bullets. Asmodeus knocks Sarah out just before Jake shows up. Jake and Asmodeus fight. Jakes loses but Asmodeus does not kill him - claiming it doesn't matter to him whether Jakes lives or dies because in the end his soul will belong to him. Jake awakes in the morning to find Sarah gone. He steals a motorcycle after breaking the arm of the biker. He rides back to the cemetery where Asmodeus seduces his other victims, and where he has brought Sarah. While Asmodeus begins to have sex with Sarah she transforms into a demon and kills him. Jake hears the growls of a demon and rushes into the crypt to see Sarah, as a demon, devouring the heart of Asmodeus. Sarah explains to Jake that he is not the only half breed to have been born and to have his dark side restricted by the church. Jake and Sarah fight after she refuses to play for the side of God any longer and is unable to convince Jake to do the same. Jake strangles Sarah and then walks out of the crypt seeming to be genuinely distraught over having to kill her. Jake goes to the church and confronts the Cardinal, angry and demanding why he wasn't told that Sarah was a half breed. He tells Jake that it was best if no one knew and that Sarah didn't know herself and while they had hoped Jake would kill the demon before he could get to Sarah, which they knew would bring out the demon in her, it wasn't a terrible loss that she is now dead. The movie ends with seeing the prostitute Asmodeus had snatched in the alley of the hotel now possessed with his child and then the camera pans up to see Jake dropping down from a fire escape to kill the prostitute.

Plot Bill is cooking when Graeme and Tim return from chess championships. Graeme and Tim are hungry, and want their dinner -- however, there is only soggy lettuce and potato peel to eat because Bill has fed their normal food (and wine) to \\"Bunter\\", a guinea pig, with dessert to follow. When Bill explains to Tim and Graeme that he is being paid ¬£30 to look after the guinea pig, and the thought of being able to get some extra money leads to the Goodies setting up the office as the \\"Goodies Animal Clinic\\" for \\"loony animals\\". Graeme sends Tim and Bill out to collect them from their owners. The Goodies' animal \\"patients\\" include a gigantic-sized snake, a gold fish, a hen (which escapes from the basket en route to the office), a large dog, a bushbaby, a tortoise, a mongoose, a vampire bat, two singing dogs, and a tiny fluffy white kitten called \\"Twinkle\\". Graeme's specially formulated growth mixture, which he feeds to the kitten, causes Twinkle to grow to super-size proportions. Graeme keeps Twinkle inside to stop him from wandering, but Bill decides to let Twinkle out for the night. Graeme, speaking with desperation in his voice, says urgently: \\"Come on. We've got to find him and catch him before he eats someone he shouldn't.\\" The following morning, Twinkle destroys St Paul's Cathedral and the Post Office Tower, as well as squashing Michael Aspel with his huge paw, and frightening various people and dogs. Graeme makes an antidote to counteract the disastrous effect of his growth mixture and reduce Twinkle back to the normal size of a cat, but the Goodies have to disguise themselves as giant mice, and become airborne on their trandem, to be able to get close enough to Twinkle for the antidote to be successful -- following which their \\"hot-air trandem balloon\\" is carried away by a Concorde airliner. Twinkle returns to normal size, and all seems well. However, the Goodies discover that there is yet another unexpected and unforeseen consequence resulting from Graeme's growth mixture -- they now have a king-size mouse problem on their hands.

The original 25 minute episode is thought to no longer exist, making it the only Goodies episode which is officially lost; however, the expanded and more elaborate version for the 1972 Montreux festival is said to have only minor differences with its 1971 prototype. One difference is the ending; in the original the giant mice are represented by stock footage of real mice inserted into the footage using chroma-key (CSO). In the Montreux version, giant model mouse heads are seen crashing through polystyrene walls. Graeme Garden makes a reference to the episode during \\"Earthanasia\\" while talking about animal science. The image of the kitten climbing the Post Office Tower (shown above) became a signature image for The Goodies. It was included in the title sequence of all their subsequent series made by the BBC.

It is part of the Fisher Range of the Southern Continental Ranges of the Canadian Rockies. It is located east of Highway 40 just southeast from the K-Country golf course, immediately southeast of Wedge Pond in Kananaskis Country. Scramble gain, mostly easy with a moderate section just above the tree line and a short difficult section on the ridge. The trail starts from the wedge pond parking lot. Either follow the shore counter clock wise until a trail takes off into the trees or follow the cutline south (right) from the gate to find a trail that soon joins the other and heads up the hill. It's a nice treed walk up to the tree line. Once on the rocks the best route up is to keep to the right, beside the cliffs until you can get on top then it's an easy walk up to the false summit. From there a ridge walk leads to the true summit. One short section of the ridge is too narrow to walk on so one has to find hand and foot holds and hang on the side of the ridge for or so.

Plot summary  Boy from the island  On an island there lived a solitary family, a father, a mother and a little boy. Once, a man named Johano swam to the island nude, since his ship had sailed off while he was bathing. The parents dressed him and hosted him for a month, during which time he told the boy fables and described continental cities. After he left, the boy ran away from home on a boat. When rescued by a ship, no one could understand his language. In port in Russia, the cook, Ivan, took him to see the city, but got drunk and was arrested, leaving the boy to sleep for several days in a cemetery, where he was found by other parents burying their own dead son. The parents then adopted him. The boy developed great musical talent, and he became a great violin master.  Boy in the village Brey  In the village Brey, Rika returns home one day to find a baby boy in a box on the table; she calls him Moses. It develops he too is very talented and becomes a violincelloist.  Boy in Prosen  In the Prussian city of Prosen a doctor is summoned to aid a dying circus worker. The circus worker dies, but a 16-year-old boy with a badly infected knee is discovered in his carriage. The doctor adopts him. He too is very talented and studies the piano.  Johano and the cook  Johano, the man who had visited the family on the island, encounters Ivan, the ship's cook who had been arrested. They learn that the boy from the island is looking for his parents, but has no idea even how to find the island they lived on. They manage to gather money and set off for Russia. On the way they encounter the boy who had been adopted by the doctor, at first confusing him with the boy that they were looking for. Johano arranges for his further study and they continue on their journey.  They meet  Four years later, in 1914 a concert was arranged in The Hague to which the three masters were invited: the violinist, the violincellist, and the pianist. When they met, they were very shocked, since all three looked identical ‚Äì even their friends could not tell them apart. But they could barely understand each other, as they spoke three different languages. Just then Johano and Ivan appeared, and the detective work began. As it happened, the pianist, former circus boy, had in his possession a diary which had belonged to his mother. Johano recognized the language in the diary as Esperanto, and they began piecing together how the boys had gotten separated. Johano found the father in an insane asylum in The Hague, and they were able to recall him to sanity with their music. Apparently, he too was a famous violincellist. He and their mother had spoken Czech and Esperanto together. The mother and Rika were also found alive. Johano got the boys to learn Esperanto so that they could understand each other. In the end they all left for the island, because the first boy wanted to meet with his adoptive parents. There they said goodbye to Johano, who it turned out, was not human at all, but a supernatural being, who had come to protect the three boys, children of Orpheus.

It also contains references to the fact that their first album was released the day of the September 11th attacks.

He died September 29, 2006 in Clearwater at the age of 86.Mike Donila and Robert Farley \\"For the disadvantaged and against Scientology: Gabe Cazares spoke out, whether it was as Clearwater mayor, to promote civil rights or to fight Scientology.\\" St. Petersburg Times September 30, 2006 Early history Gabriel \\"Gabe\\" Cazares was born to Mexican parents on 31 January 1920, in Alpine, Texas, as one of nine children. His family moved to Los Angeles, where he worked in the Civilian Conservation Corps. He attended Los Angeles City College on a track scholarship, where he set a record for the junior college 2-mile run which stood for 11 years. He also attended Fresno State College and Texas Christian University, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology, and the University of Maryland, College Park. He received his master's degree in business management from Jackson College in Honolulu, Hawaii. Much of his college work was complete while he was in the military. He joined the Army Air Forces in 1941 three weeks after the attacks on Pearl Harbor and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Political career Cazares retired from military service in 1966 to become a stockbroker. He moved to Clearwater, Florida soon afterwards and became a social activist, campaigning for desegregation and improved housing for minorities. In 1975, Cazares was elected mayor by a margin of fewer than 500 votes in a campaign that he entered as an underdog. His resounding victory was noteworthy because he was a Democrat and Hispanic in a largely Republican city then home to few Hispanics. He was a somewhat controversial mayor, frequently clashing with his colleagues on the City Commission and alienating important Democrats in the local political establishment. Nonetheless he gained popularity for his campaigning on behalf of the city's elderly population and the increasing openness he brought to City Hall. He twice ran unsuccessfully for Congress, in 1976 against U.S. Rep. C. W. Bill Young, R-Indian Shores, and in 1986 against Rep. Mike Bilirakis, R-Tarpon Springs. Cazares resigned as mayor in 1978, but was elected county commissioner in 1980. He held that post until Republican George Greer defeated him in 1984. Greer would later receive national attention as the judge in the controversial Terri Schiavo case. In 1991, Cazares was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board. His 1998 complaint that Taco Bell's television advertisements featuring a Spanish speaking Chihuahua dog were offensive and demeaning to Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, gained attention in the newspapers. In 2005 he criticized CNN for cutting away from Florida Governor Jeb Bush's speech just as he began to repeat a warning about Hurricane Wilma in Spanish - after the warning in English. Cazares called it dangerously insensitive to Florida's large Spanish speaking population. Criticism of Scientology Investigation of church Cazares became an outspoken critic of Scientology after the church decided in 1975 to move major operations into Clearwater. Cazares was suspicious of the group, which was buying property under the name \\"United Churches of Florida.\\" The church leaders told Cazares that they were an ecumenical group that planned to improve the ethics and morality in the Clearwater area. Cazares wondered why church folks from Los Angeles, California would travel all the way to Florida to provide Clearwater with moral guidance. Cazares investigated the United Churches of Florida and discovered that the leaders of the group lied about their intentions. They told Cazares they were renting the historic Fort Harrison Hotel from a group called Southern Land Development Leasing Corporation. Cazares discovered that both groups were controlled by Scientologists. Lawsuit by Church of Scientology Cazares was sued by the Church of Scientology for $1 million after he said that the city was being taken over. Cazares' suspicions about the group were investigated by local newspapers. On 3 November 1979, the Clearwater Sun ran a headline \\"Scientologists plot city takeover\\" and later stories said that the Scientologists had plans to take over the world.Clearwater Sun \\"Scientologists plot city takeover\\" 3 November 1979 The St. Petersburg Times won a Pulitzer Prize for one story exposing the wrongdoings of the Church of Scientology. Original (18M) A 1977 FBI raid on Scientology headquarters uncovered internal documents marked \\"Top Secret\\" that referred to their operation to take over Clearwater as \\"Project Normandy.\\" The FBI uncovered information about \\"Operation Freakout,\\" an operation intended to get Scientology critic Paulette Cooper committed to a mental hospital. The raid revealed \\"Operation Snow White,\\" where the Church of Scientology planned to infiltrate federal and state government offices in order to steal documents which reflected negatively on L. Ron Hubbard, or the Church of Scientology. The raid resulted in 11 top leaders of the church in jail. Cazares said it was odd that a religious group would use code names for a project to take control of a town, and called the project a \\"paramilitary operation by a terrorist group.\\"Gabe Cazares video interview for a Clearwater historical society. Harassment by the Church The Church of Scientology planned to smear Cazares.United States of America v. Mary Sue Hubbard, et al. , Sentencing Memorandum, Criminal Case No. 78-401 (1979), pp. 60-62. Dead Link Cazares questioned the church's motives, its purchases of downtown property using fictitious names, and the way its security guards carried Billy clubs and mace. At the Church of Scientology, federal investigators found internal memos outlining plans by church leaders to control public opinion in Clearwater, concoct a sex smear campaign against Cazares and infiltrate the local media and other institutions called the \\"Mayor Cazares Handling Project\\" and \\"Speedy Gonzalez.\\" These Scientology documents also revealed that church members had staged a false hit-and-run accident with Cazares in an attempt to discredit him. Cazares and his wife sued the Church of Scientology for $1.5 million. The church settled with Cazares in 1986.

Career Marcella Squires (Lulu Belle) was born in Washington, Illinois; Wiseman was from Spruce Pine, North Carolina. Lulu Belle and Scotty enjoyed enormous national popularity thanks to their regular appearances on National Barn Dance on WLS-AM in Chicago, a rival to WSM-AM's Grand Ole Opry. Barn Dance enjoyed a large radio audience in the 1930s and early 1940s with some 20 million Americans regularly tuning in. The duo married on December 13, 1934, one year after Wiseman became a regular on Barn Dance (Cooper had been a solo performer there since 1932). The duo is best known for their self-penned classic \\"Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?\\", which became one of the first country songs to attract major attention in pop circles and was recorded by many artists in both genres. Cooper was the somewhat dominant half of the duo with a comic persona as a wisecracking country girl. Her most famous novelty number was \\"Daffy Over Taffy\\". In 1938, she was named Favorite Female Radio Star by the readers of Radio Guide magazine, an unusual recognition for a country performer. Lulu Belle and Scotty recorded for record labels including Vocalion Records, Columbia Records, Bluebird Records; and Starday Records, in their final sessions during the 1960s reprising their old hits. They were among the first country music stars to venture into feature motion pictures, appearing in such films as Village Barn Dance (1940), Shine On, Harvest Moon (1938), County Fair (1941) and The National Barn Dance (1944). The couple retired from show business in 1958, except occasional appearances, going on to new careers in teaching (Wiseman) and politics (Cooper). Cooper served two terms from 1975 to 1978 in the North Carolina House of Representatives as the Democratic representative for three counties.'North Carolina Manual 1977,' Thad Eure, North Carolina Secretary of State: 1977, Biographical Sketch of Myrtle Cooper Wiseman (Mrs. Scott Wiseman), pg. 431 In 1977, she gave a memorable speech in which she revealed that she had been raped on the country music circuit.Myrtle Wiseman interview, charlotte.com; accessed November 7, 2015.

After his death in 1981 from a heart attack in Gainesville, Florida, Cooper married Ernest Stamey in 1983; and in 1989 recorded her first album in 20 years for a small traditional music label, Mar-lu Records out of Portageville, Missouri. Myrtle Stamey died in Spruce Pine, North Carolina, aged 85. In 1999, Old Homestead Records released a retrospective album Early & Great.

It starts from the west coast of the Thai-Malay Peninsula at an intersection with Phetkasem Road (Highway 4) near Amphoe Takua Pa, Phang Nga Province. The route runs eastward through Surat Thani Province to the east coast, then southward to Nakhon Si Thammarat Province. It ends at Ban Tha Pae, about 10 km north of Nakhon Si Thammarat town. Highway 4012 then connects Ban Tha Pae to Nakhon Si Thammarat town. Route Details Route 401 is the main road that connects Surat Thani and Nakhon Si Thammarat. It starts near Amphoe Takua Pa as a two-lane single carriageway. Running eastward, it passes through Phanom, Ban Ta Khun districts to Phunphin district. Then it widens to a four-lane dual carriageway and continues to Surat Thani, Amphoe Kanchanadit. It enters Nakhon Si Thammarat province at Amphoe Khanom, but does not pass the town of Khanom. It, then, goes southward pass Amphoe Sichon, Amphoe Tha Sala and ends at Ban Tha Pae, about 10 km north of Nakhon Si Thammarat. Total length is 287.682 km. Of this, 23.628 km is in Phang Nga Province, 186.458 km in Surat Thani Province and 77.596 km in Nakhon Si Thammarat Province.Highway information database , Department of Highways (in Thai). Retrieved on November 11, 2008. Most of the route is asphalt. However, a short section from Phun Phin till the start of the Surat Thani bypass is concrete. Almost all of the four-lane section is divided highway, with the exception of short sections at Ban Ton Reang and Ban Tha Pae. From Amphoe Phunphin to Amphoe Khanom, the route crosses many hills. The highest is Khao Hua Chang, a few kilometers before the intersection with Route 4014. About 1 km east of Khao Hua Chang, the route expand to six lanes, with the outermost lane for slow vehicles such as trucks. Between Amphoe Sichon and Ban Tha Pae, it's mostly level. At Amphoe Tha Sala, the route runs very near the coast (10‚Äì50 m) for about 2 km. This is the only section of Route 401 that runs adjacent to the sea. The section of Route 401 between the intersection with Route 4008 near Amphoe Phun Phin and the intersection with Route 4103 near Ban Tha Pae was once heavily used as a main access route to Bangkok for the lower southern provinces. However, when a new section of Route 41 between Phunphin and Thungsong was finished, the majority of traffic has moved to the new route. There are two bypasses on Route 401, around Surat Thani (10.282 km) and Tha Sala (4.27 km). Most of the road from Phunphin to Takua Pa is now viewable on Google Street View, the first long-distance countryside road in southern Thailand to be recorded.

This was inconvenient because at night only vehicles with permission cards could use the route. Vehicles without permission used routes 4016 and 4013 to avoid Fort Vachirawut. A new 4012 roadway was constructed about 1 km east of Fort Vachirawut. The newer route allows 24-hour access by all vehicles.

The company went public in 1993 and the stock price hovered around $40 per share. The Gloucester, Massachusetts-based company had several divisions although its consumer loyalty division was the company's cash flow engine.  Rise  The bulk of CYRK's revenues were generated from the sale of custom promotional products employed as consumer rewards in points-based consumer loyalty promotions. CYRK had three very successful public offerings between early 1993 and late 1994 underwritten by Montgomery Securities, all of which were oversubscribed. In 1997 the company, \\"already a significant player through its management of the Marlboro Gear and Pepsi Stuff continuity programs\\"Whither Cyrksimon , Promo Magazine, Oct 1, 2000 acquired Los Angeles-based Simon Marketing, making it one of the largest agencies in the promotion industry. They were named Agency of the Year by Promo Magazine in 1998. Although CYRK lost the Pepsi Stuff account in 1998 as it moved to a Coca_Cola account that never rivaled the success with Pepsi, they boasted McDonald's and Philip Morris as their two top clients. They also did significant business with Beanie Babies-maker Ty Inc. While Philip Morris accounted for 90% of the companies' business in 1994 thru the acquisition of Simon, McDonald's alone accounted for 61% of the consolidated revenue in 1999. On March 31, 1997 CYRK purchased Monroe, WA based Tonkin, Inc. At the time Caterpillar Inc. was Tonkin's largest account. The Tonkin acquisition was intended to allow CYRK to penetrate the business- to-business segment of the promotions industry and to serve as a further diversification initiative. Although based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, the company's marketing arm from 1994 to 1999 was a New York-based operation called Integrated Marketing Solutions, with President Laurel Rossi, who left the company in February 1999 to move to Hill Holliday Direct as executive VP and director of client services.Promo Magazine, Mar 1, 1999 and Joseph Sequenzia as Executive Creative Director, who left the company in 1998 to join IPG company Draft Worldwide -where he ultimately served as Executive Vice President, Executive Creative Director. In 1999, they had $988M in sales. Shlopak resigned in 1999 to join Louis Marx in an investment firm Equity Enterprises (later Brae Capital). Patrick Brady, who had joined the company in 1989 as a 50% owner of the then privately held company and was, in 1999, already president, was named CEO. At the end of that year, Yucaipa Companies with a $25 million investment, became a substantial-enough owner to replace Patrick Brady as chairman with its own Ronald Burkle. However Patrick and Simon CEO Allan Brown were named as \\"co-chief executives\\" of Cyrk.More than Money , Promo Magazine, Dec 1, 1999 In late 1999, with the company's share price still well below the intrinsic value of the company, the board of directors launched a strategic initiative with DLJ (Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette later CS First Boston) intended to maximize its share price thru a plan that would divest certain legacy accounts and certain businesses acquired previously. The plan was consummated in the Spring of 2001.

Jacobson, the security officer at then-Cyrk-subsidiary Simon Marketing. Although arrests were announced on 22 August 2001, with convictions following, and only one Cyrk/Simon employee was charged, this did not stop McDonald's from voiding its agreement. Phillip Morris quickly followed suit, thereby together removing more than 70% of Simon Worldwide's revenue. The fallout erased the benefits of the strategic divestitures and severely hurt the remaining business of Simon Worldwide; Ronald Burkle resigned from the board, and fourteen executives left to join Draft Worldwide (later called FCB) in Chicago, part of the Interpublic Group, in forming a new unit called Premium Surge within their promotional marketing division Surge.New York Times, Nov 28, 2001 Although initially maintaining an amicable relationship, there were still several unresolved issues between Cyrk and Simon.Unresolved Issues, March 2002 In May 2002, Simon Worldwide went into liquidation.Cyrk/Simon Mind-Advertising.Com The Massachusetts-based portion had evidently been sold.sold Corporate Promotions Group in Feb 2001 , Stateoftheindustry.com, 2002 On 20 May 2003, PPB Magazine reported that under new owners Sun Capital Partners, Inc., Gary Vonk had replaced Bob Siemering as CEO of Cyrk.

At the same time, Cyrk's financial statements indicate that the cash benefits of layoffs and withheld supplier payments, instituted first by interim leadership and then continued by Werner. As Werner and Bakirdan attempted to formulate their own strategy, further layoffs were executed in a desperate attempt to conserve cash.

Related to induline, it is a mixture of phenazine- based compounds. Its main industrial uses are as a colorant for lacquers and varnishes and in marker pen inks.

The shapes and sizes of the organisms are seen as color-free outlines against the dark background. An advantage of using this method, rather than regular positive stains like methylene blue or carbol fuchsin, is that prior fixation by heat or alcohol is not needed, so the organisms are seen in more lifelike shapes. Furthermore, negative staining with nigrosin can reveal some microorganisms that cannot be stained by regular methods. Nigrosin WS is used in tests for viability because living cells exclude the dye, but it enters dead cells.

History 50th Armored Division with Jersey Blues Tab, used from the 1940s to the 1960s On 13 October 1945 the War Department published a postwar policy statement for the entire Army, calling for a 27-division Army National Guard structure with 25 infantry divisions and two armored divisions. Once the process of negotiation was complete, among the new formations formed were the 49th and 50th Armored Divisions, the first armored divisions in the Army National Guard. The 50th Armored Division replaced the 44th Infantry Division within the New Jersey Army National Guard, with the 50th Armored assuming the 44th Infantry's \\"Jersey Blues\\" nickname. Most 50th Armored Division units were legacy units of the 44th Infantry and inherited the lineage and history of those units. In a 1968 reorganization, the 50th Armored was joined by the 27th Armored Brigade from New York, the legacy units left after the inactivation of the 27th Armored Division. Since the 50th Armored Division was no longer completely within New Jersey, it retired the \\"Jersey Blues\\" nickname. In 1968, the 50th Armored Division was reorganized to draw its units from New Jersey and the Vermont Army National Guard. Armor battalions in New Jersey and Vermont were upgraded to M48A1 and M48A3 Patton medium tanks. Between 1975-76 Vermont and New Jersey armor battalions started turning in their M48A3 tanks and began receiving the M48A5 which had the same 105mm gun and fire control system as the M60A1 in use by the active Army. During this time, many Vermont tank crews competed in gunnery exercises held in West Germany and consistently brought back awards. The division's training was rigorous during the Soviet threat peak years of the late 1970s to mid 1980s. Germany was the primary area of operations for the division if it was to have been activated.

The 50th Armored Division did not, and instead had the allotment for one of its brigades moved to the Texas Army National Guard, making the future of the division within the force structure 'uncertain'. During this time, both battalions of Vermont's 172nd Armor 86th Brigade began doing their annual training at Fort Hood, Texas, a change from their former armor deployment base of Fort Drum, New York. By October 1986, Vermont's 86th Brigade left the 50th Armor Division and became part of the 26th Infantry Division. A few years later the 86th went to the 42nd ID and got M60A3 medium tanks.  Inactivation  On 1 September 1993, the 50th Armored Division was inactivated and its remaining brigades joined other divisions.New Jersey Military and Veterans Affairs ‚Äì Militia Museum of New Jersey New Jersey's 50th Infantry Brigade, which took the Division's lineage, was made part of the 42nd Infantry Division. The 36th Infantry Brigade from Texas was reabsorbed into the 49th Armored Division. In the early 1990s further consolidation followed the fall of the Soviet Union, and the 26th Infantry Division disbanded, causing Vermont's 86th Brigade to join the 42nd Infantry Division and soon receive M1A2 Abrams main battle tanks. While under the 50th Armor Division, Vermont's 1-172nd and 2-172nd Armored Battalions of the 86th Brigade excelled at tank gunnery and field exercises, making the 86th Brigade the only Army National Guard unit to ever consistently accomplish Tank Table XIII, an honor it continued to earn even after the 50th AD disbanded.

It has been argued that these extinct species did not have true ossicones; however, later research has revealed their ossicones to be in line with those of giraffids. Ossicones are located dorsally of the frontal bone and fuse to the skull later in life. Ossicones are similar to the horns of antelopes and cattle, except that they are derived from ossified cartilage or subcutaneous connective tissues rather than living bone, and that the ossicones remain covered in skin and fur, rather than horny keratin. Antlers (as on deer) are derived from bone tissue: when mature, the skin and fur covering of the antlers, termed \\"velvet\\", is sloughed and scraped off to expose the bone of the antlers. Ossicones are present at birth; however, they lie flat and are not attached to the skull in order to avoid injury at birth. Male and female ossicones vary in structure and purpose. Males typically have thicker ossicones that become bald on top due to frequent necking. These ossicones also add weight to the giraffe's head allowing them to deliver heavier, sometimes fatal, blows. The added weight is an evolutionary trait bred from necessity. The addition of ossicones also leads to other evolutionary adaptations such as heavy hides and specialized dermal shields.

H.T. Colebrooke first translated this text into English. Windischmann and Lorinser translated it into German, and Pautier and St. Hilaire translated it into French.  Authorship and chronology  Samkhya is an important pillar of Indian philosophical tradition, called shad-darshana, however, of the standard works of Samkhya only three are available at present. These are: Samkhya Sutras attributed to the founder of Samkhya, Kapila; Tattva Samasa, which some authors (Max Muller) consider prior to Samkhya Sutras,The Six Systems of Indian Philosophy; Friedrich Max M√ºller, p.296, 2013, ASIN: B00F1M1B1Y and Samkhya Karika authored by Ishvara Krishna. Ishvara Krishna follows several earlier teachers of Samkhya and is said to come from Kausika family.Swami, Virupakshananada, (1995), vi He taught before Vasubandhu and is placed following Kapila, Asuri, Panca Shikha, Vindhyavasa, Varsaganya, Jaigisavia, Vodhu, Devala and Sanaka. Samkhya karika was probably composed sometime in the Gupta Empire period, between 320-540 CE. The translation of Paramartha into Chinese together with a commentary was composed over 557-569 CE, has survived in China, and it constitutes the oldest surviving version of Samkhya karika. Several manuscripts, with slightly variant verses are known, but these do not challenge the basic thesis or the overall meaning of the text. While the Samkhya ideas developed in second half of 1st millennium BCE through the Gupta period, the analysis of evidence shows, states Gerald Larson, that Samkhya is rooted in the speculations of the Vedic era Brahmanas and the oldest Upanishads of Hinduism on the nature of man, and that it is generally agreed that Samkhya's formulation took place at the earliest after the oldest Upanishads had been composed (~800 BCE).Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical SƒÅ·πÉkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 42 In terms of comparative textual chronology, states Larson, the final redaction of Yogasutra and the writing of Samkhya-karika were probably contemporaneous.Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical SƒÅ·πÉkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 149 The Samkhya literature grew with later developments such as through Bhashya on Samkhya karika in the 9th-century Samkhya Tattva Kaumudi of Vacaspati Mishra.Larson, 1979, p. 253 Structure Number of verses The Karika, wrote ancient Hindu scholars Gaudapada and Vacaspati Misra, contains seventy two verses. However, Gaudapada commented on the first sixty nine, leading 19th-century colonial era scholars to suggest that the last three may have been added later. With the discovery of 6th-century manuscripts of translations of the Indian text into Chinese language, it became clear that by the 6th-century, the Karika had seventy two verses. The Chinese version includes commentary on the Karika, but for unknown reasons, skips or misses the commentary on verse sixty three. In mid 20th-century, the first manuscript of Yuktidipika was discovered in India, which is a review and commentary on the Karika. Yuktidipika, for unknown reasons, skipped commenting on verses sixty through sixty three, verse sixty five and sixty six, but reviews and analyzes the remaining 66 of 72 verses. The medieval era Matharavrtti text states that the Karika has seventy three verses. In contrast, verse seventy two of the surviving 6th-century CE Karika declares that its original had just seventy verses, implying that a more ancient version of Samkhya-karika once existed. Scholars have attempted to produce a critical edition, by identifying the most ancient original set of seventy verses, but this effort has not produced a consensus among scholars. In terms of content, importance and meaning, the text is essentially the same regardless of which version of the manuscript is referred to.Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, , page 163 Meter Each verse of the philosophical Samkhya-karika text is composed in a precise mathematical meter, that repeats in a musical rhythm of an Arya meter (also called the Gatha, or song, meter). Every verse is set in two half stanza with the following rule: both halves have exactly repeating total instants and repeating sub-total pattern in the manner of many ancient Sanskrit compositions. The stanza is divided into feet, each feet has four instants, with its short syllable counting as one instant (matra), while the long syllable prosodically counts are two instants.Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical SƒÅ·πÉkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 147 Each verse of Karika are presented in four quarters (two quarters making one half), the first quarter has exactly three feet (12 beats), the second quarter four and half feet (18 beats), the third quarter of every verse has three feet (12 beats again), while the fourth quarter has three and a half plus an extra short syllable at its end (15 beats). Thus, metrically, the first half stanza of every verse of this philosophical text has thirty instants, the second has twenty seven.Arthur Basham (Original 1954, Reprint 2014), The Wonder That Was India, Picador, , pages 511-512 Contents Samkhya emerged in the Vedic tradition, states Gerald Larson, and the Karika is an important text that was the fruit of those efforts.Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical SƒÅ·πÉkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 7, 15-21  Goal of the text: verses 1 to 3  The Samkhya karika opens by stating that the pursuit of happiness is a basic need of all human beings. Yet, one is afflicted by three forms of suffering, a truth that motivates this text to study means of counteracting suffering:S Radhakrishnan and CA Moore (1967), A Source Book in Indian Philosophy, Princeton University Press, , pages 426-427 The three causes of unhappiness (or the problem of suffering, evil in life) are adhyatmika that is caused by self; adhibhautika that is caused by others and external influences; and, adhidaivika that is caused by nature and supernatural agencies.The Samkhya Karika Nandalal Sinha, Bhuvaneswari Ashrama, Editor: BD Basu, pages 1-2 (90 of Sutram) The suffering are two types, of body and of mind. The perceptible means of treatment include physicians, remedies, magic, incantations, expert knowledge of moral and political science, while avoidance through residence in safe places are also perceptible means available. These obvious means, state scholars, are considered by Samkhya karika, as temporary as they do not provide absolute or final removal of suffering. Verse 2 asserts that scriptures too are visible means available, yet they too are ultimately ineffective in relieving sorrow and giving spiritual contentment, because scriptures deal with impurity, decay and inequality.S Radhakrishnan and CA Moore (1967), A Source Book in Indian Philosophy, Princeton University Press, , pages 427-428 with footnotes; Original Sanskrit: ‡§¶‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§µ‡§¶‡§æ‡§®‡•Å‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡§É ‡§∏ ‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡§ø‡§∂‡§Ø‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§É ‡•§ ‡§§‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§™‡§∞‡•Ä‡§§‡§É ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡•ç ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§µ‡§ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡•ç ‡•• ‡•® ‡•• Source The verse then posits its thesis, states Larson, that \\"a superior method different from both\\" exists, and this is the path of knowledge and understanding. More specifically, liberation from suffering comes from discriminative knowledge of Vyakta (evolving, manifest world), Avyakta (unevolving, unmanifest empirical world, Prakrti), and Jna (knower, self, Purusha). Verse 3 adds that primordial nature is uncreated, seven starting with Mahat (intellect) is both created and creative, sixteenS Radhakrishnan and CA Moore list these 16 as five sense organs, five organs of action, the human mind, and five gross elements are created and evolve (but not creative), while Purusha is neither created nor creative nor evolves (and simply exists).Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical SƒÅ·πÉkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 7-8 Means of knowledge: verses 4 to 8 Verse 4 introduces the epistemology of Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, and states that there are three pramana, that is reliable paths to reliable knowledge: perception, inference and the testimony of reliable person.Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical SƒÅ·πÉkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 9-10, also see Chapter 3 All other paths to knowing anything is derived from these three, states the Karika.

It is in these respects, asserts Karika, that they are the reverse of the nature of Soul (Self, Atman) because Soul is devoid of these qualities.Samkhya karika by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press, pages 45-48S Radhakrishnan and CA Moore (1967), A Source Book in Indian Philosophy, Princeton University Press, , pages 428-429 with footnotes; Original Sanskrit: ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ó‡•Å‡§£‡§Æ‡§µ‡§ø‡§µ‡•á‡§ï‡§ø ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§É ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§ö‡•á‡§§‡§®‡§Ç ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§µ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ø ‡•§ ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§§‡§•‡§æ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ß‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§§‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§™‡§∞‡•Ä‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§•‡§æ ‡§ö ‡§™‡•Å‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç ‡•• ‡•ß‡•ß ‡•• Source The text in verse 12 states that the three Gu·πáa (qualities), that is sattva, tamas and rajas, respectively correspond to pleasure, pain and dulness, mutually domineer, produce each other, rest on each other, always reciprocally present and work together.Samkhya karika by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press, pages 49-53 This Samkhya theory of qualities have been widely adopted by various schools of Hinduism for categorizing behavior and natural phenomena.Alban Widgery (1930), The principles of Hindu Ethics, International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 40, No. 2, pages 234-237Karl H. Potter (2011), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2: Indian Metaphysics and Epistemology, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 112Ian Whicher (1998), The Integrity of the Yoga Dar≈õana, SUNY Press, , pages 109-110 Verses 13-14 state that Sattva is good, enlightening and illuminating, Rajas is urgent, motion and restless, while Tamas is darkness, obscuring and distressing; these work together in observed nature just like oil, wick and fire together in a lamp.The Samkhya Karika Nandalal Sinha, Bhuvaneswari Ashrama, Editor: BD Basu, pages 13-14S Radhakrishnan and CA Moore (1967), A Source Book in Indian Philosophy, Princeton University Press, , pages 429-430 with footnotes Nature merely undergoes modification, transformation, or change in appearance, but this is innate effect that already was in the cause, because asserts Karika, nothing cannot produce something. Nature of Prakrti: verses 15 to 16 The Karika defines Prakriti as \\"that nature which evolves\\", and asserts to be the material cause of the empirically observed world. Prakriti, according to the text, both physical and psychical, is that which is manifested as the matrix of all modifications. Prakriti is not primal matter, nor the metaphysical universal, rather it is the basis of all objective existence, matter, life and mind. Prakriti has two dimensions, that which is Vyakta (manifest), and that which is Avyakta (unmanifest). Both have the three Gu·πáa that, states the text, is in continual tension with one another, and it is their mutual interaction on Prakriti that causes the emergence of the world as we know it.Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical SƒÅ·πÉkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 10-11 When the Sattva-Rajas-Tamas are in equilibrium, no modification occurs; when one of three innate qualities is more active, the process of evolution is in action, change emerges (Gunaparinama).Samkhya karika by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press, pages 60-65 These two verses are significant, states Larson, in aphoristically presenting Samkhya's doctrines of causation, relationship between vyakta and avyakta, and its doctrine of what drives evolution. Nature of Purusha: verses 17 to 19 Samkhya-karika asserts, states Larson, that apart from the Prakriti and emergent creation, of equilibrium and evolution, exists the Purusha (or self, soul).Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical SƒÅ·πÉkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 11-12 The Purusha is pure consciousness, is itself inactive yet whose presence disrupts the equilibrium of the three Gu·πáas in their unmanifest condition. The disruption triggers the emergence of the manifested condition of empirical reality we experience, states the text.Samkhya karika by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press, pages 65-73 More specifically, verse 17 offers a proof that soul exists, as follows: Verse 18 of the Karika asserts that many souls must exist because numerous living beings are born, die and exist; because qualities (Gunas) are operating and affect everyone differently; and because everyone is endowed with instruments of cognition and action. Verse 19 states that the soul is the conscious \\"witness, separate, neutral, seer and inactive\\". The connection between Prakriti and Purusha: verses 20 to 21 A living being is a union of Prakriti and Purusha, posits Samkhya-karika in verses 20-21.S Radhakrishnan and CA Moore (1967), A Source Book in Indian Philosophy, Princeton University Press, , pages 433-434 The Prakriti as the insentient evolute, joins with Purusha which is sentient consciousness.Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical SƒÅ·πÉkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 12-13 The Karika states that the purpose of this union of Prakriti and Purusha, creating the reality of the observed universe, is to actualize a two-fold symbiosis. One, it empowers the individual to enjoy and contemplate on Prakriti and Purusha through self- awareness; and second, the conjunction of Prakriti and Purusha empowers the path of Kaivalya and Moksha (liberation, freedom).Samkhya karika by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press, pages 76-83 The verse 21 aphoristically mention the example of \\"the blind and the lame\\", referring to the Indian legend of a blind and a lame person left in the forest, who find each other, inspire mutual trust and confidence, agree to share the duties with the blind doing the walking and the lame doing the seeing, the lame sits on blind's shoulder, and thus explore and travel through the forest. Soul (Purusha), in this allegory, is similarly symbiotically joined with body and nature (Prakriti) in the journey of life. Soul desires freedom, meaning and liberation, and this it can achieve through contemplation and abstraction. These verses present a peculiar form of dualism, states Gerald Larson, because they assert unconscious primordial \\"stuff\\" on one hand, and pure consciousness on the other. This contrasts with dualism presented in other schools of Hindu philosophy where dualism focuses on the nature of individual soul and Brahman (universal reality).Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita VedƒÅnta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 19-40, 53-58, 79-86 The theory of emergence of principles: verses 22 to 38 These verses, states Larson, provide a detailed discussion of the theory of emergence, that is what emerges, how and the functioning of the different emergents.Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical SƒÅ·πÉkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 13-14 The discussion includes the emergence of buddhi (intelligence), the ahamkara (ego), the manas (mind), the five buddhindriyas (sensory organs), the five karmendriyas (action organs), the five tanmantras (subtle elements), the five mahabhutas (gross elements), and thereafter the text proceeds to detailing its theory of knowledge process. The Karika's verse 22 asserts that Mahat (the Great Principle, intellect) is the first evolute of nature (Prakriti, human body), from it emerges ego (Ahamkara, I-principle), from which interface the \\"set of sixteen\\" (discussed in later verses). Verses 23-25 describes Sattva, as the quality of seeking goodness, wisdom, virtue, non-attachment. The reverse of Sattva, asserts Karika is Tamasa. Sattva is the characteristic of intellect, states the text.Samkhya karika by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press, pages 83-94 The Karika lists the sensory organs to be the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin, while action organs as those of voice, hands, feet, excretory organs and that of procreation.Samkhya karika by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press, pages 95-108 Mind, states the text, is both a sensory organ in some aspects, and an organ of action in other aspects. Mind ponders, it is cognate, it integrates information and then interacts with the organs of action, it is also modified by the three innate qualities and diverse manifestations of it, asserts the text.S Radhakrishnan and CA Moore (1967), A Source Book in Indian Philosophy, Princeton University Press, , pages 435-436 Ego (Ahamkara), states the text, is self-assertion. Sattva influenced sensory organs and action organs create the Vaikrita form of Ahamkara, while Tamasa influence creates the Bhutadi Ahamkara or the Tanmatras.The Samkhya Karika Nandalal Sinha, Bhuvaneswari Ashrama, Editor: BD Basu, pages 23-24 Verses 29-30 of the text assert that all the organs depend on prana (breath or life), and that it is prana that connects them to the unseen one, the soul. The three internal emergent faculties (Trayasya), states Karika in verse 29, are mind, ego and the ability to reason.The Samkhya Karika Nandalal Sinha, Bhuvaneswari Ashrama, Editor: BD Basu, page 27 The sensory and action organs perform their respective function, by cooperating with each other, fueled by the life-force, while the soul is the independent observer. The organs manifest the object and the purpose of one's soul, not the purpose of anything outside of oneself, states verse 31 of the text. Verses 32 through 35 of Karika present its theory how the various sensory organs operate and cooperate to gain information, how action organs apprehend and manifest driven by mind, ego and three innate qualities (Gunas).The Samkhya Karika Nandalal Sinha, Bhuvaneswari Ashrama, Editor: BD Basu, pages 23-31 Verses 36 and 37 assert that all sensory organs cooperate to present information to the mind, and it is the mind that presents knowledge and feelings to one's soul (Purusha within).The Samkhya Karika Nandalal Sinha, Bhuvaneswari Ashrama, Editor: BD Basu, pages 31-32Samkhya karika by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press, pages 116-119 The theory of reality: verses 39 to 59 The Samkhya-karika in these verses, states Larson, discusses its theory of reality and how one experiences it. The text includes the discussion of impulses and bhavas (dispositions, desires) that produce human experience and determine subjective reality. The Karika asserts that there is twofold emergence of reality, one which is objective, elemental and external; another which is subjective, formulating in mind and internal. It interfaces these with its epistemic theory of knowledge, that is perception, inference and the testimony of reliable person, then presenting its theory of error, theory of complacency, theory of virtue and necessary conditions for suffering, happiness and release. The theory of understanding and freedom: verses 60 to 69 The verses 60-69 begin by stating the duality theory of the Samkhya school, which asserts that Prakriti (nature) and Purusha (soul) are absolutely separate.Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical SƒÅ·πÉkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 172-173, 274 with footnote 32a The Karika, in verse 63, asserts that human nature variously binds itself by a combination of seven means: weakness, vice, ignorance, power, passion, dispassion and virtue. That same nature, once aware of soul's object, liberates by one means: knowledge.Samkhya karika by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press, pages 178-179 Verse 64 of the text states that this knowledge is obtained from the study of principles, that there is a difference between inert nature and conscious soul, nature is not consciousness, consciousness is not enslaved to nature and that consciousness is \\"complete, free from error, pure and kevala (solitary)\\". Man's deepest selfhood in these verses of Karika, states Larson, is not his empirical ego or his intelligence, rather it is his consciousness, and \\"this knowledge of the absolute otherness of consciousness frees man from the illusion of bondage and brings man's deepest selfhood into absolute freedom (kaivalya)\\".Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical SƒÅ·πÉkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 13 Transmission of Samkhya tradition: verses 70 to 72 Commentaries The well known and widely studied medieval era reviews and commentaries on Samkhya-karika include the Gaudapada Samkhya Karika Bhasya (unclear date, certainly before 8th-century),Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical SƒÅ·πÉkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 148 the Paramartha's Chinese translation (6th-century), the Matharavrtti, the Samkhya tattva kaumudi (9th-century), the Jayamangala (likely before 9th-century), and the more recently discovered Yuktidipika. Vacaspati Mishra's is well studied commentary, in addition to his well-known commentary to Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Atheism in Samkhyakarika The Karika is silent about God, states Johannes Bronkhorst, neither denying nor affirming the existence of God.Johannes Bronkhorst (1983), God in Samkhya, Wiener Zeitschrift f√ºr die Kunde S√ºdasiens , Volume 27, pages 149-164 The text discusses existence and consciousness, how the world came into existence and what is the relationship between nature and soul. The numerous Sanskrit commentaries on Samkhya-karika from 1st millennium CE through the 2nd millennium, states Bronkhorst, extensively use the Karika to discuss the question whether or not God is the cause of the world. VƒÅcaspati Mishra‚Äôs Tattvakaumudi , for example, states that the creation could not have been supervised by God, since God is without activity and has no need for activity. Further, citing Karika's verses 56-57 and others, that another reason why God cannot be considered the creator of the world, is that God has no desires and no purpose is served for God by creating the universe. The text asserts that there is suffering and evil experienced by living beings, but God who is considered to be free from the three Gunas (qualities) could not be creating Guna in living beings and the vicissitudes of living beings, therefore God is neither the cause of suffering and evil nor the cause of the world. The commentary that was translated into Chinese in 6th-century CE by ParamƒÅrtha, states in its review and analysis of Samkhya-karika: The 11th-century Buddhist commentator Jnanasribhadra, frequently cites various Hindu schools of philosophies in his Arya-Lankavatara Vritti, of which Samkhya school and Samkhya-karika is the most common.Koichi Furusaka (1998), Criticism on Samkhya in the Arya-lankavatara-vrtti, Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies, Vol. 47, No. 1, pages 493-499 Jnanasribhadra states, citing Samkhya-karika, that Samkhyans believe in the existence of the soul and the world, in contrast to teachings in the Buddhist text La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra, adding that many Samkhyans are atheistic. Samkhya is an atheistic philosophy according to Paul Deussen and other scholars.Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, , page 39Lloyd Pflueger, Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 38-39David Burke (1988), Transcendence in Classical SƒÅmkhya, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 38, No. 1, pages 19-29 Liberation and freedom from suffering Jnanasribhadra, the 11th-century Buddhist scholar, quotes Samkhya-karika, Gaudapada-bhasya, and Mathara-Vritti on the Karika, to summarize Samkhya school's position on the path to liberation: See also * Samkhya References Further reading * Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, (Appendix A: Translation of Samkhyakarika) * Digambarji, Sahai and Gharote (1989), Glossary of Sankhyakarika, Kaivalyadhama Samiti, * Daniel P.

Mount Hebo is part of the Northern Oregon Coast Range and is located in the Siuslaw National Forest overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Access to the summit is provided by an eight-mile forest service road that begins about a quarter mile from the junction of U.S. Route 101 and Oregon Route 22 in the community of Hebo. Mount Hebo was apparently named by a viewing party seeking a new route to the Willamette Valley that climbed the mountain to get a better view of the terrain.

Early years Charles William Butterfield was born in Middletown, Ohio and attended high school in Wyoming. Although he studied medicine at Transylvania College, he preferred playing in bands, and he studied cornet with Frank Simon. He discontinued his studies after finding success as a trumpeter. Career Early in his career he played in the band of Austin Wylie. He gained attention working with Bob Crosby (1937‚Äì1940), and later performed with Artie Shaw, Les Brown, and Benny Goodman. While with Bob Crosby, he initially played third trumpet behind the legendary Charlie Spivak and Yank Lawson. When those two left Crosby to join Tommy Dorsey's band in 1938, Butterfield was given the opportunity to solo on a song written by Crosby bassist Bob Haggart, initially titled \\"I'm Free.\\" When lyrics were added, it became the well-known standard \\"What's New?\\". Crosby's version, featuring Butterfield's brilliant performance, is regarded as one of the great recordings of the Big Band era. On October 7, 1940, during his brief stay with Artie Shaw's orchestra, Butterfield performed what has been described as a \\"legendary trumpet solo\\" on the hit song \\"Star Dust\\". He was also a featured soloist in the small group from Shaw's band, the Gramercy Five. Between 1943 and 1947, taking a break to serve in the United States armed forces, Butterfield led his own orchestra. On September 20, 1944, Capitol recorded the jazz standard \\"Moonlight In Vermont\\", which featured a vocal by Margaret Whiting and trumpet solos (both open and muted) by Butterfield. The liner notes from the CD Capitol from the Vaults, Volume 2, \\"Vine Street Divas\\" indicate that, although Billy Butterfield & His Orchestra were credited with the song, it was really the Les Brown band recording under the name of Billy Butterfield because Brown was under contract to another label at the time. Butterfield recorded two albums with arranger- conductor Ray Conniff, Conniff Meets Butterfield (1959) and Just Kiddin' Around (1962). Later in the 1960s he recorded two albums with his own orchestra for Columbia Records. The trumpeter He was a member of the World's Greatest Jazz Band, led by former Crosby bandmates Yank Lawson and Bob Haggart, from the late 1960s until his death in 1988. He also freelanced as a guest star with many bands all over the world, and performed at many jazz festivals, including the Manassas Jazz Festival and Dick Gibson's Bash in Colorado. Film Butterfield was seen in the film Second Chorus (1940) as a member of an orchestra led by Artie Shaw. Personal life Butterfield was married to singer Dotty Dare Smith. Death Butterfield died March 18, 1988, in North Palm Beach, Florida. He was 71.

Her inclusion in the latter category is mainly due to a few numbers she performed, e.g. \\"King Size Papa\\" and \\"Snatch and Grab It\\" and \\"I Didn't Like It The First Time (The Spinach Song)\\". However, it would be misleading to characterize her music as always being in this vein. Biography Born in Boonville, Missouri, Lee was raised in Kansas City, and began her musical career around 1920, singing and playing piano in her brother George Lee's band, which for a time also included Charlie Parker. She first recorded on the Merritt record label in 1927 with Jesse Stone as pianist and arranger, and launched a solo career in 1935. In 1944 she secured a recording contract with Capitol Records, and a string of R&B; hits followed, including \\"Gotta Gimme Whatcha Got\\" (No. 3 R&B;, 1946), \\"Snatch and Grab It\\" (No. 1 R&B; for 12 weeks, 1947, selling over 500,000 copies), \\"King Size Papa\\" (No. 1 R&B; for 9 weeks, 1948), \\"I Didn't Like It The First Time (The Spinach Song)\\" (No. 4 R&B;, 1949), and \\"My Man Stands Out\\". As these titles suggest, she became best known for her trademark double entendre songs, or, as she once said, \\"the songs my mother taught me not to sing\\". The records were credited to 'Julia Lee and Her Boy Friends', her session musicians including Jay McShann, Vic Dickenson, Benny Carter, Red Norvo, Nappy Lamare, Red Nichols and Jack Marshall. She was married to Frank Duncan, a star catcher and manager of the Negro National League's Kansas City Monarchs. He, like Julia, was a native of Kansas City. Although her hits dried up after 1949, she continued as one of the most popular performers in Kansas City until her death in Kansas City, at the age of 56, from a heart attack.
