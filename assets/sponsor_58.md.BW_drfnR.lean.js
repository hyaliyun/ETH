Life and career Born in Enping, Guangdong, Feng moved to the United States at the age of twelve, living and working in various parts of California before trying to settle in San Francisco in 1906, the year that the San Francisco earthquake struck. The earthquake spoiled his plan and sent him fleeing to Oakland. Fung was fascinated by the Wright Brothers' plane and because he was always interested in machinery, one of the first things he did after arriving in Oakland was to organize an airplane manufacturing company, only a few years after the Wright Brothers' Kitty Hawk flight. Within two years of founding the company in 1908, Fung constructed his first airplane, a sesquiplane with an upper span of and lower of , powered by a engine of Fung's own construction. On September 22, 1909 (several newspapers report the date as Tuesday, September 21, 1909) Fung was the first Chinese man known to fly in America (and first aviator of any nationality to fly in California and the West Coast of the United States). He had constructed his own biplane, improving on the Wrights' blueprints. Fung flew in a wide circle, despite the harsh winds; after twenty minutes, however, the bolt holding the propeller to the shaft snapped off, and he was brought to a stop, suffering only minor bruising.\\"Feng Ru\\", Early Aviators. The flight was reported in several papers, including The San Francisco Call and the Oakland Tribune. Fung returned to China on March 21, 1911, upon the request of Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, who wanted to use Fung's planes to aid the rebellion against the Qing dynasty.\\"Pilots, Planes and Pioneers\\", Wright Brothers Aeroplane Company. He was accompanied by six Oakland residents and another biplane of his own design. However, on August 26, 1912, he was killed when his plane crashed during an aerial exhibition, in front of 1,000 spectators. Sun Yat-sen insisted that he be buried at the Mausoleum of the 72 Huanghuagang Martyrs, and that his tomb be inscribed with the words \\"Pioneer of Chinese Aviation\\". Legacy On 21 September 2009, a bronze bust of Fung, the \\"Father of Chinese Aviation\\", was unveiled in a ceremony at Laney College in Oakland. One of Fung's workshops, where he designed and built parts of his biplane, was on a site that is now part of the Laney campus, near the heart of commercial Chinatown. The event was organized by Steve Lavoie of the Oakland Public Library and Lieutenant- Colonel Roger Glenn of Amelia Earhart Senior Squadron 188, Civil Air Patrol.

It is an extremophile that was isolated from the hypersaline and alkaline Mono Lake in eastern California by geobiologist Felisa Wolfe-Simon, a NASA research fellow in residence at the US Geological Survey. In a 2010 Science journal publication, the authors claimed that the microbe, when starved of phosphorus, is capable of substituting arsenic for a small percentage of its phosphorus to sustain its growth. Immediately after publication, other microbiologists and biochemists expressed doubt about this claim which was robustly criticized in the scientific community. Subsequent independent studies published in 2012 found no detectable arsenate in the DNA of GFAJ-1, refuted the claim, and demonstrated that GFAJ-1 is simply an arsenate-resistant, phosphate-dependent organism.RRResearch By Rosie Redfield. 16 January 2012 Discovery Wolfe- Simon at Mono Lake, 2010 The GFAJ-1 bacterium was discovered by geomicrobiologist Felisa Wolfe-Simon, a NASA astrobiology fellow in residence at the US Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California. GFAJ stands for \\"Give Felisa a Job\\". The organism was isolated and cultured beginning in 2009 from samples she and her colleagues collected from sediments at the bottom of Mono Lake, California, U.S.A. Mono Lake is hypersaline (about 90 grams/liter) and highly alkaline (pH 9.8). It also has one of the highest natural concentrations of arsenic in the world (200 ŒºM). The discovery was widely publicized on 2 December 2010. Taxonomy and phylogeny Molecular analysis based on 16S rRNA sequences shows GFAJ-1 to be closely related to other moderate halophile (\\"salt-loving\\") bacteria of the family Halomonadaceae. Although the authors produced a cladogram in which the strain is nested among members of Halomonas, including H. alkaliphila and H. venusta, they did not explicitly assign the strain to that genus. Many bacteria are known to be able to tolerate high levels of arsenic, and to have a proclivity to take it up into their cells. However, GFAJ-1 was controversially proposed to go a step further; when starved of phosphorus, it was proposed to instead incorporate arsenic into its metabolites and macromolecules and continue growing. The sequence of the genome of the bacterium GFAJ-1 is now posted in GenBank. Species or strain Tufa formations along the shore of Mono Lake In the Science journal article, GFAJ-1 is referred to as a strain of Halomonadaceae and not as a new species. The International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria, the set of regulations which govern the taxonomy of bacteria, and certain articles in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology contain the guidelines and minimal standards to describe a new species, e.g. the minimal standards to describe a member of the Halomonadaceae. Organisms are described as new species if they meet certain physiological and genetic conditions, such as generally less than 97% 16S rRNA sequence identity to other known species and metabolic differences allowing them to be discerned apart. In addition to indicators to tell the novel species from other species, other analyses are required, such as fatty acid composition, respiratory quinone used and tolerance ranges and deposition of the strain in at least two microbiological repositories. New proposed names are given in italics followed by sp. nov. (and gen. nov. if it is a novel genus according to the descriptions of that clade). In the instance of the GFAJ-1 strain these criteria are not met, and the strain is not claimed to be a new species. When a strain is not assigned to a species (e.g. due to insufficient data or choice) it is often labeled as the genus name followed by \\"sp.\\" (i.e., undetermined species of that genus) and the strain name. In the case of GFAJ-1 the authors chose to refer to the strain by strain designation only. Strains closely related to GFAJ-1 include Halomonas sp. GTW and Halomonas sp. G27, neither of which were described as valid species. If the authors had formally assigned strain GFAJ-1 to the genus Halomonas, the name would be given as Halomonas sp. GFAJ-1. Biochemistry A phosphorus-free growth medium (which actually contained 3.1 ¬± 0.3 ŒºM of residual phosphate, from impurities in reagents) was used to culture the bacteria in a regime of increasing exposure to arsenate; the initial level of 0.1 mM was eventually ramped up to 40 mM. Alternative media used for comparative experiments contained either high levels of phosphate (1.5 mM) with no arsenate, or had neither added phosphate nor added arsenate. It was observed that GFAJ-1 could grow through many doublings in cell numbers when cultured in either phosphate or arsenate media, but could not grow when placed in a medium of a similar composition to which neither phosphate nor arsenate was added. The phosphorus content of the arsenic-fed, phosphorus-starved bacteria (as measured by ICP- MS) was only 0.019 (¬± 0.001) % by dry weight, one thirtieth of that when grown in phosphate-rich medium. This phosphorus content was also only about one tenth of the cells' average arsenic content (0.19 ¬± 0.25% by dry weight). The arsenic content of cells as measured by ICP-MS varies widely and can be lower than the phosphorus contents in some experiments, and up to fourteen times higher in others. Other data from the same study obtained with nano-SIMS suggest a ~75-fold excess of phosphate (P) over arsenic (As) when expressed as P:C and As:C ratios, even in cells grown with arsenate and no added phosphate. When cultured in the arsenate solution, GFAJ-1 only grew 60% as fast as it did in phosphate solution. The phosphate-starved bacteria had an intracellular volume 1.5 times normal; the greater volume appeared to be associated with the appearance of large \\"vacuole-like regions\\". Scanning electron micrograph of GFAJ-1 cells grown in defined minimal medium supplemented with 1.5 mM phosphate When the researchers added isotope-labeled arsenate to the solution to track its distribution, they found that arsenic was present in the cellular fractions containing the bacteria's proteins, lipids and metabolites such as ATP, as well as its DNA and RNA. Nucleic acids from stationary phase cells starved of phosphorus were concentrated via five extractions (one with phenol, three with phenol-chloroform and one with chloroform extraction solvent), followed by ethanol precipitation. Although direct evidence of the incorporation of arsenic into biomolecules is still lacking, radioactivity measurements suggested that approximately one-tenth (11.0 ¬± 0.1%) of the arsenic absorbed by these bacteria ended up in the fraction that contained the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and all other co-precipitated compounds not extracted by the previous treatments. A comparable control experiment with isotope-labeled phosphate was not performed. With the distribution of the strain in mid-2011, other labs began to independently test the validity of the discovery. Rosemary Redfield from the University of British Columbia, following issues with the growth conditions, investigated the growth requirements of GFAJ-1, and found that the strain grows better on solid agar medium than in liquid culture. Redfield attributed this to low potassium levels and hypothesized that the potassium levels in basal ML60 medium may be too low to support growth. Redfield after finding and addressing further issues (ionic strength, pH and the use of glass tubes instead of polypropylene) found that arsenate marginally stimulated growth, but didn't affect the final densities of the cultures, unlike what was claimed. Subsequent studies using mass spectrometry by the same group found no evidence of arsenate being incorporated into the DNA of GFAJ-1. Arsenate ester stability Structure of poly-Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate Arsenate esters, such as those that would be present in DNA, are generally expected to be orders of magnitude less stable to hydrolysis than corresponding phosphate esters. dAMAs, the structural arsenic analog of the DNA building block dAMP, has a half-life of 40 minutes in water at neutral pH. Estimates of the half-life in water of arsenodiester bonds, which would link the nucleotides together, are as short as 0.06 seconds‚Äîcompared to 30 million years for the phosphodiester bonds in DNA. The authors speculate that the bacteria may stabilize arsenate esters to a degree by using poly-Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate (which has been found to be elevated in \\"vacuole-like regions\\" of related species of the genus Halomonas ) or other means to lower the effective concentration of water. Polyhydroxybutyrates are used by many bacteria for energy and carbon storage under conditions when growth is limited by elements other than carbon, and typically appear as large waxy granules closely resembling the \\"vacuole-like regions\\" seen in GFAJ-1 cells. The authors present no mechanism by which insoluble polyhydroxybutyrate may lower the effective concentration of water in the cytoplasm sufficiently to stabilize arsenate esters. Although all halophiles must reduce the water activity of their cytoplasm by some means to avoid desiccation, the cytoplasm always remains an aqueous environment. Criticism NASA's announcement of a news conference \\"that will impact the search for evidence of extraterrestrial life\\" was criticized as sensationalistic and misleading; an editorial in New Scientist commented \\"although the discovery of alien life, if it ever happens, would be one of the biggest stories imaginable, this was light-years from that\\". In addition, many experts who have evaluated the paper have concluded that the reported studies do not provide enough evidence to support the claims made by the authors. In an online article on Slate, science writer Carl Zimmer discussed the skepticism of several scientists: \\"I reached out to a dozen experts ... Almost unanimously, they think the NASA scientists have failed to make their case\\". Chemist Steven A. Benner has expressed doubts that arsenate has replaced phosphate in the DNA of this organism. He suggested that the trace contaminants in the growth medium used by Wolfe-Simon in her laboratory cultures are sufficient to supply the phosphorus needed for the cells' DNA. He believes that it is more likely that arsenic is being sequestered elsewhere in the cells. University of British Columbia microbiologist Rosemary Redfield said that the paper \\"doesn't present any convincing evidence that arsenic has been incorporated into DNA or any other biological molecule\\", and suggests that the experiments lacked the washing steps and controls necessary to properly validate their conclusions. Harvard microbiologist Alex Bradley said that arsenic-containing DNA would be so unstable in water it could not have survived the analysis procedure. On 8 December 2010, Science published a response by Wolfe-Simon, in which she stated that criticism of the research was expected. In response, a \\"Frequently Asked Questions\\" page to improve understanding of the work was posted on 16 December 2010. The team plans to deposit the GFAJ-1 strain in the ATCC and DSMZ culture collections to allow widespread distribution. In late May 2011, the strain has also been made available upon request directly from the laboratory of the authors. Science has made the article freely available. The article was published in print six months after acceptance in the 3 June 2011 issue of Science. The publication was accompanied by eight technical comments addressing various concerns regarding the article's experimental procedure and conclusion, as well as a response by the authors to these concerns. The editor in chief Bruce Alberts has indicated that some issues remain and that their resolution is likely to be a long process. A review by Rosen et al., in the March 2011 issue of the journal BioEssays discusses the technical issues with the Science paper, provides alternative explanations, and highlights known biochemistry of other arsenic resistant and arsenic utilizing microbes. On 27 May 2011, Wolfe-Simon and her team responded to the criticism in a follow-up Science journal publication. Then on January 2012 a group of researchers led by Rosie Redfield at the University of British Columbia analyzed the DNA of GFAJ-1 using liquid chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry and could not detect any arsenic, which Redfield calls a \\"clear refutation\\" of the original paper's findings. A simple explanation for the GFAJ-1 growth in medium supplied with arsenate instead of phosphate was provided by a team of researchers at the University of Miami in Florida. After labeling the ribosomes of a laboratory strain of Escherichia coli with radioactive isotopes (forming a radioactive tracer), they followed bacterial growth in medium containing arsenate but no phosphate. They found that arsenate induces massive degradation of ribosomes, thus providing sufficient phosphate for the slow growth of arsenate tolerant bacteria. Similarly, they suggest, GFAJ-1 cells grow by recycling phosphate from degraded ribosomes, rather than by replacing it with arsenate. Following the publication of the articles challenging the conclusions of the original Science article first describing GFAJ-1, the website Retraction Watch argued that the original article should be retracted because of misrepresentation of critical data. So far, as of January 2019, the paper has not yet been retracted.

Gabron was also a gifted animalier and often included living animals in his still life scenes.Willem Gabron (attributed), Stillleben mit Aras und zwei King Charles Spaniels, at liveautioneers He initially worked in a monochrome style but developed a more colourful palette after a long stay in Italy.Willem Gabron (Antwerp 1619-1678), A still life of a pewter-mounted stoneware jug, an overturned roemer, a broken roll of bread, a candle in a brass stand, a glass beaker of beer, a pewter dish with fish and a knife with ivory handle on a draped table- top at Bonhams Life Willem Gabron was born in Antwerp where he was baptised on op 28 October 1619. His family had an artistic pedigree. His grandfather Jan Gabron was an art dealer and auctioneer. His father, also called Willem, was a frame and panel maker who had registered as a master at the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke in 1610 and was also active as a decorative painter. Willem Gabron's mother was Magdalena Cossiers, the sister of the history painter Jan Cossiers. Garland of fruit It is not clear with whom he studied but it is likely his father was his teacher.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 1116-1118 He was already active from 1634. He was first registered in the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke as a 'wijnmeester' (i.e. son of a master of the Guild) in the guild year 1640‚Äì41, along with his younger brother Antoon. His sister Anna Maria married the Antwerp sculptor Artus Quellinus the Younger. Gabron travelled to Rome, at the latest by 1646. Here he became a member of the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists working in Rome. It was customary for the Bentvueghels to adopt an appealing nickname, the so-called 'bent name'. Gabron was given the bent name Toetsteen, which means 'touchstone'. He returned to Antwerp before 1660 where he remained active until his death. He never married and he left his estate to his brother Antoon and his sister Anna Maria, who had been widowed by that time. Work Still life with macaws and two King Charles spaniels Only a few of his works have been preserved. The artist was a specialist still life painter known for his game pieces, flower and fruit pieces and vanitas paintings. His still lifes were very sought after. He excelled in the painting of fruit and flowers as well as in the realist representation of golden, silver and ivory objects.Guillaume Gabron at the Biographie Nationale de Belgique, Volume 7, p. 405 Guiliam Gabron in: Arnold Houbraken, De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen, 1718 Gabron was also a gifted animalier and often included living animals in his still life scenes. In the early part of his career in Antwerp, Gabron was close to the Haarlem tradition, which is characterised by its monochrome palet. After his trip to Italy, especially in Rome, his works took on a more colourful imagery. Like other still life painters of his generation, his work was influenced by the leading Dutch still life painter Jan Davidsz. de Heem who worked in Antwerp for a long period. Willem Gabron responded to de Heem's style in his own idiosyncratic manner rather than imitating him.Carstian Luyckx, ‚Äò‚ÄôA still life of lemons, grapes and peaches, with a bread roll and a silver pokal on a partly draped table‚Äô‚Äô at Sotheby‚Äôs The work of Daniel Seghers was also an important inspiration for Gabron. Daniel Seghers was one of the earliest practitioners of the genre of garland paintings. These paintings typically show a flower garland around a devotional image or portrait. Gabron's Adoration of the Holy Sacrament (At Tajan on 16 December 2014, lot 4) is an allegory of the holy communion represented by two flower garlands surrounding the Host and wine over which hover two putti. The work expands on Seghers' earlier garland paintings.Guilliam GABRON (1619 - 1678), L'adoration du saint sacrement at Tajan References Adoration of the Holy Sacrament External links * Category:1619 births Category:1678 deaths Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish still life painters Category:People from Antwerp Category:Members of the Bentvueghels Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke ","title":"Willem Gabron"},{"id":"29856528","text":"Banti is an Italian surname.

It is now in the Archbishop's Palace in Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ, Czech Republic and belongs to the Archbishopric of Olomouc (administered by Olomouc Museum of Art ‚Äì Archdiocesan Museum). It is one of Titian's last works, and may be unfinished, although there is a partial signature on the stone in the foreground.Robertson, 231; only \\"... NUS P\\" remains, presumably from \\"TITIANUS P[inxit]\\" ‚Äì \\"Titian painted this\\". The painting shows the killing by flaying or skinning alive of Marsyas, a satyr who rashly challenged the god Apollo to a musical contest. It is one of several canvases with mythological subjects from Ovid which Titian executed in his late years, mostly the poesie series for King Philip II of Spain, of which this painting seems not to have been part. The painting has been in Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ in Moravia since 1673, and was rather forgotten about, being off the beaten track as far as Venetian painting is concerned.Hale, 717-718 It \\"did not enter critical literature until 1909\\".Robertson, 231 By the 1930s it was \\"widely accepted as an important late work\\" among scholars,Robertson, 231 but little known by a wider public. On its first modern appearance abroad, it \\"was greeted with astonished admiration\\" as the \\"star attraction\\" of a major exhibition at the Royal Academy in London in 1983,Hale, 718 quoted 1st; Rosand (2010), 19 quoted 2nd; Robertson is the catalogue entry It was new to most viewers and was described by John Russell in the New York Times as \\"the most astonishing picture in the show\\".John Russell, ART: VENETIANS OF 1500S AT BRITISH ROYAL ACADEMY, 17 December, 1983; Rosand, 1985, 295‚Äì297 Beginning an extended analysis, Sir Lawrence Gowing wrote that \\"All these months ‚Äì it is not too much to say ‚Äì London has been half under the spell of this masterpiece, in which the tragic sense that overtook Titian‚Äôs poesie in his seventies reached its cruel and solemn extreme. At most hours on most days there is a knot of visitors riveted and fairly perplexed in front of it. ... At the Academy people still ask, and on the radio well-meaning critics debate, how it is possible that a horribly painful subject should be the occasion of beauty or greatness in art.\\"Gowing Description and subject Drawing by Giulio Romano, Louvre, for a fresco in Mantua. The choice of such a violent scene was perhaps inspired by the death of Marcantonio Bragadin, the Venetian commander of Famagusta in Cyprus who was flayed by the Ottomans when the city fell in August 1571, causing enormous outrage in Venice.Hale, 715; Sohm, 97; Richard Titian's composition is undoubtedly derived from that of Giulio Romano from several decades before (see \\"Visual sources\\" below).Robertson, 231 Both artists follow the account in Ovid's Metamorphoses (Book 6, lines 382‚Äì400),www.theoi.com Text of Ovid Metamorphoses Book 6 in English, which covers the contest very quickly, but describes the flaying scene at relative length, though with few indications that would help to visualize it.Gowing; Richard Marsyas cries out \\"Why do you tear me from myself?\\".Quoted, Hale, 712-713; Wind, 172, Ovid's line 385 Marsyas was a skillful player of the classical aulos or double flute, for which by Titian's time pan pipes were usually substituted in art,Bull, 305 for a range of other instruments he was given, but all of them from the wind section. The contest with Pan is also covered in Metamorphoses (XI, 146-93) and his set hangs from the tree over his head. Apollo played his usual lyre, which is here represented by a modern lira da braccio, an ancestor of the violin with up to seven strings. This is played by a figure of uncertain identity, who some scholars have said to be Apollo himself, perhaps appearing a second time, since Apollo is clearly the figure wearing a laurel wreath who is kneeling down and using his knife to flay Marsyas' chest.Held, 187; Hale, 714; Robertson, 231‚Äì232; Gowing It has also been suggested that the musician is Orpheus, or Olympus, a devoted pupil of Marsyas, who Apollo later converts to playing the lyre, and Ovid mentions.Rosand (2010), 22; Sohm, 96; Gowing The mythical King Midas, the seated old man on the right, is often thought to be a self-portrait.Held, 187; Robertson, 231; Sohm, 97; Glover His downward line of gaze at Marsyas is parallel to that of the musician looking up to the heavens on the other side of the painting. Ovid avoids the question of who the judges of the contest were. In most Greek accounts the Three Muses did the role, but the story early became confused with another, the \\"Judgement of Midas\\", which has happened here. This was another musical contest, always with lyre versus pan pipes, but with Pan himself on the pipes. Of course Apollo won, but in some accounts King Midas preferred Pan, and was given the ears of a donkey as punishment, while Pan was merely humiliated. The seated figure at right wears a diadem and is Midas, though his ears seem unaffected.Bull, 303‚Äì305; Hall, 27‚Äì28; Robertson, 232; Hale, 713. Whether Midas was actually supposed to be the judge, or just a spectator, varies between accounts. The \\"Judgement of Midas\\" was also sometimes painted. Both stories were set in Phrygia, in modern Turkey, where Midas ruled, which in the ancient world had various associations with music. The Phrygians were not Greek, until Hellenized after Alexander the Great, but lived on the edge of the Greek world. The human with the knife wears a Phrygian cap. The head of Marsyas, inverted Apollo is assisted by a sinister \\"Scythian\\" figure on the left, working on Marsyas' leg, and a satyr with a bucket behind Midas, perhaps to collect blood, or hold the removed skin, which in some versions of the story Apollo later had nailed up in a temple. A small boy, or boy satyr,Hale, 714; What little can be seen of his legs seems to be furry, and he is described as a satirino by several authors restrains a large dog at right, while a much smaller dog is lapping at the blood that has fallen to the ground.Gowing As was typical in Titian's day, and especially in his works, the satyr is shown with the legs and feet of a goat, and inverting him emphasizes these, as well as giving him the position typical of mid-sized animals being slaughtered or skinned before butchering.Bull, 303‚Äì304; Hale, 713 Most of his body still seems unflayed, but Apollo holds a large flap of detached skin in the hand not holding his knife. Compositionally, the \\"V\\" shape made by Marsyas's legs is echoed by the highlighted \\"V\\"s of the bent arms of the four figures nearest to him, all of whom are looking at him. Indeed, his navel is almost exactly at the centre of the canvas as it now is.\\"John Dubrow on Titian\\" in Painters on Paintings; Rosand (2010), 27 Technical examinations have determined that two of the main differences to the Giulio Romano composition are changes made well after painting was underway; originally the musician merely held his instrument, as in the Giulio Romano composition, and the boy or small satyr and the large dog were not present.Held, 187 Meaning Detail with Midas Many writers have attempted to capture the meaning of the \\"famously savage\\" painting,Royal, 222 which, despite \\"the brutality of the treatment\\",Robertson, 232 has been found powerfully compelling by many, and described as \\"the most discussed, revered and loathed of all Titian's paintings\\".Hale, 718 One common suggestion has been that the painting reflects ideas in Renaissance Neoplatonism about the \\"liberation of the spirit from the body\\",Held, 187‚Äì189; Sohm, 97 quoted; Rosand (2010), 40 or the acquisition of higher insight or clarity.Wind, 171‚Äì173, on other 16th-century depictions Such ideas are usually considered to be involved in another famous treatment of flaying: the flayed skin carrying a self-portrait face of Michelangelo, held by Saint Bartholomew as his attribute in The Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel. One of Michelangelo's poems had used the metaphor of a snake shedding its old skin for his hope for a new life after his death.Sistine, 206; Wind, 187‚Äì188; Hale, 713-714 In this spirit, Dante began his Paradiso with a prayer addressed to Apollo, who he asks to \\"Enter my breast, and so infuse me your spirit as you did Marsyas when you tore him from the cover of his limbs.Wind, 173‚Äì174, quoting Paradiso I, 13‚Äì21; Hale, 713 In some other Renaissance depictions, Marsyas's furry legs appear human when flayed, so he \\"is redeemed from the animality that condemned him to this terrible fate\\".Bull, 305 The philosopher-turned-novelist Iris Murdoch was especially fascinated by the painting, which she described in an interview as \\"the greatest in the Western canon\\". It is mentioned in three of her novels, and sometimes discussed by the characters. In her portrait for the National Portrait Gallery by Tom Phillips, a reproduction occupies most of the wall behind her head.the painting She said it was \\"something to do with human life and all its ambiguities and all its horrors and terrors and misery, and at the same time there‚Äôs something beautiful, the picture is beautiful, and something also to do with the entry of the spiritual into the human situation and the closeness of the gods ...\\"Paris Review. The novels are A Fairly Honourable Defeat (1970), The Black Prince (1973), and her last, Jackson's Dilemma (1995); Hale, 718 The general interpretation of the story of Marsyas was as an illustration of the inevitable disaster that followed hubris in the form of a challenge to a god. An idea of the contest reinforcing the general moral and artistic superiority of the courtly lyre, or modern stringed instruments, over the rustic and frivolous wind family was present in much ancient discussion, and perhaps retained some relevance in the 16th-century. Gowing comments: \\"It was on behalf of order and the laws of harmonious proportion, which sound in the music of strings, that Apollo claimed victory over the chaotic and impulsive sound of the pipes.\\"Gowing; Rosand (2010), 19‚Äì20; Held, 190; Hale, 713, 715-717 For Edgar Wind the contest determined \\"the relative powers of Dionysian darkness and Apollonian clarity; and if the contest ended with the flaying of Marsyas, it was because flaying was itself a Dionysian rite, a tragic ordeal of purification by which the ugliness of the outward man was thrown off and the beauty of his inward self revealed\\".Wind, 172‚Äì173 Alternatively, there have been suggestions that the painting has a political meaning, either general or specific, and depicts the \\"just punishment\\" of hubristic opponents.Held, 190‚Äì191, 193 The 'three ages of man' are all represented (if satyrs are allowed to count), indeed on the right they are aligned diagonally. The boy or young satyr is looking rather vacuously out at the viewer, those in their prime are concentrating on their tasks with a variety of expressions, and Midas contemplates the scene, apparently with melancholy resignation, but making no further attempt to intervene.Held, 191‚Äì192; Sohm, 97‚Äì98; Rosand (2010), 22; Matthews History Roman version of the Hellenistic figure type, Louvre It is unknown whether the painting had an intended recipient; Titian's main client in his last years was King Philip II of Spain, but the picture is not mentioned in the surviving correspondence.Hale, 711-712 The painting may well be one of those still in Titian's studio at his death in 1576.Robertson, 231 There are a number of these, including for example The Death of Actaeon in the National Gallery, London (certainly intended for Philip),Penny, 250‚Äì252 and there is a general argument as to whether they should be regarded as finished or not. In this case the signature and areas of detailed finish may suggest that the painting had been completed.Penny, 250‚Äì252; Robertson, 231; Jaff√©, 25‚Äì28, 59, 151‚Äì152 (with both points of view expressed by different authors). The painting was in this exhibition, but not in the catalogue; Gowing, and Penny's letter in response below, which may indicate a shifted position; in 1984 Penny emphasizes unfinished aspects, in 2008 those suggesting completion. Nothing is known of its history before it appears in an inventory of 1655 of the Arundel Collection, by then in exile from the English Civil War in Amsterdam. This was formed by Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel (d. 1646) and his wife Alethea Howard, and was mostly dispersed by their son after Alethea's death in 1655. The collection had mostly been formed in the 1620s, when the Howards went on an extended visit to Italy, and it is presumed that the painting was bought there.Robertson, 233; Rosand (2010), 43 note 26 The painting was bought by Franz Imstenraed in 1655.Robertson, 233 He was the nephew of (Edvard, Everard or) Everhard Jabach, a banker from Cologne who was one of the greatest private collectors of the century, and also acted as an agent for Cardinal Mazarin and Louis XIV of France. In the 1650s the superb collection of Arundel's friend Charles I of England was being dispersed in London, and Jabach, acting on behalf of Louis, was one of many international buyers active, with agents on the ground.Brotton, 298‚Äì299 In 1673 it was acquired by Karl II von Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn, Bishop of Olomouc, after being a prize in a lottery.Robertson, 233; It seems the lottery was abandoned from lack of sales, and the actual purchase was by a conventional sale . He also bought most of the collection of the brothers Bernhard and Franz Imstenraed, which remains intact in Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ Castle, the former Archbishop's Palace, now the National Museum, in Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ. Machytka, Lubor, extract from \\"History of the Archbishop‚Äôs Gallery in Olomouc\\", 13, ACTA UNIVERSITATIS PALACKIANAE OLOMUCENSIS, NEERLANDICA II ‚Äì 2003 It appears the painting was cut down at top and bottom, and added to at the sides, especially on the right, during the 18th century.Robertson, 231, citing Neumann (see further reading) In modern times, the painting has been exhibited abroad in London in 1983Robertson, 231 and 2003,Jaff√©, ex-catalogue in Washington in 1986,Richard and in Paris, Vienna, Venice, Rome,in 2013, Review of exhibition in the Financial Times and New York, most recently in \\"Unfinished: Thoughts Left Visible\\", an exhibition of unfinished works, at Met Breuer in 2016.Rosand (2010), 19; All further sites mentioned in \\"John Dubrow on Titian\\" and \\"David Molesky on Titian‚Äôs The Flaying of Marsyas\\", in Painters on Paintings Visual sources Andrea Schiavone, Judgement of Midas, Royal Collection, c 1548‚Äì50 Marsyas, as a single figure, was a well-known subject in Roman and Hellenistic sculpture, with a famous type showing him tied and hanging with his arms above his head. This probably originated in Hellenistic Pergamon,It was originally part of a group with the Arrotino, then known as the Scythian, a figure of a slave sharpening a knife, though the connection between the two was not realized until the 17th century. and was well-known from various examples by the late Renaissance, followed for example by Raphael in a small scene on the ceiling of the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican. But this is not a very direct influence on Titian's composition.Hall, 27; Bull, 301‚Äì303; Gods, 185 Much closer is \\"an awkward sketch for a now damaged fresco\\" by Giulio Romano in the Palazzo Te in Mantua (1524‚Äì34),Hale, 714 for which there is also a drawing in the Louvre; this is clearly the main source for the composition. It has all the same figures and elements except the boy and the dogs, in roughly the same positions, including, apparently for the first time in art, Marsyas shown tied upside down. The standing figure at left is a servant holding a lyre, rather than Titian's lira da bracchio player.Robertson, 231‚Äì232; Bull, 303‚Äì304; Rosand (2010), 19‚Äì20; Royal, 222 The seated figure of Midas has donkey ears, and is more clearly distressed, holding his hands over his face, and Apollo, bending down rather than on one knee, is not cutting, but is pulling the skin off like a jacket.Bull, 304 Andrea Schiavone's Judgement of Midas in the British Royal Collection (in 2017 displayed in the Gallery at Kensington Palace), is some twenty years earlier, from c. 1548‚Äì50, and is comparable to Titian, in atmosphere and some details of the composition. Titian \\"must also have remembered elements of this painting: the pensive and abstracted attitudes of Apollo and Midas, and the radically free impressionistic brushwork used to heighten the dramatic mood of the story.\\" Apollo also plays a lira da bracchio, and Midas, as yet with normal ears, looks straight at Pan.Royal, 222, quoted. Midas's ears are \\"barely indicated\\" since later overpaint was removed in the 1990s; \\"Andrea Schiavone (c. 1510‚Äì1563), The Judgement of Midas c. 1548‚Äì50\\" Royal Collection webpage Midas or \\"Midas/Titian adopts the traditional melancholic's pose\\", which Titian would have known from Raphael's supposed portrait of Michelangelo as Heraclitus in The School of Athens, and Albrecht D√ºrer's Melencolia I, not to mention the Schiavone.Sohm, 97 Technique and style The technique is characteristic of Titian's late style. Nicholas Penny commented that there are \\"intense greens and blues and reds (vermilion as well as crimson) ... after 1560 Titian began to apply these colours in scumbles, often with his fingers, so that they only half belong to any of the forms and seem to float on the surface of the painting: evidently he painted them last. ... one can still see passages of smoky preliminary painting (notably the ghostly body of Apollo) but the blood, dogs' tongues and the ribbons in the trees are brilliant red.\\"Penny, 251 quoted. See also Rosand (2010), 23‚Äì27, and Sohm, 96‚Äì98 Describing a group of late works which he considers finished, including this,Penny, 252, but see his earlier letter in response to Gowing (below it on webpage) where he takes the opposite tack and contrasting them with the Death of Actaeon, which he considers unfinished, Penny notes \\"the impact of blurred areas of painting (... indecipherable distances, light piercing foliage) is enhanced by contrast with forms that were more fully modelled, if still often roughly painted, and, indeed, with some that were more detailed (Midas's diadem ...)\\".Penny, 252 There are strong white highlights on the knife blades, the bucket, and elsewhere, comparable with those in Tarquin and Lucretia, which Titian delivered in 1571.Rosand (2010), 24 Beyond the purely technical means, many critics have tried to articulate evocations of Titian's pictorial language in this and other very late paintings.See Sohm, 97‚Äì98 for a further example According to Sidney Freedburg, \\"the surfaces of bodies make a silvered incanescence and the atmosphere, almost unbreathably dense, is like dulled fire. ...There is a wry comedy within the cruelty, ugliness and strangeness within the magisterial beauty, and terror accompanies the sense of the sublime.\\"Freedburg, 516 For John Steer \\"it is not individual colours that tell, but an all-over emanation of broken touches, evoking a greenish-gold, that is splattered, appropriately to the theme, with reds like splotches of blood. Vision and expression are here so much one that they cannot, even for the purposes of discussion, be separated. .... Titian's intense struggle to grasp in paint, through tone and colour, the physical realities of the scene is a fundamental part of their meaning.\\"Steer in Jaff√©, 43.

Dictionary of Physical Geography. London: Penguin, 1984, p. 291. . Description Because of their often conical or inverted bowl shape, karst springs are also known in German-speaking lands as a Topf (\\"pot\\") which is reflected in names such as Aachtopf (the source of the Radolfzeller Aach) or Blautopf (the source of the Blau river in Blaubeuren). Karst springs often have a very high discharge rate, because they are often fed by underground drainage from a large catchment basin. Because the springs are usually the terminus of a cave drainage system at the place where a river cave reaches the Earth's surface, it is often possible to enter the caves from karst springs for exploration. Large karst springs are located in many parts of the world; the largest ones are believed to be in Papua New Guinea, with others located in Mediterranean countries such as Bosnia, Croatia, Turkey, Slovenia and Italy. Types Fontaine de Vaucluse An estavelle or inversac is a ground orifice which, depending on weather conditions and season, can serve either as a sink or as a source of fresh water. It is a type of sinkhole. A Vauclusian spring is a spring that originates from a shaft or a cave system, with the water surging upwards under relatively high pressure. It is named after the Fontaine de Vaucluse in southern France. Submarine karst springs, also known as , occur worldwide, and are most numerous in shallow waters of the Mediterranean Sea. They can be considered to be karst springs which have become submerged by rising sea levels.  Hydrological features A main feature of karst springs is that water is rapidly transported by caverns, so that there is minimal filtering of the water and little separation of different sediments. Groundwater emerges at the spring within a few days from precipitation. Storms, snowmelt, and general seasonal changes in rainfall have a very noticeable and rapid effect on karst springs. Many karst springs dry up during the driest part of the year, and are thus known as intermittent springs. Still others are dry most of the year round and only flow after heavy rain. Sources that only flow during wet years are often known in German as Hungerbrunnen (\\"hunger springs\\"), since folklore claimed a connection between the flow rate of a spring and poor crop yield in a wet year. This appears to be more of a culturally-related superstition, as scientific studies on various Hungerbrunnen have not confirmed such a relationship. An example is the Hungerbrunnen in the parish of Heuchlingen near Gerstetten. The properties of karst springs make them unsuitable for the supply of drinking water. Their uneven flow rate does not support a steady rate of consumption, especially in summer when there is lower discharge but higher demand. In addition, poor filtering and high hardness mean that the water quality is poor. Cultural references The French Realist painter Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) painted a number of karst springs among many landscapes he depicted in the Jura region of eastern France.

The settlement lies along the road from Ada Kasseh to the district capital Ada Foah, just off the Accra-Aflao motorway. History The Ada people first migrated from Ancient Egypt, then to Nigeria in a town called Ile-Ife, through Benin among the Fon People then to Togo, and finally to Big Ada in the Greater Accra Region (present day Ghana). Big Ada was one of the first places the Ada people settled. From there, they spread out to different settlements,Amate, C.OC. [\\"The Making of Ada\\"], 1999. but always perceived Big Ada as their home base. The village that is located on the riverbank of the Volta used to be an important trading center, profiting from the river's fantastic location. From there, goods were transported to the hinterland by canoe past the Shai and Akwamu mountains. The economic activities reached a peak around 1901 when a transportation system called the Volta River Transport System was launched. Ada's decline started with the construction of the harbor sea port in Takoradi that made the transport on the Volta River unnecessary. Today, Ada is not as popular as far as social life and economic activities are concerned. Hardly any traces of physical structures such as factories and shops remain. Services Big Ada consists of two main roads with many smaller paths in between. The area has some guesthouses, many chop bars and spots, a police station and a small library.

Malone, who owns a majority of the voting shares. History 1998 launch by Liberty Media Liberty Interactive logo Liberty Interactive was originally a division of Liberty Media; on September 28, 1998, Liberty Media announced the formation of Liberty Interactive, a division which would take advantage of new technologies such as set-top boxes to develop interactive programming. The company owned eighty-six percent of TCI Music Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: TUNE/TUNEP). As of January 1, 1999, E! Entertainment President and Chief Executive Officer Lee Masters would become the new company's CEO, and Bruce Ravenel would be Chief Technology Officer. On September 10, 1999, Liberty Media Group renamed TCI Music to Liberty Digital Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: LDIG), with the new company trading on NASDAQ's National Market tier, after Liberty Media traded most of its Internet content, interactive television assets, and rights to provide AT&T;'s cable systems with interactive services, plus cash and notes valued at $150 million, for TCI Music stock. Masters, who became Liberty Digital's CEO, told The Wall Street Journal that the new company had a value of $1 billion, $650 million of that from the interactive unit of Liberty Media, which had also used the name Liberty Digital. Liberty Digital lost $244 million with revenue of $66 million in 1999, thanks to investments in struggling Internet businesses HomeGrocer, drugstore.com, TiVo Corporation and iVillage. The company bought half of the Game Show Network because of its interactive features. On December 17, 1999, TCI Satellite Entertainment Inc. (TSAT), based in Englewood, Colorado, announced that Liberty Media was trading its interest in Sprint PCS for $300 million in TCI Satellite preferred stock. A new company, ninety percent owned by Liberty Media and ten percent owned by TCI Satellite, would combine the satellite-related businesses and take advantage of the growing area of Internet content.

In philately a wrapper is a form of postal stationery which pays the cost of the delivery of a newspaper or a periodical. The wrapper is a sheet of paper, large enough to wrap around a folded or rolled newspaper and with an imprinted stamp to pay the cost of postage. Some catalogs and reference books refer to a wrapper as postal bands which comes from the French term bandes postale.Van Gelder, Peter J.; The Collectors' Guide to Postal Stationery, A Squirel Publication (1997) Still others refer to it as a newspaper wrapperAlan K.

History  The first country to issue wrappers was the United States in October 1861,Perry, Thomas Doane, Guide to the Stamped Envelopes and Wrappers of the United States, p127, The Dietz Press, 1940 followed by New South Wales (1864), North German Confederation (1868), Victoria (1869), Romania (1870), Great Britain (1870), in total 110 countries issued wrappers.Higgins & Gage World Postal Stationery CatalogAscher, Dr Siegfried, Grosser Ganzsachen-Katalog, 1925.

That gentleman recommended that a stamped wrapper should be prepared for such newspapers as it was desired to send by post, and that each wrapper should be sold at the rate of 1d by the distributors of stamps...\\"Hansard Report, 22 May 1834 All the countries which issued wrappers have now discontinued producing them due to the declining usage. The US removed them from the official schedule on 9 October 1934 though left over stock was sold for a few years thereafter.Undersander, Dan, Ed.; Catalog of the 20th and 21st Century Stamped Envelopes and Wrappers of the United States, Third Edition, UPSS, 2011. . Most countries stopped production by 1940, some of the last countries to cease issuing wrappers were Australia in 1980, Ireland in 1984, Barbados in 1990 and Cyprus in 1991.  Collecting  In the early days of philately it was the practice to cut the stamp out and dispose of the rest of the wrapper with the result that some intact wrappers are now rare. Today, collectors prefer to collect the whole wrapper as it may have postal markings that provide interesting additional information. Stamps cut from whole postal stationery items are known as cut squares, and if used for postal purposes as cut-outs. Both are considered virtually useless to the specialist because there is as much interest in the different printed inscriptions on the postal stationery as there is in the stamp itself.Mackay, James, Stamp Collecting, p26, 1980  Stamped-to-order  W H Smith & Son, addressed to Alexandria Egypt, in addition to the impressed stamp there is an advertising ring around the stamp, the embossed stamp is dated 13.1.1882, postmarked with a special precancel postmark for W H Smith. Some countries permitted businesses and individuals to submit their own plain or printed sheets for impressing with an imprinted stamp. In Great Britain numerous businesses availed themselves of this facility and since anyone could use this service it resulted in private individuals producing \\"philatelic\\" wrappers.Chandler, John H & Dagnall, H, The Newspaper & Almanac Stamps of Great Britain & Ireland, p265, 1981, Philatelic Stamped to Order wrappers The stamping-to-order facility was introduced in Great Britain in 1855Huggins, A K, British Postal Stationery, p31, 1970 and withdrawn in 1973.

Many disk abnormalities seen on MRI that are loosely referred to as \\"herniation\\" are actually just incidental findings. These may be unrelated to any symptoms and are just bulges of the anulus fibrosus. Jensen and colleagues, in an MRI study of the lumbar spine in 98 asymptomatic adults, found that in more than half, there was a symmetrical extension of a disc (or discs) beyond the margins of the interspace (bulging). In 27 percent, there was a focal or asymmetrical extension of the disc beyond the margin of the interspace (protrusion), and in only 1 percent was there more extreme extension of the disc (extrusion or sequestration).

He survived an assassination attempt in 2010, but was seriously wounded. Early life and education Abbasi was born in Kazerun, Iran, on 11 July 1958.\\"Iranian 'nuclear scientist' killed\\", Al Jazeera, 29 November 2010 According to Mashregh News, an Iranian news website, he holds a PhD in nuclear physics. Career Abbasi was a professor of nuclear physics at Shahid Beheshti University and has reportedly been a member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. He reportedly did nuclear research at the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI). Prior to his appointment as head of the AEOI he chaired the physics department at Tehran's Imam Hossein University.ISIS online report on Abbasi, 24 June 2011 Abbasi was appointed head of AEOI by then President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on 13 February 2011 to succeed Ali Akbar Salehi. In his tenure the AEOI was unwilling to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In fact in May 2011 Fereydoon Abbasi was the recipient of a letter from the IAEA, where its Director General Yukiya Amano reiterated the agency's concerns about the \\"existence of a possible military dimension\\" to Iran's nuclear programme and stressed the importance of clarifying these issues, requesting prompt access to relevant locations, equipment, documentation and persons. In June 2011 Abbasi replied evasively, so much so that the IAEA Director could only repeat his request for credible assurances. Abbasi was removed from office on 16 August 2013 and Salehi replaced him in the post. Controversy Abbasi has regularly been linked to Iran's alleged efforts to make the nuclear weapon, a process called weaponization. According to an Institute for Science and International Security report citing an expert close to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Abbasi was a key scientist in the alleged Iranian covert nuclear weapons program headed by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi, a strong supporter of Iran's alleged nuclear weapons program. Abbasi personally directed work to calculate the yield of a nuclear weapon as well as work on high energy neutron sources, this expert added. According to the same report, the IAEA had information that Abbasi was the head of the Institute of Applied Physics (IAP), which was a follow-on organization to the Physics Research Center. Both of the organizations acted as fronts for scientific work on a possible Iranian nuclear weapons program. Designation by the UN Abbasi is \\"listed in an annex to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1747 of 24 March 2007, as a person involved in Iran's nuclear or ballistic missile activities\\". This resolution imposes an asset freeze and travel notification requirements. Abbasi is described as a \\"Senior Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) scientist with links to the Institute of Applied Physics, working closely with Mahabadi (also designated by the UN). Assassination attempt On 29 November 2010, Abbasi was seriously wounded and narrowly survived an assassination attempt on a Tehran street, as a man on a motorbike attached a bomb to his car as he drove to work.Survivor of Attack Leads Iran‚Äôs Nuclear Acceleration - The New York TimesIsrael‚Äôs role in assassinations of nuclear scientists - Tehran TimesIranian nuclear scientist killed in motorbike attack - BBC NewsMajor Media Suppressing Obama Assassination Story ‚Äì American Free Press A separate similar bomb attack the same day killed another scientist, Dr. Majid Shahriari, who also taught at Shahid Beheshti University.Bomb blast blamed on Israel and US kills Iran nuclear scientist, The Independent, 30 November 2010  See also  * Atomic Energy Organization of Iran References External links |- Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:People from Kazerun Category:Iranian physicists Category:International Atomic Energy Agency officials Category:Imam Hossein University faculty Category:Shahid Beheshti University alumni Category:YEKTA Front politicians Category:Presidents of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran ","title":"Fereydoon Abbasi"},{"id":"29857119","text":"Gra≈ºyna Pstroko≈Ñska-Nawratil (born 16 July 1947) is a Polish composer and music educator.

It achieves this through research on topics such as: epistemology, policy, assessment, pedagogy, diversity, amongst others, as they pertain to engineering. History and background Engineering education research gained visibility during the 1980s, although the formal education of engineers in the United States traces back to as early as 1802, with the establishment of the United States Military Academy at West Point for the purpose of training the U.S. Army's corps of engineers.Noble, D. F. (1979). America by design: Science, technology, and the rise of corporate capitalism.Reynolds, Terry S.

This focus was primarily motivated by the need to improve the quality of engineers produced by universities in the US. Additionally, 1993 marked the relaunch of the Journal of Engineering Education, which served as a clearinghouse for scholarly research. As concerns regarding globalization and the need for innovation increased during the late 1990s and 2000s, engineering education research was influenced by calls of reform to produce the quantity and diversity of engineers needed to address global problems. Continuing the development of the field, centers for engineering education research emerged in the early 2000s. The NAE formed a Committee on Engineering Education (CEE) in 1999, NAE‚Äôs Center for the Advancement of Scholarship on Engineering Education (CASEE) was established in 2002 and the Center for the Advancement of Engineering in 2003. During the mid-2000s, dedicated funding, specialized publications, centers for research, academic preparation and conferences which connected the distributed community supplied the infrastructure necessary for the burgeoning field of research.

Global engineering cultures In 2008, a project titled \\"The Engineering Cultures Multimedia Project\\" was approved by the NSF. It was done by combine effort of \\"Virginia Tech and Colorado School of Mines to produce CD-based modules exploring how what counts as an engineer and engineering knowledge varies from country to country\\". https://globalhub.org/topics/AboutEngineeringCultures The main goal of this project was \\"To develop, disseminate, and assess learning experiences that will help students to identify, understand, and value perspectives other than their own.\\"https://globalhub.org/topics/EngineeringCultures  Pre- college engineering education  Studies indicate that engineers will be better prepared for rigorous study in the engineering sciences if exposed to engineering concepts in the years prior to university study. The following resources have been listed to provide primary- and secondary-level educators with information and online programs that will aide them in bringing engineering material to their classrooms.  Methodology  ‚ÄúRigorous‚Äù research in engineering education is defined as adherence to the National Research Council‚Äôs six guiding principles for scientific inquiry.Borrego, M. (2007). \\"Conceptual difficulties experienced by trained engineers learning educational research methods.\\" Journal of Engineering Education. 96(2): 91. The six guiding principles for scientific inquiry are:Shavelson, R., and L. Towne, Scientific Research in Education, Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, 2002. Scientific Research in Education, Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, 2002. # Pose significant questions that can be investigated empirically. # Link research to relevant theory. # Use methods that permit direct investigation of the question. # Provide explicit, coherent chain of reasoning. # Replicate and generalize across studies. # Disclose research to encourage professional scrutiny and critique.  Connection to practice  Engineering education research is conducted based on the demands and patterns of engineering in industry, policy, and education. Globally, emphasis of research focuses on educational application. Research into industry and practice have yet to gain greater attention.Jesiek, B. K., Borrego, M., & Beddoes, K. (2010) \\"Advancing global capacity for engineering education research (AGCEER): relating research to practice, policy, and industry.\\" Journal of Engineering Education. 99 (2): 107-119.  Policy  In the United States, there has been a greater push for development of formal policy for educating engineers. In 1918, the Mann Report noted an imminent lack of qualified engineers that could rapidly enter the workforce. There should be more hands-on experience, engineering educators should have practical work experience, and teaching should be more prominent even though research is also important. In 1955, the Grinter report specifically outlined undergraduate and graduate level engineering studies. Since then, some of these suggestions, including the senior capstone design course, have been implemented in public and private engineering institutions. Engineering education policy is externally driven to some degree. ABET accreditation has incorporated industrial demands as part of the accreditation process. ABET EC 2000 emphasizes both technical (design, problem solving) and professional skills (teamwork, communication, ethical/global thinking). P-12 Educational Standards: National policies such as No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top have influenced the recruitment and retention of future engineers. In April 2013, the Next Generation Science Standards were released as the science standards for K-12 science education in the United States to replace the National Science Education Standards. These include engineering-based standards embedded within the science standards. The National Assessment Governing Board has created a Technology and Literacy Framework for the 2014 National Assessment of Educational Progress. This will be a pilot test and may turn into a permanent fixture of future testing.  Educational  There is a disconnect between engineering education research findings and implementation of the findings into the classroom. Research findings are published in a variety of journals primarily read by other researchers, not P-12 teachers or university faculty outside of the Education field. This breakdown of transfer between research and practice prevents the desired outcomes at the heart of the researchAmerican Society for Engineering Education, 2009 There have been proposals to connect Engineering Education practice and Engineering Education research. A cyclical model of transfer between research and practice has been proposed by Jesiek et al. (2010) and Borrego & Bernhard (2011). This model allows research and practice to continuously influence and develop one another.

It is a Grade II* listed building. History Osborne had been built between 1845 and 1851 for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert as a summer home and rural retreat. The estate outgrew the former house stables and in 1859 Prince Albert designed the current Stable Block Quadrangle himself. The builder was Thomas Cubitt, the London architect and builder whose company built the main fa√ßade of Buckingham Palace for the royal couple in 1847. The stables were constructed to a quadrangular floor plan of rendered brick with a state roof. A central 2 storey entrance pavilion with an arched entrance is flanked on both sides by two storey (formerly one storey) wings of 8 bays. The Royal Naval College, Osborne Queen Victoria died in January 1901. Following her death, Osborne house became surplus to royal requirements and was given by King Edward VII to the state with a few rooms retained as a private royal museum dedicated to Queen Victoria. In 1903, part of the estate, the Stable Block being the hub, became a junior officer training college for the Royal Navy known as the Royal Naval College, Osborne. Initial training began at the age of 13, and further studies were continued at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. The College closed in 1921, with the last students leaving on 9 April 1921. Former students included Queen Victoria's great-grandsons, the future Edward VIII and George VI, and their younger brother George, Duke of Kent. Another well-known alumnus of the college was Jack Llewelyn Davies, one of the five Llewelyn Davies boys who inspired J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan. Davies ‚Äî whose brothers all went to Eton ‚Äî described his five years at Osborne as horrendous. The case of George Archer-Shee from 1908, who was expelled from Osborne after being falsely accused of stealing a 5-shilling postal order, inspired the play The Winslow Boy. The VADS In 1927 the Red Cross voluntary aid detachment nurses from all over the United Kingdom were allowed to use the old naval college buildings for their summer training camp. In 1934 the camps stopped as the former naval college dormitory blocks were being demolished. Saunders Roe Ltd In 1942 the Stable Block was commandeered by the Government for the war effort to provide a Head Office and design/drawing offices for Saunders Roe Ltd. At the end of the war the company took out a long lease with the Crown Estates. The company and its successors operated there for forty-five years. The products that emerged from the work undertaken there included the largest aeroplane in the world in its time, the only jet-powered seaplane, the fastest aircraft of its time, the first and largest Hovercraft, development of the nation's only successful space vehicle, components for the fastest car in the world. During 1942 part of the Stable Block was bombed. Fall into disrepair From 1987 until 1999 the Stable Block fell into disrepair and most of the buildings became semi derelict. 300px Vectis Storage & Business centre In 1999 Mr & Mrs Harrison obtained a long lease from the Crown Estates and operated their storage business from one of the usable buildings. Part of their agreement with the Crown estates was to bring the Stable Block up to a good state of repair. Since 1999 the Stable Block and surrounding buildings have been transformed into a small business park. The Stable Block and quadrangle have been greatly restored and it is hoped will continue to make history during this century.

Education and career From 1975 to 1981 Jenkins was an assistant archaeologist for the Museum of Natural History at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and a student of Claude Warren. Jenkins earned a Bachelor of Arts from the university in 1977 and a Master of Arts in 1981.

In 1986, Jenkins began work in the Fort Rock Basin. The Oregon State Museum of Anthropology hired him in 1987. Jenkins received a Ph.D. from the University of Oregon in 1991. During his four years as field director of the Fort Irwin Archaeological Project, his work on the late Pleistocene and early Holocene epochs in the Mojave Desert resulted in his doctoral thesis Site Structure and Chronology of 37 Lake Mojave and Pinto Assemblages from Two Large Multicomponent Sites in the Central Mojave Desert, Southern California. Since 1987, Jenkins has worked on Oregon Department of Transportation archaeological projects. Jenkins' primary areas of research include the ancient peoples of the Americas, particularly hunter-gatherers in the Great Basin. Techniques include obsidian sourcing and hydration analysis. His Paisley Caves excavation recovered the oldest known human remains on which carbon dating has been performed. Four years after Jenkins' work in 2002, prehistoric DNA expert Eske Willerslev analyzed his samples. Using mass spectrometry on mitochondrial DNA from coprolites, the research determined that people in haplogroups A2 and B2 lived in south central Oregon 12,300 radiocarbon years B.P., about one thousand years earlier than the accepted date for the Clovis culture. The new date of earliest human settlement, after publication in 2008, became accepted by many scientists.

Key (c. 1545-c. 1589): Portrait of a Calvinist Painter, Brepols, 2007 Research has demonstrated that contrary to what was believed traditionally, his family name was not Key and he was no relation of Willem Key. He only adopted the Key family name after taking over the workshop of Willem Key in 1567. Before that time he only used the monogram AT and the artist was referred to solely as Adriaen Thomasz.

Tillemans, 'Biografische gegevens over de schilder Willem Key (1915‚Äì68) en zijn familie', Gentse Bijdragen tot de Kunstgeschiedenis 25 (1979-'80), p. 66 It is clear that the reason why he adopted the family name is that Willem Key and his workshop enjoyed a high reputation and using Key as his family name was a good branding tool for his own work.Anna Tummers, Koenraad Jonckheere, Art Market and Connoisseurship: A Closer Look at Paintings by Rembrandt, Rubens and Their Contemporaries, Amsterdam University Press, 2008, pp. 51‚Äì52 Adoration of the Magi He was likely born in Antwerp around 1544. His father's first name was Thomas.De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde van 1453‚Äì1615, edited and published by Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, Antwerp, 1872‚Äì1876, p. 210, 275, 284, 302, 328, 335 He trained initially under the glass painter Jan Hack III and was registered as a pupil at the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in the guild year 1558.De Rubens a Van Dyck. La pintura flamenca en la colecci√≥n Gerstenmaier, El Museo Nacional de San Carlos, 2016, pp. 64‚Äì69 He became linked to the workshop of Willem Key at an early age and Willem Key is regarded as another master of Adriaen. The Habsburg Netherlands were at the time affected by the Beeldenstorm (Iconoclastic Fury) that commenced in the early 1560s and reached its peak in 1566. During the period of iconoclasm, Catholic art and many forms of church fittings and decoration were destroyed by nominally Calvinist Protestant crowds who supported the Protestant Reformation. Antwerp was also affected by the wave of destruction. Key was able to emerge as one of the leading painters in Antwerp in the second half of the sixteenth century after the iconoclasm had abated. He was admitted as a master painter in the Guild in 1567. Portrait of a 27-year-old woman with a bouquet of flowers, flowers by Ludger tom Ring the Younger When Willem Key died in 1568, Adriaen Thomasz took over his workshop. Although he had converted to Calvinism he did not leave Antwerp after the Fall of Antwerp in 1585 when the Calvinist government of Antwerp was overthrown by Spanish forces led by Alessandro Farnese. He received pupils in his workshop in 1582, 1588 and 1589. He received commissions from the leader of the Dutch Revolt William of Orange and the socio-economic elite of Antwerp. He is last mentioned in a document in 1589. It is not clear whether he died soon after or left Antwerp because of his Calvinist opinions. Work Key was mainly a painter of portraits and altarpieces. He was active to a lesser extent as a printmaker. As some of his works are signed and some are dated is has been possible to reconstruct the painter's career. His dated works span the period from 1572 to 1580. No notable stylistic evolution can be seen throughout his career. His style, which is sometimes referred to as Mannerist, is very close to that of Willem Key particularly in the religious scenes. Some works cannot be attributed to either artist with certainty due to this similarity. Willem Key's style in turn can be described as being close to that of the leading painters of Antwerp of his time, such as Frans Floris and Michiel Coxie the Elder, who were both so-called Romanist painters. The Romanists were 16th century artists from the Low Countries who had travelled to Rome. In Rome they had absorbed the influence of leading Italian artists of the period such as Michelangelo and Raphael and his pupils. Upon their return home, these Northern artists created a Renaissance style, which assimilated Italian formal language.Ilja M. Veldman. \\"Romanism.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 23 June 2020 Portrait of an unknown family In his portraits, the sitters are typically represented at half-, bust- or three quarter-length and against a neutral background. They are painted with great technical perfection and fidelity to nature. His brushwork gives an almost photographic representation of the subject while he has an impeccable eye for rendering details accurately. These qualities are on full display in his portrait of William the Silent, leader of the revolt against Spain. This work exists in three versions, one in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, one in the Mauritshuis in The Hague and third one in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid. Only the latter version is dated and was painted in 1579. All three are considered autograph and to go back to a now lost original. There are some minor differences between the versions in some details. The sitter is posed against a dark background against which the flesh tones of the face, the white ruff and the elegant grey and gold decoration of his clothes stand out. The face is rendered with much detail in line with the Northern portraiture of the period.Mar Borobia, Adriaen Thomasz. Key, William I, Prince of Orange, known as William the Silent at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum At the time this portrait was painted, William the Silent was at the height of his career. This can also be seen in the portrait. He is not shown in armour, but in neat and opulent civilian clothes. In this portrait from Key's later period, the influence of Antonis Mor is shown in its increased interest in conveying the sitter's social status. The head of St John the Baptist In his group and family portraits Key shows his originality. This is demonstrated in his Portrait of an unknown family (Museo del Prado, 1583, monogrammed ATK). In this group portrait of a Flemish bourgeois family Key has placed the father and his six children very close together so that they occupy almost the entire canvas and acquire a monumental character. The sitters are distributed in a symmetrical and balanced manner. The ruffs and white caps and the direction of the light attract the attention of the viewer to the individual faces of the family members. The father is seated on a leather chair, before a table covered with a red carpet, on which are placed an hourglass, a skull and a book. The children are standing in two planes according to their age with the females on the left and the males on the right. Key enlivens the picture by placing the children in various poses. The two youngest look at their father, the boy holding a book opened in one hand and resting the other on the father's chair, while the girl has placed one hand on the hourglass and the other on her father's shoulder. The skull on which one hand of the father rests and the hourglass evoke the theme of vanitas, i.e. the philosophical view that the passage of time and the fleeting nature of things will ultimately lead to death. This motif also evokes the absent wife and mother whose death unites the family in grief.P. Silva Maroto, Adriaen Thomasz. Key, Family portrait in: El retrato del Renacimiento, Museo Nacional del Prado, 2008, p. 234 In his religious and devotional works, Key reacted to the objections raised by his Calvinist brethren who had launched the destruction of religious art on religious grounds during the Beeldenstorm of 1566. His solution was to abandon the iconographic tradition and to return to the language of the bible as a source. This led him to limit the iconography in his religious works to a minimum. An example of this is his Last Supper (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 1575, monogrammed) in which he re-invests this famous scene from the bible using the device of the portrait histori√©, i.e. depicting historical figures through contemporary figures, including himself. In the Last Supper Saint Peter and the brown-haired apostle behind Judas are clearly historical figures while the servant is possibly a self-portrait in the servant on the right. Similarly, in the Adoration of the Magi (Lempertz (Cologne) 11 May 2013 auction, lot 1019) the head of the young man with individualised facial features in the upper left corner may be a self- portrait. In leaving out the African king, Key has also strictly followed the biblical sources which do not mention such a king.Adriaen Thomasz. Key, Adoration of the Magi at Lempertz File:Adriaen Thomasz.

Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon, orders the Israelites Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to be cast into a furnace for refusing to worship his golden idol. When their captors try to execute the sentence they are themselves killed by the heat while the Israelites remain unharmed. The woodcut contains many of the elements in Philips Galle's engraving of Nebuchadnezzar Casting the Children of Israel into the Fiery Furnace after a design by Maarten van Heemskerck, but with an increased emphasis on the role of the king. Nebuchadnezzar is in the center of the composition, both arms extended, while the Israelites in the furnace are in the background. The message of the bible story and the woodcut is to show that through God's grace his obedient worshippers are saved while the unfaithful perish.Nancy Ann Bialler, Chiaroscuro Woodcuts: Hendrick Goltzius (1558‚Äì1617) and His Time, Rijksmuseum, 1992, pp. 51‚Äì52 References External links * Category:1540s births Category:1590s deaths Category:Flemish Renaissance painters Category:Flemish history painters Category:Flemish portrait painters Category:Flemish printmakers Category:Flemish draughtsmen Category:Artists from Antwerp Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke ","title":"Adriaen Thomasz Key"},{"id":"29857455","text":"Mendozahippus is an extinct genus of notohippid notoungulate which existed in Mendoza, Argentina, during the late Oligocene.

Derived from the Greek word for public speaking, rhetoric's original concern dealt primarily with the spoken word. Aristotle wrote a philosophical work that still has major scholarly impact, Rhetoric, in which he identifies five canons of the field of rhetoric: invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery. Invention is concerned with the content or idea being expressed, and relates to the rhetorician's understanding of his goals. Arrangement deals with issues of how to best organize an argument in order to attain the speaker or writer's goals. It is closely related to style, the third element, which relates to gestures, metaphors, and word choices selected to best influence the audience and reach the desired goal. Memory is the fourth and simplest element of rhetoric in being related specifically to spoken rhetoric, specifically concerned with remembering the words in one's speech. Finally, delivery concerns tone, word choice, posture and other such bodily signs that influence the effect of one's words on an audience. Rhetorical theory is the body of thought about human symbol use. The term rhetoric, in its popular usage, typically has negative connotations. Rhetoric is contrasted with action; it is empty words, talk without substance, mere ornament. This contemporary understanding of rhetoric is at odds with a long history of rhetorical theory, dating back in the West to ancient Greece and Rome, that provides a long-standing foundation on which the contemporary discipline of communication is built. From 1870 to 1900, as the American college system moved from small schools to a larger, diverse set of universities with distinct academic disciplines, the field of composition studies grew from traditional rhetorical studies. As pioneers in the field of composition studies, Harvard University enacted a new program in their English department that, for the first time, made \\"a total commitment to writing,\\" though the initial focus was on personal writing and did not include rhetoric or literary analysis.Brereton, John C., ed. \\"Introduction.\\" The Origins of Composition Studies in the American College, 1875‚Äì1925: A Documentary History. Pittsburgh: U of P Press, 1995. Print. However, the field of composition studies soon became paired with the field of rhetoric as the modern university developed, because scholars began to realize that elements of rhetoric and not \\"systematic grammatical study\\" were necessary to improve writing and composition abilities.Winterowd, W. Ross. \\"Discovery- Invention- Creation.\\" The English Department: A Personal and Institutional History. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1998. 32‚Äì74. Print. While rhetoric traditionally concerned matters related to verbal orations or speeches, both rhetoric and composition are related to the expression of ideas, often in an attempt to influence one's audience. In addition, composition is also concerned with the principles of invention, arrangement, style, and delivery traditionally associated with rhetoric; even memory can become an element of composition when one is writing a speech or a scholarly paper to be delivered orally. Thus, rhetoric and composition‚Äîcolloquially termed \\"rhet/comp\\" or \\"comp/rhet\\"‚Äîbecame a field of its own and remains a burgeoning discipline in universities today. Current-traditional rhetoric The rhetoric and composition pedagogy developed in the late nineteenth century, and still used in many schools today, is known as current-traditional rhetoric, commonly referred to among field scholars, and hereinafter, as \\"CTR\\". CTR is defined by an emphasis on the final product, usually the five-paragraph, informal essay or short research paper on an objective topic. In addition, CTR centers around the notion that discourse is delivered in a prescribed, mechanical form, leading to its pedagogical focus on grammar, spelling, syntax, and uniform style and arrangement. Further, CTR promotes the idea that the purpose of writing is the product, which is expected to reflect a predefined, stagnant reality without consideration for process, authorial identity, or audience. For example, a CTR pedagogue might instruct his or her students to write an essay on bicycles; the expected outcome is an objective discussion of bicycles organized in a five-paragraph essay, the identity of the audience or the writer is not to be considered, and the goal is the final product‚Äîthe \\"essay\\"‚Äî which should have no errors (or even intentional boundary-breakers) in grammar, spelling, or design. James Berlin and Robert Inkster examine typical CTR textbooks and evaluate their limited approach to teaching composition, concluding that CTR limits \\"discovery procedures,\\" diminishes the \\"importance of the writer,\\" and restricts writer engagement with audience.Berlin, James A., and Robert P. Inkster. \\"Current-Traditional Rhetoric: Paradigm and Practice.\\" Freshman English News 8.3 (1980): 1‚Äì14. Print. Likewise, W. Ross Winterowd similarly contends that the pedagogy of CTR is dated and ultimately ineffective in his examination of a number of current-traditional textbooks.Winterowd, W. Ross. \\"Current-Traditional Textbooks: Take in Small Doses and Shake Well Before Using.\\" The English Department: A Personal and Institutional History. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1998. 75‚Äì100. Print. CTR as pedagogy has been almost universally employed by schools since its inception in the late nineteenth century. Until the 1960s its limitations and ineffectiveness received little criticism. However, the 1966 Dartmouth Conference reflected an influx of new scholarly ideas about composition studies that introduced the ideas of process over product and the notion that teachers should serve as guides in the composition process rather than dictatorial authority figures. Since then, the main elements of composition pedagogy have been defined and explored by countless scholars, and the concepts associated with CTR have been replaced by a wealth of pedagogical approaches to the field of rhetoric and composition. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the field of rhetoric and composition saw a process revolution, fueled by two distinct pedagogies: expressivism, both moderate and radical, and cognitivism. Moderate expressivism and radical expressivism The composition pedagogy of moderate expressivism is characterized by a focus on language as a tool for personal rather than social expression, based on the process theory of composition, a belief that the process of writing should be more important than the final product. Further, moderate expressivist pedagogy calls for fewer grammatical standards and an increased focus on the writer's process of discovery and expression. W.E. Coles, Jr. suggests that teaching writing should be approached as teaching art, with the teacher serving as facilitator or guide for the student-writer's free expression; he also calls for classroom practices such as peer-reviews, class discussions, and the absence of grades, in order to best guide the self-identification he sees as crucial to the writing process.Coles, Jr., W.E. \\"The Teaching of Writing as Writing.\\" College English 29.2 (1967): 111‚Äì16. Print. Fellow moderate expressivist Donald Murray maintains that writing is a process of discovery and experimentation, a search for truth in a specious world; his manifesto- like essay provides an apt summation of the arguments against the dated pedagogy of CTR.Murray, Donald. \\"Teach Writing as a Process Not Product.\\" The Leaflet (Fall 1972): 11‚Äì14. Print. Likewise, Maxine Hairston recognizes the paradigm shift occurring in rhetoric and composition and calls for a non- prescriptive atmosphere in teaching, including less focus on grammar and syntax and, again, more concern with the process of growth experienced by the writer.Hairston, Maxine. \\"The Winds of Change: Thomas Kuhn and the Revolution in the Teaching of Writing.\\" College Composition and Communication 33.1 (1982): 76‚Äì88. Print. Peter Elbow reflects moderate expressivist ideals in his claim that audience should be ignored during the early stages of the writing process, in order to avoid the hindrance of audience expectation and facilitate writer-based rather than reader-based text. Elbow writes, \\"It's not that writers should never think about their audience. It's a question of when.\\"Elbow, Peter. \\"Closing My Eyes As I Speak: An Argument for Ignoring Audience.\\" College English 49.1 (1987): 50‚Äì69. Print. Simply put, moderate expressivism promotes the notion of process over product, a pedagogy that evolved in the height of the 1960s and in many ways reflects the ideologies of the era in its emphasis on freedom, expression, discovery, and a search for the writer's authentic self. Radical expressivism evolved from the pedagogical ideals of moderate expressivism, and its primary difference lies in its focus on group, rather than individual, development and expression. For example, In 1966, Susan Sontag published a collection of essays in which she stresses the importance of Happenings, \\"a cross between art exhibit and theatrical performance,\\" in order to facilitate a sense of group identity, community, and engagement with audience through a shared, unique artistic experience.Sontag, Susan. \\"Happenings: An Art of Radical Juxtaposition.\\" Against Interpretation and Other Essays. New York: Picador, 2001. 263‚Äì74. Print. Radical expressivists Charles Deemer and William Lutz also suggest that English composition should be taught as and considered a sort of Happening. Deemer locates the problem with the composition course in its lack of subject content and asserts that writing demands inspiration that can be attained from teacher-induced Happenings, as \\"clear writing and clear thought follow only after clear experiences.\\"Deemer, Charles. \\"English Composition as a Happening.\\" College English 29.2 (1967): 121‚Äì26. Print. Lutz' claims are similar to those of Deemer, noting the need for creative inspiration in the classroom, a typically stagnant environment in which he claims nothing creative can be taught; he argues for the employment of Happenings in the English classroom in order to \\"make the student respond directly to his own experience and not someone else's.\\"Lutz, William D. \\"Making Freshman English a Happening.\\" College Composition and Communication 22.1 (1971): 35‚Äì8. Print. Other such pedagogues include Marshall McLuhan, who presents the idea of using hot, engaging media when teaching rather than cold, sterile media in the classroom,McLuhan, Marshall. \\"Media Hot and Cold.\\" Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man. Ed. Terrence W. Gordon. Corte Madera, CA : Gingko Press, 2003. 22‚Äì32. Print. and Geoffrey Sirc, who promotes an avant-garde approach to composition pedagogy by encouraging students' exuberant, unpolished expressions in writing. Sirc can almost be considered a \\"post-social turn\\" theorist; his 1980s research claims that the traditional classroom space is confining and argues that the language of \\"Main Street\\" should be encouraged in student writing, attacking the idea of suitable \\"academic\\" writing presented by theorists like David Bartholomae.Sirc, Geoffrey. \\"Writing Classroom as A & P Parking Lot.\\" English Composition as a Happening. Logan: Utah State UP, 2002. 185‚Äì235. Print. Furthermore, in his own English classroom, Sirc employs the study of rap music and its cultural and racial implications; he views rap music as \\"loaded with language, desire, style, and humanity\\" and imbued with poetry he describes as \\"blunt narratives of the human heart,\\" teaching students about truth, communication, and reality and effectively strengthening their writing.Sirc, Geoffrey. \\"Stagolee as Writing Instructor.\\" Enculturation 4.2 (2002): n. pag. Web. 24 Nov. 2010. . Thus, while retaining many of the ideals of individuality and uninhibited expression associated with Moderate Expressivism, the composition pedagogy of radical expressivism is distinguished by its focus on group reality and community experience, belief in the art and inspirational potential of the Happening, and view that popular media can potentially be used as a pedagogical tool. Cognitivism The pedagogy of cognitivism prevalent in the early 1970s and early 1980s also promotes the idea of process over product, but it is a more scientific approach to composition studies and is opposed to moderate expressivism in many ways. Abstractly speaking, cognitivists believe that thinking exists in the mind apart from language and are concerned with understanding how language‚Äîor writing‚Äîis developed from mental processes of the mind. Cognitivists are primarily concerned with the goals of a writer, the decisions made during the writing process by the mind. Andrea Lunsford addresses the importance of understanding the cognitive mental faculties involved during composition, claiming that the best way to facilitate the writing process is through workshops and discussion rather than lecture-based instruction.Lunsford, Andrea. \\"Cognitive Development and the Basic Writer.\\" College English 41.1 (1979): 38‚Äì46. Print. Researchers like cognitivist Sondra Perl conduct extensive studies of the composing process and the stages through which a writer goes in order to better understand how to teach writing.Perl, Sondra. \\"The Composing Process of Unskilled College Writers.\\" Research in the Teaching of English 13.4 (1979): 317‚Äì36. Print. Cognitivists Linda Flower and John Hayes see an exigency in composition studies to understand how and why a writer makes the choices they do during the writing process. Their research led them to claim that writing is a non-linear, hierarchal, goal-driven process. In addition, they concentrate their study of composition on the protocol of the writing process, including planning, translating, embedding, and reviewing.Flower, Linda, and John R. Hayes. \\"A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing.\\" College Composition and Communication 32.4 (1981): 365‚Äì87. Print. While like expressivists in their greater concern with the process of writing than with the final product, distinguishing them from the essay-driven pedagogy of current-traditional rhetoric, cognitivism proposes a more scientific approach by studying universal cognitive faculties of the mind in order to better understand the composition process. Social constructionism Unlike cognitivism, social constructionism, or the \\"social turn\\" in composition pedagogy, which evolved the 1980s, is distinguished by the belief that language and the mind are inseparable, as an individual needs language in order to even think. Social constructionist theories also promote the idea that writing is inherently political in nature and that writers are each a part of a particular community of dialogue, or discourse community, with an assumed set of principles and a distinct language of its own. Patricia Bizzell directly attacks the early cognitivist contention that writing can be understood as distinct sets of mental processes, criticizing \\"inner-directed\\" theorists like Flowers and Hayes for focusing too much on the individual writer's language and learning processes and overlooking the importance of society and discourse communities in composition; on the other hand, \\"outer- directed\\" theorists like Bizzell recognize the extent to which thinking and language are conditioned by the social context and intended audience being addressed by the writer. Writing, Bizzell claims, \\"takes place within a community,\\" and in order to improve composition, teachers should \\"explain what the community's conventions are.\\"Bizzell, Patricia. \\"Cognition, Convention, and Certainty: What We Need to Know about Writing.\\" PRE/TEXT 3.3 (1982): 213‚Äì43. Print. Social constructionist James Porter notes the \\"intertextuality\\" of all writing as interdependent, based on the principle that all speech and writing evolves from presumed meaning and accepted evidence as defined by each \\"discourse community,\\" which Porter defines as \\"a group of individuals bound by a common interest who communicate through approved channels and whose discourse is regulated.\\"Porter, James E. \\"Intertextuality and the Discourse Community.\\" Rhetoric Review 5.1 (1986): 34‚Äì47. Print. Joseph Harris agrees with Porter, maintaining that writing is community-driven and noting that the purpose in writing is drawn from \\"being part of some ongoing discourse.\\" However, Harris qualifies his argument by noting that, while writers act not as isolated individuals but as members of discourse communities with certain language, practices, and beliefs, the notion that academic or other discourse communities are \\"discursive utopias\\" existing without conflict is irrational.Harris, Joseph. \\"The Idea of Community in the Study of Writing.\\" College Composition and Communication 40.1 (1989): 11‚Äì22. Print. David Bartholomae suggests that students must be assimilated to a specialized discourse in order to write; he writes that students \\"have to invent the university by assembling and mimicking its language,\\" learning the \\"requirements of [academic] convention,\\" and understanding the \\"history of a discipline\\" in order to successfully write and communicate within that discipline.Bartholomae, David. \\"Inventing the University.\\" When a Writer Can't Write: Studies in Writer's Block and Other Composing Process Problems. Ed. Mike Rose. New York: Guilford, 1985. 273‚Äì85. Print. Suggesting an existing conflict between academics and writers, Peter Elbow argues that writing students should not be exposed to the dialogic discourse of academia, as it can be intimidating and ineffective; instead, Elbow suggests that students read and study each other's writings in the early stages of composition, in order to facilitate a sense of monologic freedom by focusing on the students' own unique voices.Elbow, Peter. \\"Being a Writer vs. Being an Academic: A Conflict in Goals.\\" College Composition and Communication 46.1 (1995): 72‚Äì83. Print. The social turn in composition pedagogy witnessed a move for community ideology and a newfound acknowledgment of the social, economic, and political forces that affect writers and discourse. James Berlin states, \\"The question of ideology has never been far from discussions of writing instruction in the modern American college,\\" and he notes that the writing classroom has always been a place for addressing questions pertaining to ideological subject matter such as class, race, economics, and civil rights. He proposes what is known as a social-epistemic model of writing instruction, in which the socially- constructed nature of knowledge and knowing is recognized. Berlin notes that \\"social epistemic rhetoric views knowledge as an arena of ideological conflict,\\" and such a writing pedagogy \\"offers an explicit critique of economic, political, and social arrangements.\\"Berlin, James A. \\"Rhetoric and Ideology in the Writing Class.\\" College English 50.5 (1988): 477‚Äì93. Print. Overall, the social turn in composition pedagogy represented a move for increased recognition of rhetorical discourse communities, the social, cultural, and political forces that influence the classroom, and the ways that ideology affects writers and the writing classroom. Critical pedagogy Critical pedagogy was the next phase of pedagogical development in the field of composition studies, and its ideas evolved in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Lisa Delpit explores the way that power works in the classroom, shaped by varied socioeconomic and cultural conditions of students and teachers, results in alienation and miscommunication in the classroom that she terms the \\"silenced dialogue.\\" Delpit names five specific aspects of the current 'culture of power' that defines the conflicting power dynamic in the classrooms.Delpit, Lisa D. \\"The Silenced Dialogue: Power and Pedagogy in Educating Other People's Children.\\" Harvard Educational Review 58.3 (1998): 280‚Äì98. Print. Paulo Freire criticizes the oppressive nature of education and the current educational system's use of the \\"banking model\\" approach to teaching, wherein students serve as depositories for information provided to them by the teacher. While Delpit suggests that the oppressed should be provided with the necessary skills to enable them to enter the culture of power, Freire demands a transformation of the culture of power through revolutionary, practical literary training. Furthermore, Freire posits that human beings are situated in certain temporal and spatial conditions that define who they are, either oppressor or oppressed, and he suggests that dialogue defines humanity.Freire, Paulo. Pedagogy of the Oppressed. New York: Continuum Books, 1993. Print. Likewise, Elizabeth Ellsworth discusses the oppressive myths that perpetuate power dynamics in the classroom, including racism on campuses. She calls for a new critical pedagogy \\"of the unknowable,\\" suggesting a need to recognize the absence of universal notions of dialogue, rationality, or knowledge, and instead openly acknowledge the many differing social groups and discourse communities in every classroom.Ellsworth, Elizabeth. 'Why Doesn't This Feel Empowering?: Working Through the Repressive Myths of Critical Pedagogy.\\" Harvard Educational Review 59.3 (1989): 297‚Äì324. Print. Thus, critical pedagogy can be seen as/in an activist pedagogy, taking into account political inequalities and empowering students to take action through their writing. Post-structuralism The pedagogy of post- structuralism is marked by an attempt to redefine rhetoric as it relates to composition, drawing on post-modern ideology calling for new ideas in a modern world. For example, Victor Vitanza suggests that writing is an entity of its own, existing apart from institutions, social mores, and even writers. He believes that the intention of writing should be to infect the reader with new ideas that disrupt the rational, controlled world. Vitanza also notes that writing can be seen as a metadiscipline, as rhetoric applies to any field in which the artist attempts to convey a message, including photography and choreography, as writing is a performative and not authoritative act.Vitanza, Victor J. \\"Abandoned to Writing: Notes Toward Several Provocations.\\" Enculturation 5.1 (2003): n. pag. Web. 14 Nov. 2010. . Sharon Crowley views rhetoric as invention and discovery by identifying the available means of persuasion in making one's argument. Furthermore, Crowley believes rhetoric has a civic purpose, as it changes the society in which it is engaged; she attests that rhetoric is the art of giving effectiveness to truth, and notes that it is persuasive and always moving.Crowley, Sharon. \\"Composition is not Rhetoric.\\" Enculturation 5.1 (2003): n. pag. Web. 14 Nov. 2010. . Conclusion The fields of composition and rhetoric remain in flux, as scholars continue to debate regarding appropriate pedagogical methods and the best approach to teaching the art of writing. Since the post-structuralism movement in composition pedagogy, there has been an explosion of discussion in the field of composition pedagogy. More recent ideas in composition pedagogy include the notion of rhetoric's relationship to travel, on which pedagogues such as Gregory ClarkClark, Gregory \\"Writing as Travel, or Rhetoric on the Road.\\" College Composition and Communication 49.1 (1998): 9‚Äì23. Print. and Nedra ReynoldsReynolds, Nedra. \\"Who's Going to Cross this Border? Travel Metaphors, Material Conditions, and Contested Places.\\" JAC 20.3 (2000): 541‚Äì64. Print. have written. In addition, composition studies is an umbrella term for the considerations of writing pedagogy. In its academic application, it is post-modern or post-structural, working both outside and within other academic disciplines. The national Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC) is a national professional association of writing instructors in the United States, the largest organization dedicated to writing research, theory, and teaching pedagogy worldwide. At the annual CCCC convention, pedagogues from around the country deliver their recent research and theories to colleagues. While the goals, methods, and desired results in composition studies are debated and continue to evolve, the importance of writing to the field of education has been indisputably recognized.

The name comes from a spirit in Hopi mythology. The 622 km long and 50 km wide chasmata arise from a system of normal faults running from the north-west to south-east. The faults bound down-dropped crustal blocks forming structures called graben. The canyons cut the cratered terrain, which means that they were formed at a relatively late stage of the moon's evolution, when the interior of Ariel expanded and its ice crust cracked as a result. The floor of the canyons is not visible on the images obtained by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in January 1986; thus, whether it is covered by smooth plains like the floors of other Arielian graben is currently unknown. During the Voyager 2 flyby in 1986 the northern hemisphere of Ariel was not illuminated by the Sun because the spacecraft arrived during a southern solstice on Uranus. Nevertheless, because it was still illuminated by light reflected from Uranus, scientists using advanced processing methods were able to detect some details in the dark hemisphere. These analyses revealed a continuation of the Kachina Chasmata into the dark hemisphere, possibly as far as to the opposite limb.

Atterbury studied the harpsichord, composition, and harmony in the leisure time he could spare from his business, which was carried on in Turn Again Lane, Fleet Market. He acquired considerable proficiency in music, and on the death of his father, being left tolerably well off, gave up his business and retired to Teddington. He obtained several prizes from the Catch Club for his glees, and was appointed a musician in ordinary to George III. On 15 May 1765, Atterbury was elected a performing member of the Madrigal Society. In 1770, he seems to have been connected with Marylebone Gardens, as he paid Chatterton five guineas for the copyright of 'The Revenge' on 6 July of the same year in which the burletta was performed. On 5 May 1773, he produced at the Haymarket theatre an oratorio, 'Goliah' which failed disastrously, though it was afterwards repeated at West Wycombe on 13 Aug. 1775, on the occasion of the burial of the heart of Paul Whitehead in the mausoleum of Lord Le Despencer. In 1784 Atterbury sang in the chorus of the Handel commemoration, and in 1787, on the establishment of the glee club at the Newcastle Coffee House, Castle Street, Strand, his name occurs as one of the original members. In September 1790 he married Miss Ancell, of Downing Street. He was at this time still living at Teddington, but his improvidence forced him to remove to Marsham Street, Westminster, and to give concerts in aid of his finances.

A similar ceasefire deal was signed in 1995, but it was dissolved within three months. History The British government recognised and guaranteed the independence of the Karenni States in a treaty with the Burmese King Mindon Min in 1875, by which both parties recognised the area as belonging to neither to the Konbaung Dynasty (Kingdom of Burma) nor to the British Empire. Consequently, the Karenni States were never fully incorporated into British Burma. The Karenni States were recognised as tributary to British Burma in 1892, when their rulers agreed to accept a stipend from the British government.Karenni Independence Through Education The Constitution of the Union of Burma in 1947 proclaimed that the three Karenni States be united into a single constituent state of the union, called Karenni State. It also gave the possibility of secession from the union after 10 years if the state's leaders were not satisfied with the central government. In August 1948, the Karenni leader U Bee Htu Re was assassinated by a pro-central government militia for his opposition to the inclusion of the Karenni States in the Union of Burma. Since 1957, the Karenni Army has been fighting government forces in an attempt to create an independent Karenni state, apart from a brief ceasefire in 1995. The KNPP have also fought left-wing groups such as the Kayan New Land Party (KNLP), and the Karenni National People's Liberation Front (KNPLF), both of which are now allied with the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces). The group has been accused of using child soldiers, a claim that they have not denied, saying that the children had volunteered willingly, because their parents had been killed during fighting between the KA and government soldiers.

It was originally developed by Elsinore Technologies in 2008 under the name ScreenConnect.  History  Connectwise Control Elsinore Technologies developed ScreenConnect in 2008 as an add-on to their RMM Software IssueNet in order to assist in providing remote support to end users. They later began distributing the software as a standalone product.  Acquisition by ConnectWise  On February 11, 2015, PSA company ConnectWise announced their acquisition of the ScreenConnect software in order to improve the remote control features of the latest release of their RMM Software, LabTech. ScreenConnect, LLC announced that, despite being acquired by ConnectWise, they would continue to operate under their original name in addition to offering their software as a standalone product. Starting in early 2017, ConnectWise changed the name of ScreenConnect to ConnectWise Control, saying that this was to simplify their software under one company.  Product   How it works  The product is a self-hosted server applicationWareprise Remote Support SoftwareOhlhorst, Frank (June 9, 2013). eWeek ScreenConnect Shifts Remote Support From the Cloud Back to the Desktop that permits the primary user to host the software on their own servers, PC, virtual machine (VM), or virtual private server (VPS). Once installed, the central web application can be made visible inside and outside of the local area network (LAN). ConnectWise Control has a proprietary protocol and exposes an open architecture structure that can be utilized by users to implement custom plugins, scripting, or various integrations. A generic use model would start with a host initiating a session through the central web application. A participant would then join a session by clicking on an email link or via the guest page of the application. An unattended client can be created and deployed to a targeted machine without the need for human intervention.Jon Jacobi PCWorld Reviews ScreenConnecthttp://www.screenconnect.com/LearnMore.aspx The executable is ScreenConnect.ClientService.exe (x86) on Windows based OSs, and is a signed by a COMODO RSA Code Signing CA certificate [Publisher: ScreenConnect Software].  Features  Most commonly expected features for a product in this arena are present. Examples include reboot and reconnect, drag and drop file transfer, screen recording, safe mode support, multiple monitor, command line access, wake-on-LAN, VoIP, chat, and a custom toolbox for quick deployment of support tools. In addition to features that facilitate communication, ConnectWise Control also offers complete control over branding and customization of the product design, logo, color scheme, icons, text strings, and localization.  Security  The software is self-hosted providing users the ability to control the flow of data behind their own firewall and security implementations. ConnectWise Control uses 256-bit AES encryption to package and ship data, supports two factor authentication, has server level video auditing, and granular role-based security. Forms-based and Windows Authentication are optional authentication methods for security purposes.  Compatibility  Host (presenter or technician): can utilize Mac, Linux, Windows, iOS or Android operating systems. Guest (customer or participant): can connect from Mac, Linux or Windows. ConnectWise Control can also be utilized to remotely support Android devices, with complete view and control available for devices manufactured by Samsung.  Technology   Server  The on site ConnectWise Control server is self-hosted, and runs as a .NET Framework application. On Microsoft Windows it runs as a set of services. On Linux and OS X it runs as a daemon on a bundled forkhttps://github.com/screenconnect/mono of the Mono Runtime. Since 2015, ConnectWise Control launched a cloud platform, providing another way to use the ConnectWise Control software with no local server installation required. The ConnectWise Control server runs as a set of three discrete services: * The Web Server service is an outward-facing ASP.NET HTTP application and serves as a portal for both technicians and their end-users * The Relay service provides outward-facing in-session communication and operates on TCP sockets. Communication is encrypted with the AES-256 block cipher. * The Session Manager service provides a data store for both the Web Server and Relay services. It is implemented as WCF SOAP web service.  Clients  ConnectWise Control sessions are arranged through the web application. Once users join sessions, a ConnectWise Control client is launched to connect to the Relay service. ConnectWise Control targets clients based on device and operating system: * The .NET client is targeted to Microsoft Windows computers and is activated with a custom URI Scheme which starts the session from an installed handler on the controller's workstation. For end-users joining a support session, a variety of bootstrappers can be used including Microsoft's ClickOnce technology. * The Java client is targeted to OS X and Linux computers and is activated with Java Web Start. * The iOS client is targeted to iPhones and iPads. * The Android client is targeted to Android phones and tablets.  Licensing model  ConnectWise Control is commercial software. Licenses sit in a pool and are available to any user on any workstation. There are three types of license: a single concurrent that allows one simultaneous connection per license, an unlimited which allows an unlimited number of concurrent sessions as long as all sessions are utilizing the same server, and enterprise licenses which provide flexible options for SaaS, multi-user, or custom functionality. The concurrent license types are bought as a one-time purchase, with lifetime support. A subscription model is used for updates, which are free during the first year after purchase, after which the \\"update license\\" must be renewed. Pricing for updates depends on when the update license was last-renewed. Misuse The program under its previous name of ScreenConnect has been used in fraudulent technical support scams where the fraudster is able to gain the control of the victims computer by telephoning and tricking the user to install the software and permitting a connection. The free trial period has been utilitized to avoid any software costs in doing this, and similar products such as TeamViewer, AnyDesk and Ammyy Admin have also been used for the scam.

A few of these words existed in Latin as loanwords from a Celtic source, usually Gaulish, while others have been later received from other languages, mainly French, Occitan, and in some cases Spanish. Finally, some were directly acquired from Gallaecian, the local pre-Latin Celtic language. Any form with an asterisk (*) is unattested and therefore hypothetical. A systematic investigation of the Celtic words in Galician is still lacking.cf.  A - C  * abanqueiroPr√≥sper (2002) p. 90.

She served as the First Lady of Kentucky from December 12, 1995, until December 9, 2003, during the tenure of her husband, former Governor Paul E. Patton. Mrs. Patton is a native of Pike County, Kentucky, and one of four daughters born to the late Roy and Esta Conway. Her father was murdered while serving as sheriff of Pike County and her mother served the remainder of his term. After completing her husband's term and an unsuccessful run for the office, Mrs. Conway served as a social worker in the mountains of Eastern Kentucky while rearing her four daughters. She credits her mother's lifelong work with women and children as her inspiration for the work she does today. Childhood Roy Conway of Pike County, Kentucky was a businessman and former state legislator who had been elected as sheriff \\"on a platform to clean out bootleggers and stop corruption that spoiled the reputation of our beautiful mountain town,\\" wrote Judi in her essay in Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives.Patton, Judi Conway. \\"Judi Patton,\\" Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, John Edwards, ed. (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 2006), 122-23. Conway was murdered in front of his family home on July 28, 1950, at the age of 44. Esta Conway was originally from the Craft and Wright families of Letcher County, Kentucky and attended Morehead State Teacher's College. Her mother's strength and determination helped as she continued her husband's work for the remainder of his term. Mrs. Conway was the first female sheriff in the town, but was defeated as she ran for a special election to complete her husband's former term. After her father's death, the Conway family opened a small grocery store, where the children were \\"expected to help after school and on Saturdays ... Mama [Mrs. Conway] offered credit to women and families who needed help.\\"Ibid. Even after the grocery store closed down, due to lack of income, Judi's mother did not attempt to collect from the families. Her mother, while completing college, would welcome women and families into their home in order to offer comfort for those in need. In a 2002 interview, Judi Patton described how important these actions were in rescuing women from danger and creating meaningful connections among women in the town: \\"Many times she would bring women and children home. Mama had this great networking system in Pikeville -- the women she got a job, the kids she put in school. ... Almost until Mama passed away, she was getting letters from women saying they would have been lost if she wasn't there to get them out. So, I thought, if I could do anything to make her proud of me, I would carry on her work.\\" Esta Conway died on April 29, 1991, at the age of 78; she was a proponent in shaping her daughter Judi's activism. Adulthood After graduating from Pikeville College, Judi married coal operator Bill Harvey Johnson in 1965 and had two children. They had two grandchildren; their only granddaughter died on Christmas Day 2005 from meningitis. Two years after they divorced in 1973, her ex-husband was murdered. In 1977, Judi Jane Conway wed Paul E. Patton who was also from Pike County, Kentucky. Both had been married once before, but found each other when Judi was working as a secretary at Kentucky Elkhorn Coal Mine owned by Paul Patton. She ran a garden and landscaping business in Pike County, and was active in the Democratic Women's Club, the Pike County Junior Women's Club and chaired the Pike County Cancer Society. In 1984 she served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. Judi and Paul Patton both agreed with the principles and policies of the Democratic Party, which they carried with them through their political careers in Kentucky. In December 1995, Judi and her husband Paul Patton (59th Governor of Kentucky) entered the Governor's Office in Frankfort, Kentucky. Immediately, Judi focused on taboo topics such as child abuse and domestic violence. Activist work In her early years, Judi was constantly at home with her mother caring for and nurturing the women her mother brought home to their eastern Kentucky home during the Appalachian War on Poverty. Patton states that her mother inspired her for the work she has accomplished throughout her life. Once her husband took office in 1995, she began to focus on family violence. Mrs. Patton has since worked and educated against child abuse and family violence issues. While in office in Frankfort, Kentucky, she pushed what was called \\"20 bills that strengthened protections for children, domestic violence and sexual assault survivors, created policy standards for prosecuting perpetrators and expanded training initiatives from local law enforcement to judges, doctors and nurses.\\"Kay Harrod, \\"Judi Patton's Work Applauded,\\" The State Journal (February 26, 2010). Accessed 4 December 2010. www.state-journal.com/news/article/4778327 In 1994 a federal Violence Against Women Act passed, and in 1996 Judi Patton received from Janet Reno the federal government's allotted grant funding for the Commonwealth to address the needs of domestic violence and sexual assault victims. Two years later, Vice- President Al Gore presented to First Lady Judi Patton a special \\"full faith and credit\\" grant of nearly $3 million from the STOP Violence Against Women program from the U.S. Department of Justice.http://www.kltprc.net/books/women/Chpt_12.htm Kentucky now has 11 advocacy centers in the state's Area Development Districts due to Mrs. Patton's work. Patton's work concerning women and children continues. Other leadership roles Mrs. Patton took onThis list is from Patrick Crowley, \\"Judi Shows Grit, Grace\\" The Enquirer, (October 2, 2002).

The only bill with which Patton's lobbying did not succeed was the criminalization of sexual assault between spouses. Marital rape was criminalized only after a decade-long campaign under the leadership of Jefferson County lawyer Bonnie Brown. In 2002, the Kentucky Commission on Women hosted a conference to discuss a report on the Economic Status of Kentucky's Women. Governor Patton had formed a task force in November 2001 after a national survey ranked Kentucky as the third worst state for women. First Lady Judi Patton and former Governor Martha Layne Collins served as co-chairs of the task force and produced a report that evidenced Kentucky's failing rankings in health and nutrition, educational attainment, equity in pay and education, economic sufficiency and political and business leadership.See the initial findings of 2001 and the final report of 2003 at the KCW website, http://women.ky.gov/ffp.htm .

Life and work Baber was the son of John Baber, recorder of Wells, Somersetshire, and was born on 18 April 1625. He was educated at Westminster school, London, then became a student at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1642. He graduated as a Bachelor of medicine on 3 December 1646, being admitted by virtue of the letters of Colonel John Lambert, governor of the garrison of Oxford. He travelled abroad, studying medicine at Leyden, in the Netherlands, and on 10 November 1648 took the degree of M.D. at Angers. On his return to England he was made an M.D. at Oxford on 18 July 1650, became a candidate of the College of Physicians, London, on 4 July 1651, and a fellow of the same institution on 17 August 1657. He started to practise in London, his residence being in King Street, Covent Garden. Through the recommendation of a near neighbour, Thomas Manton, rector of St. Paul's, Covent Garden, who, with other presbyterian divines, had taken a prominent part in the restoration of Charles II, he was made physician to the king, the honour of knighthood also being conferred on him 19 March 1660. Baber was frequently made use of by King Charles in his negotiations with the puritans. Roger North, who styled him as 'a man of finesse', stated that he was 'in possession of the protectorship at court of dissenting preachers.' In September 1669 Baber informed Manton of the king's intention to do his utmost to 'get them accepted within the establishment;' but it would appear that Charles made use of him to inspire trust in intentions which were at the best feeble and vacillating. Samuel Pepys said of Baber that he was so cautious that he would not speak in company until he was acquainted with every stranger present.Elliot, Hugh F. A new manuscript of George Saville, 1st marquis of Halifax, Macmillan's magazine, vol. 36, May-Oct 1877, pp. 452-63. Baber died in 1704.

The two met earlier in the year at UFC 125: Resolution with the fight ending in a split draw, and Edgar retaining his title. Their first encounter at UFC Fight Night: Florian vs. Lauzon saw Maynard win via unanimous decision. It was later announced on May 9 that injuries to both forced the fight to be removed from the card. Edgar suffered broken ribs, while Maynard suffered a knee injury. On February 9, it was rumored that Thiago Silva had been forced from his bout with Quinton \\"Rampage\\" Jackson and could be replaced by Rashad Evans. Silva stated that he was not injured and was looking forward to his bout with Jackson. Instead, information surfaced that Silva may have failed a pre-fight drug screening at UFC 125, which could have resulted in his suspension. It was then announced that the proposed Rashad Evans bout was never close to being signed, and that Rampage would face Matt Hamill. Former Sengoku Middleweight Champion Jorge Santiago confirmed he has signed a contract with the UFC and returned to face Brian Stann at this event. On April 20, Brad Pickett was forced to withdraw from his bout with Miguel Torres.

He is remembered chiefly for the rebuilding of Celbridge Abbey, and as the grandfather of the statesman Henry Grattan. Background He was born at Creevagh Beg, near Ballymahon, County Longford. His mother Elizabeth Morgan was the daughter of Robert Morgan of Cottlestown, County Sligo, and his wife Bridget Blayney of Castleblayney, County Monaghan. His father Anthony Marlay was a recent arrival in Ireland from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where Thomas's grandfather Sir John Marlay (1590-1673) had been a leading local politician, who served as both Mayor of Newcastle and its MP; he is chiefly remembered for his spirited defence of the town against the invading Scots army during the English Civil War.Wedgwood, C.V The King's War William Collins and Son 1958 Beginning as small tradesmen, the Marlays had risen to become among the wealthiest coal exporters in Newcastle.Henning , B.D. editor The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1660-1690 1983 George Marlay, Bishop of Dromore 1745-1763, was Thomas's younger brother, and gave his name to Marlay House, which was built by his son-in-law, David La Touche. David was an MP, a member of the Privy Council of Ireland, and first Governor of the Bank of Ireland. He married George's daughter, Elizabeth in 1761. Marlay House, home of Marlay's niece Elizabeth Marlay La Touche. Early career Thomas was educated at the University of Dublin, and unlike many barristers of his time he was a considerable scholar, who was awarded the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Laws. He was admitted to the Middle Temple, and was called to the Bar. He rapidly built up a large practice at the Irish Bar, although Elrington Ball states that he was not very highly regarded as a lawyer. An anonymous pamphlet from 1730, which took a somewhat jaundiced view of the Irish Bar in general, described him as \\"a sage refined\\": whether this tribute to his intellect was ironic or not is unclear.A View of the Bar, anonymous pamphlet, 1730 He was elected to the Irish House of Commons as member for Limavady in 1715, and as member for Lanesborough, 1727-31. He was appointed Solicitor- General for Ireland in 1720 and Attorney-General for Ireland in 1727. He was elevated to the Bench as Lord Chief Baron in 1730 and became Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in Ireland in 1741. Judge His most memorable trial as Lord Chief Justice was the so-called Annesley perjury case, Annesley v. Lord Anglesey, in 1745. This was one of several trials arising from the celebrated legal battle between James Annesley and his uncle Richard Annesley, 6th Earl of Anglesey as to which of them was the rightful holder of the Anglesey title and estates; the case is said to have inspired the novel Kidnapped by Robert Louis Stevenson. The trial was notable for lasting twenty- two hours without a single break and Marlay, who would normally have had 2 or 3 colleagues to support him, conducted it singlehanded. The verdict went in favour of James, but he died before his uncle, without having regained possession of his estates. A workload as heavy as Marlay's was bound to affect his health, and from 1749 onwards he was too unwell to go on assize; he retired on health grounds in 1751. He died in Drogheda in 1756, while on a visit to his colleague Henry Singleton. He was a popular figure and his death seems to have been genuinely mourned: a Dublin paper published verses praising his gentleness, perfect manners and scholarship (the last being rather unusual among Irish judges of the time).Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray, London, 1926 Family Marlay rebuilt Celbridge Abbey, which is chiefly remembered as the home of Esther Vanhomrigh, the beloved Vanessa of Jonathan Swift.

A tycoon's son falls in love with a woman who works at his father's factory. It was based on the 1934 Hungarian film The Dream Car. The film was shot at the Lime Grove Studios in London, with sets designed by the art director Alfred Junge. Plot Vera Hart lives with her parents. Her father is an antiques salesman who loves his stock too much to sell it and therefore doesn't make any money. Through her friend Molly, Vera manages to get a menial job at Miller's music instrument factory. Vera has a habit of going into shops and trying on expensive clothes and jewellery which she could never hope to pay for. On her way home from work she stops in a car dealer and sits in a new luxury car. Robert Miller, the young son of the owner of Miller's factory, sees Vera and falls instantly in love with her. He pretends to be an employee at the car showroom and they bond together. On a whim, he decides to buy Vera the car and pretends she has won it as the 10,000th customer to visit the shop. Vera's father is delighted by the new car, but her mother is more suspicious. Miller wants to spend more time with Vera, but he is uncertain about telling her his true identity in part because he is constantly harassed by women who are interested in his inheritance. He approaches the Hart family and offers to chauffeur the car for them, doing jobs such as weddings to pay for it. As none of them can drive, they accept his offer. Miller gets into the habit of driving Vera to work at the factory, still not revealing the truth that his family owns the business. When he discovers how little she is paid, he has her salary raised to five pounds a week. Unfortunately this leads to bad feelings amongst Vera's colleagues, in particular her superior Henry Butterworth and Anne Fisher who has a crush on Miller, who suspect that Vera is the fancy woman of Miller. Vera is bemused by her pay rise because she is under the impression that she has never met Miller. When Vera comes to his office to confront Miller about her increased salary, he hides and gets his friend Peters to pretend to be him. Peters takes a shine to Vera, and tries to persuade her to go out on a date with him. Once she has gone, Miller and Peters get into an argument over whether each of them have a shot with her and whether she is more interested in love or money. The debate is put to the test when Vera, Miller and Peters all head down to a country hotel for an ice-skating carnival. A concerned Mr Butterworth and Miss Fisher also head down to the hotel to keep an eye on Vera, and are shocked when they see her separately with both Peters and Miller, believing that she is two timing them. Still without revealing his true identity, Miller asks Vera to live with him for ever in a couple of rooms over a garage. She joyfully accepts, but when Butterworth tells her who Miller really is she is hurt - thinking that his offer was not one of marriage but one of a kept woman. She then pretends to be uninterested in Miller and instead focuses her attention on Peters. Eventually however the confusion is resolved and Miller and Vera drive off together in their \\"car of dreams\\".

Bachhoffner was a native of London. He married Caroline Derby on 23 July 1834 at St Pancras Old Church. It was in 1837 that he, in conjunction with a few others, established the Polytechnic, which was intended for a place of popular instruction. Here, he held the position of principal of the department of natural and experimental philosophy until 1855. Afterwards, he became lessee and manager of the Coliseum in the Regent's Park, and there gave lectures similar to the courses he had established at the Polytechnic. In the later part of his life, he held a post as registrar of births and deaths in Marylebone. Bachhoffner was an inventor and took out several patents for inventions connected with the electric telegraph, gas stoves and oil lamps. He was a member of the London Electrical Society. In experiments with an early induction coil in 1837, he found that replacing the solid iron core with a core made of a bundle of parallel iron wires greatly increased the output voltage. As was later discovered, this was because the divided core prevented eddy currents from flowing in the core. Eddy currents, circular electric currents induced in the core by the changing magnetic field, cause power losses. The technique of a \\"divided\\" iron core was used in all subsequent transformers, and is still used today in the form of laminated cores in transformers and powdered iron cores in inductors. Bachhoffner can thus be credited with the invention of this method of preventing eddy current losses.

It is located to the south of Grevenbroich, and it borders the municipalities of Rommerskirchen and Bedburg. The power station consists of seven units and it is owned by RWE. It was named as the second biggest single polluter for carbon dioxide emissions in the European Union in 2019 by the EU's Transport and Environment Group.  Description  The Neurath Power Station serves mainly as a base load power station. It consists of seven units (3 x 300 MW, 2 x 600 MW, and 2 x 1,100 MW nominally). Five older units were built between 1972 and 1976, and have a gross generation capacity of 2,200 MW. On 15 August 2012 two new 1,100 MW lignite-fired units ‚Äì F and G, also known as BoA 2 and 3 ‚Äì were added. BoA stands for Braunkohlekraftwerk mit optimierter Anlagentechnik (Lignite power station with optimized systems technology). The new units have an efficiency of 43% and the capability to adjust quickly to changes in energy demand. The both of the new units are 170 m (558 ft) tallhttps://www.modernpowersystems.com/features/featureneurath-f-and-g-set- new-benchmarks/ which makes them amongst the tallest industrail buildings in the world, possibly second only to the powerblock at the Niederaussem Power Station. Its engineering was carried out by Alstom, which was also the supplier of the steam turbines. The consortium that supplied steam generators was led by Babcock-Hitachi Europe GmbH. GEA Group built the cooling towers. Construction costs were ‚Ç¨2.6 billion. The lignite is delivered by rail from open pits in Rhenish lignite district, in particular from the Garzweiler and Hambach mines. {class=wikitable |- align=center ! Unit ! A ! B ! C ! D ! E ! F !

The exhaust gases are derived since then over the cooling towers. The facility also has two bypass flue gas stacks from which one belongs to units A, B and C and the other to the units D and E. The first one is , the latter high. They allow operating the facility in case of defunct flue gas cleaning facility, however, as this rarely occurs, such chimneys do not exist at most other power stations. Note: Net nominal capacity has reduced since inauguration - the capacity listed above is current, not initial capacity (total 4,211 MW as of August, 2017)  Criticism  The new power station is criticized in the climate change discussion by environmental associations and physical custodians, because electricity generation from lignite as fuel, in spite of advanced technology, is considerably less efficient than other generation sources and makes the plant the second biggest source of carbon dioxide among plants in EU. The facility, with a planned lifespan of 40 years, is seen as inconsistent with Germany's and Europe's plans to counter climate warming, particularly after COP21. It is criticized furthermore that the investment efficiency is not maximized by additional measures like using of waste heat. One of the suggested projects is the establishment of a wide greenhouse park to use the attacking rejected heat and to create other jobs. However, the area planned for it was planned for industries with large electricity demand.  Accidents  In the evening of 25 October 2007, a major accident occurred on the construction site. A section of the scaffolding broke off, and buried several workers. Three construction workers were killed by the remains of the scaffold. Six others, who were seriously injured, were taken to surrounding hospitals. Nearly 300 application forces from fire brigade, police, ambulances and technical charitable organization were used for the rescue operation. In December 2008, the initiated preliminary proceedings were put because of careless homicide by the public prosecutor's office of M√∂nchengladbach. According to certificate the knot connections of the scaffold were laid out too weakly. Because there has been no knowledge about them, in this size for the first time to used components and their stability problems, the accident has not foreseen for the experts, according to the public prosecutor's office. Rather interpretation and construction have occurred under the rules of the technology. On 13 January 2008, a further deadly accident occurred in which an employee of a steel construction company was killed. After the above-mentioned accident in October 2007 and another accident in September 2007, this became the third deadly incident on the construction site.

Cutting a log into planks in a sawmill Usually made from sawed timber, planks are usually more than thick, and are generally wider than . In the United States, planks can be any length and are generally a minimum of deep by wide, but planks that are by and by are more commonly stocked by lumber retailers. Planks are often used as a work surface on elevated scaffolding, and need to be wide enough to provide strength without breaking when walked on. The wood is categorized as a board if its width is less than , and its thickness is less than . A plank used in a building as a horizontal supporting member that runs between foundations, walls, or beams to support a ceiling or floor is called a joist. The plank was the basis of maritime transport: wood floats on water, and abundant forests meant wooden logs could be easily obtained and processed, making planks the primary material in ship building. However, since the 20th century, wood has largely been supplanted in ship construction by iron and steel, to decrease cost and improve durability.

It is a service in which the element promoted can be a physical product or a brand name. The goal is to provide the client with strategies to promote sports or to promote some other product, service, business or cause through sports. Sports marketing is also designed to meet the needs and wants of the consumers through exchange processes. These strategies follow the traditional four \\"P\\"'s of general marketing: Product, Price, Promotion and Place. Another four \\"P\\"‚Äôs are added to sports marketing, relating to the fact sports are considered to be a service. The additional 4 P‚Äôs are: Planning, Packaging, Positioning and Perception. The addition of the four extra elements is called the \\"sports marketing mix.\\" Sports marketing is an element of sports promotion which involves a wide variety of sectors of the sports industry, including broadcasting, advertising, social media, digital platforms, ticket sales, and community relations. Sports marketing is divided into three sectors. The first is the advertising of sport and sports associations such as the Olympics, Spanish Football league and the NFL, as well as sport teams like Real Madrid and the New York Yankees. The second concerns the use of sporting events, sporting teams and individual athletes to promote various products. The third category is the promotion of sports to the public in order to increase participation. In the first case, the promotion is directly related to sports. In the second case, the products can but do not have to be directly related to sports. When the promotion is about sports in general, the use of this kind of strategy is called ‚ÄúMarketing of Sports.‚Äù When the promotion is not about the sports but sports events, athletes, teams or leagues are used to promote different products, the marketing strategy is denominated ‚ÄúMarketing through sports.\\" When the promotion is about increasing participation among the public, it is called \\"Grassroots Sports Marketing.\\" To promote the products or services, the companies and associations use different channels such as sponsorships of teams or athletes, television or radio advertisement during the different broadcast sports events and celebrations, and/or advertisement on sporting venues. ‚ÄúStreet marketing of sports‚Äù considers sports marketing through billboards on the street and also through urban elements (street lighters and sidewalks, etc.) to help promote and gain publicity during major worldwide sporting events such as the Football World Cup, the Olympic Games, or the Super Bowl. this = Business  Sports fans  Like all business sectors, sports businesses also rely on market segmentation to effectively market themselves. Sport fans differ according to a number of attributes including motivations to attend sporting events, emotional attachment, economic attachment, identity, and loyalty. These attributes also make sports different than other forms of entertainment as sport fans behave differently than consumers of other products and services. Attributes such as loyalty can be recognized through the contracts players and athletes sign with sports companies, in which they get paid to wear or use their products in each game or sporting event. By doing so, the players and athletes and also their fans develop a loyalty for the products for a longer time.  Types of sports  With such an array of differences of sports fans, different types and levels of sports are found across the globe. For example, in many countries cricket and football are extremely popular. In the United States American, football, baseball, and basketball are most favored, while college sports are also preferred. In addition to the classification of sports by levels, sports have also been classified as either mainstream or non-mainstream, also known as niche. There are seven product attributes that differentiate mainstream sports from non-mainstream sports: accessibility, popularity, uniqueness, affordability, star power, player skill, and player similarity. Accessibility, affordability, and similarity are strongly related to niche sports while popularity, player skill as well as accessibility are strongly related to mainstream sports. Meanwhile, fans that are less-identified with a team are drawn to player similarity as they feel they can relate more with players while highly identified fans prefer the star power of players. Affordability also is a distinguishing factor among fans, as less-identified fans place greater importance on price. A practical marketing example of this is the National Lacrosse League mandating players to attend receptions of restaurants who sponsor the team. Other strategies that niche sports utilize to differentiate themselves from mainstream sports are providing easy access to team and player information, especially online, as well as offer affordable ticket prices and valuable promotions such as dollar beer nights and 25-cent hot dog nights. In contrast, popular mainstream sports like Major League Baseball (MLB) and the National Basketball Association (NBA) highlight the star power of players, which is why teams go to great effort to promote their best players. This is also seen in media as nationally televised sporting events often promote specific players leading up to games. Fans also hold different expectations of different sport types and levels of sports. This is essential for sport marketers to understand. For example, fans attending a minor league baseball game will compare their experience to previous games attended at minor league baseball games, or even other minor league sports if they have little experience with minor league baseball. They will not, however, compare a minor league baseball experience to an NFL game as they understand the two experiences will be very different. Sports differentiation is also important concerning sponsorship. Companies who sponsor niche sports place the most importance on attributes including cost effectiveness, spectator demographics, and the company fit with the sports image. Niche sports often allow companies who cannot afford to sponsor mainstream sports a channel to market their companies. Also, with niche sports shown to attract a different type of consumer, these companies desire to increase their public awareness within a specific target market. Other attributes important to companies sponsoring niche sports are enhancing both their image and community involvement, which may be easier to do through niche sports than mainstream sports. Benefits of sports marketing Stickers on a NASCAR race car from companies with large advertising contracts. The benefits of sports marketing are wide-ranging. Stakeholders involved in sports include leagues, teams, athletes, and fans as well as cities and countries hosting sporting events. The media and businesses who promote their products and services through sports also receive benefits. Direct benefits to leagues, teams, and athletes include revenue from tickets, media rights, and sponsorships. Cities and countries also receive revenue from taxes, and all of the stakeholders gain from the exposure provided through sports. What really works for brands is the gain in terms of visibility and brand awareness that a sports sponsorship activation can bring. Additionally, a good sport sponsorship activation can help brands talking with a high-profiled and very responsive target. Brands involved in sponsorship activations have the opportunity to come into contact with their fan base and enjoy the resulting commercial benefits. When it comes to B2B, the advantages of sponsorships must not be underestimated. A high level of corporate hospitality, with gourmet dishes, the possibility to meet players/riders and racers, and privileged viewing positions, is an excellent way to tease high-value customers or to hold less formal business discussions in a more exciting context than the office. New challenges for sports marketing With millennials switching to new platforms to access sport, the role of traditional media and sports marketing is changing. Outmoded inflexible contracts can leave little budget for the all-important activation, and with fans choosing rival unofficial channels for gossip and insider information, the rewards can be hard won. New and accessible ways to view sports, from mobile to social to VR, means there is less incentive for fans to attend events in person, while more expectation is placed on sports stars to pull off an authentic natural voice for their brands. The environment is extremely tough for small college athletics (e.g., NCAA Division III schools), who rely on fan attendance for revenue generation to keep their sports afloat - requiring communicators and marketers to become more creative in the ways they promote sports to their target audiences. The marketing of sports teams and events According to different authors and organizations, the marketing of sports events and teams is defined as ‚ÄúDesigning or developing a 'live' themed activity, occasion, display, or exhibit a sporting event to promote a product, a team, cause, or organization\\". In other words it can be defined as follows: The marketing of sports events and teams is the marketing strategy which is designed or developed for a ‚Äúlive‚Äù activity, which has a specific theme. Mostly this kind of strategy is used as a way to promote, display or exhibit different things, such as a sports team, a sport association among others. There are different events that can clearly exemplify this concept, such as the Super Bowl, the Olympic Games, the UEFA Champions League, the World Marathon Majors, and the FIFA World Cup. Major sports brands compete to link up with the best marathons in the world, the test for excellence in ‚Äòrunning‚Äô, in what is a genuine showcase for strengthening its marketing strategy to its target audience. Adidas, Asics and Nike are dividing the market into the ‚ÄòWorld Marathon Majors‚Äô, the international athletics competition created in 2006 that brings together the most prestigious marathons on the planet. They are not title but technical sponsors, but these runs are popular and are not to be missed events for these brands, which create specific advertising campaigns to one of the few competitions that brings together professionals and amateurs under the same chrono. The Super Bowl is an example of this concept because it is a massive sports event organized by a sport association, the NFL, which looks to promote the event, the sport, and as well the different football teams. The event is promoted through local and national media, and has also spread internationally. For example, in Mexico the NFL signed a contract with Cinemex, a Mexican movie theater chain, for the right to transmit its games in movie theaters. This displays the potential of sporting leagues and teams to promote not just the event, but the league and teams involved to a worldwide audience. The marketing of products through sports \\"Marketing through sports\\" is a concept that's been used since the 1980s, but has increased in importance in the last two decades due to the growth and expansion that the different types of sports have enjoyed since then. It is a marketing strategy that can be used in sports in two different ways. First, the use of marketing and promotion can be carried out through the sport or through the sports club. In the first case, the use of marketing is under responsibility of the different sporting associations, while in the second case, the responsibility falls on the different sports clubs. In this manner, marketing and promotion through sports and through the club involve sponsorship, corporate events and boxes, licensed merchandise, names and images also known as \\"endorsement\\", advertising through broadcaster, advertising such as advertising as ground signage/clothing/equipment advertising, promoting games, promoting using players/club/league or developing business opportunities. The peculiarity of sports is that \\"sports is the only entertainment where, no matter how many times you go back, you never know the ending.\\" This singular fact is used by marketing companies as an advantage: every time the audience attends an event it will see the advertisements again and again, providing a wide range of opportunities for the different companies which operate in this field. Examples of marketing of products through sports  Sponsorship of events  One of the oldest examples of the marketing of products through sports is Slazenger's supplying of the official ball of Wimbledon (1902- 2015).Another international example of marketing products through sport is Adidas‚Äô sponsorship of FIFA, which includes the company supplying the balls used in the World Cup and having its logo on the side boards along the play- field. In what it described as a \\"world first\\" in corporate sports sponsorship, in 2016 BNY Mellon and Newton Investment Management announced they had donated their title sponsorship of the annual Oxford and Cambridge Boat Races to Cancer Research UK. Sponsorship of teams Sponsorship of teams is found throughout sports. Some of the most visible examples are found in the MLS as company names and logos are featured on team jerseys. For example, Alaska Airlines is the official jersey sponsor of the Portland Timbers while Valspar is the official sponsor of the Chicago Fire FC. These are examples of sponsorships of companies that are not related to sports. Turkish Airlines established a sports marketing strategy involving high- profile sports teams, players, and sport associations including Manchester United, FC Barcelona, the Euroleague Basketball competition, NBA player Kobe Bryant, the Turkey national football team, and tennis player Caroline Wozniacki. Another example of sports marketing through sponsorships of teams is the apparel contracts seen throughout sports. In 2011 Nike agreed to become the official apparel company of the NFL in exchange for around $220 million per year, a deal that has been extended through 2019. At the college level, Ohio State and Nike maintain a contract that provides the school a value of $16.8 million per year in cash and product through the 2033-34 academic year. Michigan meanwhile receives a total value of $15.3 million per year. Under Armour and Adidas are also major apparel brands as Under Armour sponsors Notre Dame for $9 million per year while Adidas provides more than $7 million each year to both UCLA and Louisville. These are examples of sports marketing because as it is defined, sports marketing is a marketing strategy in which companies related to sports products or services promote their trademark through design, production or other resources. In this case apparel companies Nike, Under Armour, and Adidas, which are all completely related to sports, design the uniforms of these teams and in this way, promote their trademarks every time there is an event.  Sponsorship of athletes  Apparel companies also sponsor professional athletes such as Kevin Durant who receives $30 million per year from Nike. Stephen Curry is speculated to receive even more money than Durant from his contract with Under Armour. Meanwhile, Puma pays sprinter Usain Bolt $10 million per year. Many athletes maintain contracts with a variety of companies; some of them are related to sports and others that are not. Roger Federer holds agreements with Nike, Wilson, Rolex, Mercedes-Benz, and Gillette, worth a sum close to $60 million each year. LeBron James‚Äô contracts with Nike, Beats by Dre, Coca-Cola, Kia, McDonald's, and Samsung accrue the NBA player more than $40 million per year. Peyton Manning meanwhile holds sponsorship agreements with companies including Buick, DirecTV, Gatorade, Nationwide and Papa John's worth in sum approximately $12 million per year. Fellow NFL quarterback Drew Brees earns $11 million each year from his contracts with Wrangler, Vicks, Verizon, Nike, and Microsoft. Another example of marketing through sports is the strategy used by Gillette to promote its personal hygiene products through representative figures of each sport on television during broadcast sports events. Gillette uses athletes such as tennis player Roger Federer, golfer Tiger Woods, and soccer player Thierry Henry. In the commercial these celebrities appear using the products of the company. This is done in order to promote these products to the fans of these celebrities and inspire them to use these products. It is a clear example of this concept, because the company using this marketing strategy is not related to sports at all, but through important sports personalities, its products are exposed to a larger target audience. Nike and Gatorade also hold sponsorship agreements with top athletes. Included among Nike's clients are Federer, Woods, golfer Rory McIlroy and tennis player Rafael Nadal while Gatorade has deals with NBA star Dwyane Wade, Serena Williams, and Peyton and Eli Manning.  The promotion of sports to the public to increase sports participation  Grassroots sports marketing is a part of the field of marketing known as social marketing. This refers to marketing something that is of benefit to the public, and is normally done by government or charities rather than private sector organizations. It is normally done with a much smaller budget than marketing of sports teams and event or marketing of products through sports as it does not bring any direct financial benefit. Although this marketing normally drives people to clubs where they will pay to play sports, it still needs to be subsidized in order to be run. The money therefore comes from local councils with a remit to increase participation or from public health sector which wants to decrease the cost of healthcare. Examples of the promotion of sports to increase participation is the United States Golf Association's initiatives to increase golf participation as well as MLB's One Baseball campaign, which attempts to unify baseball organizations at all levels with the overarching goal of increasing youth participation and consequently creating new fans.  Relationship Marketing in Sports  Relationship marketing relates to customer retention and building long term successful relationship between a business and its customers by maximizing customer satisfaction. Sport businesses need to communicate and participate in discussion with their customers in order to create, sustain and improve relationships. Existing studies offer insightful information into relationship and the general consensus is that sports businesses can benefit from its use. In many situations, sports marketing affairs include some sort of relationship marketing, where clubs, organisations, fans and athletes have relationships with one another that are dependent on the successful management of those relationships. In order for sport businesses to be successful in their goals, they should view their customers as partners for life rather than here and now consumers, and attempt to understand their ever-evolving needs, desires, expectations and values. By doing so, sport businesses are able to maintain and enhance their fan base easily than through the more commonly used short-term transactions such as merchandise and ticket sales. Social media enables businesses to do this and connect with their customers with much higher efficiency and effectiveness. Used as a global communication and interaction channel, social media has changed the conventional customer relationship dynamics. Social media is a tool that enables customers‚Äô engagement through an instantaneous and active back-to-back conversation. Customers are increasingly incorporating social media into their daily lives and using it for communication. Businesses have also made it an integral part of their marketing mix. Today, sports businesses can use social media to actively analyse customer's needs and wants rather than use out-dated methods of data collection such as surveys and focus groups, which do not provide rich information to better understand customers. It allows sports businesses to keep their customers updated on the latest news and information as well as interact with them on an individual basis. This instantaneous two-way communication tool available to sports businesses allows them to provide quality content within short time frames and interact with customers in real time. Effective utilization of social media enables sports brands to provide their customers with the best possible experience and expand their competitive advantage in marketing. The benefits of social media are mutual: Apart from sports businesses benefitting from the use of social media in the context of relationship management and marketing, the constant interaction between sport businesses and their customers allows organisations to know and learn about each individual customer on a deeper level. As a result of this, customers feel more valued and this leads to higher customer loyalty. Social media enables sport businesses to involve customers in the marketing process by receiving feedback and ideas, which can then be implemented in future products and services. By doing so, sport businesses strengthen the level of engagement and connection between the organisation and the customer, and this reinforces the importance that customers hold in the brand building process. Teams and athletes marketing Professional leagues, teams, and athletes have started using social media as a part of their marketing strategies during the recent years. The emphasis, however, is often still on the brands that are promoted by popular teams and sportsmen. The most popular social media platforms are Facebook and Twitter, but athletes and teams are also using sites including Instagram and Snapchat for marketing. As in case of all businesses, the advantages of social media use in sports include building brand awareness, reaching a larger audience in an easy and cost-effective way as well as creating brand advocates and engaging passionate sports fans. There are numerous examples of athletes and sports teams using social media for marketing and promotions. *For example, for a brand like Babolat, having a world icon like Rafael Nadal as its top brand representative is priceless. There is no better way to stand up to your competition than by having the best on your side. You must also know how to do it because not everything works in marketing. This is why knowing how to use social media is fundamentally important. ‚ÄúA message on Twitter is not just an advertising channel with which you can win an audience. Its power lies in the message being relevant and credible‚Äù, explains Edwin Schravesande (professor of e-marketing at the Johan Cruyff Academy of Tilburg). *Baylor Bold Rewards Program: When fans decide to \\"like\\" or \\"follow\\" Baylor athletics on either Twitter or Facebook, they are given day-to-day updates on their favorite teams. From a marketing aspect, the Baylor athletics page on Facebook and Twitter keeps track of fans who have \\"tweeted\\" or \\"commented\\" on certain links, posts, or tweets. There is an incentive for these fans to post and tweet because at the end of each year, the top three posting or tweeting fans are selected to receive grand prizes including free jerseys and merchandise to season tickets. *Michigan Presale Incentive: Michigan used a very clever way to increase the total amount of \\"likes\\" or \\"followers\\" for their Facebook and Twitter Pages in order to find higher recognition. In order to have the opportunity to apply for pre-sale tickets for their Michigan football games, at the largest football arena in the nation 'The Big House,' fans are required to \\"follow\\" or \\"like\\" their page on Facebook or Twitter. This allows them to be able to purchase pre-sale tickets for any game that they desire, making this method of marketing a great tool for gaining awareness for their team and many other things. *Louisville Slugger Scavenger Hunt: After the St. Louis Cardinals won the World Series in 2011, Hillerich & Bradsby, makers of Louisville Slugger bats and other baseball equipment, created a scavenger hunt through Twitter in order to raise awareness for their company. The hunt involved 45 world series commemorative bats, scattered all over the city of St. Louis, Missouri. The Louisville Slugger Twitter page posted \\"tweets\\" that hinted at where the bats were located within the city. The fan or participants used their mobile phones in order to remain up to date on the specific \\"tweets\\" referring to the hunt. If a fan or participant found one of the several bats, the participant was told that they were to be kept by the seeker. The reason this company held a scavenger hunt was to find recognition and to increase their number of followers on Twitter. The statistics shows that their fan base skyrocketed, lifting the number of Facebook likes by 143%, number of people talking about the brand on Facebook by 834% and its number of Tweeter followers by 161%. Many teams have incorporated sponsorships into their social media strategies, such as the Minnesota Vikings ‚ÄúTouchdown Tracker‚Äù Instagram image, which was sponsored by FedEx. The Cleveland Browns also displayed sponsorship integration in their tweets recapping touchdown drives, sponsored by Cooper Tires. Many athletes including Kobe Bryant, Russell Wilson, and Rafael Nadal have taken advantage of social media to increase their followers and improve their brand recognition. Athletes have also promoted brands through social media including Russell Wilson's sponsorship of Recovery Water and Serena Williams‚Äô promotion of Wheels Up. Because of this marketing tool, these fan-based website pages have increased greatly in numbers and give them the recognition that they were looking for.

When it was first produced in 1981, the Stumpjumper was the first mass- production mountain bike. The Stumpjumper is still in production, although its design has changed significantly since it was first sold. Stumpjumpers have been raced professionally by riders including Christoph Sauser and Ned Overend. History Specialized started to produce the Stumpjumper in 1981, making it the first mass-production mountain bike. The first Stumpjumper was produced in Japan and was based on a design for a custom-made bike originally marketed by Tom Ritchey, Gary Fisher and Charles Kelly. Specialized's founder Mike Sinyard has explained that the company's aim was to \\"make a bike on a production basis but as though it was a custom bike\\". The first Stumpjumpers had welded steel frames because the lugged and brazed frames that designer Tim Neenan wanted to use were not available at the time. The original bike had a modified BMX stem and handlebars based on Magura motorcycle handlebars. The bike was equipped with 15-speed Suntour ARX GT gears, originally designed for use on road bikes, and the Stumpjumper also featured Mafac cantilever brakes and a TA Cyclotourist chainset, both designed for touring bikes. It had no suspension. The bike weighed just under . After the first production run in 1981, around 500 were imported to the United States over the course of the next year. The original Stumpjumper was sold for US$750 as a complete bike or $395 for the frame only. Specialized marketed it as an affordable and versatile bike for a new sport, namely mountain biking, and used the slogan \\"The bike for all reasons\\". Initially, bike retailers were skeptical about the Stumpjumper, with some asking Sinyard what he was doing with a \\"big kids' BMX\\". However, the first shipment of 125 bikes sold out in six days. According to sports journalist Ben Hewitt, the Stumpjumper \\"was a resounding success\\" and its introduction contributed to the rapid rise in popularity of the new sport. An original Stumpjumper is displayed in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. A limited edition reproduction of the original Stumpjumper, featuring modern components and named the Stumpjumper Classic, was produced in 2007 to mark the bike's 25th anniversary. It was available for US$1,300. Present day Specialized continue to produce the Stumpjumper, which, like mountain bikes in general, has evolved significantly since 1981 and now comes in full (front and rear) suspension and hardtail (front suspension only) options, with the former named the Stumpjumper FSR. Use by professional riders Professional mountain bikers who ride Stumpjumpers include Christoph Sauser and Ned Overend. Overend won the 1990 Mountain Bike World Championships ‚Äì the first ever event of its kind ‚Äì on a carbon-fiber prototype Stumpjumper.

History The bank was established by Act of Parliament in 1970. At that time, the main objective of TIB was to provide \\"medium and long- term loans to investors in commercial agriculture, manufacturing, processing, construction, transport, tourism and mining sectors\\". However, due to economic hardships, including a war with Idi Amin of neighboring Uganda and foreign currency exchange fluctuations within the Tanzanian economy, the bank became unable to service its financial obligations. To mitigate financial losses, TIB resorted to making short-term loans and to function like a commercial bank. The period between 1980 until 2003 was particularly hard on the bank. Development Financial Institution Over time, the Tanzanian government, the sole shareholder in TIB, re-capitalized the bank, re-vamped its strategic development plans and re-structured its management. , TIB had a total asset base in excess of US$62 million (TZS:93 billion). The government intends to raise that figure to US$265 million (TZS:400billion), in the next several years. The bank has a significant portion of its portfolio in the Tanzanian agricultural sector.

Of these 5 lay across the Hooghly in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side. After the fall of Siraj- ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, it purchased these villages in 1758 from Mir Jafar and reorganised them.

Endospores are stained red, while the counterstain methylene blue stains the vegetative bacteria blue. Endospores are surrounded by a highly resistant spore coat, which is highly resistant to excessive heat, freezing, desiccation, as well as chemical agents. More importantly, for identification, spores are resistant to commonly employed staining techniques; therefore alternative staining methods are required. Method Carbol fuchsin is applied to a heat-fixed slide. The slide is then heated over a bunsen burner, or suspended over a hot water bath, covered with a paper towel, and steamed for 3 minutes. The slide is rinsed with acidified ethanol, and counter-stained with Methylene blue.

It is a slow twelve-bar blues that jazz critic Leonard Feather and his wife, Jane Feather, are credited with writing. The song has been recorded by several blues and other artists. In 1964, it was a hit for B.B. King and became a staple of his live shows. Earlier songs In 1949, Johnny Moore with his brother, Oscar Moore, on guitars, Billy Valentine on piano and vocal, and Johnny Miller on bass recorded \\"How Blue Can You Get\\" in the West Coast blues-style. It was included on the jazz and blues compilation album Singin' the Blues (1960).RCA Camden (CAL-588) Feather described the song as having \\"the type of intimate instrumental setting heard in so many best blues vocal performances of the 1940s\\". In 1951, Louis Jordan recorded the song using a big band arrangement.Decca Records (27648) B.B. King versions B.B. King first recorded the song as \\"Downhearted\\", which was included on his 1963 Blues in My Heart album.Crown (CLP 5309) The song is performed at \\"a steady, stately pace, its groove punctuated by B.B.'s stinging runs and wailing, sustained notes\\", according to King biographer David McGee. King later re-recorded the song as \\"How Blue Can You Get\\" and ABC-Paramount Records released it as a single in 1964. It \\"stood out, thanks to the relative simplicity of its arrangement, and the caustic humor of the lyrics\\". McGee adds that the remake featured \\"more propulsion from the horn section, and B.B. investing his vocal with far more outrage than can be detected on the laidback original\\". It also added a \\"vehement stop-time interlude\\": \\"How Blue Can You Get\\" reached number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart in 1964 (Billboard's R&B; chart was suspended at the time). The song became a fixture in King's live shows \\"with enough good punchlines for B.B. to keep it in his act for decades\\". A live version of the song first appeared on the Live at the Regal album recorded in Chicago in 1964; King prefaced it with \\"pay attention to the lyrics, not so much to my singing or the band\\". Since then, live versions of the song have been included on several live B.B. King albums, such as Live in Cook County Jail, Live in Japan, the expanded Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert, and the 2008 album Live at the BBC. Recordings by other artists A variety of artists have recorded \\"How Blue Can You Get\\", including Duke Ellington, Albert Collins, James Cotton, Howard Tate (1966), Magic Slim, Fleetwood Mac, and Jeff Healey (2008, Mess of Blues). Gregg and Duane Allman also performed this song in 1968 as a part of a medley of B.B. King tunes. In 1996, Primitive Radio Gods sampled the line \\"I've been downhearted baby, ever since the day we met\\" for the chorus of their single \\"Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand\\", which became a record chart hit. King also performed the song in both the Blues Brothers 2000 movie as well as on the movie soundtrack, along with a medley of other artists credited as \\"The Louisiana Gator Boys\\", a rival blues supergroup fronted by King's character, Malvern Gasperone. In 2010, Cyndi Lauper recorded \\"How Blue Can You Get\\" with Jonny Lang for her blues album Memphis Blues.

The Lords held that the limitation period for actions founded on torts of negligence may be disapplied where it is inequitable to enforce it. This case centred on the wording of the Limitation Act 1980,Limitation Act 1980 which created an exception to the three year limitation period for \\"any action for damages for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty.\\" In the earlier case, Stubbings v Webb [1993] AC 498, S v W [1995] FLR 862, the words \\"negligence, nuisance or breach of duty\\" were construed in such a way as to exclude sexual assault. Stubbings v Webb was criticised as being unfair to claimants, notably by the Law Commission.Law Commission Consultation Paper 151 A v Hoare overruled the judgment of the House of Lords in Stubbings v Webb in favour of what the judges considered to be a fairer approach. Background The judgment summarized the facts as follows: > \\"In A v Hoare the defendant was convicted in 1989 of an attempted rape of > the claimant, involving a serious and traumatic sexual assault; he was > sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2004, while still serving his sentence, > he won ¬£7m on the national lottery. The claimant started proceedings for > damages on 22 December 2004 but Master Eyre, applying Stubbings, struck out > the action as barred under section 2 of the 1980 Act. This decision was > affirmed by the judge and the Court of Appeal [2006] 1 WLR 2320.\\"per Lord > Hoffmann at para 26 The perpetrator, Iorworth Hoare, a British national from Leeds, had previously been convicted of a series of sex attacks between 1973 and 1987, for which he had received prison sentences totalling 18 years. As he was penniless as of his final conviction in 1989, the victim did not pursue a civil action for damages against him but claimed compensation of ¬£5,000 from the government by way of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. In December 2004, within a few months of Hoare's lottery win becoming public, 16 years after the crime, and well outside the six-year time limit for tort set by the Limitation Act 1980, the victim pursued a civil action for damages against Hoare personally. This claim was struck out for being out of time by the High Court, in 2005, and by the Court of Appeal in 2006, following the case of Stubbings v Webb. The House of Lords overturned this decision in A v Hoare. The victim was awarded ¬£50,000 in compensation, and Hoare was required to pay costs for both sides of around ¬£800,000. Hoare challenged the ruling in the European Court of Human Rights, but was unsuccessful. Hoare was released in 2005. He received death threats as a result of his notoriety; in 2006, a man was jailed indefinitely for threatening to kill Hoare. Hoare's victim, Shirley Woodman, waived her right to anonymity in 2012, when she received an MBE for her actions. Decision The House of Lords held that the words \\"negligence, nuisance or breach of duty\\" could be construed to include sexual assault and thus bring them within the s33 discretion to disapply the limitation period for claims. Lord Hoffmann reasoned that s33 had caused victims of intentional torts 'the need to frame a claim in one or other of these ways when the real cause of complaint was sexual abuse for which the employer was vicariously liable was causing \\"arid and highly wasteful litigation turning on a distinction of no apparent principle or other merit\\".KR v Bryn Alyn Community (Holdings) Ltd [2003] QB 1441 per LJ Auld at para 100'per Lord Hoffmann at para 25 The case was remitted to the High Court for the judge to reconsider in the light the House of Lords speeches.

Deemed eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in February 1983, owner opposition prevented it from being officially listed. Despite protests by preservationists, the building was demolished by its owner in January 1998. Structure The Salvation Army Headquarters was a -story, three-bay structure in the Zigzag Moderne phase of Art Deco architecture. The symmetrical facade incorporated the clean lines, geometric patterns and decorative motifs that characterized that particular phase of the Art Deco style. These included setback and stepped patterning, contrasting light and dark colored building materials and an overall vertical orientation. The walls used a cream-colored pressed brick that contrasted with brownish-gray tiles. The vertically aligned windows were set in black metal window frames and divided by black metal spandrels. The dominant feature was the centrally located entrance, which was highlighted by extending the central bay up above the roofline and surrounding the entrance with tile in a step pattern that created a ziggurat effect typical with the style. At the top, the entire wall stepped back to enhance the geometric patterning of the design. A cornerstone on the east side of the facade read: \\"Erected to the Glory of God and Good of Humanity, A.D. 1931.\\"Patricia Murphy and Marie Mingo, National Register of Historic Places Inventory‚ÄîNomination Form, October 13, 1981; copy accessed from Salvation Army Headquarters file, State Historic Preservation Office in the Minnesota History Center. In addition to using the Zigzag Moderne style, the building's design was notable for its used of glazed architectural terra- cotta, a machine-made material developed in the late 1920s. Its construction was a part of a short building boom (1929‚Äì31) of Art Deco buildings in St. Paul, which included the Saint Paul City Hall and Ramsey County Courthouse, Saint Paul Women's City Club and others. Over the years, the main facade of the building remained mostly intact. Only the original Salvation Army sign and flagpole holder were removed. An addition was added to the west side wall in 1962 to provide storage and connect the building to the adjacent hospital. History The Salvation Army, an international religious and charitable organization, was founded in the United Kingdom in 1865 and established its first American office in 1876. The office in St. Paul was formed in 1887. The structure was commissioned by The Salvation Army in 1929 and designed by architect Albert C. Fehlow in the Zigzag Moderne style of Art Deco. Fehlow was employed by the Chicago headquarters of the Salvation Army and would go on to design four more buildings employing similar materials throughout the Midwest. At the time the building was constructed, The Salvation Army was trying to establish itself as a modern organization and thus selected to employ a fashionable, progressive style for their headquarters. A few years previous, the organization's headquarters in New York City (1929) was also built in an Art Deco style. The style was considered ideal because it was new and had a futuristic look without any reference to traditional ecclesiastic or public architecture.Seth Levin, Saint Paul Heritage Preservation Commission Site Nomination Form, August 1980; copy accessed from Salvation Army Headquarters file, State Historic Preservation Office in the Minnesota History Center. The Salvation Army Headquarters was completed in 1931 at a cost of $25,000. During the Great Depression, the organization was very active in providing services to the needy. It also served as a Sunday school for children. The building was sold in 1957 and the organization moved to a different headquarters in 1958. It was purchased by the neighboring St. Joseph's Hospital for use as a pre- natal clinic and offices. St. Joseph's Hospital is the oldest hospital in Minnesota. At the time, the building's name was changed to the Seton Center. In April 1981, the Heritage Preservation Commission of the City of St. Paul nominated the Seton Center for official designation as a Heritage Preservation Site. The Ramsey County Historical Society and State Historic Preservation Office subsequently nominated the building for listing on the NRHP was made in October 1981. On February 24, 1983, the National Park Service determined that the Salvation Army Headquarters was eligible for the NRHP; however, because the building's owner, St. Joseph's Hospital, filed an objection to the listing, the building could not be listed.Letter determining eligibility for National Register, National Park Service, date unknown; copy accessed from Salvation Army Headquarters file, State Historic Preservation Office in the Minnesota History Center. The building during its demolition in late January 1998 In 1988, the hospital, which was then owned by HealthEast Care System, announced plans for a new building on the site, however the plans fell through and the building was not demolished. However, in late 1996, HealthEast announced plans to demolish the structure because of its maintenance costs and a lack of suitable use. In November 1996, the company announced it would be willing to sell the building or its notable facade for $1 to anyone willing to assume the cost of dismantling and moving it. Because the company wished to retain ownership of the land for future development, the offer was only for the building itself and not the site. The St. Paul Heritage Preservation Commission opposed the demolition, but because it had no official local or national historic designation it had no legal authority to stop a demolition. At the time of the proposed demolition, HealthEast had plans to close the adjacent St. Joseph's Hospital and redevelop the area; the hospital still exists as of 2010.Larry Millett, \\"Art deco building faces demolition\\", Saint Paul Pioneer Press, December 26, 1996. In March 1997, the Minnesota Historical Society sent a letter to HealthEast offered assistance in aiding in finding new uses for the structure and noted that moving a historic building often severely compromises its historic integrity. In addition, they noted that, if listed on the NRHP, the building could qualify for federal preservation tax benefits.Britta L. Bloomberg, Letter to HealthEast, Minnesota Historical Society, March 17, 1997; copy accessed from Salvation Army Headquarters file, State Historic Preservation Office in the Minnesota History Center. HealthEast hired an architect in 1997 to look for reuse possibilities, but it was determined that such a restoration and adaptation would be too costly to be feasible for the hospital. By January 16, 1998, no one had taken up HealthEast's offer to buy and move the structure.Larry Millett, \\"Downtown art deco gem may bite dust\\", Saint Paul Pioneer Press, January 16, 1998.

Haifa's Mayor Yona Yahav stated that the problem was known and it was \\"just a matter of time until a calamity occurred\\". Israel Police suggested that the fire was caused due to a bonfire that was lit by local residents and not extinguished properly and in time.

It also sent heavy ground equipment from nearby military bases, including firetrucks, water tanks, cranes, D9 bulldozers and other equipment. The Israeli Air Force used an unmanned aerial vehicle for reconnaissance and intelligence collection. Use of other aircraft was prohibited because of a decade-old decision that prohibits military aircraft from being used in such a situation. Israel requested help from various countries, including the United States. Turkey and Greece offered to send assistance to fight the fire. Greece was the first country to respond, sending 4 CL-415 aircraft supported by 1 C-130H with technicians and equipment to Ramat David Airbase. Greece also sent 1 more CL-415 and 1 C-130H with firefighters the next day. Turkey sent two firefighting aircraft, which started to extinguish fire in the early hours of December 3. The Netherlands sent four fire extinguisher-aircraft, which could do their job as early as Monday, the 6th of December, since Benjamin Netanyahu asked the Netherlands, as well as Belgium, Germany, Finland, Norway, and Russia specifically for help.

Later in the day it made a second sortie, dropping fire retardant. The Turkish assistance was considered surprising, due to the strain on the Turkish‚ÄìIsraeli relationship since the Turkish Gaza flotilla raid.

Environmental and property damage HaBonim Fire damage in Nahal Oren Burned forest near Isfiya The fire caused widespread damage to property, as well as ecological damage. It initially spread very quickly because of the wind, and cut off power to houses in the vicinity. At least of forest were destroyed, and damage was caused to the Carmel Hai-Bar Nature Reserve. Omri Bone, the Northern Region Director of the Jewish National Fund, estimated that 1.5 million trees burnt in the fire. However, another 4 million trees have reportedly burned since then. According to officials, nearly half of the of the Carmel Forest reserve have been destroyed in the fire. Officials say it could take dozens of years to rehabilitate the area. Over 17,000 people were evacuated on December 2 as a result of the fire, including 6,500 from Tirat Carmel and 3,000 from Haifa. Villages evacuated include Kibbutz Beit Oren, Ein Hod, Nir Etzion, and the Yemin Orde Youth Village, which were severely impacted by the fire. The University of Haifa was also evacuated, as well as three prisons (Carmel, Prison Six, and Damun) and the Tirat Carmel Mental Hospital. Other institutions included the Carmel Forest Hotel and the Carmel Farm. The casualty information center opened for the first time since the 2006 Lebanon War.

At the age of five, she, her mother, Aurelia Salas, along with her siblings, moved to Union City, New Jersey. Though she lost contact with her father when she moved from the West Coast, she would later reconnect with him during the course of the background check she underwent upon being appointed a federal judge. Growing up indigent, Salas recalls having to translate for her mother at the welfare office, and later helping friends with various problems facing their lives, an activity that led to her pursuit of a career focusing on human services. Salas attended Emerson High School in Union City, where her extracurricular activities included cheerleading. After graduating from high school in 1987, she attended Rutgers University, where she lived on campus and was active in clubs and activities. Salas graduated from Rutgers in 1991 and in 1994 from Rutgers University School of Law in Newark with a Juris Doctor. She credits her success during her education and during her later professional life to the Minority Student Program.  Legal career  Following law school graduation, Salas served as a law clerk to Eugene J. Codey Jr., of the Superior Court of New Jersey. From 1995 to 1997, Salas worked for Garces & Grabler, P.C., where she practiced criminal matters in superior and municipal courts. Between 1997 and 2006, she served as an Assistant Federal Public Defender for the District of New Jersey, representing indigent defendants in federal matters. Salas served as president of the Hispanic Bar Association of New Jersey from 2001 to 2002, and as president of the Hispanic Bar Foundation of New Jersey. She has also been a member of the Governor's Hispanic Advisory Committee for Policy Development, the Supreme Court Committee on Minority Concerns, and the Supreme Court Committee on Women in the Courts.

Notable cases  The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey has a busy docket; according to a 2018 profile, Salas \\"presides over as many as 485 civil matters and 50 criminal cases\\" at any given time. In 2013, Salas presided over a criminal case against the former chief information technology officer for the office of Dawn Zimmer, the mayor of Hoboken, New Jersey.

In 2018, Salas issued a order temporarily blocking U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from deporting certain Indonesian Christians in New Jersey who were present without authorization in the U.S. and were subject to orders of removal, but were seeking legal status. The order dealt with about 50 Christians who had fled persecution in Indonesia and had lived in New Jersey for many years before being targeted by immigration enforcement actions.David Porter, Judge temporarily halts deportation of Indonesian Christians, Associated Press (February 3, 2018). In 2018, Salas sentenced Farad Roland, a leader of the Newark \\"South Side Cartel\\" set of the Bloods street gang, to 45 years in prison for his role in a series of crimes from 2003 to 2010, including five fatal shootings, a carjacking and drug dealing.Alex Napoliello, Gang leader, facing death penalty, accepts deal of 45 years in prison, NJ Advance Media for NJ.com (January 26, 2018).

Salas is the judge presiding over the class-action lawsuit against Deutsche Bank (Karimi v. Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft et al.), which alleges that Deutsche Bank had poor financial reporting practices and made misleading statements to securities investors, resulting from Deutsche Bank's desire to obscure its anti-money laundering deficiencies and its poor monitoring of high-risk customers such as Jeffrey Epstein, Danske Bank in Estonia, and FBME Bank.  Personal life  Salas is married to attorney Mark A. Anderl, with whom she had a son, Daniel. Anderl is a criminal defense attorney and former Essex County assistant prosecutor.  Home attack  On July 19, 2020, an assailant targeted Salas's family at their home. Daniel, aged 20, opened the door when the assailant knocked. The assailant then opened fire, killing Daniel at the scene. Mark was also shot multiple times and left in a critical but stable condition. Esther was in the basement at the time of the attack and was not injured. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is leading the investigation in conjunction with the U.S. Marshals Service and local law enforcement. The following day, the FBI identified 72-year-old attorney Roy Den Hollander as the primary suspect; Den Hollander was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the town of Rockland in upstate New York. Den Hollander was a self-described antifeminist who had previously been known for filing unsuccessful lawsuits against \\"ladies night\\" promotions at bars and nightclubs, as well as suing Columbia University for offering women's studies classes. Den Hollander had appeared before Salas in connection with a lawsuit he brought challenging the military's male-only draft. In various writings, Den Hollander ranted about his hatred of women, used racist and sexist terms to disparage Salas, and spoke of his personal grievances. Den Hollander described himself as a \\"men's rights\\" activist but was ejected from the National Coalition for Men and is also a suspect in the shooting death of a men's rights lawyer Marc Angelucci at his home in Crestline, California, earlier the same month.

The contract's first four clauses concerned the timber. Clause 5 provided for the contract's termination on notice by either party.

Early career Musser was born on October 14, 1901 in Pennsylvania to Ezra Musser and Cora Weidman. He was raised with his brother Willoughby, as a member of the Mennonite Church in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He died on November 7, 1998 in California, but was interned at the Erisman Mennonite Cemetery in Manheim, Pennsylvania. Omar began to study the xylophone in the 5th grade. Upon witnessing a performance of Teddy Brown playing marimba with the Earl Fuller's Rector Novelty Orchestra, Musser was inspired to study with Brown's former teacher, Philip Rosenweig. Musser soon became recognized as a virtuoso in his own right, performing as a soloist, with orchestras, and in an early Warner Bros. Vitaphone film. https://old.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid;=180977117 Design work Musser's first major project as a designer was a unique instrument called the Marimba-Celeste, built at the J.C. Deagan factory in Chicago. Essentially, the instrument combined a marimba and a vibraphone, with a built-in amplification system for the lower marimba keys. Musser toured with this instrument between 1927 and 1930. Some time between 1949 and 1950, Musser designed and built a predecessor to the drum machine, alliteratively called the \\"Musser Maestro Marimba Metron\\", or more simply the \\"Rhythm Machine.\\" The machine, used by Musser to accompany performances and lessons, measures 1.5 feet wide and about 3 feet square. Manufactured using vacuum tube technology, it plays 13 electronically generated rhythmic accompaniments such as the bolero, waltz, rhumba, cha-cha, tango, samba, and beguine. In addition to the pre-set loops, percussion sounds can be activated using push-button controls, which show wear from Musser operating them with his mallets while playing. Musser's final design project was the Celestaphone, an instrument which served to merge Musser's interests in outer space and music. The frame and the bars were forged from 678 pounds of meteorites from Musser's own collection, which he began gathering from all over the world in 1936. In design and appearance it most closely resembles a pedal glockenspiel. The Marimba Orchestra One of the most notable of Musser's contributions to the world of percussion is his work as a conductor and promoter of large marimba orchestras. One of the first of such groups was a 25-piece, all-girl marimba ensemble for a Paramount Pictures event in Chicago. In 1933 at the Century of Progress International Exhibition in Chicago, Musser conducted a marimba orchestra of 100 players. A special marimba, the \\"Century of Progress Model\\" was designed by Musser and produced by the Deagan company. Most of Musser's future marimba orchestras would follow a similar model. That is, Musser would select players, arrange and write the music, rehearse and conduct the orchestra, and design a special instrument for the group. The largest group Musser had ever assembled was an orchestra of 300 marimbas appearing at the Chicago Railroad Fair in 1950. The Deagan Company Musser joined the J.C. Deagan Company in 1930 as manager of the mallet instrument division. Perhaps the most significant development of Deagan instruments under his leadership was in the area tuning. Marimbas and xylophones to this point had a reputation for sounding \\"out of tune\\" due to certain inherent features of their design in the absence of modern acoustical theory. Musser was a member of the Acoustical Society of America and the Society for the Advancement of Science. He understood Fourier's theorem and the applications of that theorem to the tuning of a marimba bar. This understanding allowed Musser and the technicians at Deagan to tune not just the fundamental, but also the harmonics of the bar, creating a clear and unmuddled pitch. Musser Marimbas Following World War II, Musser left the Deagan Company to start his own firm, Musser Marimbas. In addition to marimbas, the company made vibraphones, xylophones, glockenspiels and chimes. Business acumen was not one of Musser's strengths, and the company was sold to Lyons Band Instrument Manufacturers in 1956. The Musser company was sold to Ludwig Drum company in 1965; the latter was sold to Selmer in 1981. Musser's design work, from the bars to the frame, helped to refine and standardize the marimba, although Keiko Abe and Yamaha are largely responsible for the concert marimba as we know it today. Northwestern Musser founded the marimba studies program at Northwestern University, the first of its kind, and headed the department from 1942 until 1952. There he instructed many outstanding marimba artists and teachers, including Vida Chenoweth. Compositions Musser's work as a composer spanned his entire career, though much of that work has been lost. As of 1941 he had published fifty-three works, including piano solos, sacred music, and arrangements for marimba and vibraphone. The only Musser originals that survive today are: * Etude in Ab, Op.6, No.2; * Etude, Op.6, No.8 (\\"Nature Boy\\"/\\"Whole Tone\\"); * Etude, Op.6, No.9 (B Major); * Etude in C Major, Op.6, No.10; * Prelude, Op.11, No.3 (G Major); * Etude, Op.11, No.4 (C Major); * Prelude, Op.11, No.7 (D Major). Those pieces remain standard repertoire for students and professionals alike. Musser assigned an opus number to 10 works at a time, and then began a new set. Since we know of works up to opus 11, it can safely be assumed that over 100 works have been lost. Musser was known to be somewhat disorganized and careless in certain matters, and with his etudes he would simply write one for a student, hand out the original, and think nothing more of it. Two of Musser's other surviving works are arrangements from his marimba orchestras. Rosales' \\"Bolero\\" from the 1933 Century of Progress Orchestra, and Saint-Sa√´ns' \\"Piano Concerto no. 2\\" from a 1942 performance by a 160-piece marimba orchestra at Soldier's Field in Chicago. The Musser Grip Musser developed the Musser grip, a new technique for playing the marimba with four mallets that differed significantly from the already existing cross grip. The musser grip allowed for greater independence between individual mallets, and would later be modified into its modern form by Leigh Howard Stevens. Engineering and astronomy Musser entered into a career as a scientist after leaving Northwestern in the early 1950s. He moved to Southern California in and began to do work in astronomy for Hughes and for NASA. He also developed classroom planetaria and other teaching materials which can be found at Cape Kennedy, the Air Force Academy, Griffith Observatory, and many schools and universities. Later he earned a doctorate in engineering from Oxford University.

A wide variety of cheeses are made throughout the country of Spain. Some of the Spanish cheeses are internationally renowned, such as the Manchego cheese of La Mancha. Some regions are better known for their cheeses than others; 26 cheeses are classified as Protected Designation of Origin (D.O.P.‚ÄîDenominaci√≥n de Origen Protegida) by Spain and the European Union. Many of the cheeses are manufactured from single types of milk (cow, goat or sheep), but a few are mixtures of different milks, and the milk may be raw, pasteurised or creamy. The cheeses are made in a wide variety of styles including fresh, cured, semi-cured and pressed paste, and some are inoculated with mould to make blue varieties. There is a huge variation in the presentation of cheeses, from the hard, dark-skinned, two-kilo Manchego to the soft, small quesitos.

Davis submitted the contract was frustrated, void, and therefore they were entitled to quantum meruit for the value of work done.  Judgment  The House of Lords held that although the performance of the contract had become more onerous it was not frustrated.

Instead he said the following.[1956] AC 696, 721 Lord Radcliffe concurred with the result.[1956] AC 696, 728-9 Another argument that failed as well was that an express term was incorporated that the agreed price was binding only if there were in fact adequate supplies of labour and materials.

He was an officer of the Austro-Hungarian Army. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I, he became one of the commanding officers in the Slovene volunteer army under Rudolf Maister's command that fought against German Austrian units during the struggle for the northern Slovenian borderlands. He later became an officer in the Army of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He died during the Austrian-Yugoslav struggles in 1919. He is considered a Slovenian national hero.http://www.napovednik.com/dogodek104310_predstavitev_nove_knjige_franjo_malgaj_vojni  Education and military career  He was born in Hru≈°evec near the Lower Styrian town of ≈†entjur, in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Slovenia). After finishing the elementary school in the nearby Styrian town of Celje, he enrolled to the Celje First Grammar School. He later studied in the Carniolan town of Kranj and in Pazin (Istria). After graduating from the school for infantry reserve officers in Graz, he participated in the Italian campaign during World War I. He participated in the first and second battles of the Isonzo, where he contracted Typhoid fever. After recovering, he was transferred to the Tyrolean sector of the front. For his bold attacks on the Italian stronghold on Monte Zebio he received the Golden Medal and transferred to the 87th Infantry regiment in Celje. In October 1918, he started to study law at the University of Graz.  Slovenian military leader After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the establishment of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs in late October 1918, he joined the Slovene volunteer army established by Rudolf Maister. This army, known as \\"Maister's fighters\\" (), seized the Slovene-inhabited territories in Lower Styria, and fought against the forces of the German Austria for the border areas in Styria and Carinthia. In early November, Malgaj gathered a group of Slovene volunteers around Celje and marched into southeast Carinthia (in what is now known as Slovenian Carinthia). Together with General Maister and a company of volunteers composed of soldiers of the Army of the Kingdom of Serbia that were retreating from imprisonment in Austria, he reached Lavam√ºnd and captured the Carinthian town of V√∂lkermarkt () in late November 1918.  Death  Accounts vary regarding his death. He either committed suicide on May 6, 1919 at Tolsti Vrh near Dravograd in Carinthia after being surrounded by Austrian soldiers, or he died after he accidentally activated a hand grenade attached to his belt. Unconfirmed rumors suggest he was shot by a group of soldiers from Serbia with whom he was allegedly in conflict. He was buried in the Carinthian town of Gu≈°tanj (now Ravne na Koro≈°kem).  Legacy  On 90th anniversary of Malgaj's death his memoirs from 1914 to 1919 were published. A primary school in ≈†entjur was named after him. Malgaj is well known in Slovenia because he led the group of Maister's soldiers that captured Me≈æa and the Me≈æa Valley for Slovenia after the First World War.

Christie commutes gun sentence, NJ.com (December 22, 2010).New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie Commutes Sentence of Man Sent to Jail for Owning Guns Legally, Fox News (December 21, 2010). after he was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison for possessing handguns legally purchased in Colorado and transported in New Jersey from one residence to another. On December 20, 2010, after Aitken had spent four months in prison, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie commuted Aitken's sentence to time served, and Aitken was released. On March 30, 2012, two of the three convictions were overturned by the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division and on April 4, 2012, the State of New Jersey dismissed the outstanding charge of illegal possession of firearms. Background Aitken states on his website that he is a digital marketer and entrepreneur who formerly worked for Edelman Digital. Aitken writes that he is a past Webby Award nominee.Brian D. Aitken: Digital Marketing Executive. Aitken was born in Pennsylvania and moved to Colorado where he married a fellow New Jersey √©migr√© and became a legal resident. After his divorce, he returned to New Jersey where he had attended college to be near his young son and other family members. During the course of his move back to New Jersey, he made several trips by commercial airline to and from Colorado. Prior to the last trip, he reviewed guidance from the United States Department of Homeland Security Transportation Security Administration to ensure he could legally transport three handguns in his checked luggage. Arrest On January 2, 2009, Aitken's mother dialed 911 while Aitken was packing his car to move to Hoboken. His mother hung-up the phone before the call was answered. The Mount Laurel Police Department responded to an abandoned 911 call to find that Aitken had said he \\"didn't see the point in being here if he couldn't see [his] son\\". This vague comment relayed to the police caused them to call Aitken on his cell phone to determine his 'state of mind'. Aitken told the officers he was not suicidal at which point Officer Michael Joy asked Aitken to return to Mount Laurel. Aitken asked if he was legally required to return to which Officer Joy responded that he did not have to return to Mount Laurel. Aitken thanked Officer Joy and stated that he would not be returning; however, minutes later Officer Joy made another call to Aitken notifying him that a 'General Alert' had been issued to New Jersey jurisdictions and that the Police would \\"pick him up\\" and \\"bring him back\\" if he did not return on his own. Officer Joy testified at trial that Aitken was \\"not free to leave until we're through with the matter\\" despite the fact that Aitken had not been charged with, or suspected of committing, a crime. Fearing a manhunt, Aitken returned to Mount Laurel and the responding officers searched Aitken's car and discovered three locked and unloaded handguns in the trunk. Aitken was subsequently arrested for possession of these weapons and was sentenced to seven years in prison by Judge James Morley. Judge Morley's decision not to provide information to the jury regarding exceptions to New Jersey's relatively strict firearm possession laws became a source of controversy. Gun laws in the United States vary widely by state and require expert knowledge to understand the differences. During the jury instructions, Judge Morley did not charge the jury with the exemptions to the New Jersey law despite arguments by the defense that Aitken met one of the exemptions and was therefore innocent of the charges. The jury returned three times requesting to be made aware of the laws that provide exemptions for lawful possession; however, all three requests were denied by the judge. One of the jury requests read: > Why did you make us aware at the start of the trial that the law allows a > person to carry a weapon if the person is moving or going to a shooting > range, and during the trial both the defense and prosecution presented > testimony as to whether or not the defendant was in the process of moving, > and then in your charge for us to deliberate we are not permitted to take > into consideration whether or not we believe the defendant was > moving?www.nationalreview.com/articles/258108/false-imprisonment-robert- > verbruggen?page=2.

Release and continued appeals On December 20, 2010, after Aitken had spent four months in prison, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie commuted Aitken's sentence to time served, and Aitken was released from Mid-State Correctional Annex.Chris Megerian, Gun owner Brian Aitken is released from prison after Gov. Christie commutes sentence, NJ.com (December 21, 2010). On March 30, 2012, the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division issued a decision overturning Aitken's conviction for second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and fourth-degree possession of a large-capacity ammunition magazine, but affirming his conviction for fourth-degree possession of prohibited ammunition (hollow point bullets). On the hollow point bullets charge, the court rejected Aitken's argument that the statute was unconstitutionally vague or that the \\"moving exemption\\" that applies to other gun laws (allowing owners to transport from one house to another while moving) should be read into the prohibited-ammunition statute, which does not contain such an exemption.State v.

He was the editor of the Morning Star in London, the only national newspaper in Britain to support the Unionist cause in the American Civil War. He died knowing that legal slavery in America had ended. In 2010 a U.S. Embassy attach√© visited the tomb of Samuel Lucas. Lucas lived to hear the \\"tidings of the destruction of the slave power in the United States\\" Biography Samuel Lucas was born in 1811 to a Quaker family in Wandsworth. Frederick Lucas was his younger brother. His father bought and sold corn. Lucas married his cousin Margaret Bright on 6 September 1839 who was also from a well connected family in the Society of Friends. His wife was to become famous in her own right largely after Lucas's death. Lucas worked for many good causes. He attended the World Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840 and he was included in the commemorative painting by Benjamin Haydon. Freeing slaves was to be a theme throughout his life. Another interest was secular schools, which Lucas championed in Manchester and where he met Richard Cobden. He had moved there in 1845 as he took an interest in a cotton mill and he stayed there for five years before returning to London. He became active for the Anti-Corn Law League which Cobden and John Bright had founded. His wife Margaret organised meetings and Samuel led them. Meanwhile, his wife took the leading role in caring for their daughter, Katherine, and their mute son. In August 1847 Lucas was a founding member of the Lancashire-based organisation that was to become the National Public Schools Association. He wrote a Plan for the Establishment of a General System of Secular Education in the County of Lancaster, By 1860 Lucas and his family had moved to London where he became a supporter of the Society for the Repeal of the Taxes on Knowledge. In March 1856, his brother in law, John Bright in partnership with Cobden created a new newspaper which was called the Morning Star. Lucas was appointed as the paper's editor. Lucas took a strong interest in running the paper where he was the \\"managing proprietor\\". Matthew Arnold described the paper as reflecting the \\"rancour of Protestant dissent in alliance with the vulgarity meddlesomeness and grossness of the British multitude.\\" Eventually Lucas became too ill to regularly attend, and he had to appoint a sub editor. However, he would still oversee the paper, and at times obliged journalists to write a second article that negated an opinion Lucas did not approve of. The paper took a strong line on anti-slavery and the Morning Star was the only national paper to support the Unionist side. In 1859 Lucas became the editor of the newly established Once A Week, a weekly illustrated literary magazine published by Bradbury and Evans. The magazine was founded after a dispute between Bradbury and Evans and Charles Dickens. The magazine was notable for its illustrations but after Lucas' death it went into decline and ceased printing in 1880. his newspaper on 24 April 1865. Lucas died in London on 15 April 1865 of a bronchial illness, and it was noted that he lived long enough to be told of end of the battle of Richmond which marked the end of the American Civil War and slavery in the United States. He was buried in Highgate Cemetery in London, where in time his wife was also buried. Legacy Lucas died before he could see the headlines in the Morning Star that marked the end of slavery.

Many of these document the development of the city's buildings, particularly facades and artistic finishings, in which he took a special interest. His shots often convey an unusual liveliness as he managed to catch his subjects in the course of their normal activities, sometimes amusingly portraying their leisure moments. Unlike other extant photographs of Luxembourg from the same period, those taken by Fischer are unusual in their number and continuity. Every weekend when he was free to walk around the town, Fischer would take the most recent examples of his work to the local authorities and receive a few hundred francs on condition he wrote a short description of the historical context on the back.

Elected office  After one term as a justice of the peace, and ten years as chairman of his ward, Kehrein was elected to the Assembly in 1902 for the 9th district of Milwaukee County (9th ward of the City of Milwaukee), succeeding fellow Democrat John C. Karel. Kehrein received 1,043 votes against 1,031 for Republican George Christianson, 939 for Social Democrat Edmund J. Berner, and 40 for independent Louis Ziener.Erickson, Halford, ed. The blue book of the state of Wisconsin 1903; p. 1106 He was defeated for re-election in 1904 in a re-match with Social Democrat Berner, who garnered 1,348 votes to 1,168 votes for Republican Frank Mueller, 844 votes for Kehrein, and 28 votes for Independent Republican Elias Lehman.Erickson, Halford (ed.). The blue book of the state of Wisconsin 1905 Democrat Printing Co., State Printer, 1905; pp. 1108-1109 He does not appear to have been any relation to Socialist Otto Kehrein, who would later represent the same district in the Assembly.

Facts The Suez canal became a \\"dangerous zone\\" as The Eugenia, carrying iron and steel, sailed towards it on the way to India from Odessa (but starting in Genoa). The charterers, in breach of a \\"general war clause\\" in the contract saying dangerous zones should be avoided, sailed into Port Said, thinking they could make it through the canal in time. The alternative was to sail around the Cape of Good Hope, which would have taken a long time. The ship was impounded as the canal was closed. The charterers then abandoned the contract and claimed it was frustrated. The claimant owners of the iron and steel claimed it was breach of contract. Judgment Lord Denning MR held that there was no frustration of the contract. First, that the charterers could not rely on any self-induced frustration (sailing into the canal) as a ground for arguing the contract was frustrated. If they had not tried the Suez canal, they would have had to sail round the Cape, but this would not have rendered the contract radically different. He said if the contract says something, \\"the contract must govern. There is no frustration.\\" But if the contract says nothing, onerous or more expensive is not enough; \\"It must be positively unjust to hold the parties bound. It is often difficult to draw the line. But it must be done, and it is the courts to do it as a matter of law: see Tsakiroglou.\\" He said that the material factors were that the difference in time was 108 days from Genoa via the Suez and 138 days via the Cape. The goods would not be adversely affected. The only trouble was it took longer. He firmly rejected, however, that frustration can only apply where the event is unforeseen or unexpected.

The hijacking was carried out by several Lebanese guerillas who demanded the release of 17 Shi'ite Muslim prisoners being held by Kuwait for their role in the 1983 Kuwait bombings. During the incident the flight, initially forced to land in Iran, traveled from Mashhad in northeastern Iran to Larnaca, Cyprus, and finally to Algiers. Kuwait sent officials to negotiate with the group, but negotiations became bogged down because the terrorists refused to release the hostages. Two hostages were killed during the course of the siege, before it eventually ended in Algiers on 20 April. The hijackers ‚Äì who were suspected by Kuwait of belonging to the Lebanon-based Hezbollah organisation ‚Äì were given passage out of Algeria. With a duration of 16 days, the crisis became one of the world's longest skyjackings. It also inspired a brief armed siege at a high school in the United States a few days later. Initial hijacking and flight to Iran On 5 April 1988, KU 422 departed Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok with 112 passengers and crew aboard, including three members of the Kuwaiti Royal Family. About three hours out of Bangkok, over the Arabian Sea, a number of Lebanese men armed with guns and hand grenades took control of the plane. A passenger later reported the hijackers to have said, \\"Don't worry, we are after redressing our rights denied by the Kuwaiti government\\". Although the passengers were restrained, they were not initially treated badly. The hijackers forced the pilot to fly to Iran, where authorities initially refused the plane permission to land, but later acquiesced on learning it was running out of fuel. After subsequently landing at Mashhad, the hijackers issued their demand for the release of 17 guerrillas held by Kuwait following their conviction for involvement in the 1983 Kuwait bombings. In addition they threatened to blow up the aircraft if anyone approached it, and to kill the three Kuwaiti Royals if their terms were not met. The hijackers were reported to number six or seven, and included Hassan Izz-Al-Din, who had previously been involved in the 1985 hijacking of TWA Flight 847. Following negotiations with the Iranian Prime Minister 25 hostages were released ‚Äì a man with a heart condition on 5 April, and 24 women the following day. A further 32 were allowed to leave the plane on 7 April after the Kuwaiti government sent a team of negotiators to Iran to talk to the hijackers. However, negotiations were frustrated by Kuwait's support for Iraq in the ongoing Gulf Conflict between that country and Iran, and no more hostages were released in Iran. The hijackers forced authorities to refuel the plane by threatening to take off with almost empty fuel tanks, and shooting at security officials. Cyprus, Algeria, and hostage deaths The plane took off from Mashhad on 8 April, but was refused landing permission at both Beirut in Lebanon and Damascus, Syria. However, after seven hours Cypriot authorities granted permission for it to land at Larnaca, where negotiations continued. Officials from Cyprus and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) engaged in talks with the hijackers, resulting in the release of a hostage on 9 April. A further twelve people were freed on 12 April. However, over the same period two passengers, Abdullah Khalidi, 25, and Khalid Ayoub Bandar, 20, both Kuwaitis, were shot dead by the hijackers and dumped on the tarmac in Cyprus, as the hijackers demanded more fuel. In addition the pilot reported incidents of passenger beatings. The hijackers also threatened to fly the plane into the Kuwaiti Royal Palace, and to carry out what they termed a \\"slow and quiet massacre\\" if the prisoners were not released. On another occasion they claimed to be preparing for death, having dressed in shrouds and renamed the aircraft the \\"Plane of the Great Martyrs\\", an incident which led to an angry exchange with the control tower when an official referred to the plane by its flight number. The plane was refueled and on 13 April took off again, this time heading for Algeria, which had given it permission to land there, and the final week of the hijacking played itself out at Houari Boumedienne Airport in Algiers. Algeria ‚Äì which had been a key player in the 1981 resolution of the Iran hostage crisis ‚Äì began talks with the hijackers as soon as the plane touched down in Algiers. The aircraft was parked close to the terminal building, but was asked to move briefly as a security measure upon the arrival of a plane carrying Kenneth Kaunda, the president of Zambia. Djuma Abdallah Shatti, a hostage with diabetes, was released on 14 April, leaving 31 people aboard. Afterwards the group issued a statement in which they said \\"We are not highway bandits. We are men of principle.\\" Two of the remaining passengers subsequently spoke to the control tower at Algiers Airport urging the hijackers demands to be met or those still on board would be killed. Reports again emerged of maltreatment, with claims passengers were being beaten for talking without permission, although these stories could not be confirmed. Another request was made for fuel on 16 April. Algerian authorities reportedly kept the aircraft on the ground there at the request of Kuwaiti and Saudi Arabian authorities, but talks were stalled when both sides reached an impasse, something Algeria blamed on Kuwait's unwillingness to discuss the 17 prisoners, which it described as \\"intransigent\\". On 18 April members of the Kuwait national football team offered to take the place of the hostages. On the same day one of the Kuwaiti Royals held aboard, Prince Fadhal al-Sabah, urged his country's government to release the prisoners. Release of final hostages and aftermath The group released their final hostages on 20 April, before surrendering themselves to Algerian authorities. Kuwait did not free the 17 prisoners and the hijackers were allowed to leave Algiers. Before surrendering, however, they issued a statement saying they would continue to fight for the release of the prisoners. They were later flown to an undisclosed destination. At its conclusion the crisis had lasted 16 days, making it one of the world's longest skyjackings. With the hostage crisis over the remaining passengers were flown back to Kuwait. The two Kuwaitis killed during the course of the hijacking were buried at a ceremony attended by over 2,000 people. On 25 April, Time Magazine reported that many Middle East leaders had condemned the hijacking because it had shifted focus away from the Palestinian uprising against Israel that had commenced a few months earlier. It also frustrated already tense relations between Iran and the PLO. The Kuwait government believed the hijacking to be the work of Hezbollah, a pro- Iranian Shi'ite group based in Lebanon. Many of the freed passengers claimed that Iran had aided the hijackers by providing weapons and explosives while the plane was at Mashhad Airport. Kuwaiti security officer Khaled Nasser Zaferi said that several more men boarded the plane after landing in Iran. \\"They produced a submachine gun and explosives they didn't have before. They were disguised as cleaning workers, but their performance was so bad and unprofessional that most of us whispered to each other, 'These must be Iranian security men.' \\" Passengers said the hijackers wiped surfaces clean of fingerprints, and removed other identifying evidence from the aircraft before the siege ended, while pilot Captain Subhi Yousif told reporters he had been unaware of the deaths of the two Kuwaiti men until his release. The hijacking prompted an incident at San Gabriel High School in San Gabriel, California on 26 April 1988, when student Jeffrey Lyne Cox held a humanities class hostage with a semi-automatic rifle for over 30 minutes. Cox, who threatened to kill his classmates, was overpowered by fellow students and then detained by police. A friend later told the press that Cox had been inspired by the hijacking and the 1977 Stephen King novel Rage.

It is located in the center of campus in the academic quad near the university‚Äôs seal and the hub. Miami University was founded in 1809 and the first class graduated in 1824. Uses Upham Hall is the home to many different departments at Miami University. They include anthropology, the Center for Environmental Education, the Scripps Gerontology Center, history, humanities center, Jewish studies, pre-law programs, sociology and gerontology, and statistics. In addition to being the home of these departments, this academic hall is the home to many professors offices and classrooms. Construction Construction on Upham Hall began on February 16, 1946 with the laying of the cornerstone in honor of Dr. Alfred H. Upham. At the time, Upham Hall was to be the biggest building on campus. The first part constructed consisted of eighteen classrooms, two seminar rooms, 29 faculty offices, and other service rooms. In the cornerstone on this building was placed a box which contained information about Dr. Upham‚Äôs life and death. Some of the materials included in this box were a student directory, newspapers, a 1946 campus yearbook which was dedicated to Dr. Upham, and a photograph of the current president of Miami. Alfred H. Upham Dr. Upham was born March 2, 1877 and is from Eaton, Ohio. He first came to Miami University as a freshman undergraduate in 1896. He received his Master's Degree from Harvard University in 1901 and his Ph.D from Columbia University in 1908. He married Mary Collins McClintock on June 28, 1905. With her he had one daughter, Margaret Louise. He was president of the University of Idaho from 1920 to 1928, when he then became the president of Miami University until his death on February 17, 1945. He led Miami during the difficult times of the Great Depression and World War II. Dr. Upham was known for many of his writings, including the ‚ÄúOld Miami‚Äù anthem, penned in 1909 for the Miami University Centennial . Upham also wrote Old Miami, the Yale of the Early West. Upham Arch A sketch of the center section of Upham Hall from the Miami University Archives. Perhaps the most famous part of Upham Hall is the Upham Hall Arch, located in the center of the building. Engraved over the arch, which was added to the building in 1948, are the words of John 8:32: ‚ÄúYe shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.\\" The arch was a midpoint between the two parts of campus. To the west of the arch was the campus that already existed, and to the east was the part of Miami‚Äôs campus not yet built. According to the Miami legend, ‚Äúif you kiss your true love under the Upham Hall Arch, you will marry and the bond will never be broken.‚ÄùThis may be the most famous of the Miami University legends. Related to the Upham Arch superstition is the term ‚ÄúMiami Mergers.‚Äù This term is used to describe a marriage between two Miami graduates. As a way to recognize these mergers, Miami sends them a Valentine‚Äôs Day card every year they are married, a tradition that started in 1973. Miami has an unusually large number of students who marry each other, approximately 14%, compared to 3‚Äì4% for other colleges and universities. On June 20, 2009 Miami broke a world record due to their long legend of Miami Mergers. 1,087 couples renewed their wedding vows under the Upham Hall Arch. This constituted a Guinness World Record for the most people renewing their wedding vows at once. This number almost doubled the previous record. All 26,472 mergers were invited to the event.

Impaler formed in the spring of 1983 with founding members Bill Lindsey (vocals), Michael James Torok (guitar), \\"Commander\\" Court Hawley (bass), Robert \\"Meaty Bob\\" Johnson (drums), and Mike Senn (guitar). The band played original songs sprinkled with a few covers by favorite influential bands such as Kiss, Alice Cooper, and Mot√∂rhead. Bill Lindsey is the sole continuing member of Impaler, keeping the band alive for over 30 years. Impaler has a theatrical show which features fake blood, cages, coffins, latex severed heads and a finale that includes a mock disemboweling of victims.  History  Combat Records Impaler recorded demo tapes which caught the ear of Important Record Distributors and lead to the band being signed to the in-house labels IRD Records and Combat Records. They released two records with these labels, the EP Rise of the Mutants in (1985), which caused much controversy with Tipper Gore and her Parents Music Resource Center organization, and their debut LP If We Had Brains... We'd Be Dangerous in 1986, produced by Bob Mould of H√ºsker D√º. Not continuing their relationship with Combat Records, the band went on to release many more albums with various labels. 1990s The 1990s was a prolific decade for Impaler, seeing the band release four albums. Wake Up Screaming! on Channel 83 Records with second guitarist John Stradinger, followed by a demo tape Sonic Freak Show in 1995 and a self-financed release on the band's own Vlad Productions titled Undead Things (1996). It Won't Die came out in 1998 after Impaler signed with Root of All Evil Records. That label also released One Nation Under Ground. The Gruesome Years featured the two Combat releases and additional bonus tracks, plus the Black Leather Monster 7\\" vinyl and a 7\\" EP titled The Mutants Rise Again for Danish label Horror Records. At this point, the band appeared at high-profile metal festivals like Milwaukee Metal Fest, New Jersey March Metal Meltdown, Classic Metal Fest and Expo of the Extreme, exposing fans to their raw punk/metal sound and energetic, theatrical stage show. 2000s Impaler continued with a high rate of output during the first decade of the 2000s, releasing four albums, including Old School Ghouls and Habeas Corpus, their last for Root of All Evil Records. Habeas Corpus marked the return of original bassist Court Hawley. The band signed with MVD Audio for the band's first official live recording, Alive Beyond the Grave, their first concept album, Cryptozoology (Creatures of God?), which marked the return of original guitarist Michael James Torok, the DVDs 20 Years Undead and House Band at the Funeral Parlor and two split 7\\" singles, one featuring fellow Minnesota band Ripsnorter and the other backed with two tracks by Iowa grind/crust band Black Market Fetus. In 2009, Lindsay contributed his recipe for Bloody Intestines and Worms to Hellbent for Cooking: The Heavy Metal Cookbook; however, the recipe clarifies that the ingredients are actually Italian sausage and onions. The following year Impaler released Chronicles of Terror (2010), an album containing old demos of their unreleased songs, as well as cover songs, a live show, and a twenty-page booklet that contained an interview with band members and rare photos of the group. Also released during the decade was the EP, 30 Year and Rising on Old Cemetery Records in 2012, the singles \\"Krampus\\" (2014) and \\"Cass Lake Christmas Massacre\\" (2017) along with their cover of \\"Go Away\\" on the compilation, Tribute to Eric Moore and The Godz, Vol. 3 Gotta Keep A Runnin, in 2017, in 2019 there were two new releases from the band ‚ÄúLive At First Ave‚Äù and the split EP with Ripsnorter ‚ÄúIf Death Were A Horse‚Äù. Impaler's star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First AvenueThe band has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \\"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\\" according to journalist Steve Marsh.  Controversy  Impaler had much controversy in the 1980s with Tipper Gore and her P.M.R.C. group. During this time, Gore wanted the public to think of rock music as evil and as spreading violence and sexuality to young kids. When Rise of the Mutants was released in 1985, it struck the entertainment industry with its violent and gory album cover. Outside of Impaler concerts, protesters would burn the album and hang crosses. Tipper Gore tried to get the album off of record store shelves, but failed to do so, giving Impaler more publicity than they expected. In 1996, when Undead Things was released, it sparked controversy with Best Buy. Best Buy tried to remove the CD from store shelves thinking the cover was too graphic, showing Lindsey split open with surgical tools still attached to him.  Lyrical themes  Impaler's writing style generally is about B-movie horrors, with lyrics about Halloween, ghouls, ghosts, monsters, witches, and skeletons. One song, \\"Heaven's Force\\", has some double meaning with religion and the film Star Wars.

Facts In 1957 Nelson Bunker Hunt obtained an oil concession for the Sarir field in Libya. In 1960, he contracted with BP to exploit the oil. The contract said (1) Hunt would transfer BP half the concession (2) BP would transfer Hunt 'farm in' contributions in cash and oil (3) BP would explore for and develop the oil (4) BP provided all funds until the oil was found, and (5) the profits would be shared, but 3/8 of Hunt's share would go to BP until 125% of the farm in contributions and half the costs of BP were covered. A massive oil reserve was found in 1967. However, in 1971, 2 years after the Libyan government was overthrown and replaced by Muammar Gaddafi, it nationalised BP's half share. BP had already covered half its costs. Two years later in 1973, the Libyan government also expropriated Hunt from his share. BP claimed the contract was frustrated, and claimed for a just sum of money to be awarded under the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943, section 1(3). Judgment High Court Robert Goff J held the contract was frustrated in 1971 and under the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943, section 1(3) awarded BP $35.4m plus interest. He held there are two steps in a section 1(3) claim. First, identify the value of the benefit, which could be the value of the services performed or the end product of the services. Regard can be had to the value of services when no end product results or where the end product has no objective value, but where the end product is destroyed by fire, there is no claim under section 1(3) because the value has been reduced to zero by the frustrating event. The effect, therefore, was to lead to the same result as in Appleby. The second step is to assess what is a ‚Äòjust sum‚Äô. Robert Goff J said it was the sum that would lead to ‚Äòthe prevention of the unjust enrichment of the defendant at the plaintiff‚Äôs expense‚Äô Court of Appeal The Court of Appeal upheld the decision of Goff J. Lawton LJ said that judges under the Act have complete discretion to award what they think is fair, and found he got 'no help from the use of words which are not in the statute', such as \\"unjust enrichment\\".[1982] 1 All ER 925, 980 House of Lords A more limited appeal on the wording of section 2(3) was dismissed.[1983] 2 AC 352 See also *English contract law *Frustration in English law References Category:House of Lords cases Category:1983 in case law Category:1983 in British law Category:English frustration case law Category:BP ","title":"BP Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd v Hunt (No 2)"},{"id":"29859649","text":"Just Love is the debut album by singer Brian Courtney Wilson.

The Great Naktong Offensive was a North Korean military offensive against United Nations Command (UN) forces early in the Korean War, taking place from September 1‚Äì15, 1950. It was the North Korean Korean People's Army (KPA)'s unsuccessful final bid to break the Pusan Perimeter established by the UN forces. For the first several months of the war, the KPA successfully defeated and pushed back the UN forces south at each encounter. However, by August the UN troops (which were composed mostly of troops from the United States (US) and Republic of Korea Army (ROK) had been forced into the Pusan Perimeter on the southeast tip of the Korean peninsula. For the first time, the UN troops formed a continuous line which the KPA could neither flank nor overwhelm with superior numbers. KPA offensives on the perimeter were stalled and by the end of August all momentum was lost. Seeing the danger in a prolonged conflict along the perimeter, the KPA sought a massive offensive for September to collapse the UN line. The KPA subsequently planned a simultaneous offensive for their entire army along five axes of the perimeter; and on September 1 intense fighting erupted around the cities of Masan, Kyongju, Taegu, Yongch'on and the Naktong Bulge. What followed was two weeks of extremely brutal fighting as the two sides vied to control the routes into Pusan. Initially successful in some areas, the KPA were unable to hold their gains against the numerically and technologically superior UN force. The KPA, again stalled at the failure of this offensive, was outflanked by the Inchon landings on 15 September and on 16 September the UN forces began their breakout from the Pusan Perimeter.  Background  From the outbreak of the Korean War following the invasion of South Korea by the North in June 1950, the KPA had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over the ROK and the UN forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing. The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them, attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit, which allowed the KPA to surround and cut off the opposing force, which would then be forced to retreat in disarray, often leaving behind much of its equipment. From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August, the KPA used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south. However, with the establishment of the Pusan Perimeter in August, the UN troops held a continuous line which the KPA could not flank, and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN forces. When the KPA approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5, they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter. Throughout August, the KPA 6th Division, and later the 7th Division engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of Masan, initially repelling a UN counteroffensive before attacking Komam-ni and Battle Mountain. These attacks stalled as UN forces, well equipped and with large standing units of reserves, repeatedly repelled KPA attacks. North of Masan, the KPA 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division sparred in the Naktong Bulge area. In the First Battle of Naktong Bulge, the KPA was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserves were brought in to repel it, and on August 19, the KPA 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties. In the Taegu region, five KPA divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of Taegu. Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the Bowling Alley where the KPA 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack. On the east coast, three more KPA divisions were repulsed by the ROK at P'ohang-dong during the Battle of P'ohang-dong. All along the front, the KPA were reeling from these defeats, the first time in the war their strategies were failing. By the end of August the KPA had been pushed beyond their limits and many of the original units were at far reduced strength and effectiveness. Logistic problems racked the KPA, and shortages of food, weapons, equipment and replacement soldiers proved devastating for their units. By late August, the UN command had more combat soldiers in Korea than the North Koreans did, and UN superiority over the air and sea meant the North Koreans were at a disadvantage which was growing daily. KPA tank losses had been in the hundreds, and they had fewer than 100 tanks by the time of the Pusan Perimeter fight, to the Americans' 600 tanks. By the end of August the KPA's only remaining advantage was their initiative. However, their forces retained high morale and enough supply to allow for a large-scale offensive.  Prelude  In planning its new offensive, the KPA command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN naval forces. Instead, they opted to use a frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle. Fed with intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware that the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle. A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN units in that city. As part of this mission, the KPA would first cut the supply lines to Taegu. North Korean planners enlarged the KPA force in anticipation of a new offensive. The KPA, originally numbering 10 divisions in two corps, was enlarged to 14 divisions with several independent brigades. The new troops were brought in from reserve forces from North Korea. Marshal Choe Yong Gun served as deputy commander of the KPA, with General Kim Chaek in charge of the Front Headquarters. Beneath them were the II Corps in the east, commanded by Lieutenant General Kim Mu Chong, and I Corps in the west, under Lieutenant General Kim Ung. II Corps controlled the 10th Division, 2nd Division, 4th Division, 9th Division, 7th Division, 6th Division and 105th Armored Division, with the 16th Armored Brigade and 104th Security Brigade in support. I Corps commanded the 3rd Division, 13th Division, 1st Division, 8th Division, 15th Division, 12th Division and 5th Division with the 17th Armored Brigade in support. This force numbered approximately 97,850 men, although a third of it comprised raw recruits, forced conscripts from South Korea, and lacked weapons and equipment. By August 31 they were facing a UN force of 120,000 combat troops plus 60,000 support troops. On August 20, the North Korean commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units. The plan called for a simultaneous five-prong attack against the UN lines. These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the KPA to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back. Five battle groupings were ordered: # 6th and 7th Divisions break through the US 25th Infantry Division at Masan. # 9th, 4th, 2nd and 10th Divisions break through the US 2nd Infantry Division at the Naktong Bulge to Miryang and Yeongsan. # 3rd, 13th and 1st Divisions break through the US 1st Cavalry Division and ROK 1st Infantry Division to Taegu. # 8th and 15th Divisions break through the ROK 8th Infantry Division and 6th Infantry Division to Hayang and Yongch'on. # 12th and 5th Divisions break through the ROK Capital Division and 3rd Infantry Division to P'ohang-dong and Kyongju. On August 22 the North Korean premier, Kim Il Sung, had ordered his forces to conclude the war by September 1, yet the scale of the offensive did not allow this. Groups 1 and 2 were to begin their attack at 23:30 on August 31, and Groups 3, 4 and 5 would begin their attacks at 18:00 on September 2. The attacks were to closely connect in order to overwhelm UN troops at each point simultaneously, forcing breakthroughs in multiple places that the UN would be unable to reinforce. The KPA relied primarily on night attacks to counter UN air superiority and naval firepower, with the KPA generals believing that such attacks would prevent UN forces from firing effectively and result in heavy casualties from friendly fire. The attacks caught UN planners and troops by surprise. By August 26, the UN troops thought they had destroyed the last serious threats to the perimeter, and anticipated the war ending by late November. ROK units, in the meantime, suffered from low morale as a result of their failures to defend effectively thus far in the conflict, and a cautious US Eighth Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker ordered Major General John B. Coulter to the P'ohang-dong area to shore up the ROK I Corps, which was falling apart due to low morale. UN troops were preparing for Operation Chromite, an amphibious assault on the port of Inchon on September 15, and did not anticipate that the KPA would mount a serious offensive before then.  Battle   Kyongju corridor  The first KPA attack struck the UN right flank on the east coast. Although the KPA II Corps' general attack in the north and east was planned for September 2, the KPA 12th Division, now with a strength of 5,000 men, started to move forward from the mountains earlier than planned, from where it had reorganized after its defeat in the Kigye and P'ohang-dong area. The division was low in food, weapons, and ammunition, and its men suffered from low morale. Facing the 12th Division was the ROK Capital Division. At 04:00 on August 27, a KPA attack overran one company of the ROK 17th Regiment, Capital Division, north of Kigye. This caused the whole regiment to buckle and retreat. Then the ROK 18th Regiment to the east fell back because of its exposed flank. The ROK 17th Regiment lost the town of Kigye in pulling back, and the entire Capital Division fell back to the south side of the Kigye valley. Walker ordered Major General Coulter to observe the ROK troops on the east. Coulter flew to Kyongju, arriving there at 12:00 that day. Walker in the meantime formally appointed Coulter Deputy Commander, Eighth Army, placing him in command of ROK I Corps which controlled the Capital and 3rd Divisions, the US 21st Infantry Regiment, the 3rd Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment and the 73rd Medium Tank Battalion, less C Company. Coulter designated these units Task Force Jackson and established his headquarters in the same building in Kyongju in which the ROK I Corps commander and the Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG) officers had their command post. Coulter was tasked with eliminating the KPA penetration in the Kigye area and of seizing and organizing the high ground extending from north of Yongch'on to the coast at Wolp'o-ri, about north of P'ohang-dong. This line passed north of Kigye. Coulter was to attack as soon as possible with Task Force Jackson to gain the first high ground north of Kigye. The US 21st Infantry Regiment was moving to a position north of Taegu on the morning of August 27, when Walker revoked its orders and instructed it to turn around and proceed as rapidly as possible to Kyongju and report to Coulter. Coulter immediately sent the 3rd Battalion north to An'gang-ni where it went into a position behind the ROK Capital Division. Coulter's plan to attack on August 28 had to be postponed. Brigadier General Kim Hong-il, the ROK I Corps commander, told him he could not attack, that there were too many casualties and the South Koreans were exhausted. The KPA 5th Division above P'ohang-dong had begun to press south again and the ROK 3rd Division in front of it began to show signs of pulling back. On the 28th, the KMAG adviser to the ROK 3rd Division and Brigadier General Kim Suk Won clashed over whether the division should retreat or attack. That day, August 28, Walker issued a special statement addressed to the ROK, and meant also for the South Korean Minister of Defense, Shin Sung-mo. He called on the ROK troops to hold their lines in the Pusan Perimeter, and implored the rest of the UN troops to defend their ground as firmly as possible, counterattacking as necessary to prevent the KPA from consolidating their gains. At the same time, elements of the KPA 5th Division penetrated the ROK 3rd Division southwest of P'ohang-dong. Coulter directed the 21st Infantry to repel this penetration. During the day on August 29, B Company, 21st Infantry, supported by a platoon of tanks of B Company, 73rd Medium Tank Battalion, successfully counterattacked northwest from the southern edge of P'ohang-dong for a distance of , with ROK troops following. The American units then withdrew to P'ohang-dong. That night the ROK withdrew and the next day an American infantry-tank force repeated the action of the day before. The 21st Infantry then took over from the ROK 3rd Division a sector extending north and northwest of P'ohang-dong. Also on August 29, the ROK Capital Division, with American tank and artillery support, recaptured Kigye and held it during the night against KPA counterattacks, only to lose it again at dawn. UN air attacks continued at an increased tempo in the Kigye area. North Korean attacks on the Kyoongju corridor, August 27 ‚Äì September 15, 1950. At the same time, KPA pressure built up steadily north of P'ohang-dong, where the KPA 5th Division fed replacements on to Hill 99 in front of the ROK 23rd Regiment. This hill became almost as notorious as Hill 181 near Yongdok had earlier because of the almost continuous and bloody fighting that occurred there for its control. Although aided by UN air strikes and artillery and naval gunfire, the ROK 3rd Division was not able to capture this hill, and suffered many casualties in the effort. On September 2 the US 21st Infantry attacked northwest from P'ohang-dong in an effort to help the ROK recapture Hill 99. A platoon of tanks followed the valley road between P'ohang-dong and Hunghae. The regimental commander assigned K Company Hill 99 as its objective. The company was unable to take Hill 99 from the well dug-in North Koreans. At dusk a KPA penetration occurred along the boundary between the ROK Capital and 3rd Divisions east of Kigye. The next morning, September 2 at 01:30, the KPA 12th Division, executing its part of the coordinated KPA II Corps general attack, struck the Capital Division on the high hill masses south of the Kigye valley. This attack threw back the ROK 18th Regiment on the left in the area of Hills 334 and 438, and the ROK 17th Regiment on the right in the area of Hill 445. By dawn of September 3, the KPA penetration there had reached the vital east‚Äìwest corridor road east of An'gang-ni. As a result of this gain during the night, the KPA 12th Division had advanced and the Capital Division all but collapsed. This forced Coulter to withdraw the 21st Infantry from the line northwest of P'ohang-dong and concentrate it in the vicinity of Kyongju. The 2nd Battalion had joined the regiment on August 31, but Coulter had held it in the task force's reserve at An'gang-ni. That battalion now took up a horseshoe-shaped defense position around the town, with some elements on high ground east where they protected the Kyongju to P'ohang-dong highway. The rest of the regiment closed into an assembly area north of Kyongju. At the same time, Walker started the newly activated ROK 7th Division toward the KPA penetration. Its ROK 5th Regiment closed at Yongch'on that afternoon, and the ROK 3rd Regiment, less its 1st Battalion, closed at Kyongju in the evening. Walker also authorized Coulter to use the 3rd Battalion, 9th Infantry; the 9th Infantry Regimental Tank Company; and the 15th Field Artillery Battalion as he deemed advisable. These units, held at Yonil Airfield for its defense, had not previously been available for commitment elsewhere. During the day on September 3, Coulter and the KMAG advisers continued to clash with the ROK 3rd Division commander, who repeatedly attempted to withdraw his troops against their orders. That night, September 3/4, the remainder of the ROK I Corps front collapsed. Three KPA T-34 tanks overran a battery of ROK artillery and then scattered two battalions of the newly arrived ROK 5th Regiment. Following a mortar preparation, the KPA entered An'gang-ni at 02:20. An hour later the command post of the Capital Division withdrew from the town and fighting became increasingly confused. US units disengaged and withdrew and by nightfall, the KPA held the town and began advancing southward along the railroad. By 12:00 on September 4, KPA units had established roadblocks along the Kyongju-An'gang-ni road within of Kyongju. A gap existed between the ROK 3rd and Capital Divisions in the P'ohang-dong area. But the big break in the UN line was in the high mountain mass west of the Hyongsan valley and southwest of An'gang-ni. In this area northwest of Kyongju there was an gap between the Capital Division and the ROK 8th Division to the west. From that direction the KPA posed a threat to the railroad and the road net running south through the Kyongju corridor to Pusan. Faced with this big gap on his left flank, Coulter put the US 21st Infantry in the broad valley and on its bordering hills northwest of Kyongju to block any approach from that direction. The night of September 5/6, events reached a climax inside P'ohang- dong. The ROK division commander, Brigadier General Lee Jun Shik and several members of his senior staff claimed they became sick after their command post was hit with artillery fire. The division withdrew from P'ohang-dong, and on September 6 it was again in KPA hands. The ROK command relieved both the ROK I Corps and 3rd Division commanders. At this time new commanders were appointed for these major commands. Brigadier General Kim Paik Il took command of ROK I Corps, while Capital Division came under command of Colonel Song Yo Ch'an, and 3rd Division came under command of Colonel Lee Jong Ch'an.  Yongch'on  In the high mountains between the Taegu sector on the west and the Kyongju- east coast sector, two KPA divisions, the 8th and 15th, also prepared an attack south on September 1 to break the supply route between Taegu and P'ohang-dong, which was in the vicinity of Hayang and Yongch'on. This attack would coordinate with the KPA offensive in the Kigye-P'ohang area. Hayang is , and Yongch'on east of Taegu. The KPA 8th Division was astride the main Andong- Sinnyong-Yongch'on road northwest of Yongch'on and the KPA 15th Division was eastward in the mountains just below Andong, north of Yongch'on on a poor and mountainous secondary road. The objective of the 8th Division was Hayang; the objective of the 15th was Yongch'on, which the division had orders to take at all costs. Opposing the 8th Division was the ROK 6th Division; in front of the 15th Division stood the ROK 8th Division. In ten days of fighting the KPA 8th Division gained only a few miles, and not until September 12 did it have possession of Hwajong-dong, northwest of Yongch'on. In this time it lost nearly all the 21 new T-34 tanks of the 17th Armored Brigade that were supporting it. Just below Hwajong-dong, mountains close in on the road, with Hill 928 (Hwa-san) on the east and lesser peaks on the west. At this passage of the mountains into the Taegu corridor, the ROK 6th Division decisively defeated the KPA 8th Division and practically destroyed it. By September 8 some of the KPA battalions could muster no more than 20 men. On the next road eastward above Yongch'on, the KPA 15th Division launched its attack against the ROK 8th Division on September 2. Although far understrength, with its three regiments reportedly having a total of only 3,600 men, it penetrated in four days to the lateral corridor at Yongch'on. North of the town, one regiment of the ROK 8th Division crumbled when a T-34 tank got behind its lines. Elements of the KPA division were in and south of Yongch'on by September 6. The KPA did not remain in the town, but moved to the hills south and southeast of it overlooking the road between Taegu and P'ohang-dong. On September 7 some of the KPA troops established a roadblock southeast of Yongch'on, and other elements attacked a ROK regiment south of the town. During the day, however, the ROK 5th Regiment, 7th Division, attacking from the east along the lateral corridor, cleared Yongch'on itself of North Koreans and then went into a defensive position north of the town. But the next day, September 8, additional elements of the KPA 15th Division arrived before Yongch'on and recaptured it. That afternoon the ROK 11th Regiment, 1st Division arrived from the Taegu front and counterattacked the KPA in and near the town. This action succeeded in clearing the KPA from most of Yongch'on, but some still held the railroad station southeast of it. Still others were an unknown distance southeast on the road toward Kyongju. In the hills southeast and east of Yongch'on, the KPA 15th Division encountered very stiff resistance. Its artillery regiment outpaced the infantry, expended its ammunition, and, without support, was then largely destroyed by ROK counterattack. The KPA artillery commander was killed in the action. After the ROK 5th and 11th Regiments arrived in the vicinity of Yongch'on to reinforce the demoralized 8th Division, the fighting was so intense that the two armies had no chance to regroup for co-ordinating action. On September 9 and 10 ROK units surrounded and virtually destroyed the KPA 15th Division southeast of Yongch'on on the hills bordering the Kyongju road. The KPA division chief of staff, Colonel Kim Yon, was killed there together with many other high-ranking officers. The part played by KMAG officers in rounding up stragglers of the ROK 8th Division and in reorganizing its units was an important factor in the successful outcome of these battles. On September 10, the ROK 8th Division cleared the Yongch'on-Kyongju road of KPA. Advancing north of Yongch'on after the retreating survivors of the KPA 15th Division, the ROK 8th Division and the 5th Regiment, 7th Division encountered almost no resistance. On September 12, elements of the two ROK units were north of the town. ROK forces now also advanced east from Yongch'on and north from Kyongju to close the breach in their lines. The most critical period of the fighting in the east occurred when the KPA 15th Division broke through the ROK 8th Division to Yongch'on. The KPA division attempted to turn east and southeast and take Task Force Jackson in the rear or on its left flank. But Walker's quick dispatch of the ROK 5th and 11th Regiments from two widely separated sectors of the front to the area of penetration resulted in destroying the force before it could exploit its breakthrough. Walker was commended for his judgment of the reinforcements needed to stem the KPA attacks in the Kyongju and Yongch'on areas.  Taegu   Tabu-dong  North Korean attacks on Taegu, September 1950. While four divisions of the KPA II Corps attacked south in the P'ohang-dong, Kyongju, and Yongch'on area, the remaining three divisions of the corps, the 3rd, 13th and 1st, conducted a converging attack on Taegu from the north and northwest. The KPA 3rd Division was to attack in the Waegwan area northwest of Taegu, the KPA 13th Division down the mountain ridges north of Taegu along and west of the Sangju-Taegu road and the KPA 1st Division along the high mountain ridges just east of the road. Defending Taegu, the US 1st Cavalry Division had a frontage of approximately . The Division commander Major General Hobart R. Gay outposted the main avenues of entry into his zone and kept his three regiments concentrated behind these outposts. Walker ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to attack north on September 1 in an effort to divert some of the KPA strength from the US 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions in the south. Gay's initial decision upon receipt of this order was to attack north up the Sangju road, but his staff and regimental commanders all joined in urging that the attack instead be against Hill 518 in the US 7th Cavalry Regiment zone. Only two days before, Hill 518 had been in the ROK 1st Division zone and had been considered a KPA assembly point. The 1st Cavalry Division, accordingly, prepared for an attack in the 7th Cavalry sector and for diversionary attacks by two companies of the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, on the 7th Cavalry's right flank. This left the 8th Cavalry only one infantry company in reserve. The regiment's 1st Battalion was on the hill mass to the west of the Bowling Alley and north of Tabu-dong; its 2nd Battalion was astride the road. This planned attack against Hill 518 coincided with the defection of Major Kim Song Jun of the KPA 19th Regiment, 13th Division. He reported that a full-scale KPA attack was to begin at dusk that day. The KPA 13th Division, he said, had just taken in 4,000 replacements, 2,000 of them without weapons, and was now back to a strength of approximately 9,000 men. Upon receiving this intelligence, Gay alerted all front-line units to be prepared for the attack. Complying with Eighth Army's order for a spoiling attack against the North Koreans northwest of Taegu, Gay ordered the 7th Cavalry to attack on September 2 and seize Hill 518. Situated north of the lateral Waegwan-Tabu‚Äìdong road, and about midway between the two towns, it was a critical terrain feature dominating the road between the two places. After securing Hill 518, the 7th Cavalry attack was to continue on to Hill 346. Air strikes and artillery preparations were to precede the infantry attack. On the morning of September 2 the US Air Force delivered a 37-minute strike against Hills 518 and 346. The artillery then laid down its concentrations on the hills, and after that the planes came over again with Napalm, leaving the heights on fire. Just after 10:00, and immediately after the final napalm strike, the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, attacked up Hill 518. The heavy air strikes and the artillery preparations had failed to dislodge the KPA. From their positions they fired on the climbing infantry, stopping the lead elements of the US force short of the crest. In the afternoon the US battalion withdrew from Hill 518 and attacked northeast against Hill 490, from which other KPA troops had fired in support of the forces on Hill 518. The next day at 12:00, the newly arrived 3rd Battalion resumed the attack against Hill 518 from the south, as did the 1st Battalion the day before, in a column of companies that resolved itself in the end into a column of squads. Again the attack failed. Other attacks failed on September 4. A KPA forward observer captured on Hill 518 said that 1,200 North Koreans were dug in on the hill and that they had large numbers of mortars and ammunition to hold out. US 1st Cavalry Division troops look down on Hill 518 from an observation post north of Waegwan, September 1950. While these attacks were in progress on its right, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, on September 4 attacked and captured Hill 303. The next day it had difficulty in holding the hill against counterattacks. By September 4 it had become clear that the KPA 3rd Division in front of the 5th and 7th Cavalry Regiments was also attacking, and despite continued air strikes, artillery preparations, and infantry efforts on Hill 518, it was infiltrating large numbers of its troops to the rear of the attacking US forces. That night large KPA forces came through the gap between the 3rd Battalion on the southern slope of Hill 518 and the 2nd Battalion westward. The KPA turned west and occupied Hill 464 in force. By September 5, Hill 464 to the rear of the US 7th Cavalry had more KPA on it than Hill 518 to its front. The KPA cut the Waegwan to Tabu-dong road east of the regiment so that its communications with other US units now were only to the west. During the day the 7th Cavalry made a limited withdrawal on Hill 518, giving up on capturing the hill. On the division's right, Tabu-dong was in KPA hands, on the left Waegwan was a no-man's land, and in the center strong KPA forces were infiltrating southward from Hill 518. The 7th Cavalry Regiment in the center could no longer use the Waegwan-Tabu-dong lateral supply road behind it, and was in danger of being surrounded. After discussing a withdrawal plan with Walker, on September 5 Gay issued an order for a general withdrawal of the 1st Cavalry Division during the night to shorten the lines and to occupy a better defensive position. Heavy rains fell during the night of September 5/6 and mud slowed all wheeled and tracked vehicles in the withdrawal. The 2nd Battalion disengaged from the KPA and began its withdrawal at 03:00 on September 6. The KPA quickly discovered that the 2nd Battalion was withdrawing and attacked it. In the vicinity of Hills 464 and 380 the battalion discovered at daybreak that it was virtually surrounded by KPA. Moving by itself and completely cut off from all other units, G Company, numbering only about 80 men, was hardest hit. On the division's left, meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry, on Hill 303 came under heavy attack and the battalion commander wanted to withdraw. This battalion suffered heavy casualties before it abandoned Hill 303 on the September 6 to the KPA. While G Company was trying to escape from Hill 464, the rest of the 2nd Battalion was cut off at the eastern base of Hill 380, to the south. Later in the day on September 7, the battalion received radio orders to withdraw by any route as soon as possible. It moved southwest into the 5th Cavalry sector. East of the 2nd Battalion, the KPA attacked the 1st Battalion in its new position on September 7 and overran the battalion aid station, killing four and wounding seven men. That night the 1st Battalion was attached to the 5th Cavalry Regiment. The rest of the 7th Cavalry Regiment moved to a point near Taegu in division reserve. During the night of September 7/8 the 5th Cavalry Regiment on division orders withdrew still farther below Waegwan to new defensive positions astride the main Seoul-Taegu highway. The KPA 3rd Division was still moving reinforcements across the Naktong. Observers sighted barges loaded with troops and artillery pieces crossing the river north of Waegwan on the evening of the 7th. On the 8th a North Korean communiqu√© claimed the capture of Waegwan. The next day the situation grew worse for the 1st Cavalry Division. On its left flank, the KPA 3rd Division forced the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry, to withdraw from Hill 345, east of Waegwan. The KPA pressed forward and the 5th Cavalry was immediately locked in hard, seesaw fighting on Hills 203 and 174. The 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, before it left that sector to rejoin its regiment, finally captured the latter hill after four attacks. Only with difficulty did the 5th Cavalry Regiment hold Hill 203 on September 12. Between midnight and 04:00 on September 13, the KPA attacked again and took Hill 203 from E Company, Hill 174 from L Company, and Hill 188 from B and F Companies. In an afternoon counterattack the regiment regained Hill 188 on the south side of the highway, but failed against Hills 203 and 174 on the north side. On the 14th, I Company again attacked Hill 174, which had by now changed hands seven times. In this action the company suffered 82 casualties. Even so, the company held only one side of the hill, the KPA held the other, and grenade battles between the two continued for another week. The battalions of the 5th Cavalry Regiment were so low in strength at this time that they were not considered combat effective. This seesaw battle continued in full northwest of Taegu.  Ka-san  General Gay, alerted all of his division's front-line units to be prepared for the attack in the Ka-san sector as well. ROK 1st Division commander Major General Paik Sun Yup also braced his men for attack. The attack hit with full force in the Bowling Alley area north of Taegu. The attack caught the 8th Cavalry Regiment unprepared at Sangju. The division was poorly deployed along the road to that town, lacking a reserve force to counterattack effectively. The KPA struck the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, the night of September 2/3 on Hill 448 west of the Bowling Alley and north of Tabu-dong, and overran it. The overrun 2nd Battalion withdrew through the 3rd Battalion which had assembled hastily in a defensive position south of Tabu-dong. During the day, elements of the KPA 1st Division forced the 8th Cavalry I&R; Platoon and a detachment of National Police from the Walled City of Ka-san on the crest of Hill 902, east of Tabu-dong. On September 3, therefore, the UN command lost both Tabu- dong and Hill 902, locally called Ka-san, the dominant mountain-top north of Taegu. This sudden surge of the KPA southward toward Taegu concerned Walker. The Eighth Army ordered an ROK battalion from the Taegu Replacement Training Center to a position in the rear of the 8th Cavalry and the 1st Cavalry Division organized Task Force Allen, to be commanded by Assistant Division Commander Brigadier General Frank A. Allen, Jr. It was to be used in combat as an emergency force should the KPA break through to the edge of Taegu. Eighth Army countered the KPA advance down the Tabu-dong road by ordering the 1st Cavalry Division to recapture and defend Hill 902. This hill, north of Taegu, afforded observation all the way south through Eighth Army positions into the city, and, in North Korean hands, could be used for general intelligence purposes and to direct artillery and mortar fire. Colonel Raymond D. Palmer, commanding the 8th Cavalry Regiment was ordered to retake the mountain with the help of several support units. The next morning, September 4, the force moved to Ka-san and set up an assembly area near the village of Kisong-dong east of the Tabu-dong road. During the afternoon and evening of September 3, the KPA 2nd Battalion, 2nd Regiment, 1st Division, had occupied the summit of Ka-san. The engineer company started its attack up the mountain about noon of September 4, following a trail up a southern spur. Less than up the trail, the company came under machine gun fire twice. KPA mortar fire also struck the company during its climb, but the head of the company arrived at the bowl- shaped summit of Hill 755, the southern arm of the Hill 902 crest. The platoon commander placed the 90 men of his company in position facing in an arc from west to northeast; the 2nd Platoon took the left flank near the stone wall, the 1st Platoon took the center position on a wooded knoll, and the 3rd Platoon the right flank at the edge of a woods. The D Company position was entirely within the area enclosed by the stone wall. As several squads left the hill on a patrol, the KPA attacked the main company position behind it. The platoon dropped down off the ridge into a gully on the left. Some of the men in the advanced squad made their way back to US lines, but the KPA captured most near the bottom of Ka-san on September 10 as they were trying to make their way through the KPA lines. About 30 minutes after D Company had reached Hill 755, an estimated KPA battalion launched an attack down the slope running south to Hill 755 from the crest of Hill 902. The company turned back this attack. That night, KPA mortar and small arms fire harassed the company and there were several small probing KPA attacks. D Company's defensive lines atop Hill 755. At dawn on September 5 the KPA attacked. The engineers repulsed this attack but suffered some casualties. Ammunition was running low and three USAF C-47 Skytrain aircraft came over the area to make an airdrop. The planes mistakenly dropped their bundles of ammunition and food on the KPA positions. Immediately after the airdrops, two F-51 Mustang fighter planes came over and attacked D Company, also in error. Soon after this aerial attack, KPA troops attacked the positions. Sometime between 10:00 and 11:00, E Company, 8th Cavalry Regiment, arrived on top of Hill 755 and came into D Company's perimeter. KPA fire, killing several of the porters, turned it back. Shortly after the E Company platoon joined D Company, the KPA attacked again unsuccessfully. The US units, out of ammunition, relied on captured KPA equipment. At 13:30 Gay ordered the 8th Cavalry Regiment to withdraw its men off Ka-san. Gay believed he had insufficient forces to secure and hold it and that the KPA had insufficient ammunition to exploit its possession as an observation point for directing artillery and mortar fire. Rain started falling again and heavy fog closed in on the mountain top and severely reduced visibility there. Again the KPA attacked as the final units began their withdrawal. When all remaining members of D Company had been assembled, the company had suffered 50 percent casualties; 18 men were wounded and 30 were missing in action. Soldiers of the ROK 1st Division captured a North Korean near Ka-san on September 4 who said that about 800 KPA soldiers were on Ka-san with three more battalions following them from the north. The engineer company had succeeded only in establishing a perimeter briefly within the KPA-held area. By evening of September 5, Ka-san was securely in KPA hands with an estimated five battalions, totaling about 1,500 soldiers, on the mountain and its forward slope. By September 10, 400‚Äì500 KPA were on the ridge of Ka-San, as observed by a T-6 Mosquito spotter plane. Now, with Ka-san firmly in their possession, the KPA 13th and 1st Divisions made ready to press on downhill into Taegu they set up a roadblock which was repulsed the next day. Even though the 1st Cavalry Division fell back nearly everywhere on September 7, Walker ordered it and ROK II Corps to attack and seize Hill 902 and Ka-san. On the morning of September 8, an estimated 1,000 KPA soldiers were on Hill 570, north of Taegu, and Walker decided the continued pressure against the eastern flank of the 1st Cavalry Division sector was the most immediate threat to the UN forces at Pusan Perimeter. That same day, the 1st Cavalry Division canceled a planned continuation of the attack against Hill 570 by the 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, when KPA forces threatened Hills 314 and 660, south and east of 570. In the midst of this drive on Taegu, an ammunition shortage became critical for the UN forces. Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105 mm howitzer ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day, except in cases of emergency. Carbine ammunition was also in critical short supply. The 17th Field Artillery Battalion, with the first 8-inch howitzers to arrive in Korea, could not engage in the battle for lack of ammunition. The KPA 1st Division now began moving in the zone of the ROK 1st Division around the right flank of the 1st Cavalry Division. Its 2nd Regiment, with 1,200 men, advanced eastward from the vicinity of Hill 902 to the towering mountain of P'algong-san. It reached the top of P'algong-san about daylight on September 10, and a little later new replacements made a charge toward the ROK positions. The ROK repulsed the charge, killing or wounding about two-thirds of the attacking force. The US 1st Cavalry Division now had most of its combat units concentrated on its right flank north of Taegu. The 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, attached to the 8th Cavalry Regiment, was behind that regiment on Hills 181 and 182 astride the Tabu-dong road only north of Taegu. The rest of the 7th Cavalry Regiment (the 1st Battalion rejoined the regiment during the day) was in the valley of the Kumho River to the right rear between the KPA and the Taegu Airfield, which was situated northeast of the city. The 5th Cavalry Regiment was disposed on the hills astride the Waegwan road northwest of Taegu. On its left the entire 8th Engineer Combat Battalion was in line as infantry, with the mission of holding a bridge across the Kumho River near its juncture with the Naktong River east of Taegu. The fighting north of Taegu on September 11 in the vicinity of Hills 660 and 314 was heavy and confused. For a time, the 1st Cavalry Division feared a breakthrough to the blocking position of the 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry. The rifle companies of the division were now very low in strength. While the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, again vainly attacked Hill 570 on September 11, KPA soldiers seized the crest of Hill 314 southeast of it and that much closer to Taegu. The 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, hurried to the scene from its attacks on Hill 570 and tried to retake the position. The 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, command post had to fight off infiltrating KPA on September 12 as it issued its attack order and prepared to attack through the 8th Cavalry lines against Hill 314. This attack on the 12th was to be part of a larger American and ROK counterattack against the KPA 13th and 1st Divisions in an effort to halt them north of Taegu. The 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, relieved the ROK units on Hill 660, east of Hill 314, and had the mission of securing that hill. Farther east the ROK 1st Division had the mission of attacking from P'algong-san toward Ka- san. The point nearest Taegu occupied by KPA forces at this time was Hill 314. The KPA 13th Division valued its possession and had concentrated about 700 soldiers on it. The KPA intended to use Hill 314 in making the next advance on Taegu. From it, observation reached to Taegu and it commanded the lesser hills southward rimming the Taegu bowl. Hill 314 is actually the southern knob of a hill mass which lies close to the east side of Hill 570 and is separated from that hill mass only by a deep gulch. The southern point rises to and the ridge line climbs northward from it in a series of knobs. The ridge line is in length, and all sides of the hill mass are very steep. Lieutenant Colonel James H. Lynch's 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, numbered 535 men on the eve of its attack against Hill 314, less its rear echelons. The US troops took the hill and fended off a counterattack. Many of the officers in the companies were wounded but refused evacuation and simply continued the attack. The KPA soldiers on Hill 314 wore US uniforms, helmets, and combat boots. Many of them had M1 rifles and carbines. About 200 KPA dead were on the hill. Of the other 500 estimated to have been there, most of them had been wounded or were missing. After the capture of Hill 314 on September 12, the situation north of Taegu improved. On September 14 the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, attacked and, supported by fire from Hill 314, gained part of Hill 570 from the KPA 19th Regiment, 13th Division. Across the army boundary on the right, the ROK 1st Division continued its attack northwest and advanced to the edge of Ka-san. The ROK 11th Regiment seized Hill 755 about dark on September 14, and small elements of the ROK 15th Regiment reached the stone ramparts of the Ka-san area at the same time. The ROK and KPA troops fought during the night and on into the 15th at many points along the high mountain backbone that extends southeast from Ka-san to Hills 755 and 783 and on to P'algong-san. The ROK 1st Division later estimated that approximately 3,000 KPA were inside Ka-san's walled perimeter and about 1,500 or 2,000 outside it near the crest. At this time the bulk of the KPA 1st Division was gradually withdrawing into Ka-san and its vicinity. Indications were that the KPA 13th Division also was withdrawing northward. Aerial observers on the afternoon of September 14 reported that an estimated 500 KPA troops were moving north from Tabu-dong. While these signs were hopeful, Walker continued to prepare for a final close- in defense of Taegu. As part of this, 14 battalions of National Police dug in around the city. The fighting continued unabated north of Taegu on the 15th. The 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, still fought to gain control of Hill 570 on the east side of the Tabu-dong highway. On the other side, the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, attacked Hill 401 where a KPA force had penetrated in a gap between the 8th and 5th Cavalry Regiments. The fighting on Hill 401 was particularly severe. Both sides had troops on the mountain when night fell.  Naktong Bulge   Second Naktong Bulge  Changyong defensive positions, 1950. During the KPA September 1 offensive, the US 35th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division was heavily engaged in the Battle of Nam River north of Masan. On the 35th Regiment's right flank, just north of the confluence of the Nam River and the Naktong River, was the US 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division. There, in the southernmost part of the 2nd Infantry Division zone, the 9th Infantry Regiment held a sector more than long, including the bulge area of the Naktong where the First Battle of Naktong Bulge had taken place earlier in August. Each US infantry company on the river line here had a front of to and they held only key hills and observation points, as the units were extremely spread out along the wide front. During the last week of August, US troops on these hills could see minor KPA activity across the river, which they thought were North Koreans organizing the high ground on the west side of the Naktong against a possible US attack. There were occasional attacks on the 9th Infantry's forward positions, but to the men in the front lines this appeared to be only a standard patrol action. On August 31, the UN forces were alerted to a pending attack when much of the Korean civilian labor force fled the front lines. Intelligence officers reported an attack was coming. On the west side of the Naktong, KPA Major General Pak Kyo Sam, commanding the 9th Division, issued his operations order to the division on August 28. Its mission in the forthcoming attack was to outflank and destroy the US troops at Naktong Bulge by capturing the Miryang and Samnangjin areas to cut off the US 2nd Division's route of supply and withdrawal between Taegu and Pusan. However, the KPA were not aware that the US 2nd Infantry Division had recently replaced the 24th Infantry Division in positions along the Naktong River. Consequently, they expected lighter resistance; the 24th Division troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the 2nd Division men were fresh and newly arrived in Korea. They had only recently been moved into the line. The KPA began crossing the Naktong River under cover of darkness at certain points. The first KPA crossing at the Paekchin ferry caught a Heavy Mortar Platoon unprepared in the act of setting up its weapons. It also caught most of the D and H Company, 9th Infantry men at the base of Hill 209, from the crossing site. The KPA killed or captured many of the troops there. The first heavy weapons carrying party was on its way up the hill when the KPA attack engulfed the men below. It hurried on to the top where the advance group waited and there all hastily dug in on a small perimeter. This group was not attacked during the night. From 21:30 until shortly after midnight the KPA 9th Division crossed the Naktong at a number of places and climbed the hills quietly toward the 9th Infantry river line positions. Then, when the artillery barrage preparation lifted, the KPA infantry were in position to launch their assaults. These began in the northern part of the regimental sector and quickly spread southward. At each crossing site the KPA would overwhelm local UN defenders before building pontoon bridges for their vehicles and armor. At 02:00, B Company was attacked. The hills on both sides of B Company were already under attack as was also Hill 311, a rugged terrain feature a from the river and the KPA's principal immediate objective. On Hill 209 the KPA drove B Company from its position, inflicting very heavy casualties on it. At 03:00, 1 September, the 9th Infantry Regiment ordered its only reserve, E Company, to move west along the Yongsan-Naktong River road and take a blocking position at the pass between Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni Ridge, from the river and from Yongsan. This was the critical terrain where so much heavy fighting had taken place in the first battle of the Naktong Bulge. Fighting began at the pass at 02:30. A strong KPA force surprised and delivered heavy automatic fire at 03:30 from positions astride the road east of the pass. With the critical parts of Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni Ridge, the best defensive terrain between Yongsan and the river, the KPA controlled the high ground. The US 2nd Infantry Division now had to base its defense of Yongsan on relatively poor defensive terrain, the low hills at the western edge of the town. North of the 9th Infantry sector of the 2nd Infantry Division front along the Naktong, the US 23rd Infantry Regiment on August 29 had just relieved the 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment, which in turn had only a few days before relieved the US 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division. It took over a front on the Naktong River without its 3rd Battalion which had been attached to the US 1st Cavalry Division to the north. On August 31 the 2nd Division moved E Company south to a reserve position in the 9th Infantry sector. At 21:00 the first shells of what proved to be a two-hour KPA artillery and mortar preparation against the US river positions of 2nd Platoon. As the barrage rolled on, KPA infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire. At 23:00 the barrage lifted and the KPA attacked along the battalion outpost line. As the KPA attack developed during the night, 1st Battalion succeeded in withdrawing a large part of its force, less C Company, just north of Lake U-p'o and the hills there covering the northern road into Changnyong, east of the river and west of the town. B Company lost heavily in this action. When word of the disaster that had overtaken 1st Battalion reached regimental headquarters, G and F Companies from 2nd Division reserve were sent to help 1st Battalion and the latter on the southern road toward Pugong-ni and C Company. This force was unable to reach C Company, but Lieutenant Colonel Carl C. Jensen collected stragglers from it and seized high ground astride this main approach to Changnyong near Ponch'o-ri above Lake Sanorho, and went into a defensive position there. The US 2nd Division released E Company to the regiment and the next day it joined F Company to build up what became the main defensive position of the 23rd Regiment in front of Changnyong. KPA troops during the night passed around the right flank of 1st Battalion's northern blocking position and reached the road behind him near the division artillery positions. The 23rd Infantry Headquarters and Service Companies and other miscellaneous regimental units finally stopped this penetration near the regimental command post northwest of Changnyong. Before the morning of 1 September had passed, reports coming into US 2nd Division headquarters made it clear that KPA had penetrated to the north‚Äìsouth Changnyong-Yongsan road and cut the division in two; the 38th and 23rd Infantry Regiments with the bulk of the division artillery in the north were separated from the division headquarters and the 9th Infantry Regiment in the south. Division commander Major General Laurence B. Keiser decided that this situation made it advisable to control and direct the divided division as two special forces. Accordingly, he placed the division artillery commander, Brigadier General Loyal M. Haynes, in command of the northern group. Southward, in the Yongsan area, Keiser placed Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley, Assistant Division Commander, in charge of the 9th Infantry Regiment, the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, most of the 72nd Tank Battalion, and other miscellaneous units of the division. This southern grouping was known as Task Force Bradley. All three regiments of the KPA 2nd Division, the 4th, 17th and 6th, in line from north to south‚Äîcrossed during the night to the east side of the Naktong River into the 23rd Regiment sector. The KPA 2nd Division, concentrated in the Sinban-ni area west of the river, had, in effect, attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into Changnyong above and below Lake U-p'o. On August 31, 1950, Lake U-p'o was a large body of water although in most places very shallow. The massive KPA attack had made deep penetrations everywhere in the division sector except in the north in the zone of the 38th Infantry. The KPA 9th Division had effected major crossings of the Naktong at two principal points against the US 9th Infantry; the KPA 2nd Division in the meantime had made three major crossings against the US 23rd Infantry; and the KPA 10th Division had begun crossing more troops in the Hill 409 area near Hyongp'ung in the US 38th Infantry sector. Communication from division and regimental headquarters to nearly all the forward units was broken. As information slowly built up at division headquarters it became apparent that the KPA had punched a hole wide and deep in the middle of the division line and made less severe penetrations elsewhere. The front-line battalions of the US 9th and 23rd Regiments were in various states of disorganization and some companies had virtually disappeared. Keiser hoped he could organize a defense along the Changnyong- Yongsan road east of the Naktong River, and prevent KPA access to the passes eastward leading to Miryang and Ch'ongdo. Walker decided that the situation was most critical in the Naktong Bulge area of the US 2nd Division sector. There the KPA threatened Miryang and with it the entire Eighth Army position. Walker ordered US Marine Corps Brigadier General Edward Craig, commanding the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, to prepare the Marines to move at once. The Marines made ready to depart for the Naktong Bulge at 13:30. North of the US 9th Infantry and the battles in the Naktong Bulge and around Yongsan, the US 23rd Infantry Regiment after daylight of September 1 was in a very precarious position. Its 1st Battalion had been driven from the river positions and isolated westward. Approximately 400 KPA now overran the regimental command post, compelling Colonel Paul L. Freeman Jr. to withdraw it about . There, northwest of Changnyong, the US 23rd Infantry Headquarters and Headquarters Company, miscellaneous regimental units, and regimental staff officers checked the KPA in a 3-hour fight. Still farther northward in the zone of the US 38th Infantry the KPA were also active. At 06:00 on September 3, 300 KPA launched an attack from Hill 284 against the 38th Regiment command post. This fight continued until September 5. On that day F Company captured Hill 284 killing 150 KPA. Meanwhile, during these actions in its rear, the 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry, was cut off west of the nearest friendly units. On the morning of September 1, 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry moved in an attack westward from the 23rd Regiment command post near Mosan-ni to open the road to the 1st Battalion. On the second day of the fighting at the pass, the relief force broke through the roadblock with the help of air strikes and artillery and tank fire. The advanced elements of the battalion joined 1st Battalion at 17:00 on September 2. That evening, KPA strongly attacked the 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry, on Hill 209 north of the road and opposite 1st Battalion, driving one company from its position. On September 4, Haynes changed the boundary between the 38th and 23rd Infantry Regiments, giving the northern part of the 23rd's sector to the 38th Infantry, thus releasing 1st Battalion for movement southward to help the 2nd Battalion defend the southern approach to Changnyong. The 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry, about 1,100 men strong when the attack began, was now down to a strength of approximately 600 men. The 23rd Infantry now made plans to concentrate all its troops on the position held by its 2nd Battalion on the Pugong-ni-Changnyong road. The 1st Battalion moved there and took a place on the left flank of the 2nd Battalion. At the same time the regimental command post moved to the rear of this position. In this regimental perimeter, the 23rd Infantry fought a series of hard battles. Simultaneously it had to send combat patrols to its rear to clear infiltrating KPA from Changnyong and from its supply road. The KPA 2nd Division made a new effort against the 23rd Infantry's perimeter in the predawn hours of September 8, in an attempt to break through eastward. This attack, launched at 02:30 and heavily supported with artillery, penetrated F Company. It was apparent that unless F Company's position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse. When all its officers became casualties, First Lieutenant Ralph R. Robinson, adjutant of the 2nd Battalion, assumed command of the company. The attack tapered off with the coming of daylight, but that night it resumed. The KPA struck repeatedly at the defense line. This time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of 9 September. The USAF then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops. Casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost steady stream during the morning. All available men from Headquarters Company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points. At one time, the regimental reserve was down to six men. When the attack finally ceased shortly after 12:00 the 23rd Regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only 38 percent. This heavy night and day battle cost the KPA 2nd Division most of its remaining offensive strength. The medical officer of the KPA 17th Regiment, 2nd Division, captured a few days later, said that the division evacuated about 300 men nightly to a hospital in Pugong-ni, and that in the first two weeks of September the 2nd Division lost 1,300 killed and 2,500 wounded in the fighting west of Changnyong. Even though its offensive strength was largely spent by September 9, the division continued to harass rear areas around Changnyong with infiltrating groups as large as companies. Patrols daily had to open the main supply road and clear the town. KPA and US troops remained locked in combat along the Naktong River for several more days. The KPA's offensive capability was largely destroyed and the US troops resolved to hold their lines barring further attack.  Yongsan  On the morning of September 1 the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the KPA 9th Division, in their first offensive of the war, stood only a few miles short of Yongsan after a successful river crossing and penetration of the US line. The 3rd Regiment had been left at Inch'on, but division commander Major General Pak Kyo Sam felt the chances of capturing Yongsan were strong. As the KPA 9th Division approached Yongsan, its 1st Regiment was on the north and its 2nd Regiment on the south. The division's attached support, consisting of one 76 mm artillery battalion from the KPA I Corps, an antiaircraft battalion of artillery, two tank battalions of the KPA 16th Armored Brigade, and a battalion of artillery from the KPA 4th Division, gave it unusually heavy support. Crossing the river behind it came the 4th Division, a greatly weakened organization, far understrength, short of weapons, and made up mostly of untrained replacements. A captured KPA document referred to this grouping of units that attacked from the Sinban-ni area into the Naktong Bulge as the main force of KPA I Corps. Elements of the 9th Division reached the hills just west of Yongsan during the afternoon of September 1. On the morning of September 1, with only the shattered remnants of E Company at hand, the US 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend Yongsan. Division commander Major General Keiser in this emergency attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the regiment. The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to Yongsan. The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around Yongsan on the northwest. Disorganized US forces were ordered to pull back to Yongsan. The road to Miryang came south out of Yongsan, bent around the western tip of this mountain, and then ran eastward along its southern base. In its position, they not only commanded the town but also its exit, the road to Miryang. The KPA had also approached Yongsan from the south. That night KPA soldiers crossed the low ground around Yongsan and entered the town from the south. US troops attempted to rally and fend off the KPA attack, but were too disorganized to mount effective resistance. By evening the KPA had been driven into the hills westward. In the evening, the 2nd Battalion and A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, occupied the first chain of low hills beyond Yongsan, the engineers west and the 2nd Battalion northwest of the town. For the time being at least, the KPA drive toward Miryang had been halted. In this time, the desperately undermanned US units began to be reinforced with Korean Augmentees (KATUSAs) However, the cultural divide between the KATUSAs and the US troops caused tensions. At 09:35 on September 2, while the KPA were attempting to destroy the engineer troops at the southern edge of Yongsan and clear the road to Miryang, Walker attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the US 2nd Division and ordered a co-ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the Marines, with the mission of destroying the KPA east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and restoring the river line. The Marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished. A North Korean POW captured by US Marines along Naktong Bulge, September 4. Between 03:00 and 04:30 on September 3, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade moved to forward assembly areas. The 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines assembled north of Yongsan, the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines south of it. The 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines established security positions southwest of Yongsan along the approaches into the regimental sector from that direction. The Marine attack started at 08:55 on September 3, across the rice paddy land toward KPA-held high ground westward. Air strikes, artillery concentrations, and machine gun and rifle fire of the 1st Battalion now caught KPA reinforcements in open rice paddies moving up from the second ridge and killed most of them. That night the Marines dug in on a line west of Yongsan. Total Marine casualties for September 3 were 34 killed and 157 wounded. Coordinating its attack with that of the marines, the 9th Infantry advanced abreast of them on the north. The counterattack continued at 08:00 September 4, at first against little opposition. By nightfall the counterattack had gained another . That night was quiet until just before dawn. The KPA then launched an attack against the 9th Infantry on the right of the Marines, the heaviest blow striking G Company. It had begun to rain again and the attack came in the midst of a downpour. US artillery fire concentrated in front of the 9th Infantry helped greatly in repelling the KPA in this night and day battle. That morning, September 5, after a 10-minute artillery preparation, the US troops moved out in their third day of counterattack. As the attack progressed, the Marines approached Obong-ni Ridge and the 9th Infantry neared Cloverleaf Hill where they had fought tenaciously during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the month before. There, at midmorning, on the high ground ahead, they could see KPA troops digging in. The Marines approached the pass between the two hills and took positions in front of the KPA-held high ground. At 14:30 approximately 300 KPA infantry came from the village of Tugok and concealed positions, striking B Company on Hill 125 just north of the road and east of Tugok. Two T-34 tanks surprised and knocked out the two leading Marine M26 Pershing tanks. Since the destroyed Pershing tanks blocked fields of fire, four others withdrew to better positions. Assault teams of B Company and the 1st Battalion with 3.5-inch rocket launchers rushed into action, took the tanks under fire, and destroyed both of them, as well as an armored personnel carrier following behind. The KPA infantry attack was brutal and inflicted 25 casualties on B Company before reinforcements from A Company and supporting Army artillery and the Marine 81 mm mortars helped repel it. September 5 was a day of heavy casualties everywhere on the Pusan Perimeter. Army units had 102 killed, 430 wounded and 587 missing in action for a total of 1,119 casualties. Marine units had 35 killed and 91 wounded, for a total of 126 battle casualties. Total US battle casualties for the day were 1,245 men. It is unknown how many North Koreans were killed or wounded on that day, but they likely suffered heavy casualties. The US counteroffensive of September 3‚Äì5 west of Yongsan, according to prisoner statements, resulted in one of the bloodiest debacles of the war for a KPA division. Even though remnants of the KPA 9th Division, supported by the low strength KPA 4th Division, still held Obong-ni Ridge, Cloverleaf Hill, and the intervening ground back to the Naktong on September 6, the division's offensive strength had been spent at the end of the US counterattack. The KPA 9th and 4th divisions were not able to resume the offensive. Just after midnight on September 6, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was ordered back to Pusan in order to travel to Japan and merge with other Marine units to form the 1st Marine Division. This was done after a heated disagreement between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker said he could not hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur said he could not conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning the 17th Infantry Regiment, and later the 65th Infantry Regiment, would be added to Walker's reserves, but Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective. Walker felt the transition endangered the Perimeter at a time when it was unclear if it would hold.  Masan   Haman  On the extreme west flank, in the center of the 25th Division line, Lieutenant Colonel Paul F. Roberts' 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, held the crest of the second ridge west of Haman, from the town. From Chungam-ni, in KPA territory, a secondary road led to Haman along the shoulders of low hills and across rice paddy, running east south of the main Chinju-Masan road. It came through Roberts' 2nd Battalion position in a pass west of Haman. Late in the afternoon of August 31, observers with G Company, 24th Infantry, noticed activity in front of their positions. They called in two air strikes that hit this area at dusk. US artillery sent a large concentration of fire into the area, but the effect of this fire was not known. All US units on the line were alerted for a possible KPA attack. That night the KPA launched their coordinated offensive against the entire UN force. The KPA 6th Division advanced first, hitting F Company on the north side of the pass on the Chungam-ni-Haman road. The ROK troops in the pass left their positions and fell back on G Company south of the pass. The KPA captured a 75 mm recoilless rifle in the pass and turned it on US tanks, knocking out two of them. They then overran a section of 82 mm mortars at the east end of the pass. South of the pass, at dawn, First Lieutenant Houston M. McMurray found that only 15 out of 69 men assigned to his platoon remained with him, a mix of US and ROK troops. The KPA attacked this position at dawn. They came through an opening in the barbed wire perimeter which was supposed to be covered by a man with a M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, but he had fled. Throwing grenades and spraying the area with sub-machine gun gun fire, the KPA quickly overran the position. Numerous officers and non-commissioned officers attempted to get the men back into line, but they would not follow these orders. In one instance ROK troops killed their own company commander when he tried to stop them from escaping. thumb Shortly after the KPA attack started most of the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, fled their positions. One company at a time, the battalion was struck with strong attacks all along its front, and with the exception of a few dozen men in each company, each formation quickly crumbled, with most of the troops running back to Haman against the orders of the officers. The KPA passed through the crumbling US lines quickly and overran the 2nd Battalion command post, killing several men there and destroying much of the battalion's equipment. With the 2nd Battalion broken, Haman was open to direct KPA attack. As the KPA encircled Haman, Roberts, the 2nd Battalion commander, ordered an officer to take remnants of the battalion and establish a roadblock at the south edge of the town. Although the officer directed a large group of men to accompany him, only eight did so. The 2nd Battalion was no longer an effective fighting force. Pockets of its soldiers remained in place and fought fiercely, but the majority fled upon attack, and the KPA were able to move around the uneven resistance. They surrounded Haman as the 2nd Battalion crumbled in disarray. When the KPA attack broke through the 2nd Battalion, Regimental commander Colonel Arthur S. Champney ordered the 1st Battalion, about south of Haman on the Chindong-ni road, to counterattack and restore the line. Roberts assembled all the 40 men of the disorganized 2nd Battalion he could find to join in this counterattack, which got under way at 07:30. Upon contact with the KPA, the 1st Battalion broke and fled to the rear. Thus, shortly after daylight the scattered and disorganized men of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 24th Infantry had fled to the high ground east of Haman. The better part of two regiments of the KPA 6th Division poured into and through the Haman gap, now that they had captured the town and held it. At 14:45 on September 1, division commander Major General William B. Kean ordered an immediate counterattack to restore the 24th Infantry positions. For 30 minutes USAF aircraft struck KPA positions around Haman with bombs, napalm, rockets, and machine gun fire. They also attacked the KPA-held ridges around the town. Fifteen minutes of concentrated artillery fire followed. Fires spread in Haman. Lieutenant Colonel Gilbert Check's 1st Battalion infantry moved out in attack west at 16:30, reinforced by a platoon of tanks from A Company, 79th Tank Battalion. Eight tanks, mounting infantry, spearheaded the attack into Haman, capturing the city easily, as most of the KPA troops had abandoned it. KPA in force held the ridge on the west side of the town, and their machine gun fire swept every approach. KPA fire destroyed one tank and the attacking infantry suffered heavy casualties. But Check's battalion pressed the attack and by 18:25 had seized the first long ridge west of Haman. By 20:00 it had secured half of the old battle position on the higher ridge beyond, west of Haman. Just short of the crest on the remainder of the ridge, the infantry dug in for the night. It had recaptured Haman and was pushing back to the 24th's old positions. The KPA attacked Haman daily for the next week. Following the repelling of KPA infiltration on September 7, the attack on Haman ground to a halt. The KPA, racked by logistical and manpower shortages, focused more heavily on their attacks against 24th Infantry positions on Battle Mountain, as well as 35th Infantry positions at the Nam River. 24th Infantry troops at Haman encountered only probing attacks until September 18.  Nam River  Meanwhile, the KPA 7th Division troops committed all of their effort into attacking the US 35th Infantry line. At 23:30 on August 31, a KPA SU-76 self- propelled high-velocity gun from across the Nam fired shells into the position of G Company, 35th Infantry, overlooking the river. Within a few minutes, KPA artillery was attacking all front-line rifle companies of the regiment from the Namji-ri bridge west. Under cover of this fire a reinforced regiment of the KPA 7th Division crossed the Nam River and attacked F and G Companies, 35th Infantry. Other KPA soldiers crossed the Nam on an underwater bridge in front of the paddy ground north of Komam-ni and near the boundary between the 2nd Battalion, led by Lieutenant Colonel John L. Wilkins, Jr., holding the river front and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard G. Teeter's 1st Battalion holding the hill line that stretched from the Nam River to Sibidang-san and the Chinju-Masan highway. The 35th Infantry, facing shortages of equipment and reinforcements, was under-equipped but nonetheless prepared for an attack. The T-34 tank was standard armor used by the North Korean Army in 1950 and was also present at Masan In the low ground between these two battalions at the river ferry crossing site, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Fisher had placed 300 ROK National Police, expecting them to hold there long enough to serve as a warning for the rest of the forces. Guns from the flanking hills there could cover the low ground with fire. Back at Komam-ni he held the 3rd Battalion ready for use in counterattack to stop KPA penetration should it occur. Unexpectedly, the National Police companies near the ferry scattered at the first KPA fire. At 00:30, KPA troops streamed through this hole in the line, some turning left to take G Company in its flank and rear, and others turned right to attack C Company, which was on a spur of ground west of the Komam-ni road. The I&R; Platoon and elements of C and D Companies formed a defense line along the dike at the north edge of Komam-ni where US tanks joined them at daybreak. But the KPA did not drive for the Komam-ni road fork south of the river as Fisher expected them to; instead, they turned east into the hills behind 2nd Battalion. At daybreak on September 1, a tank-led relief force of C Company headquarters troops cleared the road to Sibidang-san and resupplied the 2nd Platoon, B Company, with ammunition just in time for it to repel another KPA assault, killing 77 and capturing 21 KPA. Although Fisher's 35th Infantry held all its original positions, except that of the forward platoon of G Company, 3,000 KPA soldiers were behind its lines. The farthest eastern penetration reached the high ground just south of Chirwon overlooking the north‚Äìsouth road there. Troops of the 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry traverse the recaptured Engineer Road. By midafternoon, Kean felt that the situation was so dangerous that he ordered the 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, to attack behind the 35th Infantry. A large part of the division artillery was under direct KPA infantry attack. During the morning hours of September 1, when the KPA 7th Division troops had attacked, the first US unit they encountered was G Company, 35th Infantry, at the north shoulder of the gap. While some KPA units peeled off to attack G Company, others continued on and engaged E Company, downstream from it, and still others attacked scattered units of F Company all the way to its 1st Platoon, which guarded the Namji-ri bridge. There, at the extreme right flank of the 25th Division, this platoon drove off a KPA force after a fierce fight. By September 2, E Company in a heavy battle had destroyed most of a North Korean battalion. Bitter, confused fighting continued behind the 35th Infantry's line for the next week. Battalions, companies, and platoons, cut off and isolated, fought independently of higher control and help except for airdrops which supplied many of them. Airdrops also supplied relief forces trying to reach the front- line units. Tanks and armored cars drove to the isolated units with supplies of food and ammunition and carried back critically wounded on the return trips. In general, the 35th Infantry fought in its original battle line positions, while at first one battalion, and later two battalions, of the 27th Infantry fought toward it through the estimated 3,000 KPA operating in its rear areas. Although the 25th Division generally was under much less pressure after 5 September, there were still severe local attacks. Heavy rains caused the Nam and Naktong Rivers to rise on 8 and 9 September, reducing the danger of new crossings. However, KPA attacks against 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry occurred nightly. The approaches to the Namji-ri bridge, one of their key targets to protect were mined. At one time there were about 100 KPA dead lying in that area. From September 9 to 16, there were limited attacks on the 35th Infantry's front but most of the KPA's momentum had been broken and they could not muster strong attacks against the regiment again.  Aftermath  The Great Naktong Offensive was one of the most brutal fights of the Korean War. The KPA were initially successful in breaking through UN lines in multiple places and making substantial gains in surrounding and pushing back UN units. On September 4‚Äì5 the situation was so dire for the UN troops that the US Eighth Army and ROK moved their headquarters elements from Taegu to Pusan to prevent them from being overrun and losing their heavy communications equipment, though Walker remained in Taegu with a small forward detachment. They also prepared their logistics systems for a retreat to a smaller defensive perimeter called the Davidson Line. By September 6, however, Walker decided another retreat would not be necessary. Some historians contend the goals of Great Naktong Offensive were unattainable from the beginning. The Americans, who had been better equipped than the North Koreans, were easily able to defeat their opponents once they had the chance to form a continuous line, according to historian T. R. Fehrenbach. At the same time, the KPA did break through the perimeter at several points and were able to exploit their gains for a short time. The subsequent Inchon landings on September 15 were a crushing blow for the KPA, outflanking the already-weak forces along the perimeter. With virtually no equipment, exhausted manpower and low morale, the KPA were at a severe disadvantage and would not be able to continue pressure on the Pusan Perimeter while attempting to repel the landings at Inchon. On September 16 the Eighth Army began its breakout from the Pusan Perimeter. By September 23, the KPA were in full retreat from Pusan Perimeter, with UN forces rapidly pursuing them north and recapturing lost ground along the way. The destruction of the KPA made the continuation of the war impossible with North Korean troops alone. The massive equipment and manpower loses rivaled those of the ROK in the first stages of the war. The KPA totally collapsed as a fighting force, and the remainder of their military retreated into North Korea offering very weak resistance against the UN force, which was now on the offensive with overwhelming superiority by land, air and sea. Many of the outmaneuvered KPA units simply surrendered, having been reduced from units of thousands to just a few hundred men.

The company was founded in 1971 with a showroom in Fridley, Minnesota, and at its peak, operated forty three stores in California, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Texas and Oregon. The company, despite its expansion into other markets, declared bankruptcy in 2008, and eventually went into liquidation for failure to find a buyer or an investor. At the time of its closing, it was owned by Sun Capital Partners.  History   Growth  After its founding in 1971, Wickes Furniture had grown to 43 showrooms and five distribution centers. The company had over 1,700 employees, making it one of the Top 25 Furniture Retailers in the United States. By the beginning of the 1980s, it had grown into the United States' largest furniture retailer, but it closed nine of its then twenty four stores in the wake of the bankruptcy of its parent company in 1982, Wickes Corp. After Wickes was purchased by two investment firms in 1988, Wickes Furniture was sold to a management led group in April 1989. Master Home Furniture, based in Taiwan, purchased Wickes Furniture in 1998; the company went into receivership in 2000, when Master Home Furniture defaulted on its bank debt. Master Home Furniture sold one stake of Wickes Furniture in February 1999. In August 2002, Sun Capital Partners teamed with an affiliate of the furniture chain Rooms To Go to purchase Wickes Furniture from Master Home. In March 2004, Sun Capital bought out Rooms To Go's interest in Wickes. In March 2004, John Disa was hired as president and CEO of Wickes Furniture by private investment firm Sun Capital Partners. Before he joined Wickes, he spent most of his career in athletic shoe businesses.  Bankruptcy and liquidation  In May 2007, Wickes Furniture announced it would close five stores in Minnesota, and a Brooklyn Center distribution center, as part of its plan to focus its resources in expanding into markets in California, Chicago, Portland, and Las Vegas. In mid to the end of 2007, however, the furniture industry was hit hard by the high cost of fuel prices and subprime lending markets. Wickes Furniture filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection on February 3, 2008. At that time, Wickes operated thirty eight stores. The company listed debts of more than $50 million, and assets of less than $50,000. On February 14, 2008, it was announced by Richard Clausing, the company's chief financial officer, that Wickes Furniture needed a buyer or an investor by February 25, 2008, to recapitalize the company and to keep from shutting its doors, due to a deadline set by the court and creditors. None of them came forward, so Wickes, with bankruptcy court approval, commenced its liquidation sales in March 2008, and closed all of its remaining stores. On January 1, 2012, Wickes Furniture reopened, and rebranded, as Wyckes Furniture.

Facts John Walker Ltd sold to Amalgamated Investment Co Ltd a bonded warehouse and bottling factory for ¬£1,710,000 for occupation or redevelopment. Amalgamated asked whether the building was designated historic or of architectural interest. John Walker said it was not historic. Unfortunately, on 22 August 1973 the Department of Environment listed the property. The contract was signed on 25 September 1973. Then the Secretary of State wrote to John Walker that it had been listed, taking effect on that day. The property value dropped to ¬£200,000 (because a listed property which one cannot easily develop is often worth less money). Amalgamated asked for the contract to be set aside for common mistake, or for frustration, depending on whether the listing took effect before or after 25 September. Judgment The Court of Appeal said the listing took effect on 27 September, when the Secretary signed the listing papers. However the contract was not frustrated. It held that Amalgamated had taken on the risk that the building could be listed. This was shown by the nature of their pre-contractual enquiries. So the listing did not make the contract something radically different from that contemplated by the parties.

Information About the District The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the town of Kola. Population: The population of Kola accounts for 23.4% of the district's total population. Geography Kolsky District is bordered on the west by Pechengsky District, on the southwest by Finland, and on the north by the Barents Sea. The terrain is mostly flat forest (taiga) and rocky tundra. The district mostly covers the Tuloma River and the Kola River, which flow north into Kola Bay and the Barents Sea. The Tuloma River flows out of Lake Notozero, which in turn is fed from the southwest by the Nota River and the Lutto (river). History It was established as Kolsko-Loparsky District () on August 1, 1927, when the All- Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) issued two Resolutions: \\"On the Establishment of Leningrad Oblast\\" and \\"On the Borders and Composition of the Okrugs of Leningrad Oblast\\".Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 34‚Äì35 According to these resolutions, Murmansk Governorate was transformed into Murmansk Okrug, which was divided into six districts (Kolsko- Loparsky being one of them) and included into Leningrad Oblast. The administrative center of the district was in the selo of Kola. Upon establishment, the territory of the former Kolsko-Loparskaya VolostAdministrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 86 and of Minkinsky Selsoviet of the former Alexandrovskaya Volost were included into the district.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 67 In 1934, the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee developed a redistricting proposal, which was approved by the Resolution of the 4th Plenary Session of the Murmansk Okrug Committee of the VKP(b) on December 28-29, 1934 and by the Resolution of the Presidium of the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee on February 2, 1935.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 47‚Äì49 According to this proposal, Kolsko-Loparsky District was to be abolished, with Kirovsky and Kolsky Districts to be established in its place. On February 15, 1935, the VTsIK approved the redistricting of the okrug into seven districts, but did not specify what territories the new districts were to include. On February 26, 1935, the Presidium of the Leningrad Oblast Executive Committee worked out the details of the new district scheme and issued a resolution which established Kirovsky District on part of the territory of Kolsko-Loparsky District, including the town of Kirovsk with the work settlement of Kukisvumchorr in its jurisdiction, Yena-Babinsky Selsoviet, and the southern part of Ekostrovsky Selsoviet with the station of Khibiny. Minkinsky Selsoviet of Kolsko-Loparsky District was transferred to Polyarny District, and Kildinsky Selsoviet‚Äîto Lovozersky District. Kolsky, Notozersky, Peyvo-Yarvinsky, and Pulozersky Selsoviets, as well as the northern part of Ekostrovsky Selsoviet remained in Kolsko-Loparsky District, which was renamed Kolsky. The administrative center of Kolsky District was slated to be moved to the station of Laplandiya, but temporarily remained in Kola. On June 1, 1936, the renaming of the district was approved by the Resolution of the VTsIK. The provisions of the February 26, 1935 Resolution, however, were not fully implemented. The station of Laplandiya ultimately never became the administrative center of the district, because Kola was not included into Murmansk as originally intended. On April 21, 1935, the territory of Ekostrovsky Selsoviet which remained in Kolsky District was re-organized as Imandrovsky Selsoviet by the Resolution of the Presidium of Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee. By the Act of the conciliatory committee on October 20, 1935, the selsoviet was transferred to Kirovsky District‚Äîa decision approved by the Presidium of Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee on December 4, 1935 and by the Presidium of Leningrad Oblast Executive Committee on April 5, 1936. On November 25, 1935, the Presidium of the VTsIK granted work settlement status to the inhabited locality of Moncha-Guba, and renamed it Monchegorsk. At the same time, it was transferred from Kolsky to Kirovsky District. The work settlement of Nagornovsky and its settlement soviet were transferred from Kolsky District to the administrative jurisdiction of Murmansk City Soviet by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR of August 5, 1953.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 62‚Äì63 When Polyarny District was abolished on July 9, 1960, a part of its territory was transferred to Kolsky District.Decree #741/18 On December 26, 1962, when the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR decreed to re- organize the Soviets of People's Deputies and the executive committees of the krais, oblasts, and districts into the industrial and agricultural soviets, Murmansk Oblast was not affected and kept one unified Oblast Soviet and the executive committee.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 55‚Äì56 Nevertheless, on February 1, 1963, the Decree by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR established the new structure of the districts of Murmansk Oblast, which classified Kolsky District as rural. However, this classification only lasted for less than two years. The November 21, 1964 Decree by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR restored the unified Soviets of People's Deputies and the executive committees of the krais and oblasts where the division into the urban and rural districts was introduced in 1962, and the districts of Murmansk Oblast were re-categorized as regular districts again by the January 12, 1965 Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR Decree. By the August 2, 1965 Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR Decree, the work settlement of Kola was granted a status of town under district jurisdiction. Economy Kolsky District has many natural resources, including forests, ore deposits and water life. Atlantic salmon is fished in the rivers of the district. Ore deposits include copper, nickel, and titanium. The area also produces construction materials. Politics The local representative body is the Council of Deputies of Kolsky District. It has twenty members elected for a term of five years. The Head of the District is the highest executive post and is elected by the Council of Deputies.

It can be a serious health risk for the contamination of potable water supplies with foul water. In the most obvious case, a toilet flush cistern and its water supply must be isolated from the toilet bowl. For this reason, building codes mandate a series of measures and backflow prevention devices to prevent backflow.  Causes  Backflow occurs for one of two reasons, either back pressure or back siphonage. Back pressure is the result of a higher pressure in the system than in its supply, i.e. the system pressure has been increased by some means. This may occur in unvented heating systems, where thermal expansion increases the pressure. Back siphonage is the result of supply pressure being lowered below that of the system. This may occur when a supply is interrupted or drained down.  Risk of contamination  The precise measures required to prevent backflow depend on the risk of contamination, i.e. the condition of the water in the connected system. This is categorized into different risk levels: * Category 1: No risk. Potable water * Category 2: Aesthetic quality affected, e.g. water which may have been heated * Category 3: Slight hazard from substances of low toxicity, e.g. cold water storage tanks * Category 4: Significant hazard, e.g. pesticides * Category 5: Serious health risk, e.g. human waste  Measures to avoid backflow  Backflow prevention must be automatic, and manually-operated valves are not usually acceptable.  Check valves  Automatic check valves are required to prevent back pressure. Regulations for these check valves specify the design capabilities of the valve used, according to the hazard. Category 2 contamination may be prevented by a single check valve, but category 3 requires a double check valve (these are manufactured as a convenient single unit, or even integrated into tap (faucet) fittings). Category 5 requires an air gap, not merely a valve. A recent introduction to the UK has been the Reduced Pressure Zone (RPZ) valve, a form of double check valve where the intervening zone is drained and normally kept empty. If the downstream valve leaks and permits backflow, this will drain out through the vent rather than building up pressure against the upstream valve. These valves are complex, requiring certified installation and annual checks. They are used for category 4 systems, such as fire sprinklers where the system has an antifreeze additive.  Air gaps  Back siphonage may be prevented by use of a vertical air gap. This may be a small gap, such as provided by a tundish (a combined overflow spout and catch funnel) or a large gap, such as a basin tap being above the maximum level of the water in the basin. Standards for these air gaps group them by the amount of separation that they provide and their acceptability for the various risk categories. The size of the acceptable gap also depends on the capacity of the incoming supply, such that a stuck-open flow cannot overfill the cistern and close the gap. Air gaps may also protect against back pressure, and are generally favoured for this. However most air gaps also limit the system pressure that may be transmitted across them. In most cases they replace mains pressure with the pressure of that from a raised gravity cistern. Common examples of an air gap in domestic plumbing are: * Taps above washbasins * Cold water cisterns, where the float valve outlet must be above the overflow water level. The previous practice of taking a \\"silencing tube\\" from the float valve to under the water level is no longer acceptable. Under some plumbing codes. such silencing may still be acceptable if it is a soft collapsible tube which cannot syphon. * Hand-held showers must have their hoses fastened such that the shower head cannot rest below the water level in a bath or basin.  Sanitary sewer backflow  Backwater sanitary valves (also known as \\"check valves\\" or \\"backwater valves\\") are also often referred to as \\"backflow preventers\\"http://www.citywindsor.ca/residents/maintenanceandfieldservices/Sewers-/Pages/Backflow- Prevention.aspx They are intended to prevent backflow of sewage on the sanitary sewer line during a flood or sewer blockage, and have no connection with potable water. Also sewage lifting stations provide comprehensive protection against sewer backflow. They pump the water above the backpressure level into the sewer. Even when the sewer is completely full.

As in religious studies and the Anthropology of religion, many archaeologists differentiate between ‚Äúworld religions,‚Äù and ‚Äútraditional‚Äù or ‚Äúindigenous religions.‚Äù ‚ÄúWorld religions‚Äù are defined by Bowie (2000: 26) Bowie, F. (2000) The Anthropology of religion. Oxford: Blackwell. Quoted in Insoll, Timothy (2004) ‚Äò‚ÄôArchaeology, Religion, Ritual.‚Äô‚Äô New York: Routeledge, page 8 as: # Based on written scriptures. # Has a notion of salvation, often from outside. # Universal, or potentially universal. # Can subsume or supplant primal religions. # Often forms a separate sphere of activity. while indigenous religions are defined as: # Oral, or if literate, lacks written/formal scriptures and creeds. # ‚ÄòThis worldly‚Äô. # Confined to a single language or ethnic group. # Form basis from which world religions have developed. # Religious and social life are inseparable. However, Timothy Insoll (2004: 9) Insoll, Timothy (2004) ‚Äò‚ÄôArchaeology, Religion, Ritual.‚Äô‚Äô New York: Routeledge has argued that these categorizations arise from a much-critiqued neo- evolutionary perspective. Strict dichotomies of religious forms may also contribute to skewing research toward state religions, leaving household religious practice, and the relationships between these, under-investigated (a trend noted by Elson and Smith, 2001 Elson, Christina and Michael E. Smith (2001:157) Archaeological Deposits from the Aztec New Fire Ceremony. Ancient Mesoamerica, Vol. 12, Issue 2, pp. 157‚Äì174). Insoll (2004:9) argues that archaeologists may contribute to blurring the boundaries of world and indigenous religions. The archaeology of religion also incorporates related anthropological or religious concepts and terms such as magic, tradition, symbolism, and the sacred.

Routledge Classics Religion, identity, and practice Archaeological studies of religion increasingly recognize religion as an organizing principle in social life, rather than as a separate sphere of activity. They include religion as an axis of identity that structures social life and personal experience. Therefore, entire artifact assemblages (rather than specifically ‚Äúreligious‚Äù artifacts, such as rosary beads) can be interpreted according to the ways that they simultaneously create, display, and constrain notions of self according to religious ideas. For example, John Chenoweth (2009) Chenoweth, John M. (2009) Social identity, material culture, and the archaeology of religion: Quaker practices in context. Journal of Social Archaeology 9: 319 interpreted ceramic assemblages and burials according to Quaker ideals of plainness and modesty. Because social identity is both imposed and negotiated through social practice, including material practice, archaeologies of religion increasingly incorporate practice-based theory. Building upon Anthony Giddens‚Äô idea of structuration Giddens, Anthony (1986) ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Constitution of Society: Outline of A Theory of Structuration.‚Äô‚Äô Berkeley: University of California Press. and Pierre Bourdieu‚Äôs ideas of both practice Bourdieu, Pierre (1977) ‚Äò‚ÄôOutline of a Theory of Practice.‚Äô‚Äô Cambridge University Press. and cultural capital,Bourdieu, Pierre (1987) ‚Äò‚ÄôDistinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste.‚Äô‚Äô Harvard University Press. theories of material practice posit that people use material goods to negotiate their places within social structures. Examples of the archaeological interpretation of religion and ritual as part of social negotiation, transformation or reinforcement include Chenoweth‚Äôs work on Quaker religious practice, Kyder-Reid‚Äôs work on the Southern Redemptorists,Kyder-Reid, Elizabeth (1996) The Construction of Sanctity: Landscape and Ritual in a Religious Community.

State University of New York Press (August 13, 1991) particularly in early states, the archaeology of religion may also engage theories of power and inequality. John Janusek‚Äôs study of Tiwanaku religion, for example, explored the ways that religion served to integrate societies within the Andean state.Janusek, John Wayne (2006) The changing ‚Äònature‚Äô of Tiwanaku religion and the rise of the Andean state. World Archaeology Vol. 38(3): 469‚Äì492 Colonial regimes frequently justified expansion through a commitment to religious conversion; archaeologies of coloniality may therefore intersect with the archaeology of religion.

American Anthropologist 110(2): 191‚Äì203 demonstrate how religion has intersected with colonial regimes. Historical method and theory Historical archaeologists have made major contributions to the understanding of the religion and ritual of peoples who have remained underrepresented (or misrepresented) in the historical record, such as colonized peoples, indigenous peoples, and enslaved peoples. Mandatory religious conversion was common in many colonial situations (e.g. the Spanish colonization of the Americas), which led to syncretic religious practice, rejection or resistance to new religions, covert practice of indigenous religions, and/or misunderstandings and misinterpretations of both indigenous and colonizer religions (Hanks 2010 William F. Hanks, Converting Words: Maya in the Age of the Cross (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2010). Klor de Alva 1982,J. Jorge Klor de Alva, ‚ÄúSpiritual Conflict and Accommodation in New Spain: Toward a Typology of Aztec Responses to Christianity‚Äù, in The Inca and Aztec States, 1400‚Äì1800: Anthropology and History, eds.

Dialectics of Religious Transformation in the Early Doctrinas of the Colca Valley, Peru‚Äù, International Journal of Historical Archaeology, vol. 11, no. 2 (June 2007).). This research combines archaeological and anthropological method and theory with historical method and theory. In addition to recovering, recording, and analyzing material culture, historical archaeologists use archives, oral histories, ethnohistorical accounts. Researchers read texts critically, emphasizing the historical context of the documents (especially regarding underrepresented peoples whose voices may be distorted or missing) in order to better understand religious practices that may have been discouraged or even severely punished. Combined archaeological, historical, and anthropological data sets may contradict each other, or the material record may illuminate the details of covert or syncretic religious practice, as well as resistance to dominant religious forms. For example, our understanding of the religious practice of enslaved peoples in the United States (e.g. Leone and Frye 2001,Mark P. Leone & Gladys Marie Frye, ‚ÄúA Coherent Religion among African Slaves,‚Äù in Race and the Archaeology of Identity, ed. By C. Orser (University of Utah Press, 2001). Fennell 2007 Christopher Fennell, Crossroads and Cosmologies: Diasporas and Ethnogenesis in the New World (University of Florida Press, 2007).) has increased dramatically thanks to research in historical archaeology.  Material correlates Because archaeology studies human history through objects, buildings, bodies, and spaces, archaeologists must engage theories that connect anthropological and sociological theories of religion to material culture and landscapes. Theories of materiality Meskell, Lynn (2005) Archaeologies of Materiality. Wiley-Blackwell. and landscape Johnson, Matthew (2006) Ideas of Landscape. Wiley-Blackwell serve to connect human activities, experiences, and behaviors to social practices, including religion. Theories of embodiment Hammelkis, Yannis, Mark Pluciennik, and Sarah Tarlow (eds) (2001) Thinking Through the Body: Archaeologies of Corporeality. Springer. also serve to interpret human remains as they relate to religion and ritual. The archaeology of religion makes use of the same material evidence as other branches of archaeology, but certain artifact classes are particularly emphasized in studying religion and ritual in the past: *Human remains and burial assemblages can offer many clues to religious and ritual activity.Carr, Christopher (1995) Mortuary Practices: Their Social, Philosophical-Religious, Circumstantial, and Physical Determinants. Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory, Vol. 2, No. 2, pp. 105‚Äì200 Human remains themselves are used in all branches of archaeology for information on sex, age, occupation, and disease. Methods of interment (including burial position, cremation, burial location, primary and secondary burials, etc.) contribute to understanding changing religious practice, as well as social difference within groups (e.g. Lohmann 2005 Lohmann, Roger Ivar (2005) The Afterlife of Asabano Corpses: Relationships with the Deceased in Papua New Guinea. Ethnology, Vol. 44, No. 2, pp. 189‚Äì206). Total burial contexts, i.e., the setting, artifacts, ecofacts, and human remains themselves, may provide evidence of religious beliefs about death and the afterworld. *Religious buildings, such as temple complexes, kivas, and missions, are often used to examine communal religious and ritual activity (e.g. Barnes 1995,Barnes, Gina L. (1995) An Introduction to Buddhist Archaeology. ‚Äò‚ÄôWorld Archaeology,‚Äô‚Äô Vol. 27, No. 2, pp. 165‚Äì182 Graham 1998,Graham, Elizabeth (1998) Mission Archaeology. ‚Äò‚ÄôAnnual Review of Anthropology‚Äô‚Äô, Vol. 27, pp. 25‚Äì62 Reid et al. 1997 Reid, Andrew, Paul Lane, Alinah Segobye, Lowe Borjeson, Nonofo Mathibidi, and Princess Sekgarametso (1997) Tswana Architecture and Responses to Colonialism. World Archaeology, Vol. 28, No. 3, pp. 370‚Äì392 ). Part of archaeoastronomy is the investigation of how buildings are aligned to astral bodies and events, such as solstices, which often coincide with religious or ritual activities. Archaeological examinations of religious buildings can reveal unequal access to religious knowledge and ritual. Religious buildings frequently contain religious iconography that provides insight into the symbolic dimensions of religious life. *Within landscape archaeology, sacred landscapes are an increasingly important focus of study (e.g. Clendinnen 1980 Clendinnen, Inga (1980) Landscape and Worldview: The Survival of Yucatec Maya Culture under Spanish Conquest. Comparative Studies in Society and History, Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 374‚Äì393 ). Landscapes are imbued with sacred meaning throughout the world; aboriginal Australian songlines, and the related belief that mythical events are marked on the landscape, are one example. Human modifications to landscapes, such as Kyder-Reid's study of the Redemtorists‚Äô modifications of their estate to emphasize communality,Kyder-Reid, Elizabeth (1996) The Construction of Sanctity: Landscape and Ritual in a Religious Community. In Landscape Archaeology: Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape. Rebecca Yamin and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds. University of Tennessee Press. may point to the enactment of religious views. *Religious iconography, symbols,Robb, John E. (1998) The Archaeology of Symbols. Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 27, pp. 329‚Äì346 ethnographic texts and ethnographic analogy are important tools that archaeologists use to compare with the material record to examine religions in the past (e.g. Clendinnen 1980,Clendinnen, Inga (1980) Landscape and Worldview: The Survival of Yucatec Maya Culture under Spanish Conquest. ‚Äò‚Äô Comparative Studies in Society and History,‚Äô‚Äô Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 374‚Äì393 Elson and Smith 2001 Elson, Christina and Michael E. Smith (2001:157) Archaeological Deposits from the Aztec New Fire Ceremony. Ancient Mesoamerica, Vol. 12, Issue 2, pp. 157‚Äì174). Though texts are not direct ‚Äúwindows to the past,‚Äù particularly for societies with few or no written records, they are valuable lines of evidence that may be contradicted or supported by the material record. *Common artifact classes such as ceramics have been increasingly reinterpreted within a religious framework. According to the idea of religion as a form of social practice and a total worldview, any artifact may potentially be used to embody religious ideas and ideals in material form. Patterns of artifact and ecofact use within ritual contexts may expose preferences or sacred meanings of certain materials; the ritual use of pine among the ancient Maya is one example (Morehart, Lentz, and Prufer 2005 Morehart, Christopher T., David L. Lentz, and Keith M. Prufer (2005) Wood of the Gods: The Ritual Use of Pine (PINUS SPP.) by the Ancient Lowland Maya. Latin American Antiquity'‚Äô, 16(3), pp. 255‚Äì274).

These practices and religious interpretations of sites may clash with archaeological interpretations, leading to disputes about heritage, preservation, use of sites, and the ‚Äúownership‚Äù of history (Bender 1999 Bender, Barbara (1999) ‚Äò‚ÄôStonehenge: Making Space‚Äô‚Äô.

Slavery played the central role during the American Civil War. The primary catalyst for secession was slavery, especially Southern political leaders' resistance to attempts by Northern antislavery political forces to block the expansion of slavery into the western territories. Slave life went through great changes, as the South saw Union Armies take control of broad areas of land. During and before the war, enslaved people played an active role in their own emancipation, and thousands of enslaved people escaped from bondage during the war. On January 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation, making 3 million blacks legally free. During the war, both sides used African Americans for military purposes; in the South as enslaved labor and in the north as wage labor and military volunteers. Over 100,000 formerly enslaved people fought for the Union and over 500,000 fled their plantations for Union lines. Religiosity and cultural expression also developed greatly during the civil war. Demographics and economics Percentage of slaves in each county of the slave states in 1860 There have been many different ways to estimate the amount of slaveholding in the south. One estimate is that in 1860, about 25% of households and 5% of the population (384,000 people) in the South owned at least one enslaved person. An alternative estimate is that 36% of men lived in slaveholding families, and the percentage of men who had economic ties to slavery was much higher. In the Confederate Army, about 10% of the enlisted men and about 50% of the officers were slaveholders.Woodward 2014, p12-13 Virginia was the largest slave state, in the white population, in the black population, and in contribution to the Confederate Army. Richmond, Virginia was the Confederate capital and was a major industrial and commercial center. Virginia was also an engine of the domestic slave trade. Virginia plantations were smaller than average and there were more slaveholders per capita in Virginia than in the rest of the Confederacy.Woodward 2014, p15 Large numbers of enslaved people lived in the states along the border between the Union and Confederacy. Approximately 500,000 enslaved people lived in Missouri, Kentucky, and Maryland; border slave states, which did not join the Confederacy.Woodward 2014, p16 Most of the South's enslaved workers were enslaved by planters (often defined as those who enslaved twenty or more people), although yeomen farmers outnumbered planters which numbered fewer than 50,000. Southern agriculture was more lucrative than northern, focusing on crops of rice, cotton, and sugar.Woodward 2014, p32-33 Even before the war, in the rice regions of Georgia and South Carolina and in parts of the Mississippi Delta there were ten or even twenty enslaved black people for every white person. During the war, this disparity grew, leading to fear of insurrection and calls for militia companies to be stationed in agricultural regions to guarantee peace.Woodward 2014, p46 Slaves for sale, a scene in New Orleans, 1861. The market for buying and selling enslaved people continued during the war, as did the market for hiring and hiring out enslaved labor.Woodward 2014, p90 Although the price of enslaved workers grew, it did not keep up with inflation, causing the real price of enslaved people to decline during the civil war. The prices of people held in slavery rose and fell in part with the prospects for Confederate victory.Martinez 2006 In 1860, the average enslaved person sold in Virginia brought $1,500 and a \\"prime field hand\\" in New Orleans brought $1,800. In 1863, enslaved people in Richmond sold for $4,000 or $5,000 and in Texas for $2,500 to $3,500 depending on skillsets.Woodward 2014, p96 Before the start of the war, the expansion of slavery was an important political and economic goal for slaveholders. This continued during the war, and there was a large expansion of slavery into Texas, which had been made a state in 1845.Woodward 2014, p97-98 However, late in the war, many slave-owners recognized the increasing probability that slavery would be ended and there is evidence of increased attempts to sell the people they held in slavery.Woodward 2014, p100 Culture Opportunities for cultural expression grew as autonomy for slaves increased during the war. Christianity grew among enslaved people and freedmen during and immediately after the civil war. Organizations such as the American Missionary Association and National Freedman's Relief Association sent missionaries into Union- occupied areas where they formed religious congregations and led revivals.Fountain 2010, p99 The African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) in particular established a large presence among enslaved people and freedmen in and around Union held areas. Along with civilian missionaries, the AME also provided chaplains for black Union regiments. Among the free blacks AME figures especially active in the South during the war were James Walker Hood,Simmons 1887, p133-143 Henry McNeal Turner,Simmons 1887, p336-339 Jabez Pitt Campbell,Simmons 1887, p1032 John M. Brown and William E. Matthews.Simmons 1887, p1113-1118 Music sung by African-Americans changed during the war. The theme of escape from bondage became especially important in spirituals sung by blacks, both by enslaved people singing among themselves on plantations and for free and recently freed blacks singing to white audiences. New versions of songs such as \\"Hail Mary\\", \\"Michael Row the Boat Ashore\\", and \\"Go Down Moses\\" emphasized the message of freedom and the rejection of slavery.McWhirter 2012, p149-150, p157 Many new slave songs were sung as well, the most popular being, \\"Many Thousands Go\\", which was frequently sung by enslaved people fleeing plantations to Union Army camps.McWhirter 2012, p151 Several attempts were made to publish slave songs during the war. The first was the publishing of sheet music to \\"Go Down Moses\\" by Reverend L. C. Lockwood in December 1861 based on his experience with escaped slaves in Fort Monroe, Virginia in September of that year. In 1863, the Continental Monthly published a sampling of spirituals from South Carolina in an article titled, \\"Under the Palmetto.\\"McWhirter 2012, p155-156 The white Colonel of the all-black First South Carolina, Thomas Wentworth Higginson noted that when blacks knew that whites were listening, they changed the way they were sung, and historian Christian McWhirter noted that African Americans \\"used their music to reshape white perceptions and foster a new image of black culture as thriving and ready for freedom.McWhirter 2012, p152 In Port Royal, escaped slaves learned the anthem, \\"America\\" in secret, never singing it in front of whites. When the Emancipation Proclamation was passed a celebration was held, and in a surprise to white onlookers, contrabands began singing the anthem, using the song to express their new status.McWhirter 2012, p158-159 The most popular white songs among slaves were \\"John Brown's Body\\" and H. C. Work's \\"Kingdom Coming\\",McWhirter 2012, p159 and as the war continued, the lyrics African Americans sung changed, with vagueness and coded language dropped and including open expressions of their new roles as soldiers and citizens.McWhirter 2012, p163 Slave owners in the south responded by restricting singing on plantations and imprisoning singers of songs supporting emancipation or the North.McWhirter 2012, p152-153 Confederate supporters also looked to music sung by enslaved people for signs of loyalty. Several Confederate regimental bands included enslaved musicians, and Confederates arranged enslaved people to sing and dance to show how happy they were. Enslave performer Thomas Greene Bethune, known as Blind Tom frequently played pro-Confederate songs such as \\"Maryland, My Maryland\\" and \\"Dixie\\" during this period and dropped, \\"Yankee Doodle\\" from his performances.McWhirter 2012, p154 Disaffection Slave uprisings were a constant fear of slaveholders before and during the war. A slave insurrection was planned in Adams County, Mississippi, which was uncovered in the summer of 1861 leading to widespread punishment of enslaved people in the area.Woodward 2014, p17-18 In June 1861, an aborted insurrection occurred in St. Martin's Parish, Louisiana, which resulted in the arrest of forty enslaved black people and the arrest of two white men who led the uprising, one of who was arrested and the other who escaped. In August 1861, a possible uprising in Jefferson County, Alabama involving possibly 400 enslaved people was put down. Slaveholders in mountainous country particular feared uprising as the terrain made it harder for them to monitor the people they enslaved.Woodward 2014, p17-18 Gordon, a whipped slave, photo taken at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 1863; the guilty overseer was fired. Physical punishment had a prominent place in slave society and this extended to enslaved people in the Confederate Army, who were frequently whipped or punished in other ways. Enslaved people were occasionally rewarded for good behavior, but there was a belief that punishment was a more effective means of maintaining control. Punishments sometimes extended to include maiming, murder, rape, and the selling of loved ones, the last of these being often considered one of the most severe punishments.Woodward 2014, p92-94 Resistance A woodcut of Harriet Tubman in her Civil War clothing Resistance of enslaved people was widespread during and before the Civil War. One important outcome of that resistance was the effect it had on Southern troop morale as it undermined the belief that black people were more loyal to the Confederacy than the Union.Woodward 2014, p105 Generally, African Americans cheered for Union victory and the Confederacy made a great effort to keep enslaved people under their control.Woodward 2014, p91 After the war, Confederate veterans downplayed this resistance and professed to believe most of the people who they had enslaved were loyal at heart.Woodward 2014, p105 In reality, resistance among enslaved people was common and widespread. On farms and plantations, enslaved workers broke equipment, feigned illness, slowed or stopped work, stole, plotted revolts, and fled.Woodward 2014, p107 White's and blacks mobilized to help people escaping enslavement, following what was known as the Underground Railroad, and cementing the fame of individuals such as Harriet Tubman.Clinton 2004 Slave-owners were greatly disconcerted by the desire of the enslaved people they held captive to flee to Union armies, many genuinely believed enslaved people were tied by deep feelings and blamed abolitionist propaganda and the ignorance of enslaved people of the costs of freedom for their desire for freedom.Boles 2015, p185 Slaves also recognized that freedom by the sword may not be permanent and preferred to bide their time until an opportunity for freedom was assured, while others feared the uncertainty of a change in their current situation. However, most slaves chose freedom when the opportunity allowed. Where possible, many slave owners fled advancing Union armies and brought their slaves with them. In situations such as along the Atlantic coast and Mississippi river where Union advance was very fast and such arrangements were not made, fleeing slave owners left their slaves behind, and many slaves escaped to the Union. Fleeing slave-owners from Louisiana and Mississippi often moved to Texas and the roads to Texas were said to be crowded by planters fleeing with their slaves.Boles 2015, p184 Eastman Johnson (American, 1824‚Äì1906). A Ride for Liberty -- The Fugitive Slaves (recto), ca. 1862. Oil on paperboard. Brooklyn Museum Estimates of the number of runaways during the war vary. Secretary of War William Seward estimated that the Union Army seized about 200,000 slaves, while historians of estimated figures from 500,000 to 1,000,000.Woodward 2014, p107 Slaves often disguised their feelings from their masters, wishing to appear loyal but watching and waiting for a chance to at freedom. Some slaves were willing to risk their lives and families, while others were not. Many and perhaps most slaves were governable during the war, especially in the early years.Woodward 2014, p107-108 Escaping slaves who were caught on their way to freedom were usually very harshly dealt with and frequently executed.Woodward 2014, p120 Confederates emphasized negative aspects of the transition from slavery to freedom in discussions with their slaves and in letters and conversations during the period. Letters from captured Confederate soldiers noted the poor housing conditions and dress of freedmen they saw in Union held cities. Indeed, disease and lack of medical care were major issues in Federal camps set up for the freedmen, and some former slaves were sent to local planters where conditions were better. In Federal hands, there were cases of rape and other brutalities, and there were social and labor issues among the freedpeople. For instance, looking for work, in some cases, female slaves turned to prostitution.Woodward 2014, p119-120 In spite of evidences of the desire of slaves to be free, the \\"loyal slave\\" fixed itself in the consciousness of many white southerners during and after the war. This image had some grounding in fact, and examples of personal bond, sense of duty, or other calculations leading slaves to remain loyal exist. There are also examples of slaves who served masters serving in the Confederate Army, protecting women and children from assault by federal troops, or assisting aging or wounded masters when escape was possible.Boles 2015, p183 Slaves in the Confederate service The Confederacy's early military successes depended significantly on slavery. Slaves provided agricultural and industrial labor, constructed fortifications, repaired railroads, and freed up white men to serve as soldiers.Smith 2013, p9-10 Tens of thousands of slaves were used to build and repair fortifications and railroads, as haulers, teamsters, ditch diggers, and assisting medical workers.Woodward 2014, p56 In their role, slaves in the army were heavily relied on and in some cases overworked to the point of illness or death.Woodward 2014, p58, 66-67 Sergeant A.M. Chandler of the 44th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, Co. F., and Silas Chandler, family slave Another role slaves played during the war was camp servants. This role was more common in large, encamped armies than among home guard or guerilla units. Camp servants served their master and not the government and served officers and enlisted soldiers. Most Confederates could not, of course, afford this luxury, but they were not rare.Woodward 2014, p81-82 In cases where camp servants were not enslaved, servants could receive a significant salary. It was also not uncommon for slaves to be paid or to keep a portion of the earnings derived from their labor. In one case, a soldier reported a slave receiving $4 for a week's washing and cooking, and in another servant, labor was reported to receive payments in excess of a private's pre-1864 monthly pay of $11.Woodward 2014, p83-84 Confederates frequently wrote about the care slaves had for their dying or deceased masters. This care represented the benign relationship between slaves and masters in the minds of Confederates. Historians have questioned whether the care taken represented affection or was due to anxiety about the fate of the slaves themselves after the death of their masters.Woodward 2014, p90-91 On the other hand, physical punishment had a prominent place in slave society and this extended to slaves in the Confederate Army, who were frequently whipped or punished in other ways. Slaves were occasionally rewarded for good behavior, but there was a belief that punishment was a more effective means of maintaining control. Punishments sometimes extended to include maiming, murder, rape, and the selling of loved ones, the last of these being often considered the most severe punishment.Woodward 2014, p92-94 The role of slavery on the size of the Confederate Army was complicated. While the use of slave labor in camps freed white soldiers to fight, the population was said to be more willing to send their white men to the army than risk the life and labor of their slaves.Woodward 2014, p56 In October 1862, the Confederacy passed a draft bill known as the \\"Twenty Slave Law\\" that allowed one white male to stay behind on plantations with twenty or more slaves, which was meant to protect property on large plantations but also alienated many non-slaveholders in the south.Woodward 2014, p47-48 Impressment The Confederate Congress passed a slave impressment law on March 26, 1863. This law raised questions about whether or not the Confederacy could seize free blacks, who numbered about 260,000 in the South in 1860. The Virginia legislature dealt with this issue by subjecting free blacks to the Confederate draft to serve in non-combat roles and limiting the number of slaves the government could impress. In this way, commanders in Virginia had the power to force free and enslaved blacks into service. However, a limited number of free blacks were actually impressed. In part, this is because the proportion of free blacks who were males of military age was relatively small and many of those were already working in military-related tasks.Woodward 2014, p64-65 For much of the war, Confederate soldiers were relatively comfortable and well supplied. However, by the spring of 1864, the situation tightened. On March 4, 1864, Confederate General Order No 28 said that officers and enlisted men would receive one ration per day, giving no consideration for body servants. A number of commanders protested and a letter was sent to the government on March 19 signed by officers including Generals Richard Ewell, Jubal Early, Stephen Ramseur, and John Gordon requesting an increase in rations to account for servants.Woodward 2014, p86-87 Slave labor was not free of the perils of war, and Confederates occasionally wrote about slave laborers facing enemy shelling.Woodward 2014, p66 While slave-owners expected compensation when slaves died in the service of the Confederate Army, most Confederates did not own slaves and preferred a dead black worker than a dead white one. Thus, the hazardous conditions of slave labor may have been in part premeditatedWoodward 2014, p58, 66-67 In some cases, a plantation's slaves were asked for volunteer to join the army, and some were excited for the change in tasks.Woodward 2014, p58 However, the Confederacy had more need for laborers than was filled by slaves. In part, this was exacerbated by the refusal of white Confederate soldiers to join in the necessary labor in many cases.Woodward 2014, p59 The Confederate government set up impressment bureaus to ensure slaveholders furnished enough slaves. In Texas in June 1863, district commander John Magruder was put in charge of one such bureau, and Magruder was known for his ability to usually succeed in appeals to slaveholder patriotism to acquire slaves rather than impressment.Woodward 2014, p70-71 In the West, General Nathan Bedford Forrest led numerous cavalry raids where he captured many slaves who had fled behind Union lines, often sending excess to other commands.Woodward 2014, p77 Confederate forces also made raids on Union controlled plantations in the south, particularly along the Mississippi river.Woodward 2014, p120 When Confederate forces marched North, such as during the Gettysburg campaign under Robert E. Lee, Confederates in Pennsylvania rounded up as many blacks as possible, whether they were free before the war or not. These individuals became part of the spoils of war.Woodward 2014, p121 Northerners asked camp servants in the Confederate Army marching in the north why they did not flee to freedom. It would have been difficult for them to escape during the campaign, however. Fleeing to the north may not have seemed like an appealing option as, in some cases, northerners expressed their racism and dislike for blacks in the presence of Confederate soldiers and servants.Woodward 2014, p121 Even before the government authorized the impressment of slaves, officers forced thousands of slaves to work, and the scale of slave projects during the war was greater than those present on plantations, where only one master's slaves worked. Slaves built fortifications at Richmond, Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, Island No. 10, Vicksburg, Port Hudson, Wilmington, and Mobile. In September 1862, Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard was in charge of coastal defenses in South Carolina and Georgia and had 1,400 slaves working on the fortifications at Savannah. In May 1862, 7,500 slaves were said to be working at Mobile. In the spring of 1863, between 4,000 and 6,000 slaves were said to be working on the railways running into Richmond.Woodward 2014, p58 In November 1862, Robert E. Lee was in charge of defenses of the North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia coasts and had 3,330 slaves working in the fortifications at Wilmington.Woodward 2014, p63 Slave labor on fortifications ultimately undermined slavery, as it served as justification for the Confiscation acts and ultimately the 13th Amendment discussed below.Martinez 2013, p17 Near the war's end, slaves were in high demand to fortify the last bastions of the Confederacy. In the defense of Atlanta, General Joseph E. Johnston called for 12,000 slaves to join his army as teamsters and cooks, but such a large number was never furnished for any general, although slaves were an important part of the campaign, building fallback lines for the stubbornly retreating Confederate army to man. At Richmond, Lee received 2,000 or his requested 5,000 to relieve white teamsters for duty in the lines.Woodward 2014, p75-76 Near the end of the war, the Confederacy made efforts to enlist black soldiers. In November 1864, Confederate president Jefferson Davis called on the Confederate Congress to purchase 40,000 slaves who would then be emancipated in return for military service. Such calls were very contentious in the south, with General Patrick Cleburne being a leading proponent of arming slaves. Among the opposition to the idea, General Howell Cobb argued in January 1865, \\"If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong.\\" As the Confederacy collapsed in early 1864 and 1865, arming slaves became, in the words of General Robert E. Lee, \\"not only expedient but necessary.\\" In March 1865, Davis authorized the enlistment of blacks to the Confederate army and companies began to form by March 25. However, Confederate forces in Virginia surrendered on April 3 and the war was over on April 9, 1865, before black soldiers had a chance to fight on the Confederate side.Boles 2015, p197-198 Contraband USS Planter, stolen and run out of Charleston by escaping slave and future Congressman, Robert Smalls, in May 1862 At the outset of the war, Abraham Lincoln hoped to keep the Union intact with or without slavery.Smith 2013, p9 Early in the war, there was belief that the conflict would be chivalric in character and northern Generals hesitated to aid escaping slaves. but by 1862, the bitterness of the conflict became clear and Federals began to seize slaves in ernest.Woodward 2014, p110 As early as May 1861, Union General Benjamin F. Butler, in command at Fort Monroe, Virginia, unilaterally refused to return escaped slaves who reached Federal lines to their slave-owners. Instead, Butler employed them in the quartermaster department, reasoning that returning the slaves would aid the enemy, and the Grand Contraband Camp, Virginia was formed. Lincoln allowed Butler's policy to stand, and on August 6, 1861, Congress passed the First Confiscation Act which allowed the government to seize all property used by the Confederacy, including slaves. However, Union commanders were officially instructed to exclude runaway slaves until July 1862, when Lincoln admitted the importance of allowing slaves to escape to Union lines was a military necessity.Smith 2013, p10-11 The escaped slaves came to be known as \\"contrabands\\" and over two hundred thousand such individuals came to work for the Union Army. Initially, contrabands worked as teamsters, blacksmiths, cooks, coopers, carpenters, bakers, butchers, laundresses, personal servants, and performed other menial duties. Over the course of the war, many contraband took on more formal employment in support of the Union Army, particularly as cattle drivers, stevedores, and pioneer laborers.Smith 2013, p11 Lincoln feared the 1861 Confiscation Act would drive Border States into the Confederacy and was opposed by efforts of Union General John C. Fremont and of Secretary of War Simon Cameron to push forward emancipation and enlistment of black soldiers respectively.Smith 2013, p11-12 On the other hand, some Union Army Generals kept a practice of returning escaped slaves to their masters, particularly democrats such as Generals Henry Halleck, George B. McClellan, and Don Carlos Buell. Halleck's General Order No. 3 barred fugitive slaves from his lines.Woodward 2014, p108-109 However, slaves strongly desired to be free and to contribute to their own emancipation.Smith 2013, p10 Blacks were fundamental in engendering anti-slavery and emancipation sentiment in the north. Union soldiers saw the scars on the bodies of slaves they encountered marching in the south and saw the relative squalor in which they lived. They heard the stories of slaves and saw their willingness to fight for their own freedom and join the Union Army.Manning 2007, p77 This willingness to fight was irresistible to Union Generals in need of manpower. Since 1792, Federal law prohibited black men from serving in the state militias and the U.S. Army, but that changed during the war.Smith 2013, p9 In May 1862, General James H. Lane in Kansas and John W. Phelps in Louisiana began to enlist black men into regiments without War Department authorization. Lane's efforts resulted in the First Kansas Colored Volunteers while Phelps was opposed by his superior, General Butler, who, desperate for reinforcements, relented in August 1862 resulting in the Louisiana Native Guards, which was made up largely of freemen.Smith 2013, p13-14 Also in May 1862, General David Hunter proclaimed martial law and ordered slaves freed in the area around his command at Fort Pulaski on the Georgia coast, a command which included sections of coastal South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. On May 19, Lincoln annulled Hunter's emancipation decree, but remained silent on aspects of Hunter's proclamation involving the enlistment of slaves.Smith 2013, p13-14 Among the few black officers in these early regiments were freemen William D. Matthews and Caesar Antoine. In September 1862, Stanton authorized General Rufus Saxton, who had taken Hunter's position in command of parts of coastal South Carolina, to arm blacks to help guard coastal plantations, leading to the First South Carolina Colored Volunteers in 1862 and the establishment of colonies at places like Edisto Island and Port Royal.Smith 2013, p15-16 Hunter's recruitment of blacks was debated in Congress, with Charles A. Wickliffe and Robert Mallory of Kentucky opposing the efforts and Thaddeus Stevens leading the support. Lincoln's quiet official policies in favor of emancipation and enlistment of slaves and loud repudiation of Hunter and Fremont led to criticism by many abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison.Smith 2013, p16 Emancipation Executive and legislative efforts to end slavery started early in the war. In November 1861, Lincoln proposed a plan of compensated emancipation for slaves in the state of Delaware, a proposal which was rejected by the Delaware legislature. Lincoln proposed compensated emancipation programs again in early 1862 estimating that such a policy for Border States would be less expensive than continued war. The appeal was again rejected in March 1862. A third attempt was made on July 12, 1862 when representatives of Border States rejected a compensated emancipation plan proposed by Lincoln.Smith 2013, p17-19 In March 1862, Congress enacted an Article of War circumventing much of the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and 1850, and in April Congress abolished slavery in Washington D. C. compensating slaveholders and offering money to assist in immigration of slaves to Haiti or Liberia. In June, Congress emancipated slaves in Federal territories without compensation, overturning the Dred Scott v. Sandford decision of 1857.Smith 2013, p18 After the repeated rejection of compensated emancipation plans, Lincoln began to contemplate a presidential emancipation decree in mid-1862. On July 17, 1862, Congress passed the Militia Act which emancipated Confederate bondsmen employed by the Union army and authorized the president to receive into service blacks for \\"any military or naval service for which they may be found competent\\", authorizing the enlistment of blacks although intended to only apply to slaves of disloyal slave-owners and not to free blacks or slaves of loyal border state slave-owners. That same day, congress passed the Second Confiscation Act, which authorized the emancipation of slaves of people engaged in rebellion.Smith 2013, p19-20 Lincoln was slow to enact the provisions of the Second Confiscation Act, which was criticized by abolitionists, particularly Frederick Douglass.Smith 2013, p20 On July 21, 1862, four days after signing the Militia and Second Confiscation Acts, Lincoln met with his cabinet to inform them that he intended to implement the military and emancipation provisions of the acts, but not the colonization, and the next day he shared with the cabinet the preliminary emancipation proclamation. His proposal would extend to slaves beyond those under Federal Control and would be made as a war measure, which could circumvent the courts and legislature. In order to avoid alienating Border States, particularly Kentucky, Lincoln chose not to unveil his new position until the New Year.Smith 2013, p22-23 In part, this decision to delay stemmed from a desire to wait to make the proclamation until the Union Army had made some advances to ensure that the proclamation did not to appear to be made out of desperation. McClellan's victory at the Battle of Antietam in late summer 1862 gave Lincoln political capital, which was important in allowing Lincoln to issue his emancipation proclamation.Boles 2015, p190-191 Abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass greatly approved Lincoln's new position, writing, \\"The white man is liberated, the black man is liberated, the brave men now fighting in the battles of their country against rebels and traitors are now liberated...\\"Smith 2013, p25 The proclamation did receive some criticism, particularly from the South. It also only freed slaves in Confederate controlled areas, exempting about 800,000 of the country's 2.9 million slaves. In addition, it depended on Union gains in the war for its enforcement.Smith 2013, p26 Among opponents were General William T. Sherman, who frequently complained about emancipation and enlistment but who complied with the edicts.Smith 2013, p31 Freed slaves on J. J. Smith's cotton plantation on the Sea Islands near Beaufort, South Carolina, photographed by Timothy O'Sullivan standing before their quarters in 1862 Throughout the war, slaves were emancipating themselves. The two major events which allowed slaves to choose freedom were the increased possibility of escaping as white men who otherwise controlled slaves leaving the plantations for the Confederate Army and the advance of Union troops into close proximity. To prevent the former, attempts were made to better organize slave patrol and use the militia for such control, but these were less effective because the slave owners especially experienced in keeping their own slaves in bondage were often away in the Army.Boles 2015, p186 The advance of the Union Army had large effect on slavery in the areas they came to control. The first region the Union Army captured was the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia. Confederates reported that after their masters fled, the slaves in those areas pillaged their masters' property. The Union also made gains in western Kentucky, western Tennessee, and northern Mississippi.Woodward 2014, p110 Occupying Union forces made a number of efforts to provide for freed slaves. In Tennessee, General Ulysses S. Grant appointed John Eaton, Jr. to be in charge of fugitives, and a camp was established at Grand Junction, Tennessee, later moved to Memphis, which organized these efforts. The camp provided shelter, food, and a small amount of medical attention. It also centralized the hiring of freedmen to whites who leased abandoned plantations; transforming agriculture in Union held areas from a slave to a wage based labor system. This same system had already been implemented in 1862 along the South Carolina coast in the Port Royal experiment. Efforts were not universally successful, as tension developed between goals of efficiency and of black autonomy. In several locations, including Jefferson Davis' properties at Davis Bend, Mississippi, freed blacks were allotted land and given direct control. In spite of these examples, most freed slaves shifted to wage laborers, which were more similar to sharecropping than real freedom. This failure of provision of a solid economic footing for freed slaves has been considered a cause of the failure of Reconstruction.Boles 2015, p191-192 Colored Troops A company of 4th United States Colored Troops (USCT). USCT regiments formed up to a tenth of the Union army. After the Emancipation Proclamation, black soldiers became commonplace and eventually numbered 178,895 with 133,000 coming from slave states and mostly consisting of former slaves. Northerners were initially uncomfortable arming blacks and black troops were usually placed under white officers. They were also given inferior equipment and medical care and assigned disproportionate amounts of heavy labor. However, the success of these regiments led to a change in prospective. The Confederate government and army were infuriated with the northern use of black soldiers, seeing such troops as slave insurrectionaries and subjecting captured black soldiers to re-enslavement or death for treason.Boles 2015, p193-194 In December 1862, Jefferson Davis issued what has been called the \\"Anti-Emancipation Proclamation\\" which declared that the Confederate Army would return to slavery any black man found in Federal Uniform and turn over to the states any slaves found aiding Northern units; and would do the same with white officers of black regiments.Woodward 2014, p134 This led to Lincoln threatening to kill a captured rebel soldier for every black Union soldier killed in captivity, and that every captured black soldier committed to slavery would be responded to by giving a Confederate captive hard labor. No official retaliations of this sort occurred.Boles 2015, p193-194 A lithograph of the storming of Fort Wagner. Black troops were not considered equal, neither by Federals or Confederates. Black soldiers were often exposed to more difficult conditions and had worse medical care. The mortality rate for black soldiers was about 40% higher than that for white troops, and over 38,000 black soldiers died from all causes.Boles 2015, p195 On the battlefield, Black soldiers performed well, earning the respect of Union and Confederate Troops alike. However, Confederate victories against black soldiers led to atrocities where surrendering black Union soldiers were executed by Confederates. Two of the most notable such occurrences were in 1864 in the Battle of Fort Pillow in Tennessee and the Battle of the Crater in Virginia. Evidence is mixed over whether or not there was an official no-quarter policy, but at these victories, black soldiers were killed at a greatly disproportionate ratio.Woodward 2014, p148-150 Attitudes of whites Feelings of whites about slavery during this period has also been the subject of study. Generally, poor, non-slaveholding whites in the south admired planters and sought to own slaves themselves.Woodward 2014, p52 During the war, Confederate soldiers were optimistic about the prospects for the survival of the Confederacy and the institution of slavery well into 1864.Woodward 2014, p74 Confederates feared the Emancipation Proclamation would lead to slave uprisings, an occurrence which even northerners did not desire. Although most people at that time had not been born at the time of the Nat Turner Revolt or the revolution in Haiti, but insurrections were greatly feared.Woodward 2014, p113-114 Also, the north was not united against slavery, and many Union troops desired that the United States, win or lose, be a white man's country. However, it was clear to all that Lincoln's party, the Republican Party, was in favor of eventual if not immediate emancipation.Woodward 2014, p114-115 While most historians agree that the war erupted over a debate about slavery, the role of slavery in the motivation of soldiers had been the subject of widespread debate. J. Tracy Power in Lee's Miserables and Stephen Berry in All That Makes a Man argued that Confederate soldiers did not think much about slavery. Others such as Chandra Manning in What This Cruel War Was Over, Jason Phillips in Diehard Rebels, Joseph Glatthaar in The New Civil War History and General Lee's Army, Aaron Sheehan-Deen in Why Confederates Fought, Kenneth Noe in Reluctant Rebels, and James McPherson in For Cause and Comrades argued that slavery was central in the mindset of many Confederate soldiers. The issue in the mind and motivation of Union soldiers has also been debated. Manning's What This Cruel War Was Over is an example discussing the importance of slavery for Union soldiers.Woodward 2014, p4-7 Aftermath At the beginning of 1865, millions of black people remained as slaves, but the institution was crumbling. As the Confederate Army weakened, the Confederacy's ability to assert racial control lessened and large numbers of slaves were escaping to federal lines every day. Even as the large Armies surrendered, some Confederates held on to hope for victory and for the reassertion of slavery throughout the South.Woodward 2014, p181-183 At the wars end, some Southern whites fled to South America where they could escape Federal law, and in some cases, continue slaveholding, although such cases were the exception.Woodward 2014, p185 Slaves saw emancipation as more than an end to slavery, but also education, voting rights, and rights before the law.Manning 2007, p158 The 13th Amendment passed in January 1865 ending slavery in the Union and ensuring that under US control, slaves in the south would be freed.Woodward 2014, p180 After the war ended, a narrative of faithful slaves arose in the south, with stories of slaves marching with their masters or celebrating the return of soldiers to the plantations. Blacks living in the south were no longer slaves, but most remained and worked for their former masters. Even so, racial tensions grew greatly during the Reconstruction era.Woodward 2014, p187 White supremacy grew as well, represented by the growth of the militancy of the Ku Klux Klan and the growth of belief in the Lost Cause of the Confederacy movement.Woodward 2014, p192 The KKK was a radical supremacist group that persecuted African Americans and African American supporters.

The department was founded in 1970 and was later inducted into the College of Engineering and Applied Science in 1980. The department offers both undergraduate and graduate degree programs as well as a minor in Computer Science. Academic programs Undergraduate The department offers a Bachelor of Science in computer science as well as a minor. The four year undergraduate degree program typically culminates in a year-long senior projects course in which industry groups submit projects for groups of students to work on. The department also offers a working and studying area known as the Computer Science Educational Labs (CSEL). It is a common gathering place for students enrolled in at least one computer science course at the university, providing computing resources in the form of Ubuntu workstations. A student-led group called the Computer Science Undergraduate Advisory Committee (CSUAC) works with students and faculty to improve the undergraduate program and provides resources such as career fairs and other community events. Graduate The graduate program offers either a MS or ME or a Ph.D. The program places a high priority on research and the placement of its students in future careers. The department is supported by $4 million annually in the form of research grants primarily from federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation. Graduate students research in many areas, including human-computer interaction, neural networks, numerical and parallel computation, databases, networks, software engineering, systems, and theoretical computer science. Research Currently, the department has 34 research faculty and 18 administrative staff. Some of the more prevalent realms of research include computer architecture, mobile computing, computer security, computational biology, robotics, algorithm design, artificial intelligence, web engineering, programming languages, computer-supported cooperative work, machine learning, lifelong learning and design, speech and language processing, and scientific computing. Achievements and awards The department has received four successive five- year awards from the NSF and Comparative Effectiveness Research to support both research and infrastructure. The department also received the largest ever gift to a public university in the form of $250 million to fund research to improve the lives of people diagnosed with cognitive disabilities. The department is a member of the ARPA National Consortium in High Performance Computing. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak donated money to create the \\"Woz Lab\\" within the Computer Science Education Lab. Wozniak studied at the university in the late 1960s.

He received royal patronage, exhibited at the Royal Academy, and now has a pub named after him in Streatham, SW London. His early life was spent in the Royal Navy, where he would enjoy himself sketching caricatures of his colleagues. When his boss saw a caricature of himself, Tringham duly got the sack. However, in time he became a really well known illustrator, with his work appearing in several periodicals such as the London Illustrated News. As his fame spread, he joined fashionable society, and frequently had works exhibited at the Royal Academy. He was also commissioned to paint the portraits of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra on at least two occasions, and received letters signed personally by the Queen. In 1905‚Äî1906 he accompanied the Prince and Princess of Wales on their tour of India. He moved to Streatham in SW London in 1891, and is known at three addresses there, the last being 19 Greyhound Lane. He married Miss Beatrice Hall in 1886, but the marriage was dissolved in 1902, not long after the death of his mother. These events were accompanied by the development of photographic reproduction, which meant there was far less need for line illustrations in magazines, so his commissions started to dry up. He turned to alcohol, and the death of his former wife in February 1908 seems to have tipped him over the edge. To try to recover, he visited Douglas in the Isle of Man in 1908, but was arrested by a policeman who saw him behaving in a strange manner. The same night he was certified as insane and taken to the local lunatic asylum, where he died on 26 March 1908, aged 45. His illustrations are plentiful in magazines of the time, most of them showing views around Greater London. He was also a prolific painter: one Streatham collector in Victorian times is known to have possessed no fewer than 150 of his paintings. Although these rarely come onto the market, eleven of his watercolours appeared at auction in Folkestone in 2008, and are now in a private collection. Rather than showing London views, two of them show Lincoln Cathedral, while another two show Lincoln town centre. The others are scenes of the countryside, mostly featuring trees. In his lifetime he was said to be the finest tree painter in the world. The Wetherspoons tavern at 107 Streatham High Road, SW16, was named the Holland Tringham, after Streatham's most famous artist. On its walls are reproduced six illustrations of old Streatham by Tringham.

Events * April 21 ‚Äì Electric re-recording of George Gershwin's \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" by Paul Whiteman's Orchestra directed by Nathaniel Shilkret, with Gershwin at the piano. In 1925, electrical recording vastly improved the quality of recordings, and many important recordings, including Whiteman's 1924 recording of the Rhapsody, were re-recorded electrically. Whiteman was at the podium, but left the studio because of a disagreement with Gershwin over the tempo. Shilkret, Victor's Director of Light Music at the time, took the baton, and the recording was completed as scheduled.Shilkret, Nathaniel, ed.

It investigates when a common mistake within a contractual agreement will render it void. It is notable for its disapproval of Solle v Butcher, a Court of Appeal case wherein Lord Denning established a new doctrine of \\"equitable mistake\\". Facts The defendants, Tsavliris, were professional salvors in the business of maritime salvage and rendering aid to ships in difficulty in the South Indian Ocean. Learning that a vessel named Cape Providence was in trouble, Tsavliris entered into a salvage agreement with the owners on LOF terms. Tsavliris used the Ocean Routes service to try to locate the nearest rescue vessel, and were told that there was one about 35 miles away called the Great Peace. Using London brokers called Marint, Tsavliris contacted the Great Peace's owners, and agreement was made to hire the tug for a minimum of five days. It then became apparent that the Great Peace was not 35 miles from the Cape Providence, but 410 miles. Tsavliris then found a closer tug and terminated the contract with Great Peace Ltd, who responded by suing for gross breach of contract. Tsavliris argued it was a common mistake as to the location of the stricken vessel and this invalidated the contract. Judgment Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR Lord Phillips was a maritime lawyer who had served his National Service in the Royal Navy, during which time he had been paid a share of a salvage award. held that the mistake was not sufficiently fundamental to void the contract. The Great Peace would have taken 22 hours to do 410 miles, but that delay was insufficient to make performance of the contract ‚Äòessentially different from those the parties envisaged when the contract was concluded.‚Äô In the course of the judgment, McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission,. was approved, and Solle v Butcher was disapproved. It was opined that common mistake could not be explained on the grounds that it is an implied term, although it does apply only when a contract is silent.

Initial funding was a ten-year, $1.8 million commitment which was managed by its founding Director, E. Doyle Robison,Brigham Young University General Catalog, 1977-1978: p. 283 (E. Doyle Robinson, business director (1977-1978)) a talented retail professional who had established his credentials in Manhattan. (The Skaggs financial commitment was later extended at an annual giving rate of $125,000 through 1992.) The Skaggs Institute of Retail Management was one of the first academic retail institutes in the nation, founded in 1976. Its mission was to be the premier source of retail management talent in the nation, to be a leading producer of useful retail research, and to provide programs to meet the needs of the retail industry. Under the direction of Robison, the Institute received a good deal of recognition. During its years up through the early 1990s an Arthur Young survey of retail chief executive officers listed Brigham Young University among the top four universities as a source of business talent. A National Retail Federation study concluded that retail companies ‚Äútypically recruit from at least three schools, with Brigham Young University being particularly popular.‚Äù The Skaggs Institute of Retail Management received the ‚ÄúWestern Electric Fund Award‚Äù for having the most innovative program among colleges of business. Articles in Stores and Home Center magazines identified the Institute as one of two premier retail programs in the United States. Monitor magazine named the Institute as one of the top three retailing programs in the country. In 1991, Robison left Brigham Young University to serve as president of the England Mission, a Latter-day Saint missionary center based in London. The Institute was capably managed by a new director, Professor Heikki Rinne,Brigham Young University General Catalog, 1992-1993: p. 299 (Heikki J. Rinne, business director (1992-1993)) a Professor of Marketing at BYU's Marriott School of Management, and a consultant to the retail industry. Under his direction the Skagg's National Advisory Board played an ever greater role. In 1993 Professor Rinne left Brigham Young University to accept a position as CEO of the Halton Group of companies. The Institute of Retail Management In January 1993 and shortly following the death of Sam Skaggs, the American Stores‚Äô funding ceased. This required the Institute to seek new sourcing for its budget, which was accomplished under new direction and a new name. The new director, Professor William R. Swinyard,Brigham Young University Undergraduate Catalog, 1994-1995: p. 246 (William R. Swinyard, director (1994-1995)) p. 382 (in conjunction with Heikki J. Rinne, director (1994-1995)) was no stranger to retailing. He had frequently published in marketing and retail academic journals, and was Holder of the Fred G. Meyer Chair of Retailing at BYU (established through a $1 million grant from the Meyer Memorial Trust). The Skaggs Institute was renamed as, The Institute of Retail Management, and financial support was provided by a \\"National Advisory Board\\" of significant retailing leaders. For example, its 1993 National Advisory Board (NAB) was composed of the following individuals: :Ken Woodrow, President, Target Stores (and NAB Chair) :Suzanne Allford, Senior Vice President, Walmart/Sam‚Äôs Club :G. Kent Burnett, Chairman & CEO, Dillard‚Äôs SW Division :Marjorie Holmes, Sr. Vice President, Mervyn's :John Cody, President, JCPenney Stores :Jed Norden, Senior Vice President, Payless ShoeSource :John Kyees, Executive Vice President of Finance, Express :John McMillan, Co-chairman, Nordstrom :David Schuvie, Divisional Vice President, Kmart :Ron McEvoy, Senior Vice President and CIO, Fred Meyer Stores :Alan Stewart, Retail Food Consultant :Dan Sweeney, Vice Chairman, Price Waterhouse The National Advisory Board‚Äôs objectives were to assist the Institute in reaching its primary goals, increase student awareness of retailing, recommend appropriate research or seminar topics, and to critique and recommend improvements for institute programs. Under the National Advisory Board‚Äôs and Swinyard's direction the Institute‚Äôs mission became:Brigham Young University catalog, 1996-1997: p. 260 (William R. Swinyard, director; institute offers a retailing emphasis through the Institute of Business Management; goals include increasing the number and quantity of people entering retailing, producing research on retail management and technology, and producing workshops and seminars off-campus for retail management; institute involved in internship programs) # Increase the quantity and quality of young people entering the retail field, reduce the time required for a new trainee to become an effective part of the management team, and reduce the turnover rate among management trainees. # Produce research that meets the demands of technological and management progress in retailing. # Produce workshops and seminars on and off campus to assist in meeting the needs of retail management and increasing the students' understanding of current management problems as well as long-range social issues. Programs offered by the newly-defined Institute included retail career initiatives, executive lectures, retail executive panel discussions, seminars and workshops, classroom visits by retail professionals, scholarships and awards, symposia, and faculty research on retailing (funded in 1988 through a $500,000 endowment by the JCPenney Company). Both Retail recruitment and student response was enthusiastic and student response to them was The Institute of Marketing The Institute leadership changed again in 1997 when William D. Price assumed direction of the organization, with Professor Swinyard continuing as its Academic Director.Exchange, Spring 1998: p. 18 (Institute of Retail Management; renamed Institute of Marketing in 1997) Bill Price had been the president of Fuji Film's western film developing division. In 1998 as the attractiveness of retailing as a career among BYU's students began to diminish, the Institute was renamed and its mission revised to become the Institute of Marketing, which continued a broadened thrust first started in 1976.

The Commonwealth Bank (CBA) is the 100 per cent shareholder in Aussie. , Aussie reported a loan book under management of over A$42 Billion through 750 brokers and 150 stores.Aussie sales jump in last quarter, Aussie Home Loans , 17 April 2012 On 18 December 2012 CBA increased its share of ownership to 80% then to 100% in August 2017. History The firm was founded as Aussie Home Loans on 17 February 1992 by owner and executive chairman John Symond. The company was unique in its approach to home loans, offering 24 hours a day service and lower interest than loans offered by banks. . In 1994 the firm introduced the securitisation of home loans, allowing them to offer loans upwards of 3% cheaper than its competitors. The company rapidly grew as consumers became aware of its products and banks were forced to copy its methods as their market share diminished. The company re-positioned itself as a mortgage broker in 2002, and introduced its own credit card shortly thereafter. In August 2008 the Commonwealth Bank acquired a 33% stake in Aussie.Commonwealth Bank make strategic investment in Aussie, Commonwealth Bank, 29 August 2008 Acquisition  In February 2009, the firm acquired Wizard Home Loans. The deal saw the loan book expand to more than A$31bn . Aussie also acquired Wizard's franchise distribution network, including over 100 retail outlets and 200 brokers. A further acquisition was made in July 2012 of National Mortgage Brokers (nMB) which added a stand-alone wholesale aggregation channel of 200 broker businesses and loan book of 8.5 Billion dollars thus taking the total loan book under Aussie Group management in excess of 50 Billion through 950 brokers. Advertising and Sponsorship In 2009, following its acquisition of Wizard Home Loans, Aussie took over Wizard's sponsorship of the Rugby League's New South Wales State of Origin team for the next two years, and also inherited the sponsorship of Collingwood Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). Both deals lasted for two seasons (2009‚Äì2010), before Aussie withdrew. In the former case, it came in the fallout from New South Wales' fifth (of eight) consecutive State of Origin series defeat. In 2002, the firm purchased naming rights to Sydney Football Stadium in a five-year plus five-year deal, with the stadium renamed Aussie Stadium. On 7 July 2007 the stadium reverted to its original name, after the firm and the SCG Trust mutually elected not to extend the deal.

Facts The Commonwealth Disposals Commission sold McRae a shipwreck of a tanker on the \\"Jourmand Reef\\", near Samarai supposedly containing oil. The McRae brothers went to Samarai and found no tanker, and that there was no such place as the Jourmand Reef. It later became clear that the Commission officer had made a 'reckless and irresponsible' mistake in thinking that they had a tanker to sell (the Court found that they had relied on mere gossip). The McRae brothers incurred considerable expense in fitting out a salvage operation. The McRae brothers commenced an action claiming damages against the Commission. First they claimed damages for breach of contract to sell a tanker at the location specified. Second, they claimed damages for fraudulent misrepresentation that there was a tanker. Third, they claimed damages for a negligent failure to disclose that there was no tanker at the place specified after the fact became known to the Commissioner. CDC argued there was no liability for breach of contract because it was void given the subject matter did not exist. Furthermore, in relation to the expenditure incurred by McRae, the CDC argued that ‚ÄúNon constat [It is not clear or evident] that the expenditure incurred by the plaintiffs would not have been equally wasted. If the promise that there was a tanker in situe had been performed, she might still have been found worthless or not susceptible of profitable salvage operations or of any salvage operations at all. How, then‚Ä¶ can the plaintiffs say that their expenditure was wasted because there was no tanker in existence?\\" Judgment The High Court of Australia held that McRae succeeded in damages for breach of contract. They rejected the contract was void because CDC had promised the tanker did exist. Courturier v Hastie was distinguished because there the parties had both shared the assumption the corn existed, but here CDC had actually promised the tanker existed and therefore had assumed the risk that it did not. A general ruling that can be gleaned from the court's judgment is that in circumstances where parties have equal knowledge as to the existence of the subject matter, and it turned out to be false, then it would justify the implication of a condition precedent. In that case, the contract would be void for the failure of the condition precedent, and parties would be restored to their original position. However, in a case where only one party has knowledge of the subject matter (such as the present circumstances), and the other simply relies on what the first party intimates, then there could be no condition precedent. The first party promises or guarantees the existence of the subject matter and will be in breach if it does not exist. The High Court considered the measure of damages, as this was not a simple case of nondelivery of goods. In opposition to CDC‚Äôs argument that McRae‚Äôs expenditure was not wasted, Dixon and Fullagar JJ stated: ‚ÄúThey [McRae] can say: (1) this expense was incurred; (2) it was incurred because you promised us that there was a tanker; (3) the fact that there was no tanker made it certain that this expense would be wasted. The plaintiffs have in this way a starting-point. They make a prima-facie case. The fact that the expense was wasted flowed prima facie from the fact that there was no tanker; and the first fact is damage, and the second fact is breach of contract.\\" See also *English contract law *Frustration in English law * References Category:English contract case law Category:Australian contract law Category:High Court of Australia cases Category:1951 in case law Category:1951 in Australia ","title":"McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission"},{"id":"29860538","text":"Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150 (1995), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that held that under Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 801(d)(1)(B), a prior consistent statement is not hearsay only if the statement was made before the motive to fabricate arose.Mueller, Christopher and Kirkpatrick, Laird. Evidence Under the Rules: Text, Cases, and Problems, Sixth Edition. Aspen Publishers, New York: 2008, p. 171-72. Factual background The defendant, Matthew Tome, was found guilty of sexually abusing his four-year-old daughter A.T. After her parents' divorce, A.T. was in Tome's primary physical custody, and she stayed with Tome on the Navajo Reservation in New Mexico. A.T.'s mother lived in Colorado.. At trial, A.T. was six and a half years old and testified by short answers to leading questions. During cross-examination, the defense suggested that A.T. had fabricated the allegations against Tome because she wanted to go live with her mother. To rebut the charge of fabrication, the prosecution called six witnesses (a babysitter, A.T.'s mother, a social worker, and three pediatricians) that all testified to statements about the abuse that A.T. had made to them. The trial court admitted the statements under FRE 801, which reads: The Tenth Circuit affirmed Tome's conviction, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari. Opinion of the Court Majority opinion Justice Kennedy, joined by Justices Stevens, Scalia, Souter, and Ginsburg, delivered the opinion for a majority of the court except for Part II-B, a plurality where Justice Kennedy was joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg. The Court noted that not all prior consistent statements by a witness were excluded from the bar against hearsay evidence. The text of FRE 801(d)(1)(B) accorded not hearsay status only to prior consistent statements by a testifying witness used to rebut a charge of recent fabrication. The Court reasoned that to properly rebut a charge of fabrication, a prior consistent statement would need to have predated the motive to fabricate. Otherwise prior consistent statements would be admissible to rebut other forms of impeachment, and this would ignore the common law temporal requirement that the Advisory Committee Note said was adopted by the rule.Tome, 513 U.S. at 159. The Court found this approach consistent with the Federal Rules' liberal approach to admissibility, and rejected the Government's advocacy for a general balancing test for hearsay.Tome, 513 U.S. at 164. In the present case, the purported motivation to fabricate arose when A.T. was put in her father's custody in 1988, before the prior consistent statements in 1990. Finding that the statements from the other witnesses should not have been admissible under FRE 801(d)(1)(B), the Court reversed Tome's conviction and remanded the case.Tome, 513 U.S. at 167. Plurality opinion Part II-B represented only a plurality of Justices, and discussed how the Advisory Committee notes for the Federal Rules supported the holding.Tome, 513 U.S. at 161. Justice Scalia's concurrence Justice Scalia, who joined in the judgment of the Court and Kennedy's opinion except for Part II-B, wrote separately to emphasize that the Advisory Committee Notes should not be relied upon when interpreting the Federal Rules of Evidence.Tome, 513 U.S. at 168. Justice Breyer's dissent In a dissent joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Thomas, Justice Breyer characterized the case as one about relevance and not hearsay. Breyer argued that the timing of the alleged motive to fabricate should go to the probative force of the testimony, not its reliability. Breyer thought that a post-motive consistent statement could be admitted to rebut a charge of fabrication, but that the probative force of the statement would simply be diminished. Breyer argued that FRE 801(d)(1)(B) could simply be a recognition that juries can have difficulty in separating the impeaching and substantive uses of hearsay statements, and so the rule declared as not hearsay prior consistent statements used to rebut charges of fabrication. In that sense, the usefulness of the Rule did not rest on the majority's timing requirement.Tome, 513 U.S. at 169-76. Subsequent history On remand, the Tenth Circuit found that some of the hearsay admitted in the original trial was admitted erroneously under the standard enunciated by the Supreme Court. Finding that the error was not harmless, the Tenth Circuit reversed and remanded the case. Impact As an interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence, Tome is not binding on state courts.Mueller & Kirkpatrick, p. 78 In states including Montana and Nebraska, courts have held that a statement fulfilling the premotive requirement of Tome are admissible as both impeachment and substantive evidence.State v. Veis, 962 P.2d 1153, 1156 (Mont. 1998)State v. Morris, 554 N.W.2d 627, 633 (Neb. 1996) Other states including Colorado and the First Circuit have held that prior consistent statements that do not fulfill the premotive requirement of Tome may still be admitted for rehabilitative purposes.People v.

It was the junction where the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway opened in 1863 diverged from the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway which opened four years earlier. Although having only three through platforms, by rural standards it was a busy interchange station and in its heyday possessed a refreshment room. Moat Lane Junction is often quoted as a defining feature of the Great Western Railway in Wales, namely its inheritance of junctions in unlikely and inconvenient locations. Other examples are Afon Wen, Talyllyn Junction, Dovey Junction and Barmouth Junction (renamed Morfa Mawddach in 1960). The first station at Moat Lane, opened in 1859, was located a short distance to the south-west of the later junction station, and was intended to serve Caersws. On the opening of the Machynlleth line, a new station was built in the ‚ÄòV‚Äô of the junction. This had a single straight platform face serving Llanidloes trains and superseding the original station; and a curved platform serving the new line. Since the latter was now the major route, an island platform was also provided on the curve, providing three platforms trains to/from the Machynlleth direction. Both originating railways became part of the Cambrian Railways. Beyond Llanidloes, the Mid-Wales Railway to Brecon was opened in 1864, but was operated separately until 1888, passengers needing to change at Llanidloes. From that date, trains ran through from Moat Lane Junction. Reflecting the lower status of the earlier Llanidloes line, through running of passenger trains from Newtown to the Mid-Wales line eventually ceased, and the original single platform sufficed throughout its life. The station closed on 31 December 1962 together with passenger services to Llanidloes and Brecon. Shortly after closure the station was demolished apart from a small section of platform, now occupied by farming equipment.

The episode was written by Ken Keeler and directed by Raymie Muzquiz. In the episode, Bender is overclocked by Cubert Farnsworth, gradually becoming more powerful in computing ability, until eventually becoming omniscient and able to foresee future events. Meanwhile, Cubert and Professor Farnsworth are tried in court by Mom for violating Bender's license agreement, and Fry's relationship with Leela takes a turn for the worse. The episode was originally written by Keeler to serve as an open-ended series finale, in case the show did not get renewed for another season. In June 2011, as part of its \\"Countdown to Futurama\\" event, Comedy Central Insider, Comedy Central's news outlet, released various preview materials for the episode, including storyboards, concept art and a preview video clip of the episode. \\"Overclockwise\\" received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its premises and humor, but felt that the episode was not completely capable of holding its plots together. Plot Cubert overclocks Bender to improve his performance in an online game. Walt, Larry, and Igner are defeated online by an enhanced Bender and complain to Mom, who has both Cubert and Professor Farnsworth arrested for overclocking Bender (a violation of Bender's license agreement). She also sends an army of robots to capture Bender so he can be reset to his original settings. Due to heightened intelligence caused by his overclocking, Bender is able to anticipate future probabilities and connects himself to a water cooler to prevent overheating. He anticipates the arrival of Mom's robots, and manages to destroy them and steal their processors, increasing his capacities even further. Bender then leaves Planet Express to find a new, larger coolant. Meanwhile, Leela begins thinking about her on- again, off-again relationship with Fry and admits to him her concerns over their future together. At the trial overseen by Judge Ron Whitey, Cubert and the Professor are ordered to locate Bender, and are forced to pay $10,000 every day until he is found. With Planet Express going out of business as a result, Leela decides to leave, sadly breaking up with Fry. Heartbroken, Fry attempts to commit suicide by going over Niagara Falls in a barrel. There he discovers a cave behind the falls where Bender has developed into an omnipotent being, using the waterfalls as his new cooling system. Fry tries to convince Bender to help Professor Farnsworth and Cubert, but Bender is unconcerned with their troubles, stating that they are guilty and will be convicted. Fry believes that Bender is now practically omniscient, and therefore asks Bender if he has a future with Leela. Bender does not answer, but instead gets a sad expression on his face and tells Fry to leave. After Fry returns to the trial, Bender has a change of heart and appears in court, accusing Mom of unfairly trying Cubert, a minor. Fearing that Cubert will gain the jury's sympathy, Mom drops charges against Cubert while still attempting to prosecute the Professor. However, Bender seeks a mistrial on the grounds of double jeopardy, declaring that by dropping charges against the Professor's clone, Mom is unable to press charges against the Professor for the same crime because they are legally the same person. The case is dismissed as the jury discards their written verdict to have Cubert and the Professor put to death. Enraged that she cannot prosecute the Professor, Mom forcibly captures Bender and resets him to factory settings. Leela returns to Fry, still wondering what the future holds for both of them. Bender reveals that he had written down his prediction of their future, which Fry and Leela silently read together. The contents of the prediction are not shown, but Fry and Leela's reactions indicate that their relationship will have its ups and downs but will ultimately have a happy ending. Production The episode was written by Ken Keeler and directed by Raymie Muzquiz. In June 2011, as part of its \\"Countdown to Futurama\\" event, Comedy Central Insider, Comedy Central's news outlet, released various preview materials for the episode, including storyboards, concept art and a preview video clip of the episode. On June 7, concept art of the interior of overclocked Bender's head was released. The next day, concept art of Fry's video game character was released. On June 9, storyboards of Mom and her sons overlooking the Hoverfish were released. Finally, a preview video clip of Fry conversing with overclocked Bender was released on June 20. \\"Overclockwise\\" was originally written to serve as an open-ended series finale, much in the way that the season 4 episode \\"The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings\\" and the film Into the Wild Green Yonder were produced, in case the show did not get renewed. Archived by Wayback Machine from on September 7, 2010. It was eventually announced on March 24, 2011 that the show was renewed by Comedy Central for a seventh production season. Reception In its original U.S. broadcast, \\"Overclockwise\\" scored a 0.8 share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, and 1.571 million total viewers, up from the previous week's episode \\"Cold Warriors\\". The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club was generally positive towards the episode, noting that it had \\"a lot of excellent moments\\" as well as praising that it addressed Fry and Leela's relationship problems. However, he noted that the episode \\"doesn't hold together well in retrospect\\", also writing: \\"Some episodes are greater than the sum of their parts; some aren't. This one feels like the latter.\\" He also felt that \\"the story gets lost for a while in the third act, with a courtroom climax that doesn't make a whole lot of sense,\\" though also noting that the episode \\"rebounds again in the final moments.\\" He gave the episode an overall B+ rating. Robert Canning of IGN felt that the episode was \\"uneven\\" and that parts of the episode felt out of place, such as Leela's boredom with her job and relationship. He also felt that the plot involving Bender's overclocking was not used to its full potential. While noting that he felt \\"the episode wasn't quite as good as the sum of its parts\\", he noted that \\"for the most part, [he] liked 'Overclockwise'\\", writing that \\"there were some good bits throughout\\", praising the use of Mom in the episode as well as scenes of the episode set in Niagara Falls; he also enjoyed its \\"sweet, touching\\" ending. He gave the episode an overall rating of 7/10. Sean Gandert of Paste felt that the concept of overclocked Bender's prophetic nature was new and interesting, but felt that the concept \\"is completely subsumed by the myriad of subplots [in the episode] such that this is the most unfocused episode in a while.\\" Though noting that the episode \\"isn't without its charms\\", he felt that the plots involving Bender's transformation into a godlike being and Fry and Leela's romance were \\"repetitions\\". Regarding the latter plot, Gandert felt that while he was \\"largely waiting for Futurama to return to the pair and what developed during the movies (or the end of the TV show)\\", he also felt their subplot in the episode was \\"just so fast and slapdash that it didn‚Äôt really work for me.\\" He enjoyed the episode's ending, but noted that \\"it also left me feeling that like every other development in their relationship, this one will soon be dropped by the wayside as soon as the next season begins.\\" In his conclusion to the review, he wrote that \\"Overclockwise\\" was \\"not the finest ending for the season, but perhaps it's fitting for one that has been consistently quite good but rarely gone beyond that.\\" He gave the episode an overall 6.9/10 rating.

Edward Jenkins, was a barrister, author and Liberal Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was best known as an author of satirical novels, and also served as the Agent-General of Canada, encouraging emigration to the new Dominion. He contested several parliamentary elections, but won only one, and sat in the House of Commons from 1874 to 1880.  Early life  Jenkins was born in Bangalore, Mysore, India, the eldest son of Rev. Dr. John Jenkins (1813‚Äì1898), a minister of the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society from 1837 to 1841. His father moved to Canada in 1847 as a Methodist minister, before becoming a Presbyterian minister in Philadelphia in 1853, and minister of a Presbyterian Church in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, from 1865. His mother was Harriet Shepstone of Mysore. Edward's uncles included David James Jenkins, the MP for Penryn and Falmouth, and Rev. Ebenezer Jenkins, the chairman of Wesleyan Indian Missions. He was educated in Montreal at the High School and at McGill University, and then at the University of Pennsylvania. He then moved to London, where he studied law with a conveyancer, Mr. Raymond, and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in the Michaelmas term, 1864. He practised as a barrister on the Home Circuit.  Career  Jenkins made his name as the author of the satire Ginx's Baby: his birth and other misfortunes, published in 1870. The book described a child born in poverty who became the victim of rival philanthropists. He wrote at least two other satires, Lord Bantam (1871) and Barney Geoghegan, M.P (1872). The review of Lord Bantam in The Times newspaper in 1872 describes a political novel telling the story of a young nobleman of radical politics who enters Parliament supporting a redistribution of land and power, but who promptly abandons his radicalism when he inherits his father's peerage and large estates. The reviewer denounces the book as a vehicle for \\"Red Republican opinions\\", and remarks that the author wants the reader to conclude that \\"the working classes need never expect to derive any permanent advancement from the Radical professions of young lords who have such a stake in the existing institutions of the country\\". Jenkins supported the campaigns of the Warwickshire agricultural trade unionist Joseph Arch, and his novel Little Hodge (1873) dealt with the plight of landless labourers in England. As well as the satires, Jenkins wrote a series of novels and many non-fiction-works, most of them relating to Canada. He travelled in 1870 to Guiana on behalf of the English Benevolent Society, to \\"report of the condition of the coolies\\" (i.e. indentured labourers). His report was published in 1871, and resulted in the improvement of their conditions. Jenkins stood for Parliament at two by-elections in the 1870s: Truro in September 1871, and Dundee in August 1873.Craig, Election results 1832‚Äì1885, page 538The Times article \\"New Members\\" of 26 February 1874 says that he had also stood for Stafford, but Craig's elections results for Stafford do not list any Jenkins as a candidate between 1832 and 1885 (Craig, Election results 1832‚Äì1885, , pages 282‚Äì3) He was elected a member of parliament (MP) for Dundee at the 1874 general election The city was such a Liberal stronghold that its two seats were contested by four Liberals and one Conservative, and the lone Conservative came last of the five candidates. Jenkins won the seat despite being in America during the election in February, while on a lecture tour in Canada,https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=33&dat;=18741024&id;=u1IvAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=bSYDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2698,6248715&hl;=en he was appointed as the agent-general of the Dominion of Canada. His duties in that role were clarified to the House of Commons of Canada in May 1874 by the Canadian Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie, who said that Jenkins would have surveillance of the Canadian emigration business in London, would occasionally be asked to attend to other business of a confidential nature. He would also be \\"expected to give some little attention to Canadian gentlemen sojourning in London\\". He held the post for two years. On his return to Dundee in March, he addressed a meeting of electors in the Kinnaird Hall, Dundee. Between 2,000 and 3,000 people attended, with hundreds turned away because the hall was full. Jenkins did not contest the 1880 general election, but stood unsuccessfully at a by-election in January 1881 for Edinburgh.Craig, page 540 He contested Dundee again at the 1885 and 1892 general elections as a Conservative, but was unsuccessful on both occasions. He died in London on 4 June 1910, having been paralysed for some years.  Family  Like his father, Jenkins was a Presbyterian. In 1867 he married Hannah Matilda Johnstone, a daughter of William Johnson, of Belfast. They had five sons and two daughters.

It has traditionally been associated with the city of Cartagena (Spain). The association has been made principally from the analysis of classical sources in the early 20th century by Adolf Schulten. The first description of the city of Mastia appears in a poem entitled Ora Maritima (Sea Coasts) by the Latin poet Rufius Festus Avienus from the 4th-century AD. The poem claims to contain borrowings from the mythic 6th-century BC Massiliote Periplus. The description of Avienus reads: However, there is currently no conclusive evidence that the Mastia of Avienus refers to the same site where Cartagena will be founded. Context and other geographic descriptions that precede and follow these lines suggest that it could refer to the same location. Some scholars locate Mastia somewhere near the ancient city of Carteia (near modern Gibraltar), at the head of the Bay of Algeciras. In addition to the Ora Maritima, there is also a reference to Mastia in the treaty between Rome and Carthage of 348 BC, as ŒúŒ±œÉœÑŒπŒ± Œ§Œ±œÅœÉŒµŒπœâŒΩ (Mastia of the Tartessians), which marked the Roman boundary on the Iberian Peninsula.

Vidal and Santa Maria della Carit√†) is an early oil painting by Giovanni Antonio Canal, better known as Canaletto. It depicts an informal scene in Venice, looking over a temporary stonemason's yard in the Campo San Vidal set up for the construction of Andrea Tirali's facade of the church of San Vidal, and across the Grand Canal towards the church of Santa Maria della Carit√†. Painted in the mid to late 1720s, it is now in the collection of The National Gallery in London and is considered one of Canaletto's finest works.Canaletto, The Stonemason's Yard, National Gallery, London. Description The painting measures . It depicts a Venetian scene looking roughly southwest over a temporary stonemason's yard situated in an open space beside the Grand Canal known as the Campo San Vidal (\\"campo\\", literally field, used in Venice to denote a small open space). Several masons are at work shaping and carving stone probably destined for the reconstruction of the nearby church of San Vidal (immediately behind the viewer and so not visible in the painting; its Palladian fa√ßade was renovated in the 1730s) or possibly for the embellishment of a nearby palazzo (the Palazzo Cavalli- Franchetti and Palazzo Barbaro are close by, to the viewer's left). The side of the medieval church of Santa Maria della Carit√†, reconstructed in the 1440s, stands on the opposite bank of the Grand Canal, to the left of the fa√ßade of the Scuola Grande della Carit√†; the tower of the church of San Trovaso is visible rising over the rooftops in the distance. In addition to the architectural details, The Stonemason's Yard shows scenes of daily life in Venice, probably in the early morning: a cock crows on a windowsill to the lower left, and sunlight streams in from the left behind the viewer's (east). The mainly domestic buildings are generally in poor repair, with typical Venetian flared chimney-pots. Laundry hangs from many of the windows, and potted plants stand on several balconies. One woman is using a distaff and drop spindle to spin thread on a balcony to the right; another draws water from a well in the campo beside a wooden shed, from a well-head shaped like the capital of a column. Two children are playing in the foreground to the left: one is falling over and urinating involuntarily in surprise, as a woman lunges forward to catch him; another woman looks down from a balcony above. A gondola with canopied cabin passes on the canal, with others moored on either bank. Unsigned and undated, the painting is attributed and dated by stylistic clues. It seems to combine features of Canaletto's early and mature styles, for example in the use of two undercolours, and is a very early example the use of Prussian blue in oil painting.Bomford, D., Roy, A. ‚ÄòCanaletto‚Äôs ‚ÄúStonemason‚Äôs Yard‚Äù and ‚ÄúSan Simeone Piccolo‚Äù‚Äò. National Gallery Technical Bulletin Vol 14, pp 34‚Äì41. Canaletto painted The Stonemason's Yard before 1730 while Prussian blue was discovered by Johann Jacob Diesbach in 1704. Amongst other pigments used by Canaletto in this painting were Naples yellow, lead white and ochres.Canaletto, The Stonemason's Yard, illustrated pigment analysis at ColourLex. The informal scene is thought to have been painted for a Venetian patron, rather than a foreign visitor to Venice, in the mid- to late 1720s. Unlike many views painted by Canaletto and his fellow vedutisti, the location has changed significantly since the 1720s. The view of the opposite bank of the Grand Canal is now blocked by the high arch of the modern wooden Accademia bridge, and the church of the Carit√† has been much altered. The campanile fell down in 1744, demolishing the houses beside the canal in front, and much of the other stonework has been removed. The nave became the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia in the 1800s, and the Gallerie dell'Accademia is housed in the Scuola. The Campo remains an open space, with the well-head at its centre. The domestic building to the right remains standing.The Stonemason's Yard, Primary teachers' notes, National Gallery, London. Provenance The early ownership of The Stonemason's Yard is not known. It was in the collection of Sir George Beaumont by 1808, and was one of the paintings Beaumont donated to the British Museum in 1823, to form the nucleus of the National Gallery's nascent collection. It passed to the National Gallery in 1828, where it continues to be exhibited. It was extensively cleaned by John Seguier in 1852 ‚Äì so extensively that a Select Committee investigated the cleaning practices of the National Gallery ‚Äì and was cleaned again in 1955, and then restored, relined and remounted in 1989. Some early retouchings, clouds now concealed under later glazings, may have been done in Beaumont's time by John Constable.

He returned to Louisville after four appearances with the Reds, where he had the one hit in four at-bats. Negr√≥n hit .218 with six homers and 20 RBIs at Louisville until he tore the anterior cruciate ligament and medial meniscus in his right knee on July 5, costing him the rest of the season. On November 30, 2012, he was non-tendered by the Reds and removed from the 40-man roster but he agreed to a minor league contract with them for the 2013 season that included an invitation to major league spring training. In 2013, all at Louisville, he hit .225 with five homers and 30 RBIs. He played for Criollos de Caguas in the Puerto Rican Winter League after the season. Playing in Louisville in 2014 and batting .269 for the Bats, in early July he was called up to the big leagues for the second time in his career, this time to fill in for the injured Brandon Phillips. On July 13, Negr√≥n, who was starting at second base, hit his first big-league home run, off starter Francisco Liriano, and tallied his first three RBIs against the Pittsburgh Pirates. His playing time was significant for the injury-ravaged Reds; he made the most of it with a three-game stretch against the Cleveland Indians August 5‚Äì7, going a combined 7-15 with two doubles, one home run and five RBIs. On August 15 against the Colorado Rockies, he had his first four-hit game, going 4-4 with four singles and one RBI. Overall, he hit .271 with six homers and 17 RBI in 49 games for the Reds in 2014. In 2015, he split the season between Louisville and Cincinnati, hitting .216 in 59 games for Louisville and .140 in 43 games for the Reds. His season ended early when he suffered a partially dislocated shoulder, fractured scapula and torn labrum while making a catch at Great American Ball Park on September 8. He was released by the Reds in October and became a free agent. Chicago Cubs After spending the off-season rehabbing from his shoulder injury, Negr√≥n signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs that included an invitation to spring training. He did not make the major league club and spent the entire season with the AAA Iowa Cubs, where he hit .256 in 117 games with nine homers, 46 RBI and 23 steals. Arizona Diamondbacks In November 2016, Negr√≥n signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He was assigned to the Reno Aces of the Pacific Coast League, where he hit .300 in 120 games with 13 homers and 64 RBI. The Diamondbacks called him up to the majors in September He had four hits in 25 at-bats (.160) for the Diamondbacks that season in 14 games. He was added to the Diamondbacks roster for the Wild Card Game and 2017 NLDS but did not play. He was outrighted off the roster after the season but re-signed to a new minor league deal and invited to spring training. He was assigned to Reno to begin 2018, but was called up by the Diamondbacks on June 4, 2018 and appeared in two games for them on June 4 and June 5 against the San Francisco Giants, with one hit in three at-bats before he was designated for assignment on June 6 and outrighted back to the minors. He hit .283 in 118 games for Reno during the year. Seattle Mariners On August 30, 2018, Negr√≥n was traded to the Seattle Mariners for cash considerations and he was added to the major league roster on September 1. He batted .219/.242/.313 for the year. For the season, he had the fastest baserunning sprint speed of all major league third basemen, at 29.5 feet/second. He was outrighted to the AAA Tacoma Rainiers on March 13, 2019 when he did not make the roster out of spring training In 82 games for Tacoma, he hit .310 wit 12 homers and 61 RBI. On July 16, the Mariners selected his contract and brought him back to the majors where he hit .217 in 10 games. Los Angeles Dodgers On July 28, 2019, Negr√≥n was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for minor league infielder Daniel Castro. In his first at bat with the team, Negron hit a home run off Kyle Freeland of the Colorado Rockies. He played in 30 games for the Dodgers, hitting .259. Post playing career Negr√≥n announced his retirement from professional baseball on November 12, 2019. On November 19, 2019, Negr√≥n was hired by the Seattle Mariners as assistant to the director of player development.

History The building originally used for the Farmer School of Business, Laws Hall, was located across the street on Oxford's campus. Although Laws was the official home, not all departments in the school were ever housed in the same building until the opening of the Farmer School.\\"Miami University Dedicates New Home of Farmer School of Business\\", Reuters, November 7, 2009, accessed November 1, 2010. With the growth of the program and a need for more space and better facilities to distinguish itself, Farmer began the transition into creating the new Farmer School of Business. Construction The building took 30 months to complete and was finished ahead of schedule and under budget. On December 10, 2004, the university's board of trustees voted unanimously to approve the site of the building on High Street, where Reid Hall (residence) was located until its demolition in 2006. Eleven different sites were considered for the home of the business school, including Bishop Woods.

Financial Contributions University Financial Reports from the years 2006 and 2007 mention the planning for the Farmer School of Business as a package that included several other construction endeavors put into place by the university. In February 2007, the university issued $83.2 million in general receipt bonds, which were put not only toward the Farmer School but also the renovation of several other residence halls and buildings on the Oxford Campus, as well as the construction of the university's Voice of America campus in West Chester, Ohio.Annual Report 2007, Miami University, June 30, 2007, accessed November 1, 2010.

Importance to the university The Farmer School of Business is consistently ranked as one of the best programs, undergraduate and graduate, in the nation. Business Week's 2010 rankings held the school as the 16th best in the nation, and 6th among public schools. It is the highest ranked in the state of Ohio. The facilities received an A+ ranking, which is higher than some of the schools scoring overall higher than the Farmer School.\\"Top Undergraduate Business Programs\\", Business Week, November 17, 2010, accessed October 31, 2010. This ranking highlights both the FSB prestige and the impact that the Farmer building has had on the school. The Business Week rankings have been steadily increasing, moving up two spots between 2009 and 2010, and one could presume that with the new technologies and facilities at the Farmer School of Business building, the program itself is becoming better. It is indeed the goal of the Farmer School of Business to continually improve the education of its pupils through the utilization of state of the art technology and better facilities to encourage small team and seminar learning.

The temple was built during the Roman Empire, probably in the time of Hadrian and possibly on his orders. It is one of the largest Roman structures still surviving in the ancient Greek world. The temple is thought to have been used for the worship of Egyptian gods ‚Äì specifically Isis and/or Serapis, and possibly also Osiris, Harpocrates and other lesser gods, who may have been worshipped in a pair of drum-shaped rotundas, both of which are virtually intact, alongside the main temple. Although the building itself is of an immense size, it was only one part of a much larger sacred complex, surrounded by high walls, that dwarfed even the colossal Temple of Jupiter in Baalbek. The entire complex was built directly over the River Selinus in a remarkable feat of engineering that involved the construction of an immense bridge wide to channel the river through two channels under the temple. The Pergamon Bridge still stands today, supporting modern buildings and even vehicle traffic. A series of tunnels and chambers lies under the main temple, connecting it with the side rotundas and giving private access to different areas of the complex. Various drains, water channels and basins are located in, around and under the main temple and may have been used for symbolic reenactments of the flooding of the Nile. The temple was converted by the Byzantines into a Christian church dedicated to St John but was subsequently destroyed. Today the ruins of the main temple and one of the side rotundas can be visited, while the other side rotunda is still in use as a small mosque.  History  The temple's date of construction is not recorded, but from the style of the sculptures and the building techniques a date in the first half of the second century AD has been proposed. Its use of red brick on a massive scale, unique in Asia Minor but relatively common in Italy at the time, indicates that the architect was not local. The immense size and lavish construction of the complex points to an extremely wealthy patron who sent a Roman architect and brick masons to Pergamon to build the temple. The most likely candidate is the emperor Hadrian himself. He is known to have been an enthusiastic sponsor of the Egyptian gods; he built temples of Isis and Serapis at various places in the Roman world, including at his own villa in Tivoli. At some point during the Christian era the temple was gutted by fire. It was not restored, but was redeveloped in the 5th century AD as a Christian basilica, built inside the shell of the destroyed temple. Arcades were built dividing the interior into a central nave and two side aisles. The eastern wall was demolished and replaced with an apse. The floor level was raised by about , obscuring the original Roman floor, though the former floor level has since been restored by archaeologists. The church was probably destroyed by the forces of the Arab general Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik, who besieged and looted the city in 716‚Äì717 during his unsuccessful bid to conquer Constantinople. Pergamon fell into Turkish hands in 1336 and the building was converted into a mosque. The complex has been investigated and excavated in a series of campaigns by the German Archaeological Institute. In 1906‚Äì1909 P. Schazmann prepared detailed drawings of the ruins during a German excavation of the Hellenistic city. The temple and temenos were excavated by Theodor Wiegand from 1927. New archaeological studies were carried out from 2002 to 2005 under A. Hoffmann. Restoration efforts have also been pursued, first in the 1930s under O. Bayatlƒ±, the Director of the Bergama Museum, and later in the 1950s and 1960s. Further restoration work was conducted on the main temple in 2006 and the south rotunda was restored between 2006 and 2009. Description Plan of the \\"Red Basilica\\" and the surrounding complex The temple was built in the lower city of Pergamon at the foot of the hill on which the ancient city's acropolis stood. It was located at the eastern end of what was originally an immense sacred precinct or temenos, 270 m long by 100 m wide (890 ft √ó 330 ft), which was surrounded by stone walls standing at least high. Most of the temenos was destroyed and built over long ago, but substantial fragments of the walls remain standing to a height of 13 m today. The main entrance lay on the western side of the temenos through a colossal marble gateway; smaller gateways were located on the same side, north and south of the main gate. From there, visitors walked some to an immense propylon (or monumental gateway) in front of the temple, supported by a row of columns standing high. The temenos was built on top of the River Selinus, presumably because the person who commissioned the complex wished it to be located in the city centre rather than in an outlying district. As the city was already substantially built up, the river bed offered an otherwise unused location for the temple complex and reduced the number of properties that would have to be demolished to make way for it. The river was channelled into two tunnels passing diagonally for a distance of about , northwest to southeast, under the temenos and temple. This structure, the Pergamon Bridge, still stands today and continues to drain the river underneath the complex. The temple The temple viewed from the north, also showing the north rotunda. The roof of the south rotunda can just be seen on the other side. Interior of the temple, showing the podium and (left) the base of the cult statue. Smaller statues of the gods would have stood in the side alcoves. The temple measures from east to west and from north to south. Its walls still survive up to a height of , though its roof and eastern wall no longer exist and much of the original interior was destroyed when it was converted into a Christian basilica. The building was originally a vast hall, rather than a basilica, covered by a wooden roof that had no interior support or colonnade. Its walls were built entirely of red bricks that gave the building its modern Turkish name (which means literally \\"Red Courtyard\\"). They were covered in marble in various colours, though this has entirely disappeared; some important structural parts were also constructed from marble. There appear to have been windows only in the western half of the main temple, meaning that the eastern half did not receive any natural light (unless there were windows in the eastern wall, which no longer stands). The building was entered from the west through an immense door measuring more than wide by at least high. Its door-sill is still in place and was made from a single piece of marble weighing over 30 tons. It seems, however, that the door was kept open continuously as there are no traces of the rollers that would have been necessary to open and close it. In front of the door stood an iron grating, which presumably had an opening in it to permit access to the interior of the temple. A total of twelve arched niches are embedded in the walls of the western end of the temple, five each lining the north and south walls and another two flanking the door on the west wall. They stand wide by high and presumably held statues of deities ‚Äì perhaps the twelve gods of the zodiac. In his novel Metamorphoses, the Roman writer Apuleius described a visit to the temple in which his protagonist \\"saw the gods infernal and the gods celestial, before whom I presented myself and worshipped.\\" Near the centre of the hall is a shallow basin, deep by long, in which three rectangular tubs stood, placed parallel to each other. It had no inflow pipe or drain. The eastern and western halves of the hall are divided by an alabaster-lined water channel, wide and deep, extending the full width of the temple. This did have a substantial inflow or outlet point, high by wide, which exited somewhere to the west in the direction of the river. The floor of the temple was constructed from plates of marble and granite imported from as far away as Egypt. The eastern end of the hall would have been closed to the public and could only be accessed by the temple priests and their attendants. It housed the cult statue, which stood on a base that stood in turn on a podium raised by above the temple floor. The statue was at least high, approaching the size of the great Statue of Zeus at Olympia, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. An entry-hole in the base indicates that priests could climb inside the body of the statue, perhaps to make it \\"speak\\" during ceremonies. At the far end of the temple were two massive towers, projecting some distance out from the eastern wall of the temenos. The original wall no longer exists but from the foundations it can be seen that it would have been in the shape of an inverted semicircle. During the Christian era it was demolished and replaced with an apsidal wall. Side courts and rotundas South rotunda and a surviving section of the south wall of the temenos. Holes for the beams of the stoa roof can still be seen in the temenos wall. Two rotundas topped by domes stand on either side of the main temple. Although they have been stripped of their original marble cladding, they are still substantially intact. Each stands high, with a diameter of , and had doors standing high. They were lit by an opening (an opaion or oculus) that was originally wide. The two rotundas had different fates in the modern era. The one on the south side, which is part of the Red Basilica archaeological site and is open to visitors, was re-used and modified in the Ottoman period, and in the 19th century became the machinery room for an olive oil factory. Its inside walls are still covered with black soot from the smoke produced by the machinery. The north rotunda is currently used as a mosque. The two rotundas stood within courtyards to the north and south of the main temple. They were surrounded on all sides by stoas measuring some deep, supported on the eastern side by atlantes and caryatids that each consisted of two figures standing back-to- back supporting the stoa roof. The figures were clearly intended to represent Egyptians, as they are depicted wearing Egyptian headgear. A pair of water basins was located in front of each rotunda, measuring long by wide and deep. These basins each had a smaller round basin of diameter at each end. Underground An underground complex lies below the temple and rotundas. Spiral ramps lead down from the rotundas to connect with a north-south passageway that links all three buildings. Branching passageways lead to secondary entrances in the temenos and to several pillared underground chambers ‚Äì two on the south side have been excavated and it is presumed that a corresponding pair of chambers exist under the mosque/rotunda on the north side. The passageways gave access to the hidden entrance to the cult statue and also to the side walls of the temple, linking to shafts that connected with the temple roof. The tunnels are all about high by between to wide. They appear to have been generally unadorned, but some pieces of coloured stucco are reported to be visible in one area ‚Äì perhaps the remainder of some kind of decoration. The chambers to which they link are substantial structures. Two are rectangular rooms on either side of the main temple, measuring by , high, supported by pillars arranged in a 3 x 3 pattern. The other two, situated on the far side of each rotunda, are significantly larger; they measure by with a 4 x 4 pattern of columns. The two excavated chambers beside the south rotunda are today used as storage space for the archaeological site. Use and purpose Atlantid wearing an Egyptian headdress ‚Äì an indication of the nature of the gods worshipped in the temple The temple was certainly used to worship Egyptian gods, as the presence of Egyptianised atlantids indicates. Which specific gods were worshipped there is, however, unclear. An inscription referring to the temple mentions \\"Serapis, Isis, Harpocrates, Osiris, Apis, Helios on a horse ... Ares and the Dioskouroi\\". Another inscription mentions Serapis, and a small terracotta head of Isis was discovered in the area of the temenos. One of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri from Egypt refers to Isis as ·Ω≤ŒΩ Œ†ŒµœÅŒ≥Œ¨Œº·ø≥ Œ¥ŒµœÉœÄœåœÑŒπœÇ (\\"she who rules in Pergamon\\"). The temple may well have been dedicated to Isis, though some historians have interpreted it as a Serapeum (temple of Serapis) instead. The two rotundas may have been used for the worship of Horus and Anubis. The layout of the temple provides more clues about how it was used. Unlike Greek temples, where the entire building was considered to be the house of the divinity, the god worshipped in the \\"Red Basilica\\" was confined to the eastern half of the temple. Similar layouts are found in other Isis and Serapis temples elsewhere in Asia Minor and Greece. The temenos is a vastly enlarged equivalent of enclosures found elsewhere in Greek mystery sanctuaries, such as the one as Eleusis in Greece where the Eleusinian Mysteries were performed annually. The purpose of its high walls was to prevent outsiders from witnessing ceremonies held within the temenos and temple precinct, thus preserving the mystery of the rituals. Water appears to have been a central theme of the ceremonies held at the temple, judging from the number of water features (basins, troughs and so on) in the complex. The basins outside the temple may have been purely decorative but those inside seem to have been intended for use in ceremonies. These may have included purification rituals ‚Äì sprinkling the faithful with water ‚Äì and possibly also a ritual re-enactment of the flooding of the Nile. Robert A. Wild suggests that the deep basin dividing the temple into its eastern and western halves may have been designed to convey flood- or rainwater into the temple during peak rainfall periods in the winter. The basin also served to separate the public western half of the temple from the sacred eastern half. Initiates may have been taken through the underground passages to the cultic area, where they would be presented to the worshippers filling the western end of the temple. Something of this nature is hinted at by Apuleius in Metamorphoses: \\"There in the middle of this sacred temple before the image of the goddess I was made to stand on a wooden pulpit.\\" References Bibliography     Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 2nd century Category:Ancient Roman buildings and structures in Turkey Category:Ancient Roman temples Category:Archaeological sites in the Aegean Region Category:Pergamon Category:Conversion of non-Christian religious buildings and structures into churches Category:Asia (Roman province) Category:Temples of Isis Category:2nd-century religious buildings and structures ","title":"Red Basilica"},{"id":"29861340","text":"82nd NBR Awards Best Film: The Social Network The 82nd National Board of Review Awards honored the best in film for 2010.

The nobles under whom the armies were assembled included Friburz (a noble warrior with his army), Gudarz (mentioned as a wise man in counsel together with his mighty sons on his right and left along with their armies) and Tus, who was given the responsibility by Kai Khosrow for leading the army with following instructions: Tus told Kai Khosrow that he would abide by the will of the king but after days of marching the armies came to a spot where the roads parted, one towards a harsh desert void water and food and other led to Kalat.

Listening to this, Firoud took to the hills with his men most likely thinking that the army was in Kelat for a battle. He informed his mother of the situation where he faced his own brother in the battle, she tells Firoud that there is a new Shah in Iran and he is your brother and instead of fighting he should join to avenge their father's death. She tells Firoud to seek out Bahram (mentioned as a friend of their father and son of Gudarz) in the opposing army and also take the advice of Tokhareh after which Firoud together with Tokhareh went to a higher place of a mountain from where he could see the opposing army in a clear view through which Tokhareh let know Firoud of the warriors according to his knowledge. Tus sees them on the hills and seems to have been angered by this act in reaction to which he tells Bahram if they are an army lash them two hundred times and if they are Turks or spies, blind them and bring them to him to be destroyed. When Bahram goes towards the mountain to check upon them, Firoud seems to have been angered towards the opposing army for thinking less of him. However, Tokhareh asks Firoud not to be angry and he does not know the name of the person but knows his father Gudarz and he is his son. As Bahram nears the heights, he asks the men of why they are watching to which Firoud tells him to not think of him any less, watch his tongue and answer his questions and Bahram listens. However, after getting to know that it is the Bahram his mother had talked about, he says that there is none among all the host of Iran that his eyes would rather look upon, Bahram recognizes Firoud's authority, pays homage, takes his offer of feast for the army and recognizes Firoud as from the race of Kaianides. Although Bharam had let Tus know of the situation and Firoud's offer to lead and march against Turan, Tus still seems to be angry, refuses to take Bahram's words, tells him that he would perish this young Turk and assembles the army. But Bahram interrupts and says the following: After listening to this the warriors went back in their tents but Tus's anger was not gone. On the request of his son in law Rivniz (mentioned as a knight of great cunning) he let him go after Firoud but was killed by him and after Tus called upon his son Zerasp to avenge Rivzin's blood but was killed by Firoud, sending Tus a message that he was a man not to be treated with dishonor. After this Tus's anger fueled even more and this time he goes after Firoud himself to which Tokhareh suggest not to fight or kill this man as he is known warrior (mentioned as a lion and crocodile) as his death may invite more revenge and fierce battle between the armies. But Firoud refuses and instead kills the horse by the suggestions of Tokhareh so that the message is sent with minimum consequences. This act angered the nobles of the opposing army even further and Firoud doubts their intelligence and remains confused by the hostile confrontation with his brother's army and doubts their intelligence to differentiate between good and evil. Gew (son of Gudarz) was sent against Firoud but he killed his horse too, after which Gew's son Byzun was sent whose horse was killed too and Firoud went in the castle and Byzun taunts his action for not keeping the fight. Tus is still angered, calls Firoud a Turk, wishes to avenge the blood that he had spilled. Now the day passed and darkness took over, Firoud strengthens the castle while his mother is concerned about him and had dream evil portent. Listening to his mother, Firoud says the following: Jarira and dying Farud As the morning arrived, the fighting resumed and Firoud led his warriors in the mountains where extreme battle took place and Firoud made havoc among his enemies and they beheld that Firoud was a lion in the fight. But the young Firoud was now rounded up by Rehham and Byzun but he fought on and was hit with a mighty club by Rehham from behind. Firoud could see his last minutes and returned to his mother who cries after seeing her son in his condition but Firoud tells her to keep her silence while he spoke his last words to his mother which are the following: The women did as commanded, except his mother. She sat beside him until he took his last breath then she burnt all his treasures, killed the horses and returning to her son's feet, she pierced her body with a sword. After breaking into the castle and seeing Firoud and his mother on the floor, the Iranians had tears in their eye and sorrowed for Tus's anger and feared Kai Khoswor's wrath. Gudarz soon regrets what had happened and tells Tus that he had been wrong and had caused death of a young Kaianide and his own sons.

It was torn down in order to make room for the Farmer School of Business, but has been recreated within a set of buildings called Heritage Commons. History Whitelaw Reid Reid Hall was named after Whitelaw Reid, a former Miami student from the class of 1856. Whitelaw later became a diplomat and a journalist. He also ran as vice- president of the United States with Benjamin Harrison in 1892. He died on December 15, 1912 and remained a loyal Miami Alumnus throughout his life. A Murder On May 9, 1959, two men began fighting within Reid Hall. The Resident Advisor, Roger Sayles, tried to stop the fight, but was accidentally shot in the process. The shooter then ran to Ogden Hall and took his own life just moments after the first death. Legend states that after Sayles was shot, he reached for a door leaving behind a bloody hand print. (Stories vary as to whether it was two hand prints or just one). Many students claimed that the hand prints refused to fade and were still visible on the wood. Other students claimed to hear men arguing loudly, but when they went to find the source of the arguers, no one was ever found.... Other Events On Easter Weekend in 1987, Reid Hall caught fire which led to $500,000 worth of damage As of December 10, 2004, Miami University announced that Reid Hall would be torn down in order to make room for the creation of a new building. According to an article in the Miami Student, Reid Hall destruction was suggested by current Miami President, James C. Garland. In response to this news, 607 people signed a petition led by 2004 Miami Grad, Katie Goodhew, in an attempt to save the beloved hall from destruction. The petition was passed along through the web with outlets such as e-mail and networking. Goodhew got the word out through a blanket e-mail to friends, the Residence Hall Association, National Residence Hall Honorary and current student leaders at Reid Hall. According to the article, only 50% of the petition signers actually lived in Reid Hall. Goodhew explained that it was because many students were upset to see the famous hall torn down. This article was written April 26, 2005. However, the board did not find the petition convincing and decided to build the Farmer School of Business in its place.

These periods of time, generally corresponding to the major Jewish holidays, are large blocks of calendar dates in which official studies are suspended and students typically leave the Yeshiva setting. These Bein Hazmanim blocks divide between the three major Yeshiva Zmanim (semesters) ‚Äì the Elul Zman, the Choref (winter) Zman, and the Kayitz (summer) Zman. (The Kayitz/Summer Zman is sometimes referred to as the Pesach Zman, particularly among yeshivos that end their semesters prior to, or at the very beginning of, the summer, rather than on Tisha B'Av.) The Yeshiva year typically begins on 1 Elul, this being Rosh Chodesh Elul. The first Zman runs for five and a half weeks until the end of Yom Kippur on 10 Tishrei. The month of Elul, the beginning of Tishrei, and the High Holy Days, all marked by focus on repentance, are followed by the extended, more joyous holiday of Sukkot at the end of Tishrei. The first major Bein Hazmanim period usually begins immediately following Yom Kippur, and runs at least until the end of Sukkot (22 Tishrei in Israel, 23 Tishrei in the Diaspora). Some Yeshivas extend Bein Hazmanim until the end of Tishrei. Choref Zman (winter semester) begins after Sukkot and is the longest Zman of the Yeshiva year. It spans the month of Cheshvan through the end of Adar, with only a few holidays in the middle (Hanukkah, Tu BiShvat, and Purim). This Zman traditionally ends early in the month Nissan, either on Rosh Chodesh Nissan or a few days later. Bein Hazmanim beginning at this juncture in the year spans most of Nissan, which includes the holiday of Passover in its entirety (15-21 Nissan (22 Nissan in the Diaspora)). After Passover, Yeshiva starts up again by the beginning of Iyar. Kayitz Zman, the summer semester, runs for just over three months, concluding with The Three Weeks. These three weeks of mourning culminate with Tisha B'Av and the end of Kayitz Zman. Between Tisha B‚ÄôAv and 1 Elul are around three weeks, which make up the final period of Bein Hazmanim in the Yeshiva year.  Bein Hazmanim Through the Ages  While the institution of Bein Hazmanim is recent relative to the long history of Jewish study, there are a few precedents in the Jewish canon for this concept.  Early Precursors  In the Mishnah and Talmud there are records of Friday and Sabbath being days off for Yeshiva students. Perhaps the earliest source of an extended Yeshiva vacation is Rava, who allowed his students at the Pumbedita Academy to take off the months of Nissan and Tishrei for the purposes of farming (although it is assumed that most students did not actually leave).Tractate Berakhot 35b During the Amoraic and Middle Ages, Yeshiva learning was largely confined to the Yeshiva itself. Jews lived in precarious situations, and during holidays the Yeshiva setting itself provided the most secure environment.Breuer, Mordechai. Oholei Torah (The Tents of Torah): The Yeshiva, Its Structure and History. Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar Center for Jewish History, 2003. Print. Chapter VI (‚ÄúTechniques of Learning and the Yeshiva Schedule‚Äù) pp. 279-280 There was a notion amongst the Tosafists of having two distinct Zmanim, one beginning on Rosh Chodesh Cheshvan and one beginning on Rosh Chodesh Iyar.Oholei Torah p. 282 But aside from this, Bein Hazmanim is altogether not mentioned in pre-Acharon Jewish texts.  Development  By the 16th century there is explicit mention of Bein Hazmanim. The Maharal (Judah Loew ben Bezalel) criticizes his students in one of his writings for wasting too much time during Bein Hazmanim.Maharal, Drosh Al HaTorah (Address on the Torah) 26a Contemporaries of the Maharal also felt that Bein Hazmanim was not conducive to expanding the thinking mind. Some rabbis during this era gave off small pockets of days, but never very much. There were rabbis who had to travel far away for medical attention, and they would give off Yeshiva days to accommodate this need.Oholei Torah pp. 281-282 As the value for recreation time spread during the modern era, Yeshivas followed suit and slowly began to tolerate such an idea. Lithuanian Yeshivas were known to begin the Zman with a ceremonial opening, in which all of the Yeshiva‚Äôs rabbis would gather to hear a Shiur Petichah (opening lecture) about the tractate to be studied that Zman. The endpoints for the Bein Hazmanim periods varied in the 16th and 17th centuries between Italy, Poland, and Germany.Oholei Torah pp. 282-284 By the 17th century, Yeshivas in Lithuania and Eastern Europe more or less practiced the contemporary model of Bein Hazmanim. As it became popular to spend Bein Hazmanim meeting women at fairs and having a good time with wanderlust and adventuring, the idea of Bein Hazmanim was permanently established.Oholei Torah pp. 283-284  Today  While it is similar in many ways to other Yeshivas, Yeshiva University‚Äôs undergraduate Torah studies program is unique, compared to the typical Yeshiva, with regard to Bein Hazmanim. In addition to vacation days on and around the major Jewish holidays (Passover and Sukkot) and in the summer, additional vacation time is given at Yeshiva University in between the first and second college semesters, as well as at the end of the academic year, which ends in May. Students at Yeshiva University often refer to these breaks, which coincide with college semester breaks, as ‚ÄúBein Hasemesterim‚Äù (lit. in between the semesters). Although there are no mandatory undergraduate Torah studies during these times, students are encouraged to partake in special Torah studies programs, such as ‚ÄúYeshivas Bein Hasemesterim‚Äù and ‚ÄúJune Zman.‚Äù In recent years there have been instances when Yeshivas cancelled Bein Hazmanim. During these occasions, students were encouraged to continue their daily schedule of intensive study despite the official onset of Bein Hazmanim. One such instance was in the summer of 2014 as Israeli soldiers invaded the Gaza Strip in Operation Protective Edge. Leading rabbis (especially in Haredi Yeshivas) felt that extra Torah study and prayer would fortify the soldiers‚Äô chances of a safe return from war.  Attitudes Toward Bein Hazmanim  Attitudes toward Bein Hazmanim vary between different Yeshivas and socio-religious circles. In many Hesder and Modern Orthodox American-program Yeshivas in Israel, Bein Hazmanim is seen as an opportunity to travel the Land of Israel. Often, students from these Yeshivas spend significant time hiking in regions such as the Galilee or the Negev. It is popular to do the ‚ÄúYam L‚ÄôYam‚Äù (lit. sea to sea) hike, from the Sea of Galilee to the Mediterranean Sea. Some students prefer less active forms of tourism, such as visiting museums or the beach. Many American Modern Orthodox Yeshiva students return from Israel to the Diaspora to visit family, particularly for the Passover-time Bein Hazmanim. While the Kayitz Zman technically lasts until Tisha B‚ÄôAv, many American Modern Orthodox Yeshiva students in Israel tend to leave Yeshiva a month and a half early to attend summer camp or learning programs in America or Israel. For Hareidi Yeshiva students in Israel and the Diaspora, Bein Hazmanim is also seen as an opportunity to travel and spend time with family at home. Dating is another popular activity for Hareidi Yeshiva students during Bein Hazmanim. Given the increased amount of free time, students often take time to meet prospective marriage candidates. Students from different religious affiliations sometimes spend their Bein Hazmanim pursuing their religious studies in a different setting, whether it be in Bein Hazmanim Yeshivas, in Kollels, or in learning camps. Many Hasidic Yeshivas simply relocate to more rural areas (such as Upstate New York); there, the fresh air provides a change of scenery, all the while allowing for an intensive learning schedule. There are other students who utilize the vacation time as an opportunity to earn some money, as the demanding Yeshiva schedule typically does not accommodate for other wage- earning occupations. During the Passover-time Bein Hazmanim, many students run small businesses cleaning automobiles and houses to help prepare for the holiday. During the Sukkot-time Bein Hazmanim, many offer themselves as Sukkah-builders, either for charge or as Chesed. Generally, students look forward to and enjoy Bein Hazmanim, as they see it as an opportunity to take a break from their intensive studying. Many rabbis feel strongly that Bein Hazmanim offers opportunities to grow spiritually in a different context; for example, spending time with parents or friends, working in a different setting, or traveling the Land of Israel. Others (students and rabbis alike) view Bein Hazmanim as an opportunity to study texts that are not typically studied during the typical Yeshiva setting, such as ‚Äúnon-Yeshivish‚Äù tractates of the Talmud or obscure s‚Äôfarim not in the average student‚Äôs prevue. Despite the view amongst rabbis that the break from learning is a positive ordeal, many warn their students before Bein Hazmanim of the dangers of involving themselves in inappropriate behavior and futile activities that could damage their spiritual persona. Lectures are delivered before every Bein Hazmanim to this effect in many Yeshivas, warning students to remain committed to prayer and studies at some level despite the lack of a Yeshiva framework. Other Rabbis have approached the idea of Bein Hazmanim more broadly, such as Rabbi David Stav in his (Hebrew) book ‚ÄúBein Hazmanim ‚Äì Culture and Recreation in Jewish Law and Thought‚Äù (Hebrew: ◊ë÷µ÷º◊ô◊ü ◊î÷∑◊ñ÷∞÷º◊û÷∑◊†÷¥÷º◊ô◊ù ‚Äì ◊™÷∑÷º◊®÷∞◊ë÷º◊ï÷º◊™ ◊ë÷¥÷º◊ú÷º◊ï÷º◊ô ◊ï÷º◊§÷∞◊†÷∑◊ê◊ô ◊ë÷∑÷º◊î÷≤◊ú÷∏◊õ÷∏◊î ◊ï÷º◊ë÷∑◊û÷∑÷º◊ó÷∞◊©÷∏◊Å◊ë÷∏◊î). He uses general terms and specific examples to address the concepts of leisure time, entertainment, and recreation from the prospective of Halakha and Hashkafa. Although he is considered to be more liberal than most Orthodox rabbis, partially due to some lenient conclusions found in this book, this work is nonetheless significant in that it directly addresses issues encountered by modern-day yeshiva students during their Bein Hazmanim (such as watching movies and going to the beach). Still, to some contemporary rabbis, the idea of a break from intensive Torah study is foreign altogether. It has been said that Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, considered by some to be the preeminent Modern Orthodox rabbi in twentieth century America, could not understand how students would not study religious texts during the summer months and the holiday periods with the same intensity as they would normally. To him, one is required to study Torah with the same intensity every day of the year, regardless of whether or not Yeshiva is in session.

His main centre of activity was the French capital, but he also worked for ten years in Russia and toured in Britain and Ireland.Martin J. Nos artistes ; portraits et biographies. Paul Ollendorff, Paris, 1895.  Life and career  Vizentini came from an Italian musical family active in the theatre, one of whom had established himself at the Com√©die-Italienne.F√©tis F-J. Biographie universelle des musiciens. Vol II, 639-640. Paris, 1878. As a child he appeared in various children‚Äôs roles at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on, making his debut on 31 December 1847 in Le Dernier Banquet, a revue by Camille Doucet. His father Augustin worked at the Vaudeville Theatre in Paris, then became stage manager in the last season of the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique.Walsh T J. Second Empire Opera: The Th√©√¢tre Lyrique Paris 1851‚Äì1870. John Calder (Publishers Ltd), London, 1981. He undertook musical studies at the Conservatoire in Brussels, under Leonard and F√©tis, achieving first prize in violin in 1860 and a first prize in composition in 1861. After briefly acting as assistant conductor at the theatre in Antwerp he returned to Paris. Vizentini joined the orchestra of the Th√©√¢tre des Bouffes-Parisiens then became leader of the orchestra at the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique from 1861‚Äì66, as well as appearing as a concert soloist. He began conducting at the Th√©√¢tre de la Porte-Saint-Martin and toured with another French operetta troupe to London, English provincial towns and Ireland, From 1865-1873 Vizentini wrote about the theatre and music for various journals, displaying a lively wit and solid knowledge. His articles appeared in Le Charivari, L'Entr'acte, the Grand Journal, Paris- Magazine, L'√âv√©nement illustr√©, L'√âclair, and he founded a short-lived theatrical bulletin Le T√©l√©graphe. Having started to work at the Th√©√¢tre de la Ga√Æt√©-Lyrique Vizentini took over from Offenbach there in 1875, where he acted as both music director and administrator. He started with a lavish premiere production on 26 October of Le voyage dans la lune by Offenbach.Noel E and Stoullig E. Les Annales du Th√©√¢tre et de la Musique, 1ere √©dition, 1875. G Charpentier et Cie, Paris, 1876. The following year he attempted to rekindle the spirit and repertoire of the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique, by bringing on more substantial operas. He had much support, in particular from composers, the press and public administration, and secured a subsidy towards the running costs. The major premiere was to be Dimitri by Victorin de Jonci√®res, an opera in 5 acts, for which Vizentini assembled a notable cast of singers, including Victor Capoul, Michot, Jacques Bouhy, L√©on Melchiss√©dec, Grivot and Heilbron. He next decided to mount a production of Paul et Virginie by Victor Mass√© which enjoyed a major success, followed by works such as Le Timbre d‚Äôargent, by Saint-Sa√´ns, Le Bravo by Salivaire, and L'Aum√¥nier du r√©giment by Hector Salomon. Nonetheless, in spite of artistic success and public sympathy the company closed after twenty months in early January 1878. Vizentini organised a massive music festival in December 1878 at the Paris Hippodrome with at least 15,000 spectators, where he shared the podium with contemporary composers conducting their own works.Irvine D. Massenet: a chronicle of his life and times. Amadeus Press, Portland, 1997. On 18 May 1879 Vizentini was part of the group gathered at Offenbach‚Äôs house for the first private performance of Les contes d'Hoffmann.Wolff S. Un demi-si√®cle d'Op√©ra-Comique (1900‚Äì1950). Andr√© Bonne, Paris, 1953. From 1879 to 1889 Vizentini was chief conductor and stage manager of the Imperial Theatres of St Petersburg, also conducting the Pavlovsk concerts. He premiered Richard III by Salvayre which was not a success, and arranged the music for the ballet The King's Command or The Pupils of Dupr√© in 1886. Back in France he became the administrator of the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s and the Th√©√¢tre des Folies-Dramatiques, then from September 1894 stage manager of the Th√©√¢tre du Gymnase. In 1897 Vizentini became director of the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Lyon, where he staged and conducted the first French performance of Wagner's Die Meistersinger.Frankenstein, Ludwig (1907). Richard Wagner ‚Äì Jahrbuch, p. 399. Berlin: Hermann Paetel. Later he was invited by Albert Carr√© (with whom he had worked at the Gymnase) to come to the Op√©ra-Comique as stage director, which he did from 1898. After a three-month illness he died before the start of the 1906-07 season.Carr√©‚Äôs oration quoted in Stoullig E. Les Annales du Th√©√¢tre et de la Musique, 32√®me √©dition, 1906. G Charpentier et Cie, Paris, 1907, p115-6.  Compositions  Vizentini composed four op√©rettes, La Tsigane (Folies-Marigny, 1865), Le Moulin t√©n√©breux (Bouffes-Parisiens, 1869) La Plantation Thomassin (Th√©√¢tre - Vichy, 1894) and La Gaudriole (Villa Les Fleurs - Aix-les-Bains, 1897). He also wrote two cantatas performed at the Vaudeville and the Porte-Saint- Martin, and music for several plays including Nos anc√™tres, Cadio, Patrie, Le Bossu, etc. He also published fantasies for violin and piano, a great ballet \\"Ordre du Roi\\", and a lot of song and dances.

A former journalist, freelance foreign correspondent and broadcaster, Rann is the managing director of Rann Communication, a public relations firm with clients and projects in many parts of the world. He is the brother of the former Premier of South Australia, Mike Rann. Career history Rann began his journalistic career as a cadet reporter with the Matamata County Mail, a small country newspaper in New Zealand. From 1969 - while based in Auckland - Rann became a successful freelance correspondent for major international media, including CBS News (USA), Daily Mirror (UK), the Macquarie News Network in Australia and the South African Morning Newspaper Group. During this time, he attended and reported on, among other things, the independence celebrations in Fiji and Tonga (both attended by members of the British Royal family) and the Wahine ferry disaster, near Wellington, which claimed 53 lives. Rann moved to Adelaide, South Australia, in 1972 where he was a senior reporter and sub editor with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1983, he started his own media relations company, Christopher Rann and Associates, now known as Rann Communication. Rann directed the public relations campaign to attract the $5 billion Collins submarine project to South Australia and subsequently promoted the launches of the six submarines built. He also managed the official opening of Olympic Dam, the world‚Äôs largest copper/uranium resource, at Roxby Downs in South Australia and, later, a major incident at the mine site involving a leaking tailings dam. As well, he coordinated the South Australian government public relations campaign to attract the 1998 Commonwealth Games to Adelaide (Adelaide was runner-up to Kuala Lumpur).

Although they are often found in insects, peritrophic matrixes are found in seven different phyla. The peritrophic matrix serves several functions, including improvement of digestion, protection against mechanical and chemical damage and serving as a barrier to infection by pathogens. Chemical composition and structure The peritrophic matrix is composed of regularly arranged chitin microfibrils, (3‚Äì13% of matrix mass), and species specific proteins (20‚Äì55%) embedded in a proteoglycan matrix. The peritrophic matrix also includes very small pores which allow for passage of small molecules into and out of the matrix. Thus, due to size limitations (pores reach a maximum size of 10 nm) larger, unwanted materials taken in while feeding are trapped and excreted along with the matrix. Formation Type I Type I formation of a peritrophic matrix is thought to be the ancestral method, and is found in the majority of organisms that produce a peritrophic matrix. In type I formation, the peritrophic matrix is secreted by the entire midgut, and is formed simply by delamination from the surface of the midgut epithelium. Type I formation usually occurs as a response to feeding, but can also be produced continually. When formed in response to feeding, a single matrix is secreted by the midgut epithelium. This matrix surrounds the food bolus and is later excreted along with unwanted materials present in the food bolus after digestion. When formed continually, as in the insect family Acrididae (locusts), multiple peritrophic matrixes are secreted and surround the food bolus, creating a peritrophic envelope. When no food bolus is present, peritrophic matrixes that are secreted are rapidly passed in excrement. Type II Type II formation of a peritrophic matrix is considered to be a derived technique, and is found only in some families of the diptera, dermaptera, embioptera and lepidoptera orders of insects. In type II formation, the peritrophic matrix is produced by a specialized group of cells present on the proventriculus of the anterior midgut. Type II formation is a continuous process which is carried out regardless of the presence or absence of a food bolus. Thus, the peritrophic matrix is secreted as an unbroken, concentric, ‚Äúsleeve like‚Äù structure. Although the peritrophic matrix is secreted continually, the presence of a food bolus significantly increases the rate of production. In addition, the presence of a food bolus stimulates the production of multiple matrices which surround the bolus. Following the secretion of a primary peritrophic matrix, subsequent matrices are secreted underneath the first matrix to create a layered peritrophic envelope. Function Improve digestion In many organisms the primary function of the peritrophic matrix is to improve digestion. Following feeding, the food bolus is surrounded by the peritrophic matrix, effectively isolating it from the midgut epithelium. This isolation creates two distinct compartments within the midgut, the endoperitrophic space and ectoperitrophic space. This compartmentalization of the midgut provides three general advantages: prevention of non-specific binding of undigested material to the epithelium wall, conservation and concentration of enzymes and substrates and rapid removal of indigestible molecules. Prevention of non-specific binding is particularly important, as it increases the efficiency of the absorption process by filtering out undigested material which would otherwise block access to the midgut epithelium. Due to the small pore size of the matrix, only small molecules which have been broken down by enzymes or can already be effectively absorbed come in contact with the midgut epithelium. The remaining materials, undigested food and unwanted molecules, are kept within the matrix until they can be broken down by enzymes or excreted. Concentrating enzymes and food substrate within the endoperitrophic space significantly decreases the time required for digestion in the midgut. In addition, since enzymes are small enough to easily move into and out of the peritrophic matrix, they are rarely lost when the matrix, along with its contents still in the endoperitrophic space, is excreted. A counterflow of fluid in the ecoperitrophic space also helps recycle enzymes, thus maximizing their efficacy. The presence of a peritrophic matrix significantly simplifies the excretion process. Rather than having to continually sift through a mixture of digestible and unwanted molecules, digestible molecules are quickly broken down by enzymes, removed from the matrix and absorbed. Once the digestive process is completed, unwanted molecules are kept confined within the endoperitrophic space and excreted along with the matrix. Mechanical protection Although the peritrophic matrix is a very thin layer of compounds (type I matrixes reach a maximum thickness of 20 ¬µm, type II matrixes reach a maximum thickness of 2 ¬µm), it can withstand mechanical pressure strains up to 500 mmH2O. This capacity to expand prevents the food bolus from rupturing the delicate epithelial layer while assisting the passage of food through the gut. Chemical protection Much like indigestible molecules present in the food bolus, many toxins are too large to pass through the small pores of the peritrophic matrix. For example, some insects that are resistant to the insecticide DDT shed large amounts of the toxin in the peritrophic matrix. In addition, some smaller toxins bind with specific surface proteins present in the peritrophic matrix. This binding is particularly important for blood-feeding insects. Heme groups, which are components of hemoglobin, an oxygen carrying protein present in vertebrate blood, act as strong oxidizers in insects. Although this oxidizing agent is safe in vertebrates, it is very damaging to insects. However, heme groups ingested in a blood meal bind to proteins on the peritrophic matrix, enabling insects to safely feed on blood. Infection barrier Organisms that take in food often infected with pathogens, such as blood-feeding insects, also depend on the peritrophic matrix to filter out the disease agents, which are often too large to fit through the matrix pores. This benefit in particular is thought to be an important driving force in the evolution of peritrophic matrices, as many insects feeding on foods with low pathogen levels lack the ability to produce a peritrophic matrix. This trend is highlighted by mosquitoes, as blood-feeding female mosquitoes produce a peritrophic matrix while nectar-feeding males do not. A significant trend can also be observed in the type of peritrophic matrix produced by blood-feeding insects that are capable of transmitting disease. The majority of blood-feeding insects that are good disease vectors produce a type I matrix. In comparison, blood-feeding insects that produce a type II matrix, which provides a more impenetrable barrier to pathogens, are rarely disease vectors. Pathogen interference of the peritrophic matrix Many pathogens are too large to fit through the small pores of the peritrophic matrix, and thus have evolved specialized mechanisms of evading being filtered out by the matrix. Since type I peritrophic matrixes are secreted in response to the presence of a food bolus in the midgut, some pathogens simply invade the epithelial cells before the matrix is excreted. Many helminth microfilaria and arboviruses (arthropod borne viruses) are transmitted to the mosquito in their infective form and are able to immediately invade mosquito tissue. However, other pathogens such as the malaria protozoan must first develop into an infective stage within the midgut before invading other tissues. These pathogens secrete chitinase and proteinase enzymes which dissolve the chitin microfibrils and proteins present in the peritrophic matrix. These enzymes open large holes in the membrane, allowing the pathogen to infect the epithelium and other tissues in the insect.

The half-hour programme saw investigative journalist Andrew Jennings look into allegations of corruption with FIFA, the world's governing body of association football. Within the programme, he alleged that three members of FIFA's executive committee had been given bribes by International Sports and Leisure, a marketing partner of FIFA. The three men Nicolas Leoz, Issa Hayatou, and Ricardo Teixeira were reportedly involved with a sports marketing firm responsible for broadcasting rights and took money from them. Jennings further alleged that a fourth current official has been involved in ticket touting. Both of these matters had not been properly investigated by Sepp Blatter, the President of FIFA. It also made a series of claims about the bidding process for hosting the FIFA World Cup. Hayatou, who is the vice-president of FIFA, denied all accusations of involvement in the scheme and claimed money was in fact paid to the Confederation of African Football (CAF). He threatened to sue the BBC for the making of the documentary. The documentary was broadcast only three days before the result of the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups were announced. This led to fears from some people that it could ruin England's chances of hosting the former tournament, with some accusing the BBC of being unpatriotic; however, the BBC defended these claims. Russia ultimately won the right to host the FIFA World Cup in 2018, with Qatar emerging victorious for the 2022 tournament.

After being drafted from the Norwood Football Club, he made his Australian Football League debut for Gold Coast in 2011 and played 22 games in his five seasons with the Suns, before being delisted and subsequently signed by Carlton, where he played four games in 2016. Gorringe appeared in Channel 7's Big Brother Australia 2020 reboot where he made the final top 3 in the competition. Early life Gorringe was born and raised in Adelaide, South Australia where he attended Torrens Valley Christian School throughout his upbringing. He began playing Australian rules football for the Tea Tree Gully Football Club at the age of 13 and later switched to the Norwood Football Club to play top level SANFL football. He played for Norwood's senior side for most of his 2010 season and averaged 21 hit-outs per game for the South Australian state team in the 2010 AFL Under 18 Championships. As a result, he was named as the starting ruckman in the 2010 Under-18 All-Australian team. He was also invited to participate in the 2010 AFL draft combine where he ranked first in physical testing amongst other ruck draft prospects in his age group. A month later, would draft Gorringe with pick 10 in the 2010 national draft. AFL career Gold Coast (2011-2015) Gorringe made his AFL debut against the Western Bulldogs at Etihad Stadium in round 3, 2011 where he managed a goal and took a spectacular mark that was not awarded by the umpires. Two weeks later he played in Gold Coast's historic first ever AFL win by three points against Port Adelaide at AAMI Stadium. He faced numerous injuries to his ankle and hamstring in 2011 and only managed to play seven games in his first AFL season. His injury problems continued in 2012 when he injured his achilles, which took him out for almost the whole season. In 2013 he managed to play nine AFL games for Gold Coast as a useful ruckman and key forward which earned him a two-year contract extension to the end of 2015. In 2014 Gorringe suffered another achilles injury which kept him on the sidelines for most of the season. Late in 2014 he recovered to play three AFL games, but a knee injury ended his season prematurely. At the conclusion of the 2014 season Gorringe attempted to secure a trade to , but when ruckman Patrick Ryder became available to Port Adelaide he was left to finish out his contract at Gold Coast. Gorringe later revealed his decision to give everyone at the Suns \\"an absolute serve on the way out\\" when it appeared he had secured a trade to Port Adelaide and had to apologise to the staff at the club when the trade fell through and he returned for their 2015 season. Injuries continued to wreak havoc on his career in 2015 and poor form meant he was only able to play two AFL games. Towards the end of the season his form for Gold Coast's reserves team started to improve and he explored his options to move to another club. He was delisted by the Gold Coast in October 2015 and in November, he was recruited by as a delisted free agent. Carlton (2016-2017) Gorringe got his first opportunity to play an AFL game for when Carlton's primary ruckman Matthew Kreuzer was injured. He played his first game for Carlton against , matching up against one of the AFL's best ruckmen in Todd Goldstein. He was dominated by Goldstein throughout the match with the hitout discrepancy totalling 38 and Carlton losing the affair by 67 points. He played three more AFL games before a hip injury ended his season. He faced yet another setback in the 2017 pre-season when he re-injured his achilles. At the conclusion of the 2017 season, Gorringe decided to retire from football, having played just 26 games across seven seasons as an AFL player.

Drafted by the Richmond Football Club with the sixth overall pick in the 2010 AFL National Draft, Conca played 104 games across eight seasons with the club before moving to Fremantle as a free agent ahead of the 2019 season. Early life and junior football Conca was born to parents Loui and Gina, with an older brother named Luke and a twin sister named Cassie. He spent his formative years in Victoria Park, Western Australia, a suburb three kilometres south-east of Perth. As a junior, Conca was a talented soccer player but did not start playing competitive Australian rules football with the local Victoria Park side until the age of 13. He was quick to learn however, playing above his age group within his first year of picking up the sport. By the time he turned 16 he had already twice represented his state at national level and made his debut for the local representative Perth Football Club's WAFL colts side. He attended high school at Perth's Trinity College and graduated in 2009 after captaining the school's senior football side. Conca then began studying a university degree in commerce and psychology while in his final year of junior football eligibility in 2010. That year he made a role change, from half-back to inside midfielder. He ceased playing for his school and local club that year, instead focusing on playing state team matches and with the Perth WAFL colts side. He was impressive throughout that year including recording multiple 30 possession games in the colts side. As a result, he earned a senior WAFL debut with Perth at age 17 where he showed off his good ball use, strong evasive skills and his ability to win high possessions numbers. At the 2010 AFL Under 18 Championships he again represented Western Australia and was this time the team's vice captain. Through the tournament Conca average 18 disposals per game at an efficiency of 79 per cent. During this final year of junior football he suffered a broken left fibula but managed to play a mostly full season despite it. AFL recruitment In November 2010 Conca was predicted by the Herald Sun's Jay Clark to be selected by with the 21st overall selection in the forthcoming draft. He was at the same time compared to former player Tyson Edwards and praised for his speed, creativity and midfield versatility. Conca was also noted for his abilities as a roaming defender along with his ability to handball cleanly in congestion. In the days leading into the draft Conca and his management expected he would be selected by with the 16th pick. Meanwhile, the Herald Sun adjusted their predication and had him to be selected sixth overall by , a prediction matched by Emma Quayle of The Age. On the afternoon of the draft Richmond's club website published an article seemingly confirming they planned to draft Conca with their first selection. AFL career Richmond (2011-2018) 2011 season Conca was drafted by with the club's first pick and the sixth selection overall in the 2010 AFL national draft. He had a limited start to professional training, hampered by the continuing complications as a result of the broken fibula he suffered the year previous. One of six first round draft selections on the Richmond list in 2011, Conca came to the club with significant expectations despite the injury affected pre-season. He lived up to them early, making his AFL debut with a 15 disposal performance in round 1 of the 2011 season in match against at the MCG. To mid-May Conca had played in each of Richmond's seven matches and did so to a level that club officials described as comparable to the debut season of teammate and future Brownlow Medalist Dustin Martin. In round 9 he received a nomination for the 2011 AFL Rising Star award for a \\"stellar performance\\" against in which he recorded 23 disposals and an equal game-high eight marks.\\" To that point he carried averages of 18.9 disposals, five marks and 2.2 tackles per game. Conca remained in the side for a further four matches but saw his output reduced before being left out of the side to face Carlton in round 15. He returned after just one week however, playing in rounds 16 through 18 before missing another single match in round 19. Conca returned in round 20 to play just one more match at senior level that year. He finished 2011 having played 17 matches and held averages of 15.6 disposals, four marks and 1.8 tackles per game. Conca was awarded the Cosgrove-Jenkins award at season's end as the club's best first year player. 2012 season A second limited pre-season awaited Conca in 2012, sidelined by groin soreness and hip arthroscopic surgery. He was fully fit for pre-season matches however, and in the NAB Cup opener, Conca was involved in a collision where he appeared to purposely block the path of unsuspecting 's defender Leigh Adams. The AFL's Match Review Panel considered the high hit unintentional despite it occurring behind the play and graded it as reckless contact with high contact and high impact. The classification drew 425 demerit points and four-match suspension though an guilty plea entered by Conca reduced this suspension to three-matches. Due to rules in force that season but removed the year after, Conca was permitted to serve that three match suspension of the remainder of the pre-season competition, leaving him free to play in round 1 of the home and away season. That he did, returning to the club's best 22 in round 1 before turning in an impressive round 2 performance with 21 disposals and his first goal of his career in his 19th match. He doubled that mark in round 3, kicking two goals and recording a career-best 29 disposals in a round 3 win over . Conca kicked goals again in rounds 6 and 7 before entering the bye in round 13 having played in all 12 of Richmond's AFL matches and holding averages of 18.5 disposals, 4.3 marks and 2.9 tackles per game. He missed his first match of the season in round 14 immediately following the bye before returning with 23 disposals against Melbourne in round 15. Two weeks later he was one of 11 Richmond players fined for participating in a melee during a tight loss to North Melbourne. Conca was impressive in round 19 when he matched his career-best 29 disposals and added seven marks, a performance that earned him his first Brownlow Medal vote of his career. He remained in the team for just one game though, fracturing the third metatarsal in his right foot while playing against the in round 20. It would prove his last match at AFL level that season, finishing the year having played 18 matches and averaging 19.4 disposals, 4.1 marks and 3.2 tackles per game. He also placed 15th in the club's best and fairest count. 2013 season Conca evades a tackle in round 2 of the 2017 season The lead up to the 2013 season was hampered by the continuing effects of the foot injury suffered the year previous, with the fracture failing to heal properly and Conca developing Achilles soreness as a result that saw him spend 10 weeks in a stabilising moon boot. He returned to fitness before the season began, and the year saw Conca make his biggest scoreboard impact of his career, a feat that started with a goal in round 1's win over Carlton. He repeated the effort in round 2, this time along with 25 disposals. After four consecutive matches at AFL level Conca suffered a stress reaction in his right foot, the recovery from which would see him miss an expected four weeks of football. While he was considered a chance to return in late May, Conca was not declared fully fit until mid-June He made his eventual return in round 12, after seven weeks on the sidelines. Following that match it was noted by a club website contributor that Conca was particularly energetic in celebrating goals with his teammates, going so far as to embrace them with a full-body hug. The celebration, coined the Conca Cuddle, soon became a signature of Conca's. He remained in the side for the following nine-weeks before playing a starring role with 21 disposals and a career-high three-goals in a round 20 win over the . Conca repeated the effort two weeks later in his 50th career match, kicking three-goals to go with 28 disposals and seven marks in a 121-point demolition of . In September Conca played in the first final of his career, and the club's first in 12 years. It was not a joyous occasion however, with Conca tearing his hamstring and being substituted from the ground within the first 12 minutes of the opening quarter while his team went on to be eliminated from the finals off the back of the 20-point loss. He underwent surgery in the days the followed and was expected to recover in time for a return to full training by mid- December. Notably Richmond's fitness staff said the injury's severity had been a surprise given Conca had never previously had hamstring troubles. At the same time he had a small bone removed from his right heel, the problematic os trigonum bone that very few people are born with. Conca finished the year having played 17 matches, kicked a career-best 12 goals and placed 17th in the club's best and fairest count. In the trade period that followed he was the target of offers from rival clubs including a lure to return home to Western Australia. Fox Footy commentator David King at this time labelled him a must- keep player for Richmond, comparing Conca's playing style to that of former Brownlow Medallist Jimmy Bartel and predicting Conca would soon be behind only captain Trent Cotchin as Richmond's best midfielder. Reports suggested had offered a four-year deal, while attempted to trump Richmond's offer with a two-year deal worth around $400,000 per season. Conca ultimately re-signed with Richmond, accepting a three-year deal and announcing it was \\"never in doubt\\" that he would opt to remain with the club. 2014 season In the early part of 2014 Conca was restricted to running drills, the result of his hamstring tear suffered in the previous year's finals series. Conca returned to full training in early February but missed the first of the club's pre- season matches two weeks later. He returned in a pre-season match later that month, playing an \\"outstanding\\" first half with 16 disposals and five clearances before being rested for the remainder of the match. That strong showing saw him make an immediate return in time for the home and away season's round 1. Conca equaled a then-career-best with eight tackles in that match before breaking it with 10 more in round 3. He went one better in round 6, laying 11 tackles in a loss to at the MCG. After seven rounds Conca led the club in pressure acts record and in total tackles (50). He played a further three matches at AFL level before missing rounds 12 and 13. From round 14 he played six consecutive matches including in a round 19 match with . There he caused significant controversy when he struck Giants midfielder Devon Smith with an unseen off-the-ball elbow to the back of the head after the pair had been engaged in a minor scuffle during the second quarter of that match. The AFL's independent Match Review Panel handed Conca a two-match ban for the act, a response that drew significant criticism including from AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan who said the case should have gone straight to the AFL Tribunal. Conca made an immediate return following the suspension, playing in the last two of nine consecutive wins to close out the season and win his side through to an elimination final match-up with . Conca kicked the side's first goal in that match and contributed a team-high inside 50s but it was not enough to avoid a 57-point eliminating loss. He finished the year having recorded a career-best 96 tackles, the most of any player at the club that season. 2015 season Conca trained at full capacity in the early part of the pre-season, entering the 2015 calendar year fully fit. This luck would not last however, with a fresh injury requiring him to undergo minor knee surgery in January. He would make his recovery in time to play a pre-season match against Port Adelaide in early March before suffering a hamstring injury not a long after that. Conca resumed training by mid-April and returned to competitive matches through the VFL in early May where he recorded 19 disposals with the club's reserves side. He suffered a re-occurrence after just three matches back though and spent another six weeks on the sidelines before returning to VFL football in mid-July. Strong form at that level saw him selected to play his first AFL match of the season in round 18 against . He remained in the side for one more week before yet another hamstring injury saw him sidelined again. It would not proved his last AFL match of the year however, instead re-called as a shock selection to face in an elimination final in what coach Damien Hardwick labelled \\"a calculated risk\\". He came on as the substitute player midway into the third quarter and kicked an immediate goal. Despite his efforts Richmond would go out in an elimination final loss for the third straight year. Conca finished the year having played just three AFL matches. 2016 season In the lead up to the 2016 season Conca completed the first full pre-season training program of his career. He made a role change from midfield to half-back as well, and played this role during the club's pre-season matches. In the final match of that series Conca suffered yet another serious hamstring injury, a significant tear high up near the tendon that would require surgery and at least two months of recovery. During his recovery he began a muscle-strengthening pilates program which he later credited as key factor in his return to fitness. He missed 11 AFL matches as a result of the injury, making his return to football in round 12's match-up with at the MCG. Conca played four consecutive matches before missing one in round 17 and returning for two more games in round 18 and 19. A minor hamstring injury sustained in that round 19 match sidelined him for the following week's match. Conca made his return to football through the VFL in mid-August but did not play another match at AFL level that season, having played in six total for the year. By early September news reports emerged suggesting Conca and the club had agreed to mutually part ways in the forthcoming trade period. Efforts were made to shop Conca to other clubs, including a deal for ruck Toby Nankervis that was rejected by the Swans. Significant upheaval of the football department under newly appointed football director Neil Balme in October though saw the club change its tact, with Conca signing a new two-year contract to stay at Richmond by the end of the trade period. 2017 season Conca with Richmond's VFL side in August 2017 Conca returned to contention for AFL selection by the start of the 2017 JLT Community Series, playing in all three pre-season matches including gathering 24 disposals and being named among Richmond's best in the final match of the series against Collingwood. During that series he was one of a number of \\"middle tier\\" players singled out by coach Damien Hardwick whose improvement would be keys to the team's performance in 2017. Conca earned AFL selection in round 1, tasked with a rebounding half-back role. He performed strongly in the first two weeks of the season before turning in an exceptional match against where he recorded four rebound 50s, four intercepts and six marks along with 25 disposals, his first such haul in nearly three years. In round 6 Conca suffered what appeared to be an ankle injury in the first quarter of the match against , before returning to close out the remainder of the contest. A diagnosis in the days that followed classed the injury as relatively minor damage to the Lisfranc joint in his foot, but that it would still require an expected recovery time of three-to-six weeks. After two weeks in a moon boot to stabilise the joint, further scans revealed the injury to be much more severe than first thought. In all his recovery would take more than three months, with a return coming via the VFL in late August. Conca would not manage to break into the AFL team before their premiership run, but did feature in each of the VFL side's three finals victories as well as in their losing grand final against Port Melbourne. In the trade period that followed he was once again the subject of trade speculation, linked to a possible move to with some media reports suggesting he was on the verge of requesting a trade despite having a year to run on his contract at Richmond. These reports were ultimately unfounded, with Conca remaining at Richmond at the trade period's end. He finished the year having played just six AFL matches and bringing his three-year total to just 15 of a possible 70 appearances at senior level. 2018 season Conca completed a full pre-season training regime in the lead-in to the 2018 season and underwent a positional change during that time, moving into a predominately midfield role after playing at half-back in previous years. He played for the first time that year with the club's contingent sent to the AFLX exhibition tournament in Sydney in mid- February. That was followed with selection in each of the club's two pre- season matches before officially re-joining the club's best-22 with selection for round 1's season opening match against . In the first two months of the season he played in all eight of the club's AFL matches, his first such consecutive streak since the 2013 season. While Conca spent the early part of that stretch covering for the suspended Nathan Broad in defense, he was later moved to a midfield role that saw him regularly attending centre bounces while playing as an inside defensive midfielder. At the mid-season bye Conca had played in all 13 senior matches so far that year and led the club in tackles (72) and ranked top-five for disposals, contested possessions and centre clearances. In round 15 and immediately following the bye, Conca lined up in his 100th AFL match. It was not to be a happy occasion however, with Conca suffering a horrific dislocation of his left ankle when twisted in a tackle by forwards Lance Franklin and Tom McCartin. On initial appearances it had seemed that that injury was a lower leg fracture that would require 12 months of rehabilitation. Remarkably, scans conducted the following day revealed he had suffered no structural damage to the bones or joints surrounding the ankle. The dislocation was corrected without surgery and Conca spent less than two weeks in a stabilising moon boot before returning to aerobic conditioning training. By late-June he had resumed running without the help of an anti- gravity treadmill and by the first week of August he had begun participating in full training. Conca made his return to match-play with the club's reserves side in the VFL in mid-August. There he suffered a rolled ankle on the opposite foot to the existing injury, the result of which saw him leave the game early. The injury did not prove serious however, with Conca considered back to full fitness in time to be recalled to AFL football the following week. He recorded 21 disposals, including 18 by three-quarter time, in that round 22 win over . Conca held his spot the next week and helped the club seal its position as ladder leaders at the end of the home and away season.. He played a contributing role with 17 disposals and six tackles in the club's qualifying final win over and followed it with 18 disposals and five tackles in the shock knock-out preliminary final loss to . Conca finished the season having played 18 matches and placed third at the club for total tackles recorded that season. Conca headed into the 2018 trade period as an unrestricted free agent after previously putting contract talks with Richmond on hold until the end of the season. Media reports had again suggested Fremantle were interested in acquiring him, as they had been in 2013, 2016 and 2017. Conca's manager confirmed that he had attracted an offer from Fremantle but that negotiations with Richmond were ongoing. Two days before the beginning of the 2018 free agency period, The Australian reported that Conca was set to forgo a two-year deal at Richmond to sign a longer term free agency contract with Fremantle. Fremantle (2019-present) On the opening day of the 2018 free agency period, Conca accepted a three-year contract offer from Fremantle to move to the club as an unrestricted free agent. When Fremantle's leadership group was announced ahead of the 2019 season, Conca was a surprise addition to the group, having been voted into the group by his new teammates. Across the 11 games prior to Fremantle's mid-season bye, Conca averaged 20.5 disposals per game, his highest return from all his previous seasons.

Barahiya, begusarai,jahanabad, ghazipur etc are there famous cities where they are living with peace. Bhumihars are mainly landlord and richest caste in the world. They also known as babhan. Origin The Muslim Bhumihar are converted from the Hindu Bhumihar caste. They are said to have been converted to Islam during the period of Lodhi rule over Ghazipur District. Other traditions refer to the conversion having taken place during the rule of Sher Shah Suri. The Muslim Bhumihar belong entirely to a single clan, the Kinwar, who claim to have come from Karnataka in the distant past. They now occupy a compact territory between near the town of Bara, between the Ganges river and the Bihar state border. Present circumstances The community has much in common with the neighbouring Khanzadas, with whom they intermarry. Unlike Hindu Bhumihars, the Muslim Bhumihar do not practice clan exogamy, and marry close kin. There are, however, still cases of village exogamy.

Reel Injun is illustrated with excerpts from classic and contemporary portrayals of Native people in Hollywood movies and interviews with filmmakers, actors and film historians, while director Diamond travels across the United States to visit iconic locations in motion picture as well as American Indian history. Reel Injun explores the various stereotypes about Natives in film, from the noble savage to the drunken Indian. It profiles such figures as Iron Eyes Cody, an Italian American who reinvented himself as a Native American on screen. The film also explores Hollywood's practice of using Italian Americans and American Jews to portray Indians in the movies and reveals how some Native American actors made jokes in their native tongue on screen when the director thought they were simply speaking gibberish. Conception The film was inspired, in part, by Diamond's own experiences as a child in Waskaganish, Quebec, where he and other Native children would play cowboys and Indians after local screenings of Westerns in their remote community. Diamond remembers that although the children were Indians, they all wanted to be cowboys. When Diamond was older, he would be questioned by non-Native people about whether his people lived in teepees and rode horses, causing him to realize that their preconceptions about Native people were also derived from movies. Interviews Interview subjects include Sacheen Littlefeather, Zacharias Kunuk, Clint Eastwood, Adam Beach, Jim Jarmusch, Robbie Robertson, Russell Means, Wes Studi, and scholars Angela Aleiss and Melinda Micco, and film critic Jesse Wente.CBC Documentaries, \\"Reel Injun: On the Trail of the Hollywood Indian\\" at http://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/passionateeyeshowcase/2010/reelinjun/ Locations The documentary is partly structured as a road movie, with Diamond visiting locations across the United States as well as the Canadian North. In the U.S., he is traveling by \\"rez car,\\" a broken down automobile often used on Indian Reservations, as demonstrated in Reel Injun with a sequence from the film Smoke Signals. Locations visited include the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wounded Knee, the Crow Agency in Montana as well as Monument Valley. Release In Canada, the film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2009, followed by screenings at the ImagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival. Reel Injun began a limited release at theaters in Toronto and Vancouver; it debuted on television on CBC News Network's The Passionate Eye series on March 28, 2010. Reel Injun had its local Montreal premiere at the International Festival of Films on Art, followed by a commercial run at the Cinema du Parc. In the United States, the film premiered at the SXSW festival in March 2009. It aired on November 2, 2010 on the PBS series Independent Lens. It was screened at the Museum of Modern Art from June 14 to 20, 2010. Awards Reel Injun received three awards at the 2010 Gemini Awards: the Canada Award for best multicultural program, Best Direction in a Documentary Program and Elizabeth Klinck and Laura Blaney won for Best Visual Research.

In this documentary, silent film historian David Kiehn explains that, during the era of silent films, there was a great number of \\"Native American people directing and acting in films, and they were bringing their viewpoints to the table too. And those were being listened to.\\" But then, according to this documentary, \\"In the 1930s, [the Hollywood portrayal of] the Indian was transformed into a brutal savage.\\" Film historian Angela Aleiss explains that \\"There were a number of films that came out in the early 1930s that followed in the steps of The Silent Enemy, and the Indians were the stars of these movies, but... they just bombed at the box office. Americans [were] not that interested in them.\\" The documentary asserts that \\"America, struggling through the Great Depression, [needed] a new brand of hero.\\" Movies like Stagecoach, which pitted cowboys against Indians and portrayed Native Americans as \\"vicious and bloodthirsty,\\" became the Hollywood image of Indians until the 1970s.

Seven of the fatalities were Canadian; 88 Canadians were staying in the hotel at the time on a holiday shopping trip. The fire was considered notable enough by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and The Center for Fire Research to document the fire in their 1979 publications. In the end, 10 people were killed and 34 injured. In 2008, the NFPA listed the 1978 Holiday Inn Fire as one of only three dozen or so fires which killed 10 or more people in the United States between 1934 and 2006. Fire The building was built in 1963 at a cost of $1.3 million and consisted of a wood frame structure with interior hallways and 91 rooms. The building had passed a fire inspection earlier in the month. The fire started on the first floor between the north and west wings of the hotel around 2:30 am. Cleaning supplies and paper products were stored in a closet near the fire's point of origin. Due to fire doors being left opened and the nearby combustible materials, the fire spread very rapidly. The fire alarm system was not tied to a dispatch center and although some people reported a bell ringing, they failed to realize it was the emergency alarm bell. The fire was not reported to the fire department until 2:38 am when an off duty firefighter passing by reported it. The fire burned out of control for more than two hours. One hundred and twenty-five firefighters from six area fire companies responded. About 170 people were rescued from the building by firefighters and passers-by.Spotting the Flames The fire was declared under control at 4:34 a.m. with an ultimate toll of 10 dead‚Äîeight women and two men‚Äîand 34 injured. Investigators said the fire broke windows in the hallways connecting the motel's two wings. Flames shot up to the roofs of both wings and swept through an open area between the room's ceilings and roofs. Firewalls in the buildings did not extend to the roof, allowing the fire to rip through the top floor of each wing. The burning roof had collapsed into the top floor rooms.The Aftermath in the Ashes Investigation Initially, the police did not consider the fire suspicious. Questions arose about whether or not the fire alarms could be heard in the lobby of the hotel when firefighters arrived. While hotel officials said the alarms were functioning, firefighters first at the scene said they were unable to hear the bells. Although the building met existing fire codes, it lacked some fire prevention equipment including smoke detectors and a sprinkler system. Additionally, the fire alarm system was not connected to the Greece-Ridge Fire Department or any other security agency, and there was only one vertical fire wall between the two wings. The alarm system consisted only of one bell in the middle of each of the two wings.Hard Questions John Stickevers, an expert fire investigator from New York City, was brought in to assist with the investigation. He discovered that an uncommon highly flammable liquid accelerant was used to start the fire inside a storage cupboard under the first floor stairwell. The fire was officially ruled as an arson attack, but no one was ever charged with this crime, and the case remains open today. In early 2011, the Greece Police Department launched the most intensive investigation of the fire in the last thirty years.I-Team 10 investigation: 1978 Holiday Inn fire in Greece On November 26, 2014, police announced that they have identified a suspect for the first time, 36 years after the fire.Police have suspect in deadly 1978 Holiday Inn fire in Greece In 2018, it was reported that the investigation had been narrowed down to two suspects but disagreements between Greece Police and the Monroe County District Attorney on which suspect is responsible and over proof of arson have stalled the investigation.

It was written by show story editor Tracey Wigfield and directed by co-executive producer John Riggi. It originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on December 9, 2010. Guest stars in this episode include Alan Alda, Elizabeth Banks, Will Forte, and Elaine Stritch. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and Avery Jessup (Banks) convince Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to confide in and grow closer to his visiting mother Colleen Donaghy (Stritch) at Christmas time. At the same time, actor Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tries to stop the release of his new film before it ruins his new serious persona, and Liz also tries to fix Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) relationship with her former boyfriend Paul L'Astname (Forte). This episode of 30 Rock received generally positive reviews from television critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Christmas Attack Zone\\" was watched by 4.759 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.9 rating/5 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. On June 22, 2020, it was revealed that this would be one of three episodes being pulled from syndication due to a scene where Jenna wears blackface. Plot Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is invited by her boss Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to spend Christmas with him to help him deal with a visit from his mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). Liz finds it strange that Jack's fianc√©e Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) will not spend the holiday with him and immediately realizes that Jack has not told his mother about Avery's pregnancy. Avery becomes angry, but she and Liz convince him to tell her which he promises to do. Jack tells Colleen about the news but she is not excited about the pregnancy as Jack and Avery are not married. To get back at her, Jack calls his biological father Milton Greene (Alan Alda), the father she never told him he had, and invites him to spend Christmas with him, and does not inform him that Colleen will be present. The next day, Milton arrives and Jack explains the reason for his visit is so that he can ambush Colleen as she looks down on his relationship with Avery. Later, Avery arrives and is angered about what Colleen said about her relationship with Jack. Liz tries to warn Colleen about Jack's plan but to no avail. She is shocked to see Milton, but immediately figures out what Jack is up to. Colleen gets even with Jack by faking a heart attack, which causes Milton and Avery to feel sorry for her thus abandoning their plan to reprimand Colleen. At the hospital, Avery reveals that she and Jack had planned to elope over New Year's and extends an invitation to everyone. After the announcement, Liz leaves and travels to White Haven, Pennsylvania to spend Christmas with her family. Meanwhile, actor Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his role in the drama feature Hard To Watch but realizes that in order to win the award he needs to act as a serious actor. As a result, Tracy buys the rights to his new comedy movie, The Chunks 2: A Very Chunky Christmas, in order to block the distribution of the feature and improve his chances at winning the award. Later, Tracy decides to do a charity event by screening Hard To Watch‚Äîa story of an inner-city boy living in the ghetto‚Äîfor a women's shelter. At the charity event, Tracy introduces the movie but decides against showing it, realizing that laughter is the best medicine and instead screens The Chunks 2: A Very Chunky Christmas. The people in the shelter find the movie hilarious thus making Tracy happy. At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) is having a hard time dealing with her break-up with Paul L'Astname (Will Forte). Liz, seeing Jenna miserable, visits Paul and tells her that Jenna misses him. Paul visits Jenna, though not to resume their relationship, instead to tell her that he has come up with a brilliant costume for the New Queer's Eve party in which guests dress up as a pop culture phenomenon from the previous year. Unbeknownst to Paul, Jenna also has the same costume idea as his and as a result the two get back together. At the party, Paul dresses like actress Natalie Portman's character in the 2010 movie Black Swan, and Jenna dresses up as former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Lynn Swann. Production Elizabeth Banks guest starred in \\"Christmas Attack Zone\\" as the character Avery Jessup. \\"Christmas Attack Zone\\" was written by 30 Rock story editor Tracey Wigfield, her first episode for the fifth season, and her fourth writing credit overall after \\"Jackie Jormp-Jomp\\", \\"Future Husband\\", and \\"Don Geiss, America and Hope\\". This episode was directed by co-executive producer and staff writer John Riggi, making it his fifth for the series after directing \\"Goodbye, My Friend\\", \\"The Problem Solvers\\", \\"The Moms\\", and \\"Let's Stay Together\\". This episode of 30 Rock originally aired in the United States on December 9, 2010, on NBC as the tenth episode of the show's fifth season and the 90th overall episode of the series. Co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed to Entertainment Weekly that \\"Christmas Attack Zone\\" was \\"the big [episode] for us. It's the long-awaited reunion of Jack's biological parents. A couple of years ago, Jack discovered his real father, but just to avoid an argument, he hasn't told his mother that he knows her shameful sex secret.\\" The character Professor Milton Greene, Jack Donaghy's biological father, was played by guest actor Alan Alda, best known for his role as Hawkeye Pierce from the television series M*A*S*H. Alda and Alec Baldwin have worked together, having appeared in the 2004 biographical drama film The Aviator. This was Alda's third appearance on the show. After the airing of the season three finale episode \\"Kidney Now!', in which Jack organizes a benefit concert to get Milton a kidney, it was unknown whether or not the benefit concert for Milton was a success, however, in the season four episode \\"Into the Crevasse\\", Milton is shown to have written his book From Peanut to President, a biography of United States President Jimmy Carter. In this episode it is revealed that Jack sent Milton a kidney from British singer-songwriter Elvis Costello who participated in the benefit concert in \\"Kidney Now!\\". In October 2010, it was confirmed that Alda would return as his 30 Rock character on the fifth season. In an interview with TV Guide, Alda said that he first met Elaine Stritch twenty years ago \\"but never worked with her before. I always knew the reunion would be interesting. We kid with each other a lot, and our characters have a common enemy in their son.\\" This was Elaine Stritch's seventh appearance as Colleen Donaghy, Jack's mother, on the series. She guest starred in the episodes \\"Hiatus\\", \\"Ludachristmas\\", \\"Christmas Special\\", \\"Se√±or Macho Solo\\", \\"The Natural Order\\", and \\"The Moms\\". Avery Jessup, fianc√©e of Baldwin's character, was played by actress Elizabeth Banks, who first guest starred as the character in the show's fourth season. This was Banks' tenth time as the Avery character. Banks told Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly that she approached the 30 Rock staff about making an appearance as she is a fan of the show. \\"I definitely put feelers out, like, 'I would love to be on your show.' And they did it. They made it happen! I'm a huge fan, so this is a dream come true.\\" Banks also revealed that she has no intention on becoming a series regular, explaining that she has been having \\"too much fun\\" making films to commit to a television show full-time. Comedian actor Will Forte made his fourth appearance in the show, having guest starred as a different character in the February 1, 2007, episode \\"Black Tie\\" from the show's first season. In the previous season, Forte played Jenna Maroney's boyfriend and Jenna impersonator. Forte has appeared in the main cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL), a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Tina Fey, the series creator and lead actress on 30 Rock, was the head writer on SNL from 1999 until 2006. In June 2010, Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna, confirmed that Forte would reprise his role as her boyfriend in the upcoming season. Carlock also noted in the Entertainment Weekly interview that the Jenna and Paul characters \\"have some ups and downs. He wants to try to be a normal couple, and she is afraid of that level of commitment.\\" In the previous episode, \\"Chain Reaction of Mental Anguish\\", Jenna and Paul break-up. In \\"Christmas Attack Zone\\", the two get back together. Cultural references Liz says that she watches the CBS police procedural television series The Mentalist and that she has become a body language expert, in which she figures out that Jack has not told Colleen about Avery's pregnancy, similar to the show's series protagonist played by actor Simon Baker. Some reviewers have noted that Tracy's movie The Chunks 2: A Very Chunky Christmas is a parody to the movies Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (2000), Norbit (2007), and the comedic fictional character Madea. Later, Tracy says \\"As an actor, it is my job to tell the truth, hold the mirror to humanity, and sell Proactiv\\", this is a reference to Proactiv Solution, an over-the-counter topical treatment for mild to moderate forms of acne and the fact that the product has many celebrity spokespeople. At the New Queer's Eve, in which guests dress up as a pop culture phenomenon from the previous year, Paul dresses as actress Natalie Portman's character in the 2010 psychological thriller Black Swan, and Jenna dresses up as former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Lynn Swann. Their a cappella rendition of \\"O Holy Night\\" with which the episode concludes is an homage to Episode 4:11 of The West Wing, \\"O Holy Night.\\" Reception According to Nielsen Media Research, this episode of 30 Rock was watched by 4.759 million viewers during its original United States broadcast. The show claimed a 2.9 rating/5 share among viewers aged 18 to 49, meaning that 2.9 percent of all people in that group, and 5 percent of all people from that group watching television at the time, watched the episode. This was a decrease from the previous episode, \\"Chain Reaction of Mental Anguish\\", which was watched by 5.034 million American viewers. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club wrote that \\"Christmas Attack Zone\\" was a \\"nice holiday outing with a lot of great gag-writing\\", however \\"...I wouldn't put this up there with the show's best Christmas episodes. But I'd say it fits in nicely with the general run of competency to excellence we've been seeing so far this season. It was modestly funny, a little sweet, and not at all horrible.\\" Alan Sepinwall from HitFix who is not a fan of Elaine Stritch's role on the show enjoyed her in this episode, writing that along with the appearances of Elizabeth Banks and Alan Alda \\"I decided to hope their presence would counteract my feelings about hers ‚Äì which is pretty much what happened.\\" Sepinwall enjoyed the subplots commenting that Tracy's \\"played well\\" and Jenna and Paul's \\"was both sweet and ridiculous\\". Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student said it was \\"a ton of fun to watch\\" all the subplots play out and considered \\"Christmas Attack Zone\\" as \\"probably one of the two or three best episodes of the season thus far. In fact ... it may have been the best Christmas episode of 30 Rock yet.\\" Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline enjoyed Stritch and Alda's \\"wonderfully funny roles\\". Entertainment Weeklys Annie Barrett opined that Stritch and Alda \\"really made this episode great.\\" Meredith Blake, a contributor for the Los Angeles Times, opined that television Christmas episodes \\"are a sitcom staple, but ... they're also a risky proposition for a show like 30 Rock. Just how do you maintain the right balance between holiday cheer and year-round irreverence? It's a delicate formula, and on Thursday night 30 Rock got it just right. That is, they leaned toward the former, delivering a Christmas episode full of cynicism ‚Äì but topped with just a sprinkle of sweetness.\\" In addition, Blake was complimentary toward Stritch's role on the show. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote that this episode of 30 Rock \\"wasn't the best Christmas episode that [the show] has had. Past episodes like 'Ludachristmas,' 'Christmas Special' and 'Secret Santa' were put together better and had more heart\\". Sassone noted that the problem with \\"Christmas Attack Zone\\" was Tracy's subplot \\"as it wasn't very funny\\" and the one that dragged the episode down.

It was written by co-producer Kay Cannon and directed by Ken Whittingham. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on December 2, 2010. In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) tries to help Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) when his \\"son\\" returns and asks for money to fund an ill-conceived theme restaurant; Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) turns to Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) as a relationship therapist; and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) thinks her boyfriend Paul (Will Forte) may pop an important question. Plot When Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) asks Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to invest in his con artist \\"son\\" Donald's (guest star Michael Benjamin Washington) ill-conceived theme restaurant, Jack becomes concerned. He believes that Tracy is letting sentiment get in the way and allowing himself to be taken for a ride, and needs to cut Donald off like any other parent, thus preventing him from scamming him out of any more of his money. At the same time, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is having doubts about her relationship with Carol (Matt Damon) but is unable to vent her concerns to Jack since he is too busy trying to sort out Tracy's problem. Instead, Jack recommends that she sees a therapist, so she appoints Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) as her relationship therapist, but this winds up creating another problem when a comment that Liz makes about her Uncle Harold reminds him of one of his own traumas. Jack ends up having to resolve this issue as well by appointing himself Kenneth's therapist. Kenneth explains to Jack that he had had a pig named Harold whom he loved and looked up to as a father but was eventually forced to sell. Later, when he needed a ferry ride to NBC, he was forced to eat Harold. Jack tells Kenneth that by eating Harold, he gave his death meaning, but this brings back memories of problems with his father, Jimmy Donaghy. At the end, Jack reveals to Tracy and Donald that when he received the part of protein in a school play, his father Jimmy Donaghy destroyed his confidence resulting in him forgetting his lines. He therefore tells Tracy to support Donald in his dreams since his father never did. After hearing of Jack's blunders, Donald is reluctant to accept his father's help until Jack recites his part in the school play. Finally, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) is excited about her relationship with Jenna impersonator Paul (special guest star Will Forte), believing that he is going to pop the question, although the question she has in mind is that of a sex tape. As it turns out, Paul wants to solidify their relationship and take it to the next level by inviting Jenna to meet his parents. This worries Jenna, who doesn't want to commit herself to a long term relationship and instead decides to break up with Paul. Reception According to the Nielsen Media Research, this episode of 30 Rock was watched by 5.03 million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 2.3 rating/6 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 2.3 percent of all 18- to 49-year- olds, and 6 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. Alan Sepinwall, writing for HitFix called the episode \\"flawed but funny\\" and opined that \\"an episode filled with things I don't usually enjoy about 30 Rock these days - Liz freaking out about a relationship for no particular reason, Kenneth stories from home (and a lot of Kenneth, period), Tracy's ridiculous \\"son\\" Donald, etc. - and yet one where I kept laughing in spite of that.\\" Writing for The A.V. Club, Nathan Rabin scored the episode A- and called it \\"an all-around winner, an elegantly constructed episode that delivered a steady stream of laughs and managed to somehow make the ridiculous moment when Jack recites his spiel from an elementary school play about science both funny and strangely moving\\". Dan Forcella for TV Fanatic commented that the episode \\"was the continuation of a decent season, but it didn't pack as much of a punch as the past two episodes\\" and criticized Jenna's storyline particularly, writing that the character \\"having a boyfriend that dresses up like her and does strange sexual things with her is just weird and gross\\".

Prior to 2014, the company had an agreement with satellite TV company DISH Network to market and sell DISH Network products, as well as to provide DISH Network customers in remote locations with access to broadcast network programming from distant markets. Notably, All American Direct was not a DISH Network subsidiary. Subscribers to the company's My Distant Network Package had to pay subscription fees separately and in addition to their monthly DISH Network subscription fees. History All American Direct was founded in 1983 as nationwide C-Band satellite service provider and retailer National Programming Service, LLC. According to a company Web site, NPS continues to provide C-Band products and services and claims to be the largest C-Band programming provider in the U.S. NPS first began offering C-Band programming in 1987 and first switched from selling large 7‚Äì12 foot-diameter C-Band dish antennae to providing small-dish services and equipment as DISH Network affiliate All American Dish in 2003. In 2006, All American Dish launched AllAmericanDirect.com, which \\"offer[s] a wide variety of consumer electronic products, such as High Definition televisions, Sirius Satellite Radio, Verizon Wireless, High-Speed Internet, and other related products.\\" EchoStar Agreement In late 2006 NPS entered into a multi-year contract with DISH Network parent company EchoStar Corporation that saw EchoStar provide NPS with domestic satellite capacity on EchoStar VII at 119¬∞ West longitude and on EchoStar X at 110¬∞ West longitude. The partnership came after a Florida court ordered EchoStar to cease providing distant-network programming in October 2006 after a 10-year legal battle over whether the satellite TV provider had violated the Copyright Act; in December 2006 DISH Network ceased all transmission of distant-network programming. Initially, many satellite-TV industry commentators predicted that DISH Network would lose as much as $50 million per year in revenue as a result of the Florida decision; they also assumed that many DISH Network customers would abandon the satellite TV provider for competitor DirecTV. However, following its deal with EchoStar, AllAmericanDirect.com began offering distant network channels in connection with EchoStar, allowing DISH Network to defy these forecasts. From December 2006 until February 2014, AllAmericanDirect.com offered ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX as part of its Distant Network Package subscription service. Distant Network Package channels through All American Direct were accessible to DISH Network subscribers on channel ranges 241 to 248 for standard- definition broadcast networks. On January 30, 2013, Dish began carrying the channels in the 907 to 914 range. This was due to them moving the channels to accommodate Dish's new direction of grouping channels by genre. After February 13, the distant networks would disappear from the 241 to 248 range, and they would be found exclusively in the 907 to 914 range. Distant Network Package subscription fees ranged between $3.00 and $15.00 per month, or between $40 and $170 per year, on a channel-by-channel basis. These fees were paid directly to All American Direct and are separate and in addition to the subscriber's monthly DISH Network bill. In December 2010, National Programming Service announced it would cease providing C-Band programming as of midnight, Dec. 26, 2010. Closure All American Direct ceased operations on February 25, 2014 at 11:59 pm., resulting in the loss of services, including Distant Network channels, for millions of Dish Network subscribers nationwide.

The place was named by James Cook during his 1770 voyage up the eastern coast of Australia aboard the Endeavour. To the south the next two ocean headlands are Waddy Point and Indian Head which was also named by Cook. The cape is protected within the Fraser Island section of the Great Sandy National Park. BreakSea Spit extends about 30 km north of Sandy Cape. Nesting loggerhead and green turtles use the remote, sandy location as a rookery. Nighttime driving along the beach at Sandy Cape is banned during the nesting season. The vegetation at the cape is stunted and windswept. The foredunes are lightly covered by spinifex grass. Vehicle access to Sandy Cape is only available by the eastern beach at low tide. Camping is permitted in the area and it is a popular location with anglers. History Matthew Flinders, traveling aboard the Investigator, landed at Sandy Cape in 1802 and noted the desolate landscape. In August 1803, the ships Cato and Porpoise were both sunk off the cape in bad weather. In late December 1842, HMS Fly anchored behind Sandy Cape where some crewmen and naturalists went ashore and commented on the poor sparse surroundings. The Fly returned in April 1845 and took water from an abundant supply behind the beach and about 7 miles within the Cape. The Seabelle was wrecked in 1857 and the Chang Chow in 1884 in waters closer to the cape which may contain hidden sandbars. Because of the number of shipwrecks in the vicinity the Sandy Cape Light was constructed in 1870. This marked the first permanent European settlement on Fraser Island. The SS Marloo was wrecked in September 1914. Clement Lindley Wragge set up an extensive network of weather stations around Queensland, including one at Sandy Cape in 1891. The cape is still used as a reference point for weather observations; however from May 2015, it has been downgraded to a daily observation, compared with the half-hourly observations at some other weather stations.

The right to housing is recognized by many national constitutions, and the lack of adequate housing can have adverse consequences for an individual or a family.Sen 2004 p. 61 The term may apply regionally (across a geographic area), temporally (between one generation and the next) or culturally (between groups with different racial or social backgrounds).Pryce 2009 p. 145 Housing inequality is directly related to racial, social, income and wealth inequality. It is often the result of market forces, discrimination and segregation. It is also a cause and an effect of poverty.Yinger 2001p. 360 Residential inequality is especially relevant when considering Amartya Sen‚Äôs definition of poverty as \\"the deprivation of core capabilities\\".Sen 1999 p. 87 Economic inequality Disparities in housing explain variations in the conversion of income into human capabilities in different social climates.Sen 2004 p. 61 Income does not always translate into desirable outcomes such as healthcare, education, and housing quality is a factor which determines if those outcomes are readily available to an individual.Yinger 2001 p. 367 According to economist and philosopher Amartya Sen, an individual's freedoms (or capabilities) are significant indicators of the kind of life they value or have a reason to value.Sen 1999 p. 18 As economic equality varies by economic system, historical period and society, so does housing inequality. Economic inequality is a primary contributing factor to housing inequality. The distribution of wealth in a region affects who has access to housing, and at what level. Social inequality Social inequality is the difference in access to social goods brought about by social constructs such as power, religion, kinship, prestige, race, ethnicity, gender, age, and class. Social goods include the labor market, a source of income, healthcare, freedom of speech, education and political representation and participation. Social inequality may be a factor of housing inequality, as when individuals are denied access to housing based on social characteristics. Conversely, social inequality can be a result of housing inequality (such as social stigma associated with living in a certain neighborhood or type of home). Causes Sociologist John Milton YingerYinger 2001 describes urban residential inequality as a result of housing-market forces. YingerYinger 2001p. 360 reasons that, all else being equal, housing becomes relatively more expensive as it is closer to work sites. Because poorer families often cannot afford to pay transportation costs, they may be forced to live in inner-city locations closer to employment opportunities. To win the spatial competition for housing near work sites, lower-income families must compensate for a high-priced location by accepting smaller housing, lower-quality housing or both.Yinger 2001 p. 363 These market forces are subject to other socio-economic factors; no one cause can explain housing inequality. In the United States, Thomas Shapiro and Jessica Kenty-DraneShapiro 2005 point to the wealth gaps between African Americans and other groups as likely causes of the housing disparity between African Americans and the rest of the country. According to Shapiro and Kenty-Drane, historical and social obstacles (slavery and racial segregation) have prevented African Americans from securing and accumulating assets Including quality housing).Shapiro 2005 p. 176 YingerYinger 2001 p. 376 also suggests that racial discrimination still plays a role in housing;Yinger 1997 p. 23 black and Latino households must pay higher search costs, accept lower-quality housing and live in lower-quality neighborhoods due to discrimination. One studyYinger 1997 p. 32 found that 20 percent of potential moves made by African American households and 17 percent of potential moves made by Latino households were discouraged by discrimination in the search process. Rural-urban migration People in rural areas may move to cities in search of better economic or educational opportunities. They may lack resources to pay housing prices typical of home ownership and suburban life, and live in areas where rent and housing prices are lower. This can lead to increased population density in areas of already-low housing quality which, may further deteriorate the standard of living in those areas. One result of this pattern is the emergence of slums, particularly in population centers of developing nations.  Effects The most direct effect of housing inequality is an inequality of neighborhood amenities, which include the condition of surrounding houses, the availability of social networks, the amount of air pollution, the crime rate, and the quality of local schools.Yinger 2001 p. 362 A neighborhood with a certain quality of amenities typically includes individual residences of corresponding quality. Those with lower incomes usually live in areas with poor amenities to win the spatial competition for housing. A neighborhood amenity includes satisfaction derived from living in a nice area, and many studies suggest that growing up in a high-poverty neighborhood affects social and economic outcomes later in life.Yinger 2001 p. 368 Another way the poor compete for housing is by renting homes rather than buying them, which furthers the negative effects of housing inequality by restricting access to household wealth.Krivo and Kaufman 2004 Proposed remedies Proposals to remedy the adverse effects of housing inequality include: * Subsidized housing, also known as affordable housing. Subsidized housing includes: ** Co-operative housing ** Non-profit housing ** Direct housing ** Public housing ** Rent supplements * Private-sector housing - U.S. landlords who provide adequate housing * Fair-lending enforcement - Lenders are expected to not discriminate against borrowers because of family status, race, originality, gender, and color * Scattered-site housing - A housing system where rent is based on household income This system is popular in Philadelphia in the U.S. * Investment in local school systems - According to Ruel Hamilton, financially supporting schools in impoverished areas has a ripple effect which improves school ratings and property values for owners of inner-city housing projects. Inequality Although the focus of housing inequality has changed with time, contemporary international analyses tend to center on urbanization and the move to metropolitan areas. International housing inequality is largely characterized by urban disparities. A 2007 UN- HABITATUN-HABITAT 2007 report estimated that over one billion people worldwide lived in slums at the time, a figure expected to double by 2030. In developing countries, housing inequality is increasingly caused by rural-to-urban migration, increasing urban poverty and inequality, insecure tenure and globalization.UN-HABITAT All these factors contribute to the creation and continuation of slums in poorer areas of the world. One proposed solution is slum upgrading.

It is the westernmost point of Portugal and, if considered part of Europe (although it sits on the North American Plate), is Europe's westernmost point as well. Approachable only by boat, the deep bay provides opportunities for scuba diving during the day in the summer. The islet and the waters around it are protected for their rich biodiversity. Ninety-six species of flora and fauna have been identified congregating in the waters near the islet, including brown algae, limpets, barnacles, and Mediterranean rainbow wrasse. History Historically, the islet functioned as an astronomical or celestial navigational guide and reference mark for mariners, who calibrated their navigational equipment by referencing the islet on long Atlantic crossings. Its unique geological formation also attracted visitors traveling between Europe and America, intersecting here on their way to the ports of Lajes or Santa Cruz on Flores Island. The steep rock slopes of the islet's shoreline served as shelter from strong gales. The islet gave its name to the defunct monthly newspaper O Monchique, the last regularly- published newspaper on Flores. Geography Location map of the islet of Monchique near the island of Flores The islet is located more than north- northwest of the island of Flores, in a bay between Ponta de Fenais (Point Fanaes or Fanais Port) and Faj√£ Grande. The islet is located on the North American Plate between the two westernmost Azorean islands of Flores and Corvo. The islet is a solid monolith of black basaltic rock consisting of a vertical wall formation, remnants of a coastal volcanic cone eroded by ocean forces. It extends steeply to a height of above sea level. It was formed from irregular lava flows that produced many submarine cavities along the islet's relief, with sand and boulders accumulating around the shoreline over time. The islet is an elevated area that includes two rock outcroppings above the water's surface. A deep channel separates Monchique Islet from Flores, with only a rock shoal called the Baixa Raza separating it from the Flores shoreline. Since the channel is between and deep, ships are able to anchor in the bay, aiding visits to the area and providing shelter from storms. The deep channel is considered safe for navigation, though ships must navigate with care to avoid surface rocks. The Baixa Raza rock formation extends over a length of to the west of Ponta de Fenais. Biome The maximum depth of water in the coastal channel is , with water temperatures varying between . The islet is the centre of a region of great biodiversity, with 96 identified species, with a Margalef index of 11.0 biodiversity. The flora along its flanks are dominated by an iridescent brown algae (Dictyota dichotoma), while numerous fauna species including limpets (Patella ulyssiponensis and Patella aspera), barnacles (Megabalanus azoricus and Megabalanus tintinnabulum), and Mediterranean rainbow wrasse (Coris julis) are found in the inner straits. Measures to conserve the islet and its waters fall under the Plano do Ordenamento da Orla Costeira (POOC) Flores (English: Organizing the Flores Coastline Plan), which identifies the islet as part of an area of conservation and preservation for ecological and tourism reasons. The islet itself is identified as \\"vulnerable\\" and designated areas have been marked for terrestrial and marine species protection, limiting human use and access to the islet and surrounding waters. Recreation Visits to Monchique Islet are considered ideal in late spring or early summer (June and July) when the weather is good and vegetation is green and flowers bloom. The airport nearest the islet is Flores Airport in Santa Cruz das Flores. Locally, the islet is only accessible by boat. The water around the coast is suitable for scuba diving as the underwater visibility is good in the warm, clear, and clean waters. There is an advisory which states diving in these waters should be done only during daylight hours as a precautionary measure to avoid any surprises from sea currents. Kayakers can travel to Monchique Islet from Flores. External Links * Map View of Ilh√©u do Monchique at GeoNames.org.

Synopsis of sketch The monologue is Mr. Cohen's attempt to contact his landlord using a telephone of the period. The humor is derived from that of the Cohen's \\"stereo-typical\\" tendency to make puns, and perhaps the difficulty in being understood on the then primitive telephone with his thick Yiddish accent: \\"Hello, I'm Cohen...I'M COHEN...No- I ain't Goin...I'm stopping here....Hello! This is your tenant Cohen...YOUR TENANT COHEN....No, NOT Lieutenant Cohen...\\" The purpose of the call was to ask the landlord to send a repairman down to his location after a windstorm had caused property damage. In frustration, he hangs up at the end of the record and decides to arrange for the repairs himself.

He was a Professor and served as Chair of the Department of Communications Studies at the University of Memphis. Career Before teaching at the University of Memphis he held faculty positions at The University of California-Davis, Indiana University, University of Wisconsin- Madison, and Northwestern University. He also served as editor of Rhetorica, the journal of the International Society for History of Rhetoric, and as the founding president of the American Society for the History of Rhetoric. Leff was an Argumentation Scholar and believed argumentation studies could bridge traditional divisions between dialectic and rhetoric. Leff had many influential ideas about rhetoric in his scholarship. One idea that that is prevalent when studying his works is humanism and how it relates to rhetoric. The history of humanism constantly relates to Ciceronian principles and requires an intricate relationship between the orator and the audience. The humanistic approach to rhetoric was often distinguished as ‚ÄúCiceronian Humanism‚Äù because Cicero played a dominant role throughout its history and development. Leff in particular argued a humanistic approach to rhetoric. He saw that the humanistic approach to rhetoric was necessarily vague and that it positioned the orator both as an individual who leads the audience and as a community member shaped and constrained by the demands of the audience. Another reason Leff argues for humanistic rhetoric is their view of the orator as a cultural hero that holds important oratorical power. Leff disagreed with aspects of the humanistic approach, such as their over-emphasis on the orator‚Äôs individual agency, but recognized the importance of Renaissance humanists to the tradition as well. Leff‚Äôs voluminous scholarship also focused on the rhetorical artistry of Abraham Lincoln and neo-classical criticism. Neo-classical criticism was a central idea in Leff‚Äôs critical work. In his work, ‚ÄúLincoln at Cooper Union: Neo-classical Criticism Revisited‚Äù he uses Lincoln at Cooper Union to show a notable shift in ideals of neo-classical criticism. Leff refers to Abraham Lincoln ‚Äúas our foremost rhetorical president [that] provides and ideal case for examination. Lincoln at Cooper Union displays the earliest example of the direction of close reading as a mode of criticism In Leff‚Äôs work, he shows how Lincoln at Cooper Union is an example of how argument, style, and interlocking main points effectively have changed within neo-classical rhetoric. Leff was a renowned critic of rhetoric; he was knowledgeable in many areas such as argumentation, humanism, and neo- classical criticism, which made his work so well known in the academy. For his many publications he was awarded the NCA Winans-Wicheln Award, the Woolbert award for influential scholarship, and the Ehinger Award for a sustained program of research. He was also awarded the Distinguished Research Award at the 2002 conference of the International Society for the study of Argumentation. In addition to these prestigious awards, Leff also mentored numerous graduate students who now lead in the fields of argumentation, rhetorical criticism, and the history of rhetoric.

It runs in a north-south direction from the University of the Philippines Diliman, intersecting with Tandang Sora Avenue at its northernmost point, down to the Manila Philippines Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, intersecting with White Plains Avenue at its southernmost point. The avenue is named after the Kataas-taasan, Kagalang-galangan, Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan (KKK).Yahoo! Singapore: People and stories behind popular PH streets The road is a component of National Route 11 (N11) and National Route 129 (N129) of the Philippine highway network and Circumferential Road 5 (C-5) of Manila's arterial road network. The avenue has three lanes each way in most sections, widening to four in select areas,Philippine Daily Inquirer: Katipunan road plan gets big 'No' and narrowing to two lanes within Barangays White Plains and Saint Ignatius. An extension project, shelved by the government for the last six decades due to failed negotiations with private entities, has been revived by the Department of Public Works and Highways to address worsening traffic situations along Katipunan and Commonwealth Avenue, as well as Batasan‚ÄìSan Mateo Road. The project is expected to be completed in 10 months. Buildings Along the avenue are several higher educational facilities, including the Ateneo de Manila University, Miriam College, and University of the Philippines Diliman. It is also the location of the Manila Water facilities within the Balara Filters Park. The area along Katipunan Avenue was originally intended as a low-density residential zone. Due to the populous universities along the avenue, numerous condominiums have been since been established in the area. In 2009, the SM Investments Group proposed to build a 31-story high-rise residential project called Stanford Residences on a site on Katipunan Avenue near the Santa Maria della Strada Parish Church, totalling over 1,316 residential and commercial units.Manila Bulletin: QC residents, others oppose granting of zoning exemption to multi-level structure To build this, SM would have to get an exemption from Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance (Ordinance No. SP 918 S-2000), restricting the height of buildings in residential areas such as that part of Katipunan Avenue to . Local residents opposed the exemption.Philippine Daily Inquirer: Proposed reso on planned SM condo put on hold SM already had another high-rise project in progress on the other side of Katipunan Avenue, called Berkeley Residences, which was already 40% done by September 2009. SM indicated that it would be willing to move the Stanford Residences project to another location. Despite advisories warning against alcohol beverage distribution near schools located along Katipunan Avenue, bar establishments continue to be a popular aspect of the area's nightlife. Popular bar establishments include Walrus, VSpot, and Lan Kwai. Transport The avenue generally features heavy motorized vehicle traffic, and is divided in the middle by traffic islands for the convenience of pedestrians.Philippine Daily Inquirer: Reprieve In 2005, the MMDA listed the area of Katipunan Avenue near Ateneo de Manila University as one of Metro Manila's 14 most dangerous traffic black spots.Philippine Daily Inquirer: Metro's 14 most dangerous spots In 2008, the MMDA introduced a traffic rerouting plan on the avenue, cutting off some u-turn slots along the avenue; local residents complained, but the MMDA responded that the road was used by many motorists and not just local residents, and that the measures had improved traffic flow. Later the MMDA stated they might re-open some of the u-turn slots.Philippine Daily Inquirer: MMDA may reopen U-turn slots if In 2010, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) announced that it would deploy 2,000 traffic enforcers along the avenue to deal with the heavy vehicular traffic.The Philippine Star: MMDA deploys 2,000 enforcers to decongest Katipunan, U-belt The city government built a pedestrian overpass in 2006 near Ateneo de Manila University.The Philippine Star: New QC bridge to ease Novaliches traffic Motorized tricycles have long been officially banned from Katipunan Avenue, but the ban was not always evenly enforced, until an announcement in August 2008 by the MMDA. MMDA stated that they would enforce the ban from Aurora Boulevard northwards.GMA News: MMDA to strictly enforce tricycle ban on Katipunan Avenue In September 2008, Quezon City councilor Allan Butch Francisco proposed an exception to the ban. He stated that the Quezon City Tricycle Ordinance of 1992 permitted tricycles to travel along national highways if those highways were the only access roads in the area, and that Katipunan Avenue was the only road linking to the u-turn slot on C.P. Garcia Avenue. Katipunan tricycle drivers held a strike in mid-September in protest. Katipunan Station is located on Aurora Boulevard near its intersection with Katipunan Avenue. It is the only underground station on Line 2 and the whole LRTA system.GMA News: LRTA offers traditional free ride on June 12 Landscape In 2002, the Katipunan Greening Project volunteers planted Bougainvillea, Lantana camara, petunias, red creepers, and other flowering shrubs along the avenue, after two years of lobbying the MMDA to ensure that the city would water and otherwise look after the plants. Businesses along the avenue also lent a hand.Philippine Daily Inquirer: Katipunan Avenue in bloom In 2003, the MMDA proposed removing the trees and the traffic islands along the avenue, in an effort to improve the traffic flow; however, local residents objected. The tree-cutting was halted by an order from Malaca√±ang, pending the return of then-President of the Philippines Gloria Macapagal Arroyo from an overseas trip.Philippine Daily Inquirer: Palace stops cutting of trees on Katipunan Again in 2009, the MMDA was cutting down trees along the avenue for a road-widening project; in the second case, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources ordered MMDA to stop, after protests by Ateneo de Manila University.The Philippine Star: DENR to MMDA: Stop removing trees from Katipunan Avenue There were further back-and-forth accusations between the two departments, with MMDA stating that the tree removal had already been agreed to with DENR, while DENR criticized MMDA's sloppy work in removing the trees.The Philippine Star: MMDA: Tree removal covered by DENR deal Incidents Crime In 1996, Colonel Rolando Abadilla of the Philippine Constabulary (now Philippine National Police) Metropolitan Command Intelligence and Security Group was killed by four gunmen, including a fellow police officer, while driving along Katipunan Avenue in broad daylight.

The Principal Award of ‚Ç¨100,000 was presented during a ceremony at the Royal Palace in Amsterdam.  History of Organization   Brazil  Viva Rio was founded in December 1993 as a reaction to the city of Rio de Janeiro's increase in the number of violent crimes committed. In 1993, according to the US State Department, extrajudicial killings of criminal suspects and minors by vigilante groups were the principle human rights problem in Brazil.U.S. Department of State. Brazil Human Rights Practices, 1993. 31 January 1994. 10 November 2010. < http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/democracy/1993_hrp_report/93hrp_report_ara/Brazil.html > The July 23, 1993, Candelaria Massacre, and the August 31, 1993, Vig√°rio Geral massacre were two events that led leaders from different sectors of society, including those of the media, cultural groups, and merchants to gather at general meetings throughout the month of September.‚ÄúLinha du Tempo‚Äù. vivario.org.br. Viva Rio. n.d. 9 November 2010. From these meetings emerged the idea that an institution needed to be created to promote what the city lacked; a culture of nonviolence and community development. Viva Rio was consequently founded two months later. That year, the organization created a volunteer project designed to provide low-income communities with material necessities. In 1994, Viva Rio collaborated with Rio de Janeiro's Military Police in the organization of the government's new public security policy of community policing. The aim was to replace the repressive policing that was contributing to the violence rather than reducing it. Between 1983 and 1994 the homicide rate in the city of Rio de Janeiro grew 88%, from 41.8 to 78.1 per 100,000 people. From 1994 to 1998 homicides fell 28%, from 78.0 to 60.8 per 100,000 people.Carniero, Leandro. ‚ÄúViolent Crime in Latin America Cities: Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo‚Äù. usp.com.br. Department of Political Science University of Sao Paulo. January 2000. 9 November 2010. This drop in the city's homicide rate occurred parallel to the changes in policing methods largely brought about through the collaboration of Viva Rio. One of Viva Rio's most prominent campaigns is Rio Desarma-se (Rio Disarm yourself), aimed at reducing the number of arms that are in the possession of civilians rather than government or law enforcement personnel. According to a survey done by Viva Rio and the Institute of Religious Studies, around 15 million or 90% of firearms in Brazil fall under this category.‚ÄúControl Arms‚Äù. Vivario.org.br.

Under these conditions Viva Rio has established itself in the capital city of Port-au- Prince and has engaged local residents through various social programs.

Projects  Viva Rio is involved in multiple social projects that focus on three areas of concern: community outreach, communications and human security. These projects focus on researching a specific problem, developing solutions, and implementing them. These solutions are first implemented on a small scale, and depending on the success, are then applied on a city or regional level.  Community Outreach  Vivario food drive The community outreach programs are focused on the education of children and young adults throughout Rio de Janeiro. The projects include basic youth education, job market training, and projects that promote constructive activities, such as sports and gardening, within low income neighborhoods. This aims to encourage youth to engage in improving their lives as well as uplifting their communities. Besides education, the community outreach programs involve projects that work to provide low-interest loans to entrepreneurs and local businesses in Rio de Janeiro. ‚ÄúVivaCred, Viva Rio‚Äôs flagship credit program has provided over US$5 million in low interest loans‚Äù. Apart from their loan programs ‚Äúthe VIVASEGURO program informs community members about insurance and savings‚Äù.  Communication  Viva Rio works to bring communication access of various types to the favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro. The installation of internet access points throughout low-income neighborhoods, allows the residents to market their commercial products to a wider audience. These projects stimulate the local economies and reduce the isolation faced by the favelas due to lack of internet and telecommunications. Apart from stimulating economic development, Viva Rio works to bring social understanding between residents of the favelas and the rest of the population in Rio de Janeiro. By creating and supporting project such as Viva Favela, an internet communication network, residents of the favelas are able to post information about their communities. This information varies from dissatisfaction with living conditions, to the publication of social and cultural events.

The Triangle was considered \\"a marketplace for information and was regarded as a symbolic space for free expression.\\" Importance of Posters and Leaflets As the movement progressed many poems and short essays were also pasted at the base of the Monument to the People's Heroes informing people about ideas and tactics that were emerging during the course of the movement.Han Minzhu, p. 49. The Monument to the People's Heroes became \\"the center stage as cries for democracy were pasted and broadcast from it during the movement.\\" Han Minzhu, p. 61. Posters appeared on the monument describing events that others may not have had the chance to witness such as the student petition submitted on April 22 which government officials declined to receive, and the Xinhua Gate Incident involving alleged police brutality towards students. Ideas also appeared in handbills and student papers that were passed out in and around the Square.Han Minzhu, p.61. Ideas and slogans during the movement began as posters on campuses, and were later converted to leaflets and handbills. Big and small character posters became the main way to report news and express viewpoints on campuses.Han Minzhu, p.76. The ideas they expressed spread by word of mouth, or by individuals who had hand copied the contents. To express news and ideas quickly, efficiently, and accurately the \\"propaganda teams of student organizations created handbills explaining movement activities, and they went to the streets\\" to hand out leaflets to the public.

Posters and leaflets appeared around universities throughout China, but they were mainly concentrated in Beijing. Big-character posters became a way for individuals to express their views and to collectively share ideas and opinions regarding the government and movement. Posters and Slogans Class boycott posters and slogans such as the ones below appeared on leaflets and information boards across university campuses throughout China. Items to note regarding the boycott of classes: 1\\\\. Boycott classes, not studies. 2\\\\. During the class boycott please do not return home or march without authorization. Respect normal school rules and daily schedules. 3\\\\. Further announcements of student activities during the class boycott will be made. ~People's University (Renmin University of China) Student Union big-character poster Han Minzhu, p.71. Slogans: Support the Communist Party and socialism! Support reform! Long live democracy! Oppose corruption in government; oppose special privileges! Patriotism is not a crime! Long live the people! Han Minzhu, p.73. Influence of Posters and Leaflets When student activists wanted to organize a demonstration all they needed to do was, \\"put several posters at the Triangle, write down the time and location of the gathering, the purposes of the demonstration, and the slogans to be used\\" and on the day of the demonstration, students would be mobilized and ready to go.Dingxin Zhao, p.253. Students regularly gathered at the Triangle to begin their marches to Tiananmen Square. Since the media was under state control students depended on big-character posters, student-controlled broadcasting stations, and word of mouth for information.Dingxin Zhao, p. 311. Word of mouth information became a way for rumors about government divisions and brutality to spread,Dingxin Zhao, p.320. leading to the misinterpretation of information, and wrong ideas being spread.

The D&LW; undertook electrification of its Morristown Line and related branches in 1929‚Äì1930, and purchased 141 motor cars from Pullman to operate it. These were supplemented by 141 unpowered trailers of various types which were converted from existing rolling stock. The multiple units were successful and remained in service into the early 1980s.  History  The MUs were inaugurated with fanfare on September 3, 1930, when the aging inventor Thomas A. Edison, a key proponent of DC current (the source of electric power for the MUs), drove the first train for the first mile along its 13-mile trip from Hoboken to Montclair, New Jersey. The service was extended in phases to other towns that would have yards to store the trains: South Orange, Summit, Gladstone, Morristown and Dover. Plans to extend electrified service west, for freight service, possibly as far as Scranton, PA, were investigated by the Lackawanna. The plans were abandoned due to cost, particularly since the timing of the extension coincided with the arrival of the Great Depression. The MUs did travel beyond the electrified district on occasion, particularly after World War II when there was a shortage of rail cars available. Unpowered MUs, pulled by steam locomotives, travelled on the Sussex Branch to Branchville, New Jersey, for instance, during the immediate post-war timeframe. Over the years, the distinctive Pullman green cars were considered to be extremely reliable. Thomas T. Taber, in his book on the DL&W;, called the Lackawanna MUs \\"...probably the finest multiple unit electric cars ever constructed.\\" Their reliability remained excellent into their fourth decade of service, but suffered during the final years of their 54-year tenure in service. During their 54-year tenure, the cars were run by four different railroad companies: the Lackawanna Railroad (1930‚Äì1960); the Erie Lackawanna Railroad (1960‚Äì1976); Conrail (1976‚Äì1982); and finally, NJ Transit (1983‚Äì1984). The cars were retired after their final runs on August 24, 1984. The DC power distribution system was retired at that point and a 25,000 volt 60 hertz AC power distribution system, which had been installed and tested over the previous several years as part of the re-electrification project, was switched on. Arrow III MU cars, which continued to run to and from Hoboken, initially replaced the Lackawanna MUs. The introduction of Midtown Direct service to New York City in 1996, however, would prove problematic as the Northeast Corridor Line into Manhattan still used the original Pennsylvania Railroad 12,000 volt 25 hertz AC distribution system. Given that the Arrow III cars were not engineered to easily switch from one voltage to another, it was necessary for NJ Transit to acquire new locomotives, ALP-44s, to handle the new service. Mountain Station in South Orange, New Jersey, in 1982. Note the repainted lead car which was part of a minor refurbishment carried out on some cars during the late 1970s and early 1980s due to delays in the re-electrification of the line. The Lackawanna MUs were built from a combination of new motorized units (built by General Electric and Pullman) and converted coaches as trailers. These cars were semi-permanently attached to each other in pairs (trailer car-power car), with the trailer car on the westbound (Dover-facing) end of the train. Most of the trailer cars were built by Pullman. Typically, trains were limited to 6 pairs of these units, i.e. 12 cars. Although, due to the loss of a trailer car in a 1962 accident, its unmatched power car was placed into the middle of a 13-car train that was run during rush-hours only during the Erie Lackawanna years, the Tom Taber Express. New Jersey state law restricted the length of commuter trains to a maximum of 13 cars. Although with the unmatched power car in the pool of available cars, it was theoretically possible to have every combination of train length from two to 13 cars, the most common train lengths seen were 2 and 4 car trains off-peak and 6 and 8 cars during the rush hour. Three-car sets (two power cars plus a single coach) were used rarely, mostly as shuttle trains east of Newark, and were noted for their faster acceleration and higher top speeds, which may explain their limited use. Although matched sets were not over-powered, it was possible for MU trains to pull an additional freight car (most often milk cars), which would be coupled to the rear-end of the MU train. In later years, the 2-car off-peak configuration was abandoned in favor of a 4-car configuration for reliability purposes. Outbound from Hoboken, commuters could ride on the Morristown Line (the mainline) to Dover, New Jersey, a trip of 38.3 miles (62 km). The Montclair Branch and Gladstone Branch diverged from the Morristown line at Roseville Avenue Station in Newark and Summit, respectively. The MUs ran off 3000 volt DC overhead electric wire, drawing current through pantographs. Due to the presence of overhead bridges along the line, the overhead catenary varied considerably in height. Where no height restrictions existed, the catenary was typically at , but for some bridges the wire needed to drop in clearance, with Roseville Avenue being the point of lowest clearance at . This didn't affect the operation of the MUs, since they had been designed with these clearance differentials in mind, but the low clearances restricted the use of other trains on the line that had insufficient clearance. The Lackawanna MUs had two pantographs: one for normal use (on the Dover end of the motor car) and one with greater wire tension that was used only during ice storms (on the Hoboken end of the car). The trains lacked speedometers. On test runs, the trains attained a speed of on level track. On suitable downgrades, however, the trains could reach .  Types   Low-roof trailers  The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad purchased fifty suburban coaches from Pullman in 1925. The cars were and had vestibules at both ends. The total seating capacity was 82. Originally numbered 300‚Äì349, they were converted to multiple unit trailers in 1930 and renumbered 2200‚Äì2249. The cars were referred to as \\"low roof\\" trailers to distinguish them from Pullman trailers built in 1917‚Äì1920 which had higher roofs. The low-roof trailers were tall and weighed . In 1961, they were renumbered 3200‚Äì3249. After retirement, the cars were stored at Mahwah, New Jersey, and listed for sale on March 9, 1984, and November 13, 1984.  High- roof trailers  High roof trailer car leaves Bergen Hill Tunnels in August 1981 Pullman built 75 suburban coaches for the Lackwanna between 1917‚Äì1920. These cars had \\"high roofs\\", higher than the Pullman coaches delivered in 1925 or the motor cars built in 1930. 68 of these ( 648‚Äì715) were rebuilt as trailers in 1930 and renumbered 2300‚Äì2367. The cars were rebuilt by the American Car and Foundry Company, which added vestibules and converted the cars to electric heat. The cars were long and could seat 78. The cars stood tall and weighed . In 1961, they were renumbered 3300‚Äì3367 and finally by NJT to 4300-4367.  Combine trailers  The Lackawanna rebuilt a total of 18 combine cars for multiple unit operation: fifteen baggage/express and three railway post offices (RPO). These cars were drawn from different batches. Combines 426‚Äì428 were built in 1917; 429‚Äì433 in 1921; 434‚Äì443 in 1925. Cars 426 and 442‚Äì423 were the RPOs. All save 426 were converted to MU trailers in 1930; 426 was converted later. The baggage express cars were renumbered 2400‚Äì2414; the RPOs 2440‚Äì2442. The RPOs were used on the Gladstone Branch and Dover Branch; at , the Gladstone RPO made the shortest such run in the United States. In 1961 the combines were renumbered 3400‚Äì3415 and 3440‚Äì3441.  Club trailers  Lackawanna club cars 480‚Äì484 were built in 1912 by the Barney and Smith Car Company and car 647 in 1917 by Pullman. They were converted to MU trailers in 1930 and renumbered 2450 to 2455. In 1961, they were renumbered 3450-3455. Since the cars were subscription only, they were typically placed on the westbound (Dover-facing) end of the train.  Motor units  Between 1929‚Äì1930 Pullman and General Electric constructed 141 new electric multiple units for the suburban service. These were numbered 2500‚Äì2640. Each car could seat 84 passengers. The individual cars were long, stood high, and weighed . Four traction motors permitted an acceleration of and a maximum speed of , although they could reach downhill.

It is an active Anglican church in the Diocese of Blackburn. It was constructed between 1960 and 1962, and designed by Laurence King. History The church is the third in the town bearing the name of St Nicholas, and the second built on the present site. The first, on Wyre Street, was destroyed in the floods of 1927, and the second was demolished in the late 1950s to make way for the current building. Part of it survived until 2007 as the scout hut. The church was designed by Laurence King (1907-1981), a prominent Lancashire ecclesiastical architect, who also designed the tower of Blackburn Cathedral. The foundation stone was laid by Nicholas Meynell in October 1960 and the site was hallowed by Charles Claxton, Bishop of Blackburn. Although never fully completed, the church was dedicated by Anthony Hoskyns-Abrahall, Bishop of Lancaster, in April 1962. The building was not consecrated until 1987 when the church became the parish church of the new parish of St Nicholas, Fleetwood. Architecture St Nicholas stands on a triangular plot of land at the intersection of Poulton Road, Highbury Avenue and Broadway. Whilst modern in appearance, it is traditional in form, comprising a central tower, nave, chancel, north and south porches, and ancillary rooms. King's design was intended to resemble the upturned keel of a ship, reflecting the seafaring aspects both of the town and of St Nicholas himself. The external construction of the church is largely of light brown brick. There is no stone or concrete used anywhere. The other prominent external feature is the series of steeply-pitched copper roofs, whose green patina contrasts with the orange-brown brickwork. The large square central tower is composed of two, tall tapering brick slabs on the east and west faces, and flat recessed plain-glass windows on the north and south faces. The nave and chancel roofs are very steeply pitched, but the nave roof is considerably higher, extending over the aisles. Each of the roofs has three sharply pitched dormers on each side, those on the chancel being smaller than those on the nave. The overall effect is intended to be reminiscent of the sails of a ship. While the exterior is sharply angular, the interior is dominated by pointed arches. Construction is of the same light-brown brick as the exterior, although contrasted with pale pointing. Centrally placed on the west wall is the organ (1961). The instrument is a 2 manual and pedal pipe organ, probably the last to be built by the firm of J J Binns. It is a 5 rank extension organ, with 4 ranks totally enclosed in a swell box and the 5th rank, a diapason, on display to the side and above the console. , The high altar, under the tower, is raised on a two-step plinth. Beyond the high altar, in the chancel, is the Lady Chapel, with an abstract stained glass window; the only stained glass in the church. Laurence King designed the three large painted wood carvings prominent in the interior: a Madonna and a St Nicholas on either side of the chancel arch and a Crucifix in the chancel.

Career Uhlmann was formerly a seminarian, a security guard, and a journalist with The Canberra Times before joining the Australian Broadcasting Corporation as a radio producer in 1998. From 1999 to 2004, Uhlmann co-hosted Local Radio Breakfast on 666 ABC Canberra with David Kilby. In 2005, he was Jon Faine's producer for the Mornings show on 774 ABC Melbourne, and in 2006 was made chief political correspondent for ABC Radio current affairs. In 2008, Uhlmann switched to television, and was political editor for The 7.30 Report, ABC News, and ABC News channel. In December 2010, he was appointed as co-host of the ABC Television current affairs program, 7.30. In 2012, the show was revamped again, with Uhlmann returning to the political editor role, and Leigh Sales hosting the program. In 2013, Uhlmann stepped down as 7.30 political editor. He announced that he would be working on a documentary about the Rudd and Gillard Governments for the ABC. In February 2014, Uhlmann became the 14th presenter of AM, the ABC Radio news and current affairs program. He took over after Tony Eastley resigned to take up a senior presenter role with ABC News 24. In January 2015, Uhlmann was appointed in a newly created position as ABC News political editor. As a result of the new position Uhlmann left his role as presenter of AM, and was replaced by Michael Brissenden. In July 2017, Uhlmann's 2-minute report for ABC's Insiders on Donald Trump's appearance at the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit went viral, and he was interviewed extensively in the United States, on various television networks. In August 2017, Uhlmann announced that he would be leaving ABC to join the Nine News as political editor replacing Laurie Oakes. Uhlmann is also a fill in presenter on Today. In August 2018, amid the 2018 Liberal Party leadership spill, Uhlmann appeared on Today, where he stated that the Sky News television channel, 2GB radio station and News Corp were \\"waging a war\\" against Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull. When asked how he expected presenters on Sky or 2GB to respond, he said he \\"couldn't give a rat's arse\\", adding \\"If you dish it out, you have to be prepared to take it\\".

Retrieved 12 July 2017. Politics Uhlmann unsuccessfully contested the ACT 1998 general election for the electorate of Molonglo with the Osborne Independent Group. The conservative group was named after Paul Osborne, who was strongly pro-life and advocated blocking both euthanasia legislation and any attempt to decriminalise abortion. Osborne and Uhlmann fell out when Osborne moved to restrict abortion in the ACT. Six years earlier, Uhlmann had written in support of establishing an abortion clinic in the territory. Books With Steve Lewis, Uhlmann has written a series of political novels set in Canberra: The Marmalade Files (2012), The Mandarin Code (2014) and The Shadow Game (2016). These feature a political reporter, Harriet Dunkley, investigating a conspiracy involving China, the US and Australian security organisations. In 2016 the first two books were adapted as the Australian television series Secret City. Personal life Uhlmann is married to Gai Brodtmann who was an Australian Labor Party member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Canberra from 2010 to 2019.

The art form, which began in the early half of the nineteenth century in Europe, started to rise slowly in America under the guise of Dadaism in 1915. While originally formed under a group of artists in New York City who wanted to counter pop culture with their art, music, and literature the art form began to grow into prominence with American pop culture due to a variety of factors between the 1940s to the 1970s. However, from many factors that arose in the late 1970s, avant-garde began to both lessen in prominence and began to blend with the pop culture to the point in which most art critics considered the art form extinct.  Avant Garde and Kitsch  Though his first published essays dealt mainly with literature and theatre, art still held a powerful attraction for Clement Greenberg, so in 1939, he made a sudden name as a visual art writer with possibly his most well-known and oft-quoted essay, \\"Avant-Garde and Kitsch\\", first published in the journal Partisan Review. In this Marxist- influenced essay, Greenberg claimed that true avant-garde art is a product of the Enlightenment's revolution of critical thinking, and as such resists and recoils from the degradation of culture in both mainstream capitalist and communist society, while acknowledging the paradox that, at the same time, the artist, dependent on the market or the state, remains inexorably attached \\"by an umbilical cord of gold\\". Kitsch, on the other hand, was the product of industrialization and the urbanization of the working class, a filler made for the consumption of the working class: a populace hungry for culture, but without the resources and education to enjoy cutting edge avant garde culture. Greenberg writes, > \\"Kitsch, using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of > genuine culture, welcomes and cultivates this insensibility. It is the > source of its profits. Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas. Kitsch > is vicarious experience and faked sensations. Kitsch changes according to > style, but remains always the same. Kitsch is the epitome of all that is > spurious in the life of our times. Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its > customers except their money ‚Äì not even their time.\\" Greenberg, Clement. > \\"Avant-Garde and Kitsch.\\" Partisan Review. 6:5 (1939) 34‚Äì49 For Greenberg, avant garde art was too \\"innocent\\" to be effectively used as propaganda or bent to a cause, while kitsch was ideal for stirring up false sentiment. Greenberg appropriated the German word \\"kitsch\\" to describe this low, concocted form of \\"culture\\", though its connotations have since been recast to a more affirmative acceptance of nostalgic materials of capitalist/communist culture. \\"Avant Garde and Kitsch\\" is clearly a politically motivated essay, in part a response to the destruction and repression of Modernist Art in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and represents a denouncement of the growing totalitarian threat in Europe and the \\"retrogression\\" of fascism. Further definition Avant-garde, as sociologist Diana Crane states, \\"was an art-form that had started in Europe that had started in the early nineteenth century.\\" While the art form has survived for this long, she states that the concept of the art form is \\"highly ambiguous\\" and it has been through many phases throughout its existence, including Dadaism, Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, and pop art. Socially, however, each form of avant-garde is united with the idea that it is part of the definition of high culture, although this in itself is defined in a variety of fashions. Ways to determine avant-garde Due to the ambiguity of the term, Crane gives a few considerations on what could be considered avant-garde and what is not. She states that avant-garde can be determined in its approach to the aesthetic, through the social content of the artwork, and through the production and distribution of the artwork. Aesthetics Through aesthetic, a piece of artwork can be determined avant-garde if it does any of the following: * If the artwork redefines artistic conventions. * If it utilizes new artistic tools and techniques. * And if it redefines the nature of the art objects. An example of the aesthetic used in Avant-garde can include the artwork of Marcel Duchamp. For Duchamp's Fountain, he simply took a urinal and defined this as a ready-made art form. In this, he redefined artistic conventions by taking an item that was already made and employing the item for an artistic purpose. By doing this, he also employed a new technique in the production of art by taking something that was already produced and redefined the object he was using by taking a urinal and using it for art. Through Social Content Through social content, a piece of artwork can be determined avant-garde if it does one of the following: *; If the artwork incorporates in its artworks social or political values that are critical of or different from the majority culture. :For example, in The Art of Humanism: Art in a Time of Change, Barry Schwartz states that one of the roles of avant- garde art was to provide a counter-cultural force in the art world. *; If it redefines the relationship between high and popular culture :Like pop artists using images from advertisements and comic strips to employ a different meaning to those images *; And if it adopts a critical attitude toward artistic institutions :This is seen by the Dadaist attack on the legitimacy of art Through production and distribution Through its production and distribution, an artwork can be described as avant-garde if it redefines the social context for the production of art, in terms of critics, role models, and the audience; if it does one of the following: *; The artwork redefines the organizational context for the production, display, and distribution of art :A good example of this is the usage of alternative spaces in order to make the art appear unsellable. *; The artwork redefines the nature of the artistic role or the extent to which the artist participates in other social institutions, which provides a good niche of avant-garde artists in the middle class. Differences with Post-Modernism While the two terms are used interchangeably today, some argue that the difference between the two lie in their approach to innovating art. According to Jochen Schulte-Sasse, the two differ in the fact that Post-modernism wants to destroy old conceptions of art to replace them with new (without any reference to the social impact of the art). According to Diana Crane, post-modernists do this through a variety of ways, namely through creating effects of polysemy, ambiguity, and parody. Post-modernists also only focused on the technique of their art rather than the social impacts of their art. However, avant-garde wants to innovate art and also communicate social issues within it. It could also be defined that post-modernism uses their art with the intent to shock the person viewing the art while avant-garde, while it also often shocks the viewer, uses their art to communicate a message through the art while also using the art to shock the viewer. Subgenres of the avant-garde While avant-garde is a solitary art form, it has had a variety of subgenres attached to the art form throughout its history, with each communicating their own distinct messages. Some of them, like Dadaism and Pop Art, use the art to provide a social commentary. Others, like Abstract Expressionism, use outer-worldly figures and colors to evoke an emotional response.Abstract Expressionism.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2010. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 . Finally, there are some like Minimalism\\"minimalism.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2010. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 . which use their art for the sake of making art without any emotional or social meanings behind them. While there are myriad different avant-garde subgenres that came about during its popularity in America, the four subgenres that played the biggest roles in American Popular Culture are Dadaism, Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, and Pop Art. Dadaism Marcel Duchamp's Fountain is an example of Dadaist Ready-Mades Dadaism was the first major subgenre of avant-garde art to cross over into America. Dadaist artists, in many ways, wanted to contrast from the typical artist at the time from their idea of being against typical artistic conventions at the time and being anti-art. A good example of their anti-art approach came through what Dadaists call the \\"ready-mades,\\" the most notable being Marcel Duchamp's Fountain, which was a porcelain urinal. Ready-mades such as this caused great debate in the art community concerning the definition of art and how Dadaists should play in this definition. Commonalities Between Pieces While Dadaist pieces cannot be determined through a particular artistic form, many Dadaist artists collaborated in groups with each other in order to create their art, united on either to create art based on social issues (particularly in Europe) or to mock the art world in general (mostly in America). In America, the center of this movement came from two locations in the New York-area: at Alfred Stieglitz's New York gallery \\"291,\\" and at the studio of Walter Arensberg. In addition to group collaboration, artists of the Dada movement depended more on spontaneity and chance than following other established artists. They focused on rejecting the ideas formed by established artists and art creation and used methods such as collage, photomontage, and found-object construction to create their art. While this art form started strong in 1916 in Germany, it eventually faded out by 1922 in both Europe and America. However, despite its decline, Dada would play a major influence on other avant-garde and nihilistic art-forms in the future, including the Punk movement in the '1970s. Abstract Expressionism Abstract Expressionism was another major avant-garde genre that, unlike Dadaism, was born in and popular in the United States. A number of artists that were practitioners of this art form include Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, and Mark Rothko. Much like Dadaism in America, the center of the movement was in New York City. Commonalities Also, much like Dadaism, although many of the artists worked together in creating their art, the art pieces cannot be determined through one particular art form. Pieces often varied differently between painting styles from both the techniques that were used in the piece and quality of expression of the pieces. Despite the drastic differences between pieces, Abstract Expressionism shares several broad characteristics. These characteristics includes: * Each piece depicts forms that are not found in the visible world * Each emphasize free, spontaneous, and personal emotional expressionism * They exercise a freedom of technique with emphasis on exploitation of the physical character of the paint to evoke expressive qualities (violence, lyricism, etc.) * They show similar emphasis on the unstudied and intuitive application of that paint in a form of psychic improvisation akin to the automatism of the Surrealists, with a similar intent of expressing the force of the creative unconscious in art. * They display the abandonment of conventionally structured composition built up out of discrete and segregable elements and their replacement with a single unified, undifferentiated field, network, or other image that exists in unstructured space. * Finally, the paintings fill large canvases to give these aforementioned visual effects both monumentality and engrossing power. There are also three main techniques in which categorize Abstract Expressionism. First, there is Action Painting, which is characterized by a loose, rapid, dynamic, or forceful handling of paint in sweeping or slashing brush strokes and in techniques partially dictated by chance, such as dripping or spilling the paint directly onto the canvas. Examples of this include Jackson Pollock dripping commercial paints on raw canvas to build up complex and tangled skeins of paint into exciting and suggestive linear patterns and Willem de Kooning used extremely vigorous and expressive brush strokes to build up richly colored and textured images. The second category of Abstract Expressionism is represented by a variety of styles ranging from Color field, to Lyrical abstraction; delicate imagery and fluid shapes and fields of color included in works by Clyfford Still, Philip Guston, and Helen Frankenthaler to the more clearly structured, forceful, almost calligraphic pictures of Robert Motherwell and Adolph Gottlieb. Finally, the last form of Abstract Expressionism is the third and least emotionally expressive approach was that of Rothko, Barnett Newman, and Ad Reinhardt. These painters used large areas, or fields, of flat colour and thin, diaphanous paint to achieve quiet, subtle, almost meditative effects. While Abstract Expressionism's roots could be traced back as far as 1919, the peak of its popularity were in the 1950s to the 1960s. This, like Dadaism before, shows another influential avant-grade artistic genre that suffered from a short peak of popularity. Minimalism Minimalism was an avant-grade genre from the 1910s to the late 1960s which was characterized by extreme simplicity of a form and a literal approach. Its origins could be stemmed from many artists, including Kandinsky, Picabia, Delaunay, Kupka, Survage and Malevich, who focused on reducing art to its basic element. A great example of his art was the painting of a black square on a white ground. Other minimalist artists that were famous at this time included painters such as Jack Youngerman, Ellsworth Kelly, Frank Stella, Kenneth Noland, Al Held, and Gene Davis and sculptors such as Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Tony Smith, Anthony Caro, and Sol LeWitt. Kazimir Malevich, Black Square, 1923, oil on canvas, State Russian Museum, St.Petersburg In many ways the rise of Minimalism came as a result of those who were dissatisfied with the Abstract Expressionist movement, primarily from the Action Paintings of the movement. The reason for many was that they believed that Action painting was too personal and insubstantial, and they adopted the point of view that a work of art should not refer to anything other than itself. Similarities Unlike other genres of avant-garde at the time, minimalist art used not only a set of philosophical properties when it came to the production of their In order to rid their art of any extra- visual influence, Minimalist paintings used hard edge painting, a simplistic form, and a linear approach to emphasize two-dimensionality and to allow the viewer an immediate, purely visual response to art in comparison to any other sort of response. Hard-Edge Painting Hard-edge painting is characterized by large, simplified, usually geometric forms on an overall flat surface; precise, razor-sharp contours; and broad areas of bright, unmodulated color that have been stained into unprimed canvas. It differs from other types of geometric abstraction in that it rejects both lyrical and mathematical composition because, even in this simplified field, they are a means of personal expression for the artist. Minimal hard-edge painting is the anonymous construction of a simple object. (Make a reference to the part of the encyclopedia entry that this came from) Similarities between Minimalist Sculpture Much like minimalist painting, minimalist sculpture used extremely simple, monumental geometric forms made of fiberglass, plastic, sheet metal, or aluminum, either left raw or solidly painted with bright industrial color in order to convey the art for the usage of the visual response without allowing the art to create responses elsewhere. An example of Minimalist Sculpture is \\"Free Ride\\" by Tony Smith, which is a black geometrical structure the size of a door opening on a white background. Pop Art One of the last major avant-garde artforms that proved to be very influential to the American pop culture was Pop Art. This art form had much of its roots in Great Britain in the early 1950s, but made its way into the American culture by the late 1950s and remained a popular art form in America from the 1960s. Some of the famous practitioners of this era include Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Claes Oldenburg.\\"Pop art.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2010. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 . Similarities Pop art, also like minimalism, has clear commonalities between their pieces. Primarily, each piece uses commonplace items (comic strips, soup cans, road signs, and hamburgers) as the subject matter of their pieces. They emphatically present any iconography that has created a major impact on contemporary life without praise or condemnation but with overwhelming immediacy, and by means of the precise commercial techniques used by the media from which the iconography itself was borrowed. It was also an attempt to return to a more objective, universally acceptable form of art after the dominance in both the United States and Europe of the highly personal Abstract Expressionism. It was also iconoclastic, rejecting both the supremacy of the \\"high art\\" of the past and the pretensions of other contemporary avant-garde art. Pop art became a cultural event because of its close reflection of a particular social situation and because its easily comprehensible images were immediately exploited by the mass media. Despite its opposition to other avant-garde art forms at its time, Pop art was a derivative of Dada, especially praising the art of Marcel Duchamp, who with his \\"ready-mades\\" also praised many objects and imagery of American pop culture. Relationship Before the 1940s Before World War II there were some significant artists and art movements in the United States, but, according to sociologist Diana Crane, these art movements never were directly inspired by art movements from Europe. However, due to the numbers of immigrants from Europe who were involved with the avant-garde movement in Europe, Dadaist artists from Europe like Marcel Duchamp moved to America carrying their avant- garde ideals with them. Once they arrived in New York City, many of these Dadaists decided to collaborate, making art to display to the public. Initially, while the Dadaists brought some attention to the New York art scene, they had very little attention outside of it. Some factors that played to the lack of attention of the Dadaists at the time included the lack of museums throughout the United States and the lack of funding to the artists who created and advertised the art. Origins of European avant-garde According to Peter Burger, some of the theories involving aesthetics can come all the way back to the writings of Karl Marx. According to Burger, \\" For Marx, this development is not merely one in economic theory. Rather, he feels that the possibility of a progress in knowledge is a function of the development of the object toward which insight directs itself ... Marx demonstrates through the example of the category of labor also applies to objectifications in the arts ... it is only with aestheticism that the full unfolding of the phenomenon of art became a fact, and it is to aestheticism that the historical avant-garde movements respond\\". Besides from the idea of Karl Marx's influence over the avant-garde movement, much of the movement came through social commentary from the wars that were fought during the time of its rise. Dadaism, for instance, was seized upon by the group as appropriate for their anti-aesthetic creations and protest activities, which were engendered by disgust for bourgeois values and despair over World War I. Another example of this is John Hartfield's usage of photomontage to express his anti-Nazi views. Relationship between the 1950s and 1980s As previously stated, as soon as many of the Dadaist movement from Europe immigrated over to the United States in the 1920s, they started making their art and presenting the art to the people of New York. Although it didn't initially take off, by the 1950s, their art and the art from artists that were inspired by these individuals began to rise in popularity. There were a number of factors that lead to the rise of avant-garde art in the eyes of the American Popular Culture. First of all, due to the rise of the American Economy after World War II, the American Government focused on enhancing the importance of the Fine Arts. To do so, congress passed bills in which expanded the number of museums around the nation and funded the government to allow the artists to produce more art. Increasing the Museums Before the 1940s, Americans in many regions were unaware to the existence of avant-garde art because, according to Dore Ashton, \\"Although culture ... had penetrated the hinterland in the form of public libraries, literary societies, and even music circles, the plastic arts had ... lagged far behind\\" In order to increase the interest of the arts among the people and to allow them to be up-to-date with the rest of the world at that time, they decided to increase the number of museums in America from the 1940s to the 1980s. Government Funding the Artist Along with the construction of museums, the Federal Government also realized that, to increase the interest of the people, there needed to be more art available. In addition to this, if the artists were to do so, they would need to form communities in which the artists could gather to produce their art. According to Sharon Zukin, \\"... real-estate developers profited from the increase in property values that resulted from the creation of an artistic community in Manhattan's SoHo district while political leaders benefited from the creation of a large pool of arts-related jobs.\\" Another reason the Federal Government felt a need to fund the artists at this time was to increase the patriotism of the people. If there was art depicting how grand, majestic, and free the United States of America is, they felt this would increase Patriotism among the people so the people would be willing to agree with whatever the government had to offer. According to Sharon Zukin, \\"The willingness of federal and state governments to fund art and artists were political interests that used traveling exhibitions as propaganda for the American way of life. The influence of early avant-garde on later avant-garde When looking at all of the major movements of avant-garde that were influential from this time period, almost all of these art forms trace back to earlier avant-garde art forms, namely Dadaism. For instance, in practice, Abstract Expressionism was influenced by Dada by the fact that the art form had its similarities not in the way that the art was constructed, but rather from the concept that the genres exemplify. Pop Art also marks its influences from Dada because, like the \\"ready-mades\\" which used commonplace items in a way that they were not originally intended. For the case of Dada, the \\"ready-mades\\" consisted of items such as toilets as art. For the case of pop art, it could have been anything that proved influential in popular culture, whether it be comic strips, soup cans, or magazine advertisements. Another example of how an earlier avant-garde genre influenced a later genre was the example of Dada's influence of Punk fashion in the 1970s. Much like how the Dadaists used their art to reflect the ideal of the belief in nothing and the wish to become nothing through their art (as they often referred it as anti-art), the Punk culture used the same ideals for their fashion and their music (by describing their music as anti-music). In addition to the two matching the same ideal, both used their mediums to reflect the same approach: to shock the community through their art and to speak a political, often Marxist, message through their works. Relationship Between high culture and popular culture Stemming from its Dadaist beginnings, avant-garde was a movement that served as a contrast from typical Popular Culture. Under the guise of Dada, it started in Europe as a way to display their anti-art rhetoric as well as to communicate to the public their disgust for bourgeois values and their disapproval of World War I. In America, while the art was not much about protesting bourgeois values and the war, it still served as a way to protest against typical art values as well as to establish the high, artistic culture to contrast American popular culture.\\"Dada\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2010. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 Similarly, Abstract Expressionist and Minimalist art also served as a way to contrast popular culture. In Abstract Expressionist art, the approach to contrast from the depiction of real-world qualities by creating art using forms that do not exist in the real world. In Minimalist art, the approach was to contrast from the complicated works of the time, including those of fellow avant-garde genre Abstract Expressionism. Through this, the artist created their art with the sole intent of making art; not with a complicated political statement, not with a cultural reference, etc. It solely was art for art itself. However, Pop art and its practitioners, while continuing to do some contrast between high culture and popular culture, began to blur the two by using elements of popular culture and transforming those images in a way which were not the original intent of those elements, much like the ready-mades of the Dadaist artists before them. It sometimes came through subverting the images coloration, such as what Andy Warhol did with pictures of soup cans and actress Marilyn Monroe. In other times, it came through taking a comic strip out of its initial context and using that for a piece. However, despite trying to contrast the two, at many times many of the artists became celebrities in popular culture while practicing their contrast between that and the High Culture. Avant-garde's demise After the end of the Pop Art movement, many art critics began to question the rising generation of artists who were influenced by the Pop artists shortly before, even to the point that some considered avant-garde dead. There are various reasons, but three primary indications for its demise are:Blink-182 performing live in 2009. # In their beginnings, the pop artists made a distinction between American Pop Culture and High Culture by changing the intent on items that provided a major impact on American society. However, as time went on, many of these same artists whose goals were to subvert well-known icons to fit their art became celebrities themselves. As a result, since many avant-garde artists who supported the High Culture began to be well known in Popular culture, the differences between the two cultures were becoming less distinguishable as time went on. # By the time the 1990s approached, the Punk movement began to be part of the American culture. Indications of this transition include the rise of punk-inspired grunge music provided by bands like Nirvana and the rise of pop-punk bands such as Green Day and Blink 182. As punk music began to increase in popularity by this time, the lyrics, fashion, and the music itself began to be saturated by Popular Culture until the point where most of its avant-garde influence seemed to be transparent. # With the definition of high culture more vague than it was back in its inception, many artists attempted to create art that seemed similar to avant-garde, but rather than focusing on building up the High Culture, the art was rather made to create shock and to create art of the future. Such art that focused on shock and not about the social impact of the art were considered by art critics to be beginnings of Post-modernism.

Photo by Paolo Monti, 1969 The sandolo is a traditional, flat-bottomed Venetian rowing boat designed for the generally shallow waters of the Venetian Lagoon. The Italian plural is sandoli. Description A sandolo is less ornate and of a simpler build than a gondola, but both have a pointed, decorated metal nose. It is also lighter and smaller than a gondola,Robert Charles Davis, Garry Marvin, Venice, the tourist maze (2004), p. 146 and can be recognized at a glance, as it always lacks the benches and high steel prow (called ferro) which is seen on a gondola.George Goodchild The Lore of the Wanderer (2007 reprint), p. 95John Holmes Agnew, Walter Hilliard Bidwell, Eclectic magazine: foreign literature vol. 36 (Leavitt, Throw and Co., 1882), p. 766: \\"The sandolo is a boat shaped like the gondola, but smaller and lighter, without benches, and without the high steel prow or ferro which distinguishes the gondola.\\" The sandolo, like the larger craft, is rowed while standing up.Dorothea Ritter, John Julius Norwich, Venice in old photographs, 1841-1920 (Laurence King, 1994), p. 65: \\"The sandolo, a small, typically Venetian boat, is rowed, like the gondola, while standing up...\\" It can be fitted with a sail,Horatio F. Brown, Life on the Lagoons (2008 reprint), p. 155 and also with an in-board or outboard motor. In the past, the police used an extant variant of the sandolo called vipera, which differed in having no stem, being sharply pointed at both ends and constructed so that it can be rowed from either end.Damien Simonis, Venice (2004), p. 13 Space in the sandolo is limited, with enough room for one oarsman, aft, two passengers on the main seat, and two more passengers sitting on small stools towards the bow, although for greater comfort some writers advise one passenger, or two small passengers.Ginnie Siena-Bivona, Mitchel Whitington, Dorothy McConachie, Ghost Stories from Around the World (2004), p. 18 The traditional use of the sandolo is for recreation and racing, and it is considered one of the four principal types of boat used in and around Venice.J. J. Wilson, The Woodenboat (2000), pp. 25, 52, 56 Rather less stable than a gondola, it has a rocking motion all of its own.Mary Heaton Vorse, The breaking in of a yachtsman's wife (Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1908), p. 155: \\"Our sandolo darted off with its peculiar rocking motion\\". Although not often used for fishing, as such, the craft is used for collecting crabs and mussels,Geographical magazine, vol. 32 (1959), p. 66: \\"The journey from Venice to Chioggia takes about ninety minutes, with never a dull moment... always and ever the tiny sandolo boat busy about some crab- or mussel-bed.\\" while an early 20th-century writer noted that he had heard the sandolo called \\"the donkey cart of Venice\\".Joseph Henry Wade, Primer [first-fifth] reader, vol. 4 (Ginn & company, 1907), p. 187 The boat has also been called \\"without doubt one of if not the most graceful of all Venetian craft\\". Less manoevrable but lighter than a gondola, it was in the past used especially by boys, artists, and women.Margaretta M. Lovell, Venice: the American view, 1860-1920 (1984), p. 24 In Gondola Days (1897), Francis Hopkinson Smith (1838‚Äì1915) stated that the sandolo was \\"the only boat of really modern design, and this is rarely used as a fishing-boat\\". He went on to describe it as \\"a shallow skiff drawing but a few inches of water, and with bow and stern sharp and very low\\", and considered that it was originally intended for greater speed in boat racing.Francis Hopkinson Smith, Gondola Days (1897), pp. 99-100 Horatio Brown said in his Life on the Lagoons (1884), \\"The Venetians are not good boat- builders. The only boats they make successfully are gondolas and sandoli.Horatio F. Brown, Life on the Lagoons (1884), chapter 'Sails and Sailmaking', p. 152 In a later book he wrote, \\"The pleasantest way to go to Malamocco is to take a sandolo, if you can.Horatio Forbes Brown, In and around Venice (1905), pp. 175-177 Alexander Robertson said of Venice in 1898, \\"Their streets are canals, their carriages are gondolas and sandolos...\\"Alexander Robertson, The Bible of St. Mark, St. Mark's Church the Altar and Throne of Venice (1898), p. 80 References Category:Human-powered vehicles Category:Boat types Category:Water transport in Venice Category:Traditional boats Category:Rowing racing boats ","title":"Sandolo"},{"id":"29866822","text":"Peepalpahad is a village of Choutuppal mandal in the Nalgonda district in Telangana, India.

Grodecki's scientific research centered on medieval Poland, particularly the history of Polish coinage, monetary history and monetary policy under the Piast dynasty. Although he was not a numismatic himself, Grodecki was widely read by coin collectors of his day, and he engaged in academic discussions and polemics with the noted Polish numismatic Marian Gumowski. In addition to economic history, Grodecki published works on the general history of medieval Poland, focusing on Polish diplomacy of the period, the history of Silesia and the life of Duke Zbigniew, the older brother of Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth. Life Grodecki was born in Rzesz√≥w to Jan Grodecki, a tax official, and Karolina Gorylska. He spent his childhood in G≈Çog√≥w Ma≈Çopolski and attended school in Kolomyia and Bochnia. After completing a gymnasium he enrolled at the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w, in 1907. He published his first, KsiƒÖ≈ºƒôca w≈Ço≈õƒá trzebnicka na tle organizacji majƒÖtk√≥w ksiƒÖ≈ºƒôcych w Polsce w XII wieku, work in 1911, while still a student. This thesis became the basis for his doctorate, which he received a year later. Between 1914 and 1917 he served in the Polish Legions. he finished his studies after World War I, receiving his habilitation in 1920. In 1926 he became a part-time member of the Polish Academy of Learning. World War II and the Nazi invasion of Poland interrupted the existence of the organization and as a consequence Grodecki did not become a full member of the academy until 1946. World War II At the outbreak of World War II, Grodecki was already fifty years old but nonetheless an officer of the Polish army reserves. During the mobilization of the first days of the war he left Krak√≥w in order to join his unit. As a result he escaped the fate of many of his academic colleagues from the Jagiellonian University, who were arrested by the Germans during the Sonderaktion Krakau, and most of whom later perished in Nazi concentration camps. He spent most of the German occupation in Lwow. There he taught at the Underground University (higher education for Poles was banned by the Germans). Major works *Nieznane pieczƒôcie m.

References Category:Rivers of Romania Category:Rivers of Covasna County ","title":"Cire»ô (B√¢sca)"},{"id":"29867094","text":"Rhododendron periclymenoides, commonly called pink azalea and pinxter flower, is a species of shrub in the heath family. It is native to eastern North America, where it is widespread from Alabama to New Hampshire. It is often found in riparian areas, in wet to dry forests.Flora of North America This species produces showy pink flowers in the spring. They have long stamens; they carry a strong, sweet scent similar to petunias. The leaves are bright green and ovate. The trunk grows to be about tall. Like many members of the genus, the plant contains toxins in all parts of the flower. This species is a popular horticultural plant. There is an unconfirmed report of this species in O'Leno State Park in Columbia County, Florida along the Santa Fe River.  Description  Rhododendron periclymenoides occurs throughout the Eastern United States, from southern New York south to Georgia, with isolated populations in Midwestern states. This plant prefers habitats in swamp margins, moist woods and open areas with full to partial sunlight or high, open shade. Soils in which R. periclymenoides grows best are typically acidic, rich in hummus and retain moisture but should still have some drainage. Common ecosystems in which this plant can be found are oak-hickory, oak-pine- spruce- fir, maple-beech-birch and white- ed-jack pine. Common pollinators of R. periclymenoides are hummingbirds and butterflies.  Taxonomy  About 860 species belong to the genus Rhododendron. Rhododendron periclymenoides was first described by Michaux. A synonym of R. periclymenoides is R. nudiflorum but was synonymized in 1962 by Shinners.  Etymology  The genus name for Rhododendron comes from a combination of the Greek words ‚Äúrhodo‚Äù, meaning rose, and ‚Äúdendron‚Äù, meaning tree. One of the common names of R. periclymenoides is the ‚Äúpinxterbloom azalea‚Äù. ‚ÄúPinxter‚Äù is Dutch for the word Pentecost, a name used for the seventh Sunday after Easter. This is typically around the time when the flowers bloom.  Toxicity  Rhododendron periclymenoides is highly toxic and all parts of the plant are poisonous and could be fatal if ingested. The poisons produced by plants in the Rhododendron are known as grayanotoxins, which are a class of neurotoxins. These neurotoxins work by blocking the inactivation of sodium channel receptors, causing cell dysfunction. The specific grayonotoxin which R. periclymenoides employs is called andromedotoxin, and symptoms which occur after ingestion include salivation abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, paralysis and coma. The honey which is made by bees who collect pollen from genus Rhododendron spp. is referred to as ‚Äúmad honey‚Äù. Humans who ingest this honey begin exhibiting many of the symptoms listed above as well as hypotension and other irregularities of cardiac rhythm. Outside of ‚Äúmad honey‚Äù ingestion, human poisoning by Rhododendron is rare. However, pets and other livestock can still ingest the plant parts. While not common in the United States, ‚Äúmad honey‚Äù is believed to have medicinal qualities in China.  Insects and disease  Rhododendron periclymenoides is susceptible to problems caused by both insects and disease. Common insects which cause damage to R. periclymenoides are aphids, nematodes, borers, lace bug, mites and whitefly. Common diseases include crown and root rot, leaf spot and powdery mildew. Many of the wild R. periclymenoides have more resistance to these issues than the hybrids which are bred for gardens.  Horticulture  Rhododendron periclymenoides has been used in horticulture as an ornamental plant. Common landscape uses for the plant are as a foundation plant and as shrub borders. Both seeds and cuttings of the plant can be used for propagation. Since lack of proper drainage can lead to root rot, North Carolina State University advises the use of raised beds if the plant is going to be grown in soil that contains a lot of clay.  Management  Many animals and birds utilize shrubs like R. periclymenoides for cover on the forest floor. The roots also provide erosion control and protection for watersheds.  Fire ecology  According to the United States Forest Service, wildfires typically ‚Äútop kill‚Äù azaleas. After wildfires have come through an area, R. periclymeniodes can resprout from subsurface structures.

Freudenberg IT is headquartered at Weinheim, Germany. In 2009, Freudenberg IT crossed US$100 million in annual revenue. History Freudenberg IT (FIT) is part of Freudenberg Group of companies. Around 1995, Freudenberg Group was faced with a question many companies encounter: that of whether to transfer its in-house IT services to a third party. Following comprehensive external benchmarking, the group made a decision to take an entirely different path by achieving legal independence and entering into business transactions with third parties i.e. becoming an IT spinoff. An independent entity Freudenberg Informatik KG was created which was later renamed as Freudenberg IT. Today Freudenberg IT or FIT is Germany's most successful IT spinoff, realizing more than three-fourths of its revenue from external customers. In Germany Freudenberg IT is located at Weinheim, Balingen, D√ºsseldorf, Munich and Hamburg. Their first office outside Germany was in Barcelona, Spain.

It was formed in April 1943 at Townsville, Queensland, as part of North-Eastern Area Command. Led by Group Captain Charles Eaton, the wing soon deployed to Merauke, Dutch New Guinea, where it comprised three squadrons flying CAC Boomerang and P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, and A-31 Vengeance dive bombers. Eaton was succeeded by Group Captain Allan Walters in mid-1943. No. 72 Wing took part in the defence of Torres Strait, undertaking interception, patrol and occasional ground-attack and anti-shipping duties. By July 1944, its original squadrons had all been disbanded or transferred to other operational formations. No. 120 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron, which had arrived in May 1944, operating Kittyhawks, remained at Merauke until February 1945. The wing headquarters returned to Australia that May, and disbanded the following month. History alt=Informal portrait of man with short dark hair in light-coloured open-necked military shirt, holding a pipe No. 72 Wing was formed on 23 April 1943 at Townsville, Queensland, under the command of Group Captain Charles Eaton. Early the next month, its headquarters deployed to Merauke, described by the official history of the RAAF in World War II as \\"a desolate marshy little port in Dutch New Guinea\\".Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 113AWM, Squadrons, Formations & Units of the Royal Australian Air Force and Their Deployment, p. 119 Controlling No. 84 Squadron (flying CAC Boomerang fighters), No. 86 Squadron (P-40 Kittyhawk fighters), and No. 12 Squadron (A-31 Vengeance dive bombers), the wing's purpose was to assist in the defence of Torres Strait.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 113‚Äì116 The Boomerangs, operating out of Horn Island, undertook air defence and patrol tasks in and around western New Guinea, first making contact with enemy forces on 16 May 1943; they exchanged fire with three Japanese bombers, but the latter escaped into cloud. Merauke airfield was only completed in late June, and Nos. 86 and 12 Squadrons began arriving early the next month; by then the wing had also acquired No. 44 Operational Base Unit and its own medical receiving station and mobile fighter sector headquarters. Eaton's relations with North-Eastern Area Command in Townsville had meanwhile became strained. In his opinion, \\"the problems of Merauke were not understood from there ... mountains were made out of molehills\\", and he was posted that July to lead a bombing and gunnery establishment in South Australia. Later in the year he would form No. 79 Wing at Batchelor, Northern Territory.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 215‚Äì218 alt=Four single-seat piston-engined fighter aircraft flying in formation Group Captain Allan Walters, formerly in charge of No. 1 (Fighter) Wing in Darwin, assumed command of No. 72 Wing following Eaton's reassignment.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 141‚Äì142 Enemy contact was generally sporadic and inconclusive, but on 9 September 1943 a force of over thirty Japanese bombers and escorting fighters heading for Merauke were intercepted by fourteen of No. 72 Wing's Kittyhawks and four of its Boomerangs; although most of the Kittyhawks' guns failed to fire through oil clogging, and none of the Boomerangs made contact, the Australian aircraft claimed one bomber and two fighters destroyed without loss. No. 12 Squadron became fully operational at Merauke in September, but was mainly given patrol duty and only rarely saw enemy activity. The following month, No. 84 Squadron converted to Kittyhawks and transferred to a new formation, No. 75 Wing, which controlled units on Horn Island, Thursday Island and Higgins Field. During late 1943 and early 1944, No. 86 Squadron was actively engaged in air defence, enjoying some success against Japanese bombers and their escorts, as well as participating in attacks on infrastructure and shipping in Dutch New Guinea. No. 86 Squadron departed Merauke on 25 April 1944; the squadron was subsequently reduced to a cadre and its Kittyhawks transferred to Nos. 78 and 81 Wings of No. 10 Operational Group on Noemfoor Island.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 227RAAF Historical Section, Fighter Units, p. 92 It was replaced by the Dutch-Australian No. 120 Squadron, which arrived from Canberra in early May and became operational on the 9th of the month.RAAF Historical Section, Fighter Units, p. 101 The same month, Walters handed over command of the wing to Group Captain Bill Hely.

It originates east of Donner Ridge and north of Donner Lake in the Tahoe‚ÄìDonner Golf Course and flows through the town of Truckee, California, to its confluence with the Truckee River in Nevada County, California, just west of Highway 267. Trout Creek restoration project Historically, Trout Creek was re-routed for development of downtown Truckee, to power a lumber mill in a flume, channelized, and used to feed ponds for ice harvesting and logging. None of the lower portion of the creek follows its original channel and a large portion has been channelized within a concrete flume between Jibboom Street and Donner Pass Road. The Town of Truckee is working to restore Trout Creek in order to: * Restore the natural function of the creek. * Improve ecological value by creating riparian and aquatic habitat. * Improve water quality by managing local water runoff. * Provide flood protection. * Improve recreational and aesthetic value of the creek. The restoration is on the section of the creek from its I-80 undercrossing east of Bridge Street, under Donner Pass Road, past the Lumber Yard, through the Railyard Development area, and to the Union Pacific Railroad right of way line, which is immediately north of the Truckee River. Ecology Observed species include a variety of birds, including killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), belted kingfisher (Ceryle alcyon), hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), Steller's jay (Cyanocitta stelleri), common raven (Corvus corax), mountain chickadee (Poecile gambell), white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis). brown creeper (Certhia americana), and dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) and several mammals. including California ground squirrel (Spermophilys beecheyi), North American beaver (Castor canadensis), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). The primary fish species that are present through the project reach are brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus myklss), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and Paiute sculpin (Cottus beldingi). All of these fish species, except for the sculpin, are introduced species. The presence of highly aggressive salmonids, such as non-native rainbow trout, probably depredated the historically native, federally listed, Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi). North American beaver (Castor canadensis) are now prevalent on Trout Creek, and have built over 30 dams from the bridge on Donner Pass Road to the Truckee River. Beaver were re-introduced to the Tahoe Basin by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) and the U. S. Forest Service between 1934 and 1949 in order to prevent stream degradation and to promote wetland restoration. That beaver were once native to the area is supported by the fact that the Washo have a word for beaver, c'imh√©lhel and the northern Paiute of Walker Lake, Honey Lake and Pyramid Lake have a word for beaver su-i'-tu-ti-kut'-teh. When Stephen Powers visited the northern Paiute to collect Indian materials for the Smithsonian Institution in preparation for the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, he reported that the northern Paiute wrapped their hair in strips of beaver fur, made medicine from parts of beaver and that their creation legend included beaver. In addition, fur trapper Stephen Hall Meek \\"set his traps on the Truckee River in 1833\\", which strongly suggests that he saw beaver or beaver sign. The presence of beaver dams has been shown to either increase the number of fish, their size, or both, in a study of brook, rainbow and brown trout in nearby Sagehen Creek, which flows into the Little Truckee River at an altitude of and is a stream typical of the eastern slope of the northern Sierra Nevada. Not only have aspen and cottonwood survived ongoing beaver colonization but a recent study of ten Tahoe streams utilizing aerial multispectral videography, including Trout Creek and Cold Creek, has shown that deciduous, thick and thin herbaceous vegetation has increased near beaver dams, whereas coniferous trees are decreased. Benefits of beaver dams include removal of sediment and excessive pollutants travelling downstream, which improves water clarity, which was shown to worsen when beaver dams were recently removed in nearby Taylor Creek and Ward Creek. Flooding from beaver dams is relatively inexpensively controlled with flow devices.

It is located outside the walls of the Old City about northwest of Jaffa Gate in the centre of the Mamilla Cemetery. With a capacity of 30,000 cubic metres, it is connected by an underground channel to Hezekiah's Pool in the Christian Quarter of the Old City. It was thought as possible that it has received water via the so-called Upper or High-Level Aqueduct from Solomon's Pools, but 2010 excavations have discovered the aqueduct's final segment at a much lower elevation near the Jaffa Gate, making it impossible to function as a feeding source for the Mamilla Pool. Etymology There are a number of theories on the origin of the name Mamilla. John Gray writes that it may be a corruption of the Hebrew word for 'the filler' (m'malle'), though that is uncertain.A history of Jerusalem, John Gray, Praeger, 1969, p. 49 Others indicate it may have been named for its sponsor, Mamilla or Maximilla, or for a church that once stood near the pool that was dedicated to a saint named Mamilla or Babila. History The pool's original date of construction is unknown. Roman period During the rule of Herod the Great (37 - 4 BCE), improvements were made to the water supply system in Jerusalem. Two new pools constructed during his reign, the Pool of the Towers and the Serpent's Pool (Birket es-Sultan), were fed by the Mamilla Pool via aqueducts. Itzik Schwiki of the Jerusalem Center Site Preservation Council attributes the construction of the Mamilla Pool itself to Herod. Byzantine period Following the Persian capture of Jerusalem from the Byzantines in 614, a large number of Christians were reportely massacred by Jews at the pool.Jerusalem blessed, Jerusalem cursed: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in the Holy City from David's time to our own.

Life and career A self-taught chef, Patterson was born in Lynn, Massachusetts. His mother was a French and history teacher, and his father John Patterson is a lawyer. He says his family's frequent travels to France influenced his views on food. He began working as a restaurant dishwasher at age 14, and attended Duke University before dropping out. In 1989 he moved to Sonoma, California with then- girlfriend (and later wife) Elizabeth Ramsey. With Ramsey, Patterson opened Babette's, a French-inspired restaurant, in Sonoma in 1994 at age 25. The restaurant subsequently closed in 1999 when his lease expired. Wine Spectator described it as a \\"top\\" restaurant in the town. Patterson and Ramsey opened Elizabeth Daniel in 2000, and closed it on New Years Day, 2004 due to slow business despite a strong reputation. He was opening chef at Frisson, a short- lived restaurant that incorporated elements of aromatherapy and molecular gastronomy. Coi, which he opened in 2006, earned two Michelin stars, and was one of several restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area to earn four stars from the San Francisco Chronicle. Patterson describes its concept as combining haute cuisine, an emphasis on local vegetables, a modern aesthetic, and a personal approach to cooking, with \\"a casual, neighborhood feeling\\". The approach was uncommon at the time, but later became a hallmark of Northern California restaurants. His cooking at Coi involves foraging for wild ingredients, using aromas and essential oils (including asking patrons to rub grapefruit oil on their hands before a dish, or placing inedible fragrant flowers on a dish), and making his own ingredients (for example, butter churned in-house). He opened an informal rotisserie, Il Cane Rosso (\\"the red dog\\" in Italian), in the San Francisco Ferry Building with co-owner Lauren Kiino, before selling the business to her entirely. He opened restaurants Plum in Uptown Oakland in 2010 and Haven in Oakland's Jack London Square in 2012. In 2017, Patterson partnered with LA chef Roy Choi to open the fast food concept restaurant Locol, which received the LA Times Restaurant of the Year award before closing in 2018. Patterson lives in Oakland, California, and is married to Labor attorney Alexandra Foote. Writing Patterson also writes about food. He is an occasional contributor to New York Times Magazine, Food & Wine Magazine, and San Francisco Magazine. In 2004 he wrote The Magic of Essential Oils in Food and Fragrance together with co-author Mandy Aftel, a noted perfume maker. \\"To the Moon, Alice\\" (a reference to Alice Waters of Chez Panisse) published in 2005, generated considerable controversy for criticizing the tendency of San Francisco restaurants to copy the Chez Panisse style and approach, which he said resulted in self-righteousness over ingredients and a lack of creativity, complexity, or technical finesse. He also criticized San Francisco diners for avoiding food they considered too fancy, while paying similar prices for restaurants that featured home-style cooking, as a form of affected populism. One quote from the essay that is often repeated is: \\"so deeply embedded is the mythology of Chez Panisse in the DNA of local food culture that it threatens to smother stylistic diversity and extinguish the creativity that it originally sought to spark.‚Äù Awards and recognition *Best New Chef, Food & Wine Magazine, 1997 *Rising Star Chef, San Francisco Chronicle, 1997 *Best New Restaurant, James Beard Foundation, 2001 (for Elizabeth Daniel) *Chef of the Year, San Francisco Magazine, 2007 *Best Chef: Pacific (nominee), James Beard Foundation, 2009 and 2010 References External links *To the Moon, Alice? - controversial New York Times essay Category:American chefs Category:American male chefs Category:American restaurateurs Category:Living people Category:Head chefs of Michelin starred restaurants Category:Cuisine of the San Francisco Bay Area Category:James Beard Foundation Award winners Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Daniel Patterson (chef)"},{"id":"29868142","text":"Kirby at USC c. 1948 Jack Kirby was a player in the National Football League.

From the Spring and Autumn period (8th‚Äì5th centuries) onward, the canals of China were used for army transportation and supply, as well as colonization of new territories. From the Qin (3rd century ) to the Qing (17th‚Äì20th centuries), China's canal network was also essential to imperial taxation-in-kind. Control of shipbuilding and internal tariffs were also administered along the canals.  History   Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods In 647, the State of Jin suffered major crop failure. Duke Mu of Qin despatched a large fleet of ships manned by Corv√©e labour from his capital at Yong (Èõç) in modern- day Fengxiang County, Shaanxi Province. The ships carried several thousands of tons of cereal and proceeded along the Wei, Yellow and Fen Rivers before arriving at the Jin capital Jiang (Áªõ) (south east of modern-day Yicheng County, Shanxi Province). Later, in 486, King Fuchai of Wu linked the Yangtze and Huai Rivers by excavating the Han Ravine (ÈÇóÊ≤ü) so that water flowed from the Yangtze through the Lakes Fanliang (Ê®äÊ¢ÅÊπñ), Bozhi (ÂçöËäùÊπñ) and Sheyang (Â∞ÑÈò≥Êπñ) into the Wei at Huai'an. This waterway was subsequently used to transport provisions for the army. Three years afterwards King Fuchai further extended the Han Ravine via the Heshui Canal (Ëç∑Ê∞¥ËøêÊ≤≥) to connect with the Si River in Shandong Province. Qin dynasty In 214 the first Chinese Emperor Qin Shi Huang ordered construction of a canal connecting the Xiang River and the Lijiang in order to supply his troops for an attack on the Xiongnu nomads. Designed by Shi Lu (Âè≤Á•ø), the resulting Lingqu Canal is the oldest contour canal in the world. p. 636 This canal along with the Zhengguo Canal in Shaanxi Province and the Dujiangyan Irrigation System in Sichuan Province are known as ‚ÄúThe three great hydraulic engineering projects of the Qin dynasty‚Äù. Han dynasty During the Chu‚ÄìHan Contention (206-202), General Xiao He used the Wei River to transport provisions for his army, thereby creating an effective logistics supply network. In 129, the sixth year of Emperor Wu, a canal was cut through the northern foothills of the Qin Mountains running parallel to the Wei River linking Tong Pass with Chang‚Äôan and greatly reducing the amount of time needed to transport goods between the two cities. Sui and Tang dynasties Although the Sui dynasty lasted only 37 years from 581 until 618, its rulers made a major contribution to improving the canal system. The Grand Canal became a major factor in economic growth and political unity by connecting north and south, allowing transport of tax grain and control of the sale of salt.Samuel Adrian M. Adshead. T'ang China: The Rise of the East in World History. (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004; ), p. 50. The Hai, Yellow, Huai, Yangtze and Qiantang Rivers were all interlinked through the construction of canals thus laying the groundwork for further development during later dynasties. These were the Guangtong Canal (Âª£ÈÄöÊ∏†), Tongji Canal (ÈÄöÊøüÊ∏†), Shanyang Channel (Â±±ÈôΩÁÄÜ) and Yongji Canal (Ê∞∏ÊøüÊ∏†) which formed the basis of a large scale canal based transport network. At the time of Emperor Jingzong of Tang (r. 824-827) the canal system had become too shallow. This restricted the movement of salt and iron which were important government monopolies so to solve the problem seven rivers were diverted to the east. Song dynasty During the Song dynasty the capital Daliang (Â§ßÊ¢Å), modern day Kaifeng, used the Bian Yellow, Huimin (ÊÉ†Ê∞ëÊ≤≥) and Guangji (ÂπøÊµéÊ≤≥) Rivers as part of the canal network. In 976 CE during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Song more than 55 million bushels of grain were moved along the Bian River to the capital. By the time of Emperor Renzong of Song (r. 1022-763) the amount had increased to 80 million bushels. Yuan dynasty The Yuan Dynasty saw the establishment of a government body in the form of a \\"Si\\" (Âè∏) near the capital to oversee the canal system. Known as the Huai & Yangtze Rivers Grain Transport Office, (Ê±üÊ∑ÆÈÉΩÊºïËøêÂè∏) this was an offshoot of the Three Departments and Six Ministries of the administrative third grade or \\"San Pin\\" (‰∏âÂìÅ). This office was responsible for arranging grain transportation to the Luan River (Êª¶Ê≤≥) then onwards to the capital at Dadu (modern day Beijing) using more than 3,000 boats. Sea-based transportation within the grain taxation system was also important with canals playing a subsidiary role. Ming dynasty Former yamen of the canal system's governor-general at Huai'an, Jiangsu Province. In 1368, the first year of the reign of the Ming Hongwu Emperor, the Capital Grain Transport Office (‰∫¨ÁïøÈÉΩÊºïËøêÂè∏) was established under the auspices of a fourth grade (ÂõõÂìÅ) commissioner. At the same time, the canal system's governor-general's office was set up in the prefectural capital of Huai'an, Jiangsu Province. Its responsibilities were to manage the canal network and ensure that annual grain shipments remained at around 40 million tons. Boatyards were also established in Anqing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jiujiang, Zhangshu and Raozhou (È•∂Â∑û) (modern day Poyang County). At Huai'an, a boatyard northwest of the Yangtze River ran for a distance of 23 Chinese miles (c. . Overall responsibility for all these locations lay with a department of the Ministry of Works. Every year, regulations fixed the total amount of tax payable by the entire country in grain via the canal system at 29.5 million bushels. Of this, 12 million bushels were allocated to local governments, 8 million bushels supported the army on the northern border, 1.2 million bushels went to the capital in Nanjing whilst 8.2 million bushels were used to supply Beijing. From 1415 onwards, imperial regulations stated that the grain taxation system should use only the country's canal network; thereafter all seaborne transportation stopped. This situation remained virtually unchanged until the beginning of the 19th century and as a result, during both the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the volume of the grain tax transported via the Grand Canal far exceeded that of the preceding Yuan Dynasty. During the Ming dynasty the usage pattern of the canal system went through three successive phases. At first the \\"zhiyun\\" (ÊîØËøê) variant evolved as grain tax transportation switched from the sea to the country's canal and river network. At Huai‚Äôan, Xuzhou, Linqing and other locations, warehouses were established to store taxes paid in grain and delivered by the local population. This was then shipped north to provision the army once every quarter. Storage became unnecessary with the advent of the \\"duiyun\\" (ÂÖëËøê) form where taxes paid by the common people were partly used to directly pay the transportation fees for army supplies on the journey north.\\"History of Ming\\" Food Commodities Chapter 3„ÄäÊòéÂè≤‚Ä¢È£üË¥ßÂøó‰∏â„Äã During the third stage known as \\"changyun\\" (ÈïøËøê) or \\"gaidui\\" (ÊîπÂÖå), the army took responsibility for the movement of grain from south of the Yangtze River.

In 1825 during the reign of the Daoguang Emperor a maritime shipping office was established in Shanghai with a grain tax receiving station at Tianjin. Qishan and other senior ministers thereafter managed the first grain shipments by sea. Operations in Tianjin quickly grew to outstrip those based in Linqing, Shandong Province. Before the First Opium War of 1839-42 and the Second Opium War (1856-60), yearly grain-tax maritime shipments reached around 4 million bushels of grain per annum. A series of events towards the end of the Qing dynasty led to the ultimate decline of the canal system: * On the 21July 1842, during the later stages of the First Opium War, British troops attacked and occupied Zhenjiang near the confluence of the Grand Canal and Yangtze River, effectively blocking operation of the canal system and its grain taxes. As a result, the Qing Daoguang Emperor decided to sue for peace and agreed to sign the Treaty of Nanking which brought hostilities to an end. * The Taiping Rebellion of 1850-64 resulted in the loss of Nanjing and the Anhui segment of the Yangtze River for ten years from 1853 onwards thereby curtailing the canal network. During the war with the rebels, major canal side towns including Yangzhou, Qingjiangpu (Ê∏ÖÊ±üÊµ¶), Linqing, Suzhou and Hangzhou suffered serious damage or were razed to the ground. *After the Yellow River changed course in its floods between 1851 and 1855, the canals in the Shandong region gradually silted up. Thereafter, the principal routes for grain shipment were maritime. *In 1872, an office to promote investment in steamships was established in Shanghai when steamships became the official vessels used within the grain-tax system. *All canal-based traffic of the grain tax ceased in 1901. *The post of canal system's governor-general was abolished in 1904 *1911 saw the opening of the Jinpu railway linking Tianjin and Zhenjiang such that the importance of the Grand Canal and the towns along its banks significantly dropped.

Device drivers are programs which allow software or higher-level computer programs to interact with a hardware device. These software components act as a link between the devices and the operating systems, communicating with each of these systems and executing commands. They provide an abstraction layer for the software above and also mediate the communication between the operating system kernel and the devices below. Usually the operating systems comes with a support for the common device drivers and usually the hardware vendors provide the device driver for their hardware devices for most platforms. The aggressive scaling of the hardware devices and the complex software components has made the device driver development process cumbersome and complex. When the size and functionality of the drivers started increasing the device drivers became a key factor in defining the reliability of the system. This has created an incentive towards automatic synthesis and verification of device drivers. This article sheds some light into some approaches in synthesis and verification of device drivers. Motivation for automatic driver synthesis and verification Device drivers are the principal failing component in most systems. The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) project found that OS crashes are predominantly caused by poorly written device driver code.Archana Ganapathi, Viji Ganapathi and David Patterson. \\"Windows XP kernel crash analysis\\". In Proceedings of the 2006 Large Installation System Administration Conference, 2006. In Windows XP, drivers account for 85% of the reported failures. In the Linux kernel 2.4.1 device driver code accounts for about 70% of the code size.A. Chou, J. Yang, B. Chelf, S. Hallem and D. Engler. An Empirical Study of Operating Systems Errors. In SOSP, 2001 The driver fault can crash the whole system as it is running in the kernel mode. These findings resulted in various methodologies and techniques for verification of device drivers. An alternative was to develop techniques which can synthesize device drivers robustly. Less human interaction in the development process and proper specification of the device and operating systems can lead to more reliable drivers. The other motivation for driver synthesis, is the large number of flavors of operating systems and device combinations. Each of these has its own set of input/output control and specifications which makes support of hardware devices on each of the operating systems difficult. So the ability to use a device with an operating system requires the availability of corresponding device driver combination. Hardware vendors usually supply the drivers for Windows, Linux and Mac OS but due to the high development or porting costs and technical support difficulties they are unable to provide drivers on all platforms. An automated synthesis technique can help the vendors in providing drivers to support any devices on any operating system. Verification of Device Drivers There are two challenges that limit testing the device drivers. *It is very hard to determine the exact operation or time when there is a fault in the interaction between driver and the kernel. The system could go into some inconsistent state and the crash is reported after a long time, blurring the real cause of the crash. *The drivers which work properly in normal circumstances can go wrong in rare and exceptional cases and the traditional testing techniques may not help in detecting the corner case behavior of the drivers. The wave of verification of device drivers was initiated by Microsoft through their SLAM project as early as the year 2000. The motivation for the project was that 500,000 crashes reported a day were found to be caused by one video driver, leading to concern about the great vulnerability in using complex device drivers. More details can be found here, in the speech delivered by Bill Gates. A large number of static and runtime techniques have since been proposed for bug detection and isolation. Static Analysis Static analysis means analyzing the program to check whether it complies with the safety-critical properties specified. For example, the system software should conform to rules such as \\"check user permissions before writing to kernel data structures\\", \\"don't reference null pointer without check\\", \\"prohibit overflowing buffer size\\" etc. Such checks can be made without actually executing the code being checked. Using the traditional testing process (dynamic execution) requires writing many test cases to exercise these paths and drive the system into error states. This process can take a long time and effort and is not a practical solution. Another theoretically possible approach is manual inspection, but this is impractical in modern systems in which millions of lines of code are involved, making the logic too complex to be analyzed by humans. Compiler Techniques The rules that have a straightforward mapping to source code can be checked using a compiler. Rule violations can be found by checking if the source operation does not make sense. For example, rules like \\"enabling an interrupt after being disabled\\" can be checked by looking at the order of function calls. But if the source code type system cannot specify the rules in its semantics, then the compilers cannot catch errors of that kind. Many type-safe languages allow memory safety violations resulting from unsafe type casting to be detected by compiler. Another approach is to use meta-level compilation (MC),.Engler, Dawson and Chelf, Benjamin and Chou, Andy and Hallem, Seth. \\"Checking system rules using system-specific, programmer-written compiler extensions\\". In Proceedings of the 4th conference on Symposium on Operating System Design and Implementation, 2000 Metacompilers constructed for this purpose may extend the compilers with lightweight, system specific checkers and optimizers. These extensions need to be written by system implementers in a high level language and dynamically linked to the compilers to do strict static analysis. Software Model Checking Software model checking is the algorithmic analysis of programs to prove properties of their executions.Jhala, Ranjit and Majumdar, Rupak. \\"Software model checking\\". In ACM Computation Survey. 2009 This automates the reasoning about the program behavior with respect to the given correct specifications. Model checking and symbolic execution are used to verify the safety-critical properties of device drivers. The input to the model checker is the program and the temporal safety properties. The output is the proof that the program is correct or a demonstration that there exists a violation of the specification by means of a counterexample in the form of a specific execution path. The tool SDV (Static Driver Verifier)Thomas Ball, Ella Bounimova, Byron Cook, Vladimir Levin, Jakob Lichtenberg, Con McGarvey, Bohus Ondrusek, Sriram Rajamani. and Abdullah Ustuner. \\"Thorough static analysis of device drivers\\", In SIGOPS Oper. Syst. Rev, Vol. 40, 2006. from Microsoft uses static analysis for windows device drivers. The back end analysis engine SLAM used model checking and symbolic execution for compile time static verification. The rules that are to be observed by the drivers for each API are specified in a C like language SLIC (Specification Language for Interface Checking). The analysis engine finds all paths which can lead to violations of the API usage rules and are presented as source level error paths through the driver source code. Internally, it abstracts the C code into a boolean program and a set of predicates which are rules that are to be observed on this program. Then it uses the symbolic model checkingMcMillan, Kenneth L. \\"Symbolic Model Checking\\". Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1993. to validate the predicates on the boolean program. The model checker BLAST (Berkeley Lazy Abstraction Software verification Tool)Thomas A. Henzinger, Ranjit Jhala, Rupak Majumdar and Gregoire Sutre. \\"Software Verification with BLAST\\". In SPIN, 2003. is used to find memory safety and incorrect locking errors in Linux kernel code. It uses an abstraction algorithm called lazy abstractionThomas A.

It has been successful in verifying temporal safety properties of C programs with up to 50K lines of code. It is also used to determine if a change in the source code affects the proof of property in the previous version and is demonstrated on a Windows device driver. AvinuxH. Post,W.

In 7th OSDI, 2006. is a low overhead system for detecting and recovering from type safety violations in device drivers. With only 4% changes to the source code of Linux network drivers they were able to implement SafeDrive and give better protection and recovery to Linux kernel. A similar project using hardware to isolate the device drivers from the main kernel is Nook.Michael M. Swift, Steven Martin, Henry M. Levy, and Susan J. Eggers. \\"Nooks: an architecture for reliable device drivers \\". In 10th ACM SIGOPS, 2002. They place device drivers in separate hardware protection domain called \\"nooks\\" and they have separate permission setting for each pages making sure that a driver does not modify pages which are not in its domain but can read all kernel data since they share the same address space. Another similar work in this area is on automatic recovery of operating systems due to driver faults. MINIX 3Jorrit N. Herder, Herbert Bos, Ben Gras, Philip Homburg, and Andrew S. Tanenbaum. \\"MINIX 3: a highly reliable, self- repairing operating system\\". In SIGOPS Oper. Syst. Rev. 40, 2006. is an operating system which can isolate major faults, defects are detected and failing components are replaced on the fly. Device driver Synthesis An alternative to verification and isolation of faults is to deploy techniques in device driver development process to make it more robust. Given a device specification and operating system functions, one method is to synthesize device driver for that device. This helps to reduce the human introduced errors as well as the cost and time involved in developing the system software. All the synthesis methods rely on some form of specification from the hardware device manufacturers and operating system functions. Interface Specification Languages Hardware operating code is usually low level and is prone to errors. The code development engineer rely on the hardware documentation which typically contains imprecise or inaccurate information. There are several Interface Definition Languages (IDL) to express the hardware functionalities. The modern OSes uses these IDLs to glue components or to hide heterogeneity, like remote procedural call IDL. The same applies to hardware functionalities as well. In this section we discuss writing device drivers in domain specific languages which helps to abstract the low level coding and use specific compilers to generate the code. DevilFabrice Merillon, Laurent Reveillere, Charles Consel, Renaud Marlet, and Gilles Muller. \\" Devil: an IDL for hardware programming\\". In Proceedings of the 4th conference on Symposium on Operating System Design & Implementation, Vol. 4, 2000. allows high level definition of the communication with the device. The hardware components are expressed as I/O ports and memory-mapped registers. These specifications are then converted to a set of C macros which can be called from the driver code and thus eliminates the error induced by programmer while writing low level functions. NDLChristopher L. Conway and Stephen A. Edwards. \\"NDL: a domain- specific language for device drivers\\". ACM SIGPLAN Notices 39, 2004. is an enhancement to Devil, describing the driver in terms of its operational interface. It uses the Devil's interface definition syntax and includes set of register definitions, protocols for accessing those registers and a collection of device functions. Device functions are then translated into a series of operations on that interface. For a device driver generation, one have to first write the driver functionalities in these interface specification languages and then use a compiler which will generate the low level driver code. HAIL (Hardware Access Interface Language)J. Sun, W. Yuan, M. Kallahalla, and N. Islam. \\"HAIL: A Language for Easy and Correct Device Access\\". In Proc. of ACM Conference on Embedded Software, 2005. is another domain-specific device driver specification language. The driver developer needs to write the following. # Register map description, which describes various device registers and bit fields from the device data sheet. # Address space description for accessing the bus. # Instantiation of the device in the particular system. # Invariant specification, which constraints accessing the device. The HAIL compiler takes these inputs and translates the specification into C code.  Hardware Software Co-design  In hardware software co- design, the designer specifies the structure and behavior of the system using finite state machines which communicate among themselves. Then a series of testing, simulation and formal verification are done on these state machines before deciding which components go into the hardware and which of these into the software. The hardware is usually done in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), whereas the software part is translated into low-level programming language. This approach mostly applies in embedded systems which is defined as a collection of programmable parts that interact continuously with environment through sensors. Existing techniquesFelice Balarin et al. \\"Hardware-Software Co-design of Embedded Systems. The POLIS Approach.\\" Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1997. are intended for generating simple micro-controllers and their drivers. Standalone Driver Synthesis In the standalone synthesis both the device and the system software are done separately. The device is modeled using any Hardware Description Language (HDL) and the software developer does not have access to the HDL specifications. The hardware developers put forth the device interface in the data sheet for the device. From the data sheet, the driver developer extracts register and memory layout of the device and the behavioral model in the form of finite state machines. This is expressed in the domain specific languages described in the Interface language section. Final step involves generating the code from these specifications. The tool TermiteLeonid Ryzhyk, Peter Chubb, Ihor Kuz, Etienne Le Sueur, and Gernot Heiser. \\"Automatic device driver synthesis with Termite\\". In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, 2009. takes three specifications to generate the driver. # Device specification : The device register, memory and interrupt services specification obtained from the device data sheet. #Device class specification : This can be obtained from the relevant device I/O protocol standard. For example, for ethernet the Ethernet LAN standard describes the common behavior of these controller devices. This is usually encoded as a set of events like packet transmission, completion of auto negotiation and link status change etc. #OS specification : This describes the OS interface with the driver. More specifically the request OS can make to the driver, the order of these requests and what the OS expects the driver in return for these requests. It defines a state machine where each transition corresponds to a driver invocation by OS, the callback made by driver or a protocol specified event. Given these specifications Termite will generate the driver implementation that translates any valid sequence of OS request into a sequence of device commands. Due to formal specification of the interfaces, Termite can generate the driver code which holds the safety and liveness properties. Another very interesting hacking effort has been done by RevNIC,Vitaly Chipounov and George Candea. \\"Reverse Engineering of Binary Device Drivers with RevNIC\\". 5th ACM SIGOPS/EuroSys, 2010. which generates a driver state machine by reverse engineering an existing driver to create inter-portable and safe drivers for new platforms. To reverse engineer a driver, it wiretaps the hardware I/O operations by executing the driver using symbolic and concrete executions. The output of the wiretap is fed to a synthesizer, which reconstructs a control flow graph of the original driver from these multiple traces along with the boilerplate template for the corresponding device class. Using these methods, the researchers have ported some Windows drivers for network interfaces to other Linux and embedded operating systems. Criticism While many of the static analysis tools are widely used, many of the driver synthesis and verification tools have not seen widespread acceptance in practice. One of the reasons is that drivers tend to support multiple devices and the driver synthesis work usually generates one driver per device supported which can potentially lead to a large number of drivers. Another reason is drivers also do some processing and the state machine model of drivers cannot depict processing.Asim Kadav and Michael M. Swift \\"Understanding Modern Device Drivers\\" In Proceedings of the 17th ACM Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems Conclusion The various verification and synthesis techniques surveyed in this article have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, runtime fault isolation has performance overhead, whereas the static analysis does not cover all classes of errors. The complete automation of device driver synthesis is still in its early stages and has a promising future research direction. Progress will be facilitated if the many languages available today for interface specification can eventually consolidate into a single format, which is supported universally by device vendors and operating systems teams. The payoff from such a standardization effort could be the realization of completely automated synthesis of reliable device drivers in the future.

Passengers, the media, and the ATSB praised de Crespigny for his professional handling of the emergency, and in 2016 he was awarded the Order of Australia for his contributions to aviation safety. He has since written a two books QF32, detailing the flight and it's aftermath, and FLY! \\\\- the Elements of Resilience.  Military career  De Crespigny decided he wanted to become a pilot after touring RAAF base Point Cook in Victoria when he was 14. He went on to enter the RAAF at age 17 in 1975. During his first training flight the instructor did not stop him from putting the plane into a downward spiral, after which he left de Crespigny to stop the plane from plummeting to the ground alone. The incident left him terrified but heightened his awareness of the dangers of complaceny and human error in flight. In 1982 he was posted to the Air Force VIP jets for a short time, but soon he became certified as a helicopter pilot and was deployed to El Gorah, Egypt. While he was accepted into training to fly the F-111, he never went on to become a fighter pilot.  Civil aviation  Shortly after leaving the military for Qantas in 1986 he took a break from flying to establish Aeronaut Industries Pty Ltd (a computer software company) due to a recession in the aviation industry reducing the amount of jobs available for pilots. During this period he did complete an annual flight check during the two-year break. After returning to Qantas full time he converted to flying the 747-400, having previously been a pilot of the 747-200 and 747-300 \\"classic\\" aircraft. In 2004 he switched to flying the Airbus A330, and in 2008 he was certified to fly the A380  Qantas 32  On 4 November 2010 de Crespigny was serving as pilot-in-command of Qantas Flight 32 while also undergoing a route check. The A380 under his command suffered an uncontained engine failure several minutes after leaving Singapore Changi Airport . Despite facing over 50 ECAM warning checklists and having limited use of many critical systems on the aircraft, including brakes, hydraulics, and electronics, the crew managed to bring the plane back to the airport and make an emergency landing. After the landing engine number one had to be forcefully shut down by firefighting foam before passengers could disembark safety since it was not responding to inputs by the flight controls and the pressurized water failed to shut it down. Once in the airport terminal he reassured the passengers and answered questions. While a passenger on a 747 flight home he experienced another engine failure, albeit a much less severe engine failure, that forced the plane to turn around and left him in Singapore for a few more days.

The diesel-worked Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig and electrified Riesa‚ÄìChemnitz lines cross in D√∂beln Hbf. From 1884 to 1964 D√∂beln Hbf was also the terminus of the 750 mm gauge railway from Oschatz. History Although D√∂beln had already been connected to the Riesa-Chemnitz route since 1847 with the nearby Gro√übauchlitz station, this station was opened with the opening of the D√∂beln‚ÄìLeisnig section of the Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig railway 2 June 1868 as Station D√∂beln, which \\"interimistically\\" had only a \\"passenger entrance shed\\". On 25 October 1868, the D√∂beln Ost (east) station came into operation on the route to Mei√üen, and D√∂beln station received the designation of Hauptbahnhof (main or central station). Two years later, on 1 January 1870, the wedge-shaped station was completed under the direction of the departmental engineer Bassenge with the present entrance building, which resembles the then station building of Zwickau station. The simple, functional building contained rooms for a post office, police and railway staff with baggage handling and three waiting rooms for first, second and third class. From 1 November 1884, the Oschatz‚ÄìM√ºgeln‚ÄìD√∂beln narrow gauge railway also connected D√∂beln station with the Wilsdruff network (Wilsdruffer Netz) by means of a branch from G√§rtitz. The station received platform canopies in 1886. Between 1892 and 1926 the D√∂beln horse tramway (D√∂belner Stra√üenbahn) connected the station and central D√∂beln. Major changes to the station track layout resulted from extensions for locomotive and goods sheds in 1896.

It is endemic to New Zealand.  Taxonomy  This species was described by Edward Meyrick in 1889 using a specimen he collected in the Waitakere Range in Auckland and named Gracilaria leucocyma. George Hudson discussed this species under the name Parectopa laucocyma in his 1928 publication The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand. The specimen collected by Meyrick was the only recorded specimen until this species was rediscovered in 1954 by K. A. J. Wise. In 1961 Lajos V√°ri restricted the genus Parectopa to Holarctic species which do not have genital characteristics that resemble New Zealand species. As a result, John S. Dugdale placed this species in the genus Acrocercops. However the genus level classification of Acrocercops leucocyma is regarded as unsatisfactory and as such the species is currently also known as Acrocercops (s.l.) leucocyma. The holotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London.  Description  Meyrick described this species as follows:  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand.  Biology and life cycle  The adult moths of this species are on the wing in December.  Habitat and host species  The larvae feed on Agathis australis. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts at the tip of the leaf and then heads for the general direction of the petiole, sometimes double-backing along the way. Near the petiole, the host plant forms a gall, creating a sheltered site for the larva to overwinter. After hibernation, the larva chews itself out of the gall and pupates on the leaf in a parchment-like cocoon.

The Australian government, in a bid to encourage the local film industry, announced the Commonwealth Prize, an award of ¬£2,500 to the best Australian-made film. Chauvel declared his intentions to enter the competition, and conceived a large-scale historical drama, spanning 150 years of Australian history, to maximise his likelihood of winning.Chauvel, Elsa (1973) My Life with Charles Chauvel, Sydney: Shakespeare Head Press The film was announced in July 1933. It was dubbed an Australian version of Cavalcade and was supported by Herb McIntyre of Universal. It would cover Australian history form the arrival of Captain Cook to the Great Depression. Chauvel announced plans to hold a Miss NSW competition to promote the movie. By February 1934 the film was called Heritage and registered a script the following month.Copyright registration at National Archives of Australia Chauvel was able to secure a budget of ¬£24,000 from his company Expeditionary Films. Extensive research was undertaken to ensure that props, costumes, hairstyles and music were accurate to their historical settings. Casting Peggy Maguire was the 16-year-old convent- educated daughter of Brisbane hoteliers Mary Jane and Michael Maguire. Chauvel discovered her and signed her to a ¬£100 a week contract, launching her career. Publicity pushed her as \\"Australia's Janet Gaynor\\". Male lead Franklyn Bennett was from Sydney amateur theatre. He changed his name from Bruce Bennett Smith. Shooting Production began in April 1934 and went for eight months. Studio scenes were shot at Efftee Studios in St Kilda, Melbourne. Outdoor filming took place in New South Wales and Queensland. Forty aborigines were employed to appear in a scene filmed at Canungra, Queensland. There were also scenes shot at Parliament House in Canberra and Governor Arthur Phillip's landing in Sydney was shot at Pittwater. Reception Heritage was first released on 13 April 1935, and distributed by Universal Films through the General Theatres Corporation. Of the thirteen films in contention for the Australian government's Commonwealth Prize, Heritage was awarded the top prize of ¬£2,500. The runner-up films were Ken G. Hall's The Silence of Dean Maitland, in second place (¬£1,250), and Frank Harvey's Clara Gibbings, in third place (¬£750).\\"\\"Heritage\\" Wins First Award In Aust.

Some reviewers celebrated the film as \\"worthy of Australia's hopes\\" and \\"a challenge to the overseas film industry.\\" Other commentators criticised Heritage as uneven, some blaming the comparatively small budget. Historically, the film is often considered a commercial failure, though contemporary press releases report that the film's six-week takings matched those of the highest-grossing imported films.\\"\\"Heritage\\" Tops All Figures in Brisbane.

There were allegations that the Deputy Premier of New South Wales had shares in Expeditionary Films Ltd, and that was why the government were supporting an introduction of a quota.

He has established and led key social initiatives in the evolution of education in Tanzania and East Africa starting in 1991 including hakielimu.org, especially as an advocate for young people through education and recently, with twaweza.org and uwezo.net, open government and ICT. In addition he helped set up and served as the first chairman of Policy Forum, a network of over 100 NGOs in Tanzania involved in helping 'policies work for people'. Rajani is considered a thought leader for much International Development work, particularly related to child rights, education, democracy and open government in East Africa and globally. Life and career Rajani was born in Tanzania where he completed his primary and secondary education. He then won a Wien Scholarship for university studies in the USA, and graduated from Brandeis University with a BA in Philosophy and English Literature in 1989 and Harvard University with a MTS, (Liberation) Theology in 1991. While studying at Brandeis and Harvard, Rajani was part of the Catholic Worker movement at Haley House in Boston, MA. From 1991 to 1998 Rajani co-founded and served as the first executive director of the Kuleana Centre for Children's Rights in his hometown of Mwanza, Tanzania. The organization worked with street children and advocated for children's interests across the country. The work with street children was based on a situation analysis that helped shift thinking about street children from a charity view to understanding deprivation was caused by a lack of rights. It received the Maurice Pate Award but is now largely defunct. After Kuleana, Rajani served as a resident fellow at Harvard University's Center for Population and Development Studies and the Human Rights Program of the Harvard Law School from 1998 to 2000. He continued as a non-resident fellow for many years since, including serving as an associate of the Joint Learning Initiative on Children and HIV/AIDS from 2006 to 2009. In 2001, Rajani founded HakiElimu and served as its executive director. Early on, the organization offered external advice on the primary education and secondary education development plans (PEDP and SEDP) that led to the expansion of government primary and secondary schooling in Tanzania throughout the 2000-2010 decade. Rajani also co-edited two volumes of speeches and papers on education by Julius Nyerere, Tanzania's founding president.http://hakielimu.org/files/publications/Nyerere%20Kuhusu%20Elimu.new.pdf Rajani stepped down as executive director at the end of 2007 but continued some work with the organization through its Board until 2009. After leaving HakiElimu, in 2008 and 2009 Rajani worked as a consultant with Hivos, William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, Google.org and other agencies. His main work involved researching and advising on how citizen driven accountability could be strengthened in East Africa. This work led to the formation, in 2009, of Twaweza, a program to promote access to information, citizen agency and better service delivery in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. Through this Rajani played a key role in helping set up the Open Government Partnership, where he served as the civil society chairman for two years. A major project of Twaweza is Uwezo, which undertakes a large scale assessment of basic literacy and numeracy in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania on a regular basis. The World Bank Development Report in 2018 was anchored in the main finding of this work. Another major program of the work started under Rajani's leadership is Africa's first nationally representative mobile phone survey, known as Sauti ya Wananchi (Citizen's Voices) which regularly collects and publishes independent and scientifically credible data. Rajani stepped down from Twaweza in December 2014, and became director of the Democratic Participation and Governance program at the Ford Foundation in New York, USA in January 2015, charged with strengthening the organization's global engagement. From 2014 until 2015, Rajani served on United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's Independent Expert Advisory Group on the Data Revolution for Sustainable Development, co- chaired by Enrico Giovannini and Robin Li.Independent Expert Advisory Group Members The UN Secretary General's Independent Expert Advisory Group on a Data Revolution for Sustainable Development.

His father described himself in his will as a \\"Staymaker and Dealer in Whale Fins\\". Early in his career he was employed to draw caricatures by the print publisher SW Fores. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1802, showing mostly portraits, but also some paintings of horses and, from the early 1830s, a few historical pictures. Between 1807 and 1845 he exhibited at the British Institution, predominantly showing literary and historical subjects, including scenes from the works of Shakespeare and Walter Scott. His portrait of the clown Joseph Grimaldi is in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery and his 1826 painting of Carl Maria von Weber is in that of the Royal College of Music. He is best remembered for his book The Art of Painting Portraits, Landscapes, Animals, Draperies, &c.;, in oil colours, published in 1840.

Life  Bayram, whose family was from Ladik, near the Anatolian city of Amasya, was a member of the Janissary corps. Although the Janissary corps was originally based on the devshirme system, beginning in the reign of Murat III (1574‚Äì1595), Turks were also admitted into the corps. In 1622, his title was turnacƒ±ba≈üƒ± (chief of recruiting teams), and in 1623, the keth√ºda (chamberlain). In 1625, he was appointed to Egypt (then an Ottoman territory) as the beylerbey (governor- general). In 1628, he was promoted to the rank of vizier. In 1635, Bayram Pasha was the kaymakam (a title almost equivalent to modern mayor) of the Ottoman capital, Constantinople. In 1637, during the reign of Murat IV (1623‚Äì1640), he was promoted to the rank of grand vizier, the highest office in the empire next to that of the sultan. Bayram Pasha participated in the Baghdad campaign led by the sultan. He died (of natural causes) near Urfa.On line history  As a groom  Bayram was also a damat (groom) of the palace. In Ottoman tradition, the daughters and sisters of the sultans usually married viziers. But Bayram's case was an exception, because Bayram was married to Hanzade Sultan, the daughter of Ahmet I (1603‚Äì1617) in 1623 while he was still a turnacƒ±ba≈üƒ±. .  As a governor and a vizier  Bayram Pasha was reputed both in Egypt and in Anatolia for his efforts in construction of public works. He repaired the city walls of Constantinople and commissioned a mosque and a k√ºlliye (religious complex) in the city. Today, the district of Bayrampa≈üa bears his name. He commissioned an irrigation facility and a caravansarai in Amasya. Bayram Pasha is also known as the commissioner of various inns in Anatolian towns. As grand vizier, Bayram Pasha executed two princes by the order of the sultan. He is also known as the name behind the execution of the famous poet Nef'i for writing satirical poems. Nef'i had earlier promised not to compose any more satire, but when he broke this promise, he was executed at the request of Bayram Pasha.

The larva mines directly into the leaf through the bottom of the egg. The mine starts as a long, slender, slightly tortuous, gradually widening gallery. The first part being on the under-surface of the leaf, close against the cuticle, showing up white and silvery by reflected light. The remainder of the mine, however, is on the upper surface. In the last stage the gallery expands, more or less abruptly, into a large irregular blotch. It usually follows the midrib or margin of the leaf along its greater extent, sometimes being deflected by the coarser veins. In this manner its course may be slightly tortuous, but rarely markedly so. The midrib forms an impassable barrier except at its upper end. The colour of the mine is conspicuously white or light green, sometimes discoloured a bright reddish-brown, but patchy in character. That part of the leaf covering the blotch is, in fleshy leaves, more or less mottled in shades of green according to the closeness of the mine to the outer cuticle. The frass is exceedingly scanty, black, finely granular, occupies a thin line near one side of the gallery, sometimes abruptly changing from one side to the other.

He was a painter, a caricaturist and a sculptor. Biography Jean Rouppert was born on 11 August 1887 in Custines, a town which is situated in the district of Meurthe-et- Moselle. Jean Fran√ßois Rouppert was the son of Johann Rouppert ‚Äì a metal worker ‚Äì and of Marie Cl√©mence Kieffer. He lived in Lorraine until 1924 when he moved to the Rh√¥ne-Alpes region. He first lived in Lyon and from 1932 onwards he settled in the area of Roanne. Between 1913 and 1924 he was employed as a set painter and then as an art manager for the Emile Gall√© institutions in Nancy. Because he was initially a self-taught person, his formation at Gall√© obviously left a mark on him. Afterwards he stood out as a protagonist of the Art Deco movement. The First World War made much of an impact on him as he went through its entire length as a soldier. He made numerous black ink drawings that formed an uncompromising criticism of the war. In 1925 he became an independent artist and he started up a workshop of his own in Lyon which he relocated in Saint-Alban-les-Eaux in 1932. During his lifetime Jean Rouppert expressed himself through drawing mainly, and also through painting. He also developed wood sculpture, mostly from 1934 onwards. He addressed multiple themes, amongst which are mainly found caricatures and expressive faces, the Great War, naturalistic or imaginary landscapes and wildlife art. He also drew illustrations which depicted a literary or historical theme. Besides, he gave shape to mythological, legendary or religious characters as well as popular figures and he designed Art Deco patterns too. As a Lorraine inhabitant, Jean Rouppert had been influenced by German art and Lorraine art from the 16th and 17th century (D√ºrer, Callot) which enhanced his stroke with cogency and accuracy. The influence of Gall√© and to a greater extent the Arts and Crafts Movement, the Art Nouveau and japonisme appear in his works. This influence becomes visible through his ink drawings as much as in his water colours, his gouache works or his sculptures. Jean Rouppert put his art on display during the 1930s, 1940s and the 1950s. He exhibited his works in museums and galleries, including the \\"Salon de la Soci√©t√© lyonnaise des Beaux-Arts\\" and the \\"Salon des Amis des Arts √† Roanne\\".

It is the second film that Anthony Dexter made for producer Edward Small for Columbia Pictures after his debut in Valentino. Plot A rogue exile impersonates a King and a virtuous person wants to be so because he is the rightful heir to the throne. Loosely based on The Brigand by Alexandre Dumas, the film is set in the Napoleonic era in 1804 in the mythical Iberian nation of \\"Mandorra\\". The film bears a resemblance to The Prisoner of Zenda with Dexter playing a dual role of a rogue exile who impersonates a King in danger of being overthrown by his cousin played by Anthony Quinn. The scheming Quinn plans a \\"premeditated accident\\" to King Lorenzo by giving him a hunting weapon that is rigged to fire backwards; an idea reused by director Phil Karlson in his The Silencers. With the real King unable to perform his duties, the swashbuckling distant relative Carlos DeLago, late of the Sultan of Morocco's Guard steps in to save the Kingdom.

In May 1949 it was reported that Small had hired Robert Libott and Frank Burt to write the script in 1949. In December 1949 Small signed a two-year contract with Columbia to make \\"two to six\\" films, which would include Lorna Doone and The Brigand, \\"projects he had been developing for some time.\\" This contract was separate to one Small had signed with Columbia to distribute Valentino. In August 1950 Small announced that he would make two films starring Anthony Dexter, who had made Valentino for the producer. The films would be The Brigand and a remake of The Sheik. In May 1951 Jesse Lasky Jr was reportedly writing the script. The same month Phil Karlson was announced as director. Ron Randell had appeared in Lorna Doone for Small. In August 1951 he signed to appear in The Brigand; he was to do it at the same time as appearing in Broadway Bill at the Pasadena Playhouse. Filming started 9 July 1951. Reception The New York Times called it \\"no great shakes. But neither, as a standard sample of this type of entertainment, is it hard to take.\\" Variety called it \\"a program swashbuckler\\".

It is not known by whom he was instructed, but he became an artist of sufficient celebrity to be invited to Spain by Philip II, who employed him in the palaces of Madrid. He was commanded to paint the gallery of the queen in the Palace of the Pardo, on which occasion he made choice of the very inappropriate subject of the 'Chastity of Joseph.' It was destroyed with many other valuable works of art in the burning of that palace. Cax√©s translated into Spanish Vignola's 'Five Orders of Architecture,' for which he engraved the frontispiece and plates.

There is a separate variety of this species on the North Island. This variety is slightly smaller, with a wingspan of about 8 mm. The larvae feed on Nothopanax arboreum, Nothopanax sinclairii and Panax species. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine is entirely on the under-surface of the leaf. Throughout its whole course it is a simple gallery, and very tortuous in its direction. The chief direction is in the long axis of the leaf, and the outer portions of the leaf are more mined than the centre. The gallery twists and turns, and in its course follows so close against the earlier portions that the partition between them is broken down, and finally the entire mine appears to form a huge blotch occupying about one half the leaf-surface. Though thus closely following its former track, it rarely crosses it except under direct need. The midrib forms a barrier, except in its upper and thinner part, where it is invariably crossed. The colour in the early stages of the mine is white with a fine brown central line occupied by the frass. The remainder of the mine is a shade paler green than the rest of the leaf.

It targeted the French community in Belgium. On September 13, 2017, at 20:30 it became ABXplore. History Claude Berda, CEO of the French AB Groupe, launched AB4 in October 2002 without authorization from the French Community of Belgium to broadcast its new channel over its territory. He had obtained the authorization of the French Superior Audiovisual Council on 24 September 2002 to activate a dormant operating license existing since 26 March 1996 (amended 24 March 1998) on the AB30 service. On the basis of the European Television Without Borders Directive, a channel which has been granted a license to operate in a European State may be broadcast unhindered in all other Member States, provided that the content broadcast is the same as in the origin. The AB4 signal was transmitted from France to the Eutelsat satellite system which forwards it to the headquarters of the association of Belgian French-speaking teledistributors who then provides it to contracted networks. AB4 has been licensed by the Higher Audiovisual Council of the French Community of Belgium since 23 September 2003. Since the beginning of 2007, the AB3 and AB4 content have been broadcast from the headquarters of AB Groupe in La Plaine Saint-Denis in the Paris suburbs where it creates greater synergy between groups and reduce staff costs in Belgium in the face of an average audience. The diffusion is made between the two countries via digital technologies. This decision would not be foreign to the entry of the TF1 group into the capital of AB Group. Since May 2009, the TF1 Group has grown from 33.5% to 49% in the Holding WB, which manages the AB3, AB4, and Vid√©oclick3 channels. Philippe Zrihen, Program Director, said in 2010 at tuner.be: \\"It is under study. It was necessary to go through a hierarchy of priorities, and quite naturally AB3 imposed itself in the recasting. AB4 has not changed its editorial line. This is something we are also considering.\\" Since March 22, 2010, AB4 shares its antenna with \\"AB shopping\\" devoted to tele-shopping. Subsequently, from October 8, 2011, the latter takes a greater place in the AB4's schedule by being broadcast from 8:00 pm to 4:00 pm: AB4 only broadcasts 4 hours of programs. On April 28, 2011, at 1:00 pm, AB4 switched to 16:9 format. On August 11, 2015, the channel ceased satellite broadcasting (Hotbird 13). On September 13, 2017, the AB group decided to rename the AB4 chain by becoming ABXplore, and reformat it into a channel devoted to documentaries and entertaining content.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It stands in open countryside near the A16 road between Grimsby and Louth. History The building originates from the 10th century, with additions and alterations carried out in the 11th and 13th centuries. It was restored in 1861 by James Fowler of Louth, for the Haigh family, local landowners. By the time it was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust in the 2000s, the building was in a state of decay and it had been vandalised. Some of the bell openings were near to collapse. The site was overgrown and the interior contained debris and bat guano. Repairs started in October 2005 and cost nearly ¬£350,000. Architecture Exterior The tower is Anglo-Saxon, and the 19th-century restoration is in Early English style. The church is constructed in local limestone and ironstone, the roofs being a mixture of clay tiles and Welsh slate. Its plan consists of a two-bay nave with north and south aisles, a small south transept, a chancel in the form of an apse, and a central tower at the crossing between the nave and the chancel. The tower is in three stages with a plain parapet. The north wall contains a lancet window over which is a cinquefoil window. The bell openings in the top stage are paired; the lights being separated by a shaft with a cushion capital. The west wall of the church contains four lancet windows and a window in the shape of a vesica. In the north wall of the north aisle are two lancet windows, with a similar window in its east wall. There are five lancets around the apse of the chancel, and another in the east wall of the south transept. In the south wall of the transept is a doorway with a pointed moulded arch flanked by buttresses. In the gable above the doorway is a lancet window, also with a moulded head. In the south wall of the south aisle are two further lancet windows. Interior The nave is separated from the aisles by two-bay arcades. The walls of the aisles and nave consist of bands of red brick and ashlar stone. Around the tops of the walls are tiles containing texts. The tower arches are round-headed. In the south wall of the tower is a marble plaque recording the restoration of the church in 1861. Around the chancel apse is blind arcading consisting of marble shafts and limestone arches with decorated capitals, rising from a string course. The reredos, chancel floor and chancel walls are covered with elaborately decorated Minton tiles. Some of the stained glass is by Ward and Hughes, and the rest is by Powell. The fittings date from the 1861 restoration and include a carved font, a stone pulpit on a marble base, and a full set of pitch pine pews. Beneath the altar is the Haigh family mausoleum. External features In the churchyard are the base and shaft of a cross dating from the 14th century and restored in 1861. It is designated as a Grade II listed building and a Scheduled Monument.

According to the New York State Department of Transportation, CR 28 is split into two sections: the signed portion that is New Highway between NY 27 and the Southern State Parkway, and the unsigned Republic Road between the Town of Babylon/Town of Huntington town line and CR 5 (Ruland Road). ;Route description The road begins at NY 27 just west of the intersection of CR 2 (Straight Path), and an Educational Bus Transport garage for school buses and intercity buses of Suffolk County Transit. This section of the road then curves towards the old section which runs along Trinity Cemetery, the site of the former Zahn's Airport, and behind the Sisters of St. Dominic Motherhouse Complex, which was previously known as the Queen of the Rosary Academy. After bi-secting Albany Avenue, the road approaches an at-grade crossing of the Central Branch of the Long Island Rail Road and immediately intersects NY 109\\\\. After the immediate intersection with NY 109, CR 28's southern section terminates with the Southern State Parkway, but the roadway continues northward on the south and eastern circumferences of Republic Airport. North of the industrial zone in East Farmingdale, Republic Road regains the designation of CR 28 at the Babylon/Huntington town line. Republic Road and CR 28 terminates 0.41 miles north of the line at CR 5 (Ruland Road) in Melville; however, just to the east of this terminus is a de facto extension called Maxess Road, which leads to the eastbound service road of the Long Island Expressway between NY 110 and CR 3 (Pinelawn Road). This extension, however, is not included on CR 28's route. ;Major intersections County Route 29 County Route 29 was an unsigned county route connecting CR 93 to the Long Island Expressway. The road was widened during the period that the Ronkonkoma Station was facing major reconstruction itself, and included a replacement for the wooden bridge that previously crossed over the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road. The CR 29 signs were installed between 1989 and 1995, but have since been taken down. Within the town of Islip, the road is named Smithtown Avenue. After it crosses the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road and simultaneously the Town of Islip‚ÄìTown of Brookhaven town line, it becomes Ronkonkoma Avenue, a name that continues north of the terminus of I-495 until it reaches Hawkins Avenue in Lake Ronkonkoma. The route is no longer recognized by the Suffolk County Department of Public Works nor the New York State Department of Transportation. ;Major intersections County Route 30 County Route 30 was the north-south road along the east side of Lake Montauk, known as East Lake Drive. The east side of this road consists of parts of Montauk County Park, a residential enclave, and Montauk Airport. The road terminates at the a parking lot north of the Inlet Seafood Restaurant on the Block Island Sound. ;Major intersections The entire route is located in Montauk. County Route 31 County Route 31 is a short north-south county highway running across rural eastern Suffolk County. The road serves as a connection between Westhampton Beach and the Riverhead area, feeding directly into CR 104 as it makes its way north. ;Route description The road begins at Montauk Highway (CR 80), just north of the downtown area of Westhampton Beach. It serves in function as a continuation of Oak Street, which heads south to connect with the town's main street before crossing over to the Dune Road beaches. Heading north, this arrow-straight portion of the road crosses the Long Island Rail Road's Montauk Branch railroad tracks and then runs through the grounds of Francis S. Gabreski Airport, a former base of the United States Air Force, which is now home to the 106th Rescue Wing of the New York Air National Guard. North of the base, the road continues through a section of the Long Island Central Pine Barrens, which feature the indigenous dwarf pine. This area fell victim to a widespread wildfire that burned a significant portion of the core of the Pine Barrens in 1995. The section of CR 31 within the village of Westhampton Beach is ceremoniously dedicated \\"Volunteers Way\\" in honor of volunteer first responders to the Sunrise Fire. The road widens as it crosses NY 27, with which it has a full cloverleaf interchange. About one- half mile beyond this interchange, the road ends at a traffic circle with CR 104\\\\. ;History Between January 18, 1961 and May 23, 1972, CR 31 was extended south of Montauk Highway between Oak Street and Mill Road (formerly CR 100). Mill Road was intended to be converted into part of the formerly proposed Port Jefferson‚ÄìWesthampton Beach Highway. ;Major intersections County Route 32 County Route 32 is the Ponquogue Bridge, the main two-lane highway between Ponquogue Point on Westhampton Beach Barrier Island and the mainland, which, through a maze of roadways, connects to downtown Hampton Bays. The route used to be designated north of the bridge along Lighthouse Road, Foster Avenue, Shinnecock Road, and Ponquogue Avenue to Montauk Highway in Hampton Bays, but neither the Suffolk County Department of Public Works or the New York State Department of Transportation recognize that portion of the roadway as CR 32, just the Ponquogue Bridge portion. The formerly proposed Ponquogue Causeway was intended to either run parallel to or replace CR 32 between the 1930s and 1960s, but the roadway never came to fruition. ;Major intersections The entire route is in Hampton Bays, New York. County Route 32A County Route 32A was concurrent with CR 32 from Montauk Highway to the LIRR station. County Route 32B County Route 32B was Foster Avenue and the former Ponquogue Bridge. It was integrated with CR 32\\\\. County Route 33 County Route 33 was the designation for Cranberry Hole Road, Promised Land Road, and Napeague Meadow Road. The entire road is a former routing of Montauk Highway. CR 33 began in Amagansett at the intersection of NY 27 and Bluff Road as Cranberry Hole Road, and carried over a bridge above the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, the easternmost LIRR bridge to exist. The name Cranberry Hole Road continues until the intersection with Bendigo Road (former CR 33A and CR 74). From there it the road becomes Promised Land Road. Both segments of CR 33 ran along the northern edge of Napeague State Park, and continued to run through the park even as it turns southeast onto Napeague Meadow Road. Promised Land Road continues northeast as Lazy Point Road where it enters \\"downtown\\" Napeague. The former route crosses the LIRR Montauk branch for the second time, but this time it is at an at-grade crossing, where it enters a section of Napeague formerly known as East Hampton Beach, before finally terminating at Montauk Point State Parkway (NY 27). ;Major intersections County Route 33A County Route 33A was for Abrahams Landing Road and Bendigo Road. It was a former suffixed route of CR 33, that is now unmarked CR 74\\\\. County Route 34 County Route 34 is Deer Park Avenue between the Village of Babylon/Town of Babylon line and New York State Route 231 in North Babylon. It was a former segment of CR 35 that was established in 1970 when the New York State Department of Transportation created (what was intended to be) a temporary alignment of NY 231\\\\. The Village of Babylon used to maintain the section of CR 34 within the village. However, the New York State Department of Transportation, as well as the Suffolk County Department of Public Works, deems that CR 34 exists outside of the Babylon village limits. Outside of the village limits, CR 34 crosses over New York State Route 27 (Sunrise Highway) as part of Exit 40, which is primarily for NY 231 to the east. Though CR 34 terminates at NY 231 in Deer Park, just south of the Southern State Parkway's exit 39, Deer Park Avenue continues northward as NY 231 well into Dix Hills. Before its current designation, CR 34 was assigned to Greenlawn Road, today a portion of CR 9 along with Cuba Hill Road, until the late 1960s. ;Major intersections The entire route is located in North Babylon. County Route 35 County Route 35 serves as a de facto extension of NY 231, spanning from the northern terminus of NY 231 and the Northern State Parkway in Dix Hills northwest to NY 110 in the hamlet of Huntington. The road originally included NY 231 and CR 34 until 1970, when the New York State Department of Transportation turned the segment between Southern and Northern State Parkways into the temporary alignment of NY 231, before the hopeful transfer of the road onto the formerly proposed Babylon‚ÄìNorthport Expressway. The south end of CR 35 and CR 66 and the north end of NY 231 was intended to include a formerly proposed North Deer Park Avenue Spur leading to the unbuilt expressway. ;Route description The segment of CR 35 between NY 231 and NY 25 is four-lanes wide and is known as Deer Park Road West, as opposed to CR 66, which is known as Deer Park Road East. CR 35 is the last intersection with Old Country Road before both move north and intersect with NY 25\\\\. After this intersection, CR 35 narrows down to two lanes and becomes Park Avenue, which turns to the northwest at the 2nd Precinct of the Suffolk County Police Department before intersecting with CR 86 in west Elwood. At the north end of Dix Hills Road, the road narrows down to two lanes and contains frontage roads for residences. From there, the road serves as the east end of Maplewood Road, where it briefly overlaps with New York State Bicycle Route 25A until it reaches the west end of Little Plains Road, a block away from Little Plains Park. The road briefly becomes four lanes wide again at the intersection of CR 11, but narrows back down to two lanes. Continuing northwest, CR 35 has an at-grade crossing with the Port Jefferson Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, which has been the site of many tractor-trailer accidents, and was the original location for the first \\"Low Ground Clearance\\" warning sign. The next major intersection after this crossing is Broadway, which runs west towards Huntington Station. Here, CR 35 becomes an unconventional two-lane divided highway, where the divider ends at Tasman Lane. As it goes downhill, CR 35 passes by three Jewish Centers and the Town of Huntington's Hilaire Woods Preserve before approaching the Huntington Arts Cinema at the southwest corner of NY 25A. North of NY 25A, CR 35 runs along the eastern edge of Heckscher Park, makes a northeast turn at Sabbath Day Path, and then passes Huntington Memorial Hospital before reaching NY 110\\\\. The two routes share a short concurrency between two traffic circles, before CR 35 exits and proceeds west towards West Shore Road. County Route 35 continues northward, then westward (unsigned) along West Shore Road before officially terminating at Landing Road (just east of Gold Star Beach Park). ;Major intersections County Route 35A County Route 35A was an extension of CR 35 that ran north of NY 25A then made a northeast turn at Sabbath Day Path before reaching NY 110\\\\. It was eventually absorbed into CR 35\\\\. This segment runs along parkland east of Heckscher Park and is the location of Huntington Memorial Hospital. County Route 35B County Route 35B was Deer Park Road East and today is CR 66\\\\. County Route 35C County Route 35C was an extension of CR 35 northwest of NY 110 that included Mill Dam Road, and West Shore Road on the west side of Huntington Harbor. The road was integrated into CR 35; however, it was later transferred to the town of Huntington. County Route 36 County Route 36 is a former segment of Montauk Highway known as South Country Road. Though it is signed as an east‚Äìwest road, it runs southeast to northwest from CR 80 (Montauk Highway) and Lake Drive in East Patchogue into Bellport, and northeast to southwest back to Montauk Highway in the hamlet of Brookhaven. The entire road is two lanes wide, with exceptions for provisions for left turns at some intersections. ;Route description South Country Road begins on the east bank of the Swan River at the intersection of Montauk Highway and Lake Drive, with a four way intersection that includes an eastbound connecting ramp. Almost immediately it crosses the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road after the intersection of Robinson Avenue. The former East Patchogue Station was located west of this intersection (Hagerman Station was further east along the line). Luxurious houses line the road from most of this point on. The bridge over Robinson Pond has a similar appearance to the one on Montauk Highway over the Forge River between Mastic and Moriches. On the opposite side of Robinson Pond is the Mud Creek County Nature Preserve, a protected area controlled by the Suffolk County Department of Parks and Recreation. Other protected land exists along Strongs Creek and Abet's Creek in Hagerman, the latter of which used to be the location of a greenhouse. The last intersection outside of the village of Bellport is Munsell Road, a pre- automotive era road that once went as far north as West Yaphank. Bellport County Club serves as the unofficial border of the historic village of Bellport, New York. The intersection with Bellport Avenue to the north and Bellport Lane to the south is the heart of Bellport. Bellport Avenue leads to the town's LIRR station, but also through North Bellport, the edges of Yaphank and Medford, and once lead as far north as Gordon Heights. Bellport Lane, along with CR 36, is one of the streets bordering the Bellport Village Historic District, which has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1980. Just outside the village at Mott's Brook, CR 36 passes by the Gateway Playhouse, which was established in 1941 on the grounds of a former farm owned by J. L. B. Mott. Well past the intersection of Bellhaven Avenue, the road begins to turn north as it follows the west bank of Beaver Dam Creek, which is hidden off to the east. Very little evidence of this or any other waterway exists along this section of the road until it reaches a hidden driveway leading to a Yacht Club near the southeast corner of Beaver Dam Road. Most of the houses along the road appear to be far more Victorian from this point on. For a moment, the road curves back to the east before intersecting with Fireplace Road, then heads back into a northerly direction. The northeastern end runs beneath a low bridge for the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road where it intersects with Railroad Avenue (the former location of Brookhaven Station) before finally terminating at Montauk Highway. ;History Originally part of Montauk Highway, the road was created on February 24, 1930, when it shared a designation with NY 27 which was part of Montauk Highway at the time. It was completely turned over to Suffolk County on July 17, 1932, when the state of New York realigned Montauk Highway on the north side of the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. Since then it has been used as the main road through the village of Bellport. Until the late 1980s, flood insurance maps published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency have misrepresented South Country Road as being NY 95\\\\. South Country Road has never been either NY 95, nor CR 95\\\\. ;Major intersections County Route 37 County Route 37 was Manwaring Road on Shelter Island. It began at NY 114 and ran east toward the intersection of Ram Island Road, Saint Mary's Road, and Manhassett Road. County Route 38 County Route 38 is the connector road along between the village of Southampton and North Sea. It begins at the intersection of NY 27/CR 39 on the north border of the Village of Southampton. After this intersection, it continues northwest towards Tuckahoe, where it approaches the northern terminus of CR 52 (Sandy Hollow Road), and moves directly north towards the hamlet of North Sea. The route ends 500 feet north of the intersection with Millstone Brook Road, just before the roadway reaches the \\"downtown\\" portion of North Sea. CR 38 used to continue eastward from North Sea to Noyack via Noyack Road, and, eventually, Sag Harbor. The route's mileage and designation is only recognized by the SCDPW or by the New York State Department of Transportation between Southampton Village and North Sea. ;History As far back as the 1930s the road was planned to be extended along the north shore of the South Fork of Long Island to the Amagansett‚ÄìPromised Land area.Map of Eastern Suffolk County, New York 1941@NYCRoads.com Besides the existing segment of North Sea Road (and the former segment of Noyack Road), the new segment was to begin at the intersection of Brick Kiln Road then continue southeast until it reaches Town Line Road, where it would curve east. The CR 38 extension would gradually move southeast again, running along the headwaters of Northwest Creek and Three Mile Harbor, through Barnes Hole, and Devon until reaching Promised Land Road (former CR 33), which it would replace until it reached NY 27 (Montauk Point State Parkway) in the East Hampton Beach section of Napeague. Though the extension was dropped due to anti-highway sentiment, the official description used to include the extension, which was 25 miles. ;Major intersections County Route 38A County Route 38A is a former spur of CR 38 known as Noyack‚ÄìLong Beach Road. Today the road is designated as CR 60\\\\. County Route 39 County Route 39 is North Highway in the town of Southampton. Most of the road is concurrent with NY 27, where it is known as the Southampton Bypass, except for the portion along the Shinnecock Canal and the Great Peconic Bay. This section has an interchange with NY 27, both at the beginning of the freeway portion (Sunrise Highway) and the first interchange (exit 66). The multiplex between NY 27 and CR 39 was only meant to be temporary, since NY 27 was proposed to be moved to the Sunrise Highway Extension. Like CR 38, Suffolk County was planning to extend CR 39 east of Flying Point Road through CR 79 (Bridgehampton‚ÄìSag Harbor Turnpike) at the proposed Sunrise Highway Extension, and if necessary as a substitute for the Sunrise Highway Extension. These plans also date back to the 1930s, and included what became part of the proposed Sunrise Highway extension. ;Major intersections County Route 39A County Route 39A is a little known suffixed route that runs concurrent with NY 27 (also known as North Highway or the Southampton Bypass) between North Sea Road and Montauk Highway. East of David Whites Lane, CR 39 was intended to be rerouted onto the formerly proposed Hampton Bays‚ÄìAmagansett Road. While all businesses on this short stretch of highway use \\"County Road 39A\\" for the street name, it commonly known as part of CR 39\\\\. The entire route is signed as CR 39\\\\. ;Major intersections County Route 39B County Route 39B is Canal Road East and Old North Highway on the east side of the Shinnecock Canal. The road runs beneath the Sunrise Highway (NY 27) bridge over the Canal, just as CR 39 does, and provides closer access to Meschutt Beach County Park. ;Major intersections The entire route is in Shinnecock Hills. County Route 40 County Route 40 is known as Three Mile Harbor Road, and extends from the East Hampton village line in East Hampton North to Copeces Lane in Springs. ;Route description CR 40 begins north of the North Main Street Historic District at the East Hampton village line at Cedar Street. The route starts north of the bridge under the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. The first major intersection north of the historic district (and the southern terminus of CR 40) is Cedar Street, which leads to Cedar Point County Park, and the second one is CR 41 (Springs Fireplace Road). A fork in the road for Springy Banks Road is the southern border Three Mile Harbor, both the waterway and the former hamlet. This road leads motorists northwest to Lafarges Landing and Sammy's Beach, while CR 40 continues to the northeast as it passes by East Hampton Marina, Three Mile Harbor Boat Yard, and Gardiner's Marina. After passing Gardiner's Marina, the designation for CR 40 ends at Copeces Lane, just to the south of Marina Lane Waterside Park. ;Major intersections County Route 40A County Route 40A was concurrent with CR 40 along Three Mile Harbor Road until after the 1960s. County Route 41 County Route 41 is Springs‚ÄìFireplace Road, which spans from East Hampton to Springs. Though CR 41 terminates at CR 45 in Springs, Springs‚ÄìFireplace Road continues north into the Springs. ;Major intersections County Route 42 County Route 42 is a short, partially-unsigned east-west county road in the hamlet of Shelter Island Heights, in the town of Shelter Island. It is known as Shore Road, and extends from Rocky Point Road on the west shore of Shelter Island to West Neck Road (CR 115). ;Major intersections The entire route is in Shelter Island Heights. County Route 43 County Route 43, known as Northville Turnpike for its entire length, is a county route contained completely within the township of Riverhead. It heads north-northeast from Downtown Riverhead towards the North Shore of Long Island, ending at Sound Avenue in the hamlet of Northville, New York. ;Route description County Route 43 begins at Roanoke Avenue (CR 73) just north of its crossing with the Long Island Rail Road Main Line tracks. After cutting a slice through part of downtown Riverhead, CR 43 heads off in an almost-straight path towards the North Shore. After crossing Old Country Road (CR 58), CR 43 enters the farm fields that characterize much of Riverhead town. The road crosses CR 105 just before its terminus at Sound Avenue. ;History Originally, CR 43's southern terminus was on Roanoke Avenue at NY 25 (Main Street) in Downtown Riverhead. The southern terminus was truncated in 1943, when CR 73 took over Roanoke Avenue. ;Major intersections County Route 44 County Route 44, was an unbuilt county road along the west side of NY 114 in North Haven that was intended to be four-lanes wide and take motorists to a new bridge across the southern Shelter Island Sound. Suffolk County Department of Public Works had also hoped it would be acquired by the NYSDOT as a realignment for NY 114. County Route 45 County Route 45 was primarily known the designation for Old Stone Highway (Springs‚ÄìAmagansett Road), Springs-Fireplace Road, and Hog Creek Road. ;Route description CR 45 began at NY 27 as Abrahams Landing Road, where it instantly crossed the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road at Amagansett Station, and immediately made a left-turn onto Old Stone Highway (Springs‚ÄìAmagansett Road) at the South Fork Country Club. The route slanted to the north as it approached the intersection of Town Lane, and then to the northeast. From here, the route continued into Springs, at a former hamlet known as Barnes Hole, where it encounters Red Dirt Road, Barnes Hole Road, and the south end of Neck Path. The route continued to move northeast, but suddenly curved northwest in order to avoid Accabonac Cliff, which is accessible from a side road called Louise Point Road. CR 45 intersected at Neck Path again east of the former hamlet of Kingstown, but this time it merges with the former route and then immediately turns onto Accabonac Road. Curving back to the northwest, CR 45 passed by the Springs General Store, then over a creek leading to Pussys Pond, and instantly intersected a fork in the road at Parsons Place, which leads to the historic Charles Parsons Blacksmith Building as well as the NRHP- listed Ambrose Parsons House. In between both roads are the Springs Cannon, Ashawagh Hall, and for CR 45, the Springs Community Presbyterian Church on the opposite side. In front of the church, Springs‚ÄìAmagansett Road/Old Stone Highway curves to the right, until it reaches a wye at Springs‚ÄìFireplace Road, thus serving as the former northern terminus of CR 41. This segment of Springs‚ÄìFireplace Road is where one can find the NRHP-listed Pollock-Krasner House and Studio. The rest of the road runs along the northwest shore of Accabonac Harbor, along preserved land such as the Meadow Lake and Kaplan Meadows Sanctuaries. CR 45 made a sharp left turn onto Hog Creek Road, and headed north again while Springs‚ÄìFireplace Road continues towards Fireplace in Gardiners Bay, as well as a former hamlet called Gerard Park. Along Hog Creek Road, CR 45 skirted the border of Springs and Fireplace, until the intersection of Kings Point Road where it made a sharp left onto Three Mile Harbor Road and terminated at the former northern terminus of CR 40. ;Major intersections County Route 46 County Route 46 is the county designation for William Floyd Parkway, a four-lane highway spanning from Smith Point County Park to almost near Wading River. County Route 46A County Route 46A was the original designation for the alignment along the west side of Brookhaven National Laboratory between Yaphank‚ÄìMoriches Road and south of the unnumbered interchange with NY 25\\\\. It was eventually integrated as part of CR 46 while the old CR 46 (Upton Road) was abandoned to both the lab and private developers. County Route 47 County Route 47 is the designation for Great Neck Road from NY 27A in Copaigue through NY 110 in East Farmingdale until it reaches the Nassau‚ÄìSuffolk county line in East Farmingdale. ;Route description CR 47 is almost entirely two lanes, with a center-left-turn lane, except at its southern terminus at NY 27A. Aside from the Copaigue Fire Department and a school or two, the street is almost entirely residential until the intersection of Hollywood Avenue. There, the route becomes a commercial strip, especially as it approaches CR 12 (Oak Street), which once carried a streetcar line between Amityville and Babylon. One block later CR 47 runs beneath Copiague Station. The commercial zoning ends at the intersection of Campagnoli Avenue. Scattered commercial operations can be found near the intersection with CR 2 (Dixon Avenue) which spans from Amityville to Dix Hills, but, for the most part, the road remains primarily residential. As the road runs along the west side of Copiague Middle School, it approaches the cloverleaf interchange with NY 27, where CR 47 becomes a two-lane divided highway. After the interchange with NY 27, the road resumes its status as a two-lane corridor (with a center-left-turn lane) and shifts from north and south to northwest and southeast at the intersection of Bethpage Road. The next major intersection is Albany Avenue, which spans from downtown Amityville to the Sisters of St. Dominic Motherhouse Complex. Prior to reaching the intersection of NY 110, CR 47 runs over the Southern State Parkway and a former gas station that existed in the median until 1985. It also shared an interchange with the Parkway until the 1950s.Hagstroms Western Suffolk County Road Atlas (1941) Though CR 47 continues north of NY 110, it ceases to be a county road one block away, when it crosses the Nassau County line and becomes South Main Street in both South Farmingdale and Farmingdale. ;Major intersections County Route 48 County Route 48 is the designation for Middle Road on the North Fork of Long Island between Mattituck and Greenport. It was intended to be converted into an extension of the Long Island Expressway, and was originally designated CR 27\\\\. The route includes New York State Route 25 Truck for its entire length. County Route 49 County Route 49 runs south-to-north from NY 27 in Montauk to the loop on the west side of Lake Montauk. It starts along the east side of Fort Pond Bay as Edgemere Street, and then onto Flamingo Avenue before reaching Montauk Station. From this point, the road moves northeast above Fort Pond Bay before reaching CR 77\\\\. ;Major intersections The entire route is in Montauk. County Route 50 County Route 50 is an east-west county road running from Babylon to Great River, paralleling the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. The road serves as a commuter-feeder route in southwestern Suffolk County. Most of the road is two lanes wide, although there are some areas where it opens up to four lanes or simply allows center-left-turn lanes. ;Route description CR 50 begins at the intersection of New York State Route 109 in the village of Babylon, north of the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road as Park Avenue. The route straddles northward on Deer Park Avenue for three-tenths of a mile to find its way onto Simon Street but this name doesn't carry the designation very long. At the intersection of Cedar and Cooper streets, CR 50 makes a sharp right turn along Cooper Street to cross under the tracks, which then immediately makes a left onto John Street along the south side of the Montauk Branch. For a slightly longer distance until reaching the quarter cloverleaf interchange with New York State Route 231 (NY 231, the Babylon‚ÄìNorthport Expressway) on the Babylon Village‚ÄìWest Islip border, the road suddenly takes on the name \\"Union Boulevard\\", the street that defines CR 50\\\\. Union Boulevard continues to carry CR 50 along the south side of the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road for the rest of its length to the hamlet of Great River. East of the intersection of CR 82 (Higbie Lane), CR 50 runs beneath a pedestrian-railroad bridge that spans between a shopping center and the intersection of Orinoco Drive and Patricia Avenue across the Montauk Branch, and another limited- access highway known as the Robert Moses Causeway in West Islip. Unlike the Babylon-Northport Expressway, no access to the Causeway is provided. The bridge that carries the Robert Moses Causeway over Union Boulevard also carries it over the LIRR railroad tracks. After passing through the northern sections of West Bay Shore and the village of Brightwaters, CR 50 approaches southbound-only Clinton Avenue (CR 13A) and northbound-only Fifth Avenue (CR 13) in Bay Shore. Continuing eastward on the south side of Bay Shore's LIRR train station, CR 50 then intersects with CR 57 (Third Avenue). The last major intersection within Bay Shore is Brentwood Road, although Saxon Avenue also leads through NY 27\\\\. While Union Boulevard runs south of the railroad tracks, another street called Moffit Boulevard runs parallel on the north side of the tracks, which runs between Brentwood Road and Carleton Avenue (CR 17). As the road enters the heart of the hamlet of Islip, CR 50 intersects Nassau Avenue and, more importantly, NY 111 (the two streets that serve Islip's train station). Shortly after passing over the north end of Knapp Lake and Champlin Creek, the road curves somewhat further southeast as it intersects Irish Avenue where it passes the Islip Art Museum and, then with, Carleton Avenue (CR 17) in East Islip, which was originally a segment of NY 111 until 1966. Union Boulevard runs beneath a third limited-access road between East Islip and Great River, Heckscher State Parkway. No access to this parkway is provided, however Exit 45W on the parkway leads to Harwood Road, which takes commuters to both NY 27A and CR 50\\\\. From the parkway bridge, the road enters both county and state protected areas. CR 50 then intersects with Connetquot Avenue south of Great River's train station. The road finally terminates at an at-grade interchange with NY 27A and the entrance to the Bayard Cutting Arboretum. ;Major intersections County Route 50A County Route 50A was reserved for the unbuilt Union Boulevard Extension between Oakdale and Sayville. This 1964 proposal was to run mostly along the north side of the Montauk Branch of the LIRR, terminating east of the low railroad bridge over Montauk Highway in Sayville. County Route 50B County Route 50B was Oak Street, Railroad Avenue, and Trolley Line Road from Amityville at the Nassau‚ÄìSuffolk county line to Babylon at Deer Park Avenue. Today, it is CR 12\\\\. County Route 50C County Route 50C was Park Avenue between NY 109 and Deer Park Avenue within Babylon. This was a proposed extension that was phased out during the mid-1980s, although Suffolk County Department of Public Works still lists this street as being part of CR 50\\\\.

It is known from New Zealand.Global Taxonomic Database of Gracillariidae (Lepidoptera) Mine Mine of the South Island Form Pupa The wingspan is about 10 mm. There is a separate South Island form. The larvae feed on Nothopanax simplex and Nothopanax sinclairii. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a simple gallery throughout, and is vermiform in character, the loops being very closely applied to one another, but never crossing. As a rule the gallery at first winds backwards and forwards in slightly increasing distances, closely applied to itself, and in a direction more or less parallel to the long axis of the leaf. Then it changes its direction for one almost at right angles to the earlier one, now crossing the leaf in curved sweeps from edge to midrib, this latter forming a certain obstacle to trespass on the other half of the leaf. On reaching the upper region of the leaf the mine becomes less vermiform in character and becomes rather tortuous in its direction, crossing the midrib in its upper and thinner part, and continuing down the other half of the leaf in more or less close proximity to the midrib or outer margin. This latter portion of the mine is often deeper in the leaf than the earlier part. The entire mine is in the upper surface of the leaf, and no trace of it can be seen beneath. The colour of the mine is a paler green than other portions of the leaf. The terminal portion of the gallery may be slightly enlarged, and within it the cocoon is constructed, a small area of the upper cuticle of the leaf at the extreme end of the mine being first prepared to a transparent thinness for the exit of the pupa later. The frass is finely granular, pale in colour, not very abundant, and occupies a rather broad band in the central third of the gallery. The mine made by the South Island form differs somewhat. In the earlier part the mine is a simple vermiform gallery. Later, however, instead of ending in a somewhat tortuous and widened gallery, it expands into a relatively large blotch, which may occupy the entire leaf, or all or the greater part of one half of the leaf in larger leaves. The entire mine is on the upper surface of the leaf, and is pale green in colour. The midrib forms a barrier in its basal two-thirds. The blotch is irregular in shape, but all irregularities are rounded. The frass is finely granular, black and scanty. Old mines soon become white and conspicuous.
