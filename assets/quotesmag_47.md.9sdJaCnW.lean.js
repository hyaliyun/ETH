The age range of the students is 11 to 18. The original buildings were opened in the early 1960s but further development has taken place on a regular basis ever since, such as the library, information technology rooms and science facilities as well as the post-16 learning centre. Treviglas opened a new sports facility, The Dome, in October 2001 and, in February 2004, a new dedicated sixth form and community learning block was opened. The SportsHub, funded by Sport England, opened in 2012. From the playing fields there are views to the sea dropping down toward Porth, with the village of St Columb Minor neighbouring the college. As of January 2019, Treviglas Community College became part of The Roseland Multi Academy Trust and became Treviglas Academy. Treviglas was the first school in the county to receive Business and Enterprise status and was awarded an overall Outstanding by OfSTED for the second consecutive time in their second most recent inspection (2012). As of July 2017 the school has now been dubbed Inadequate by OfSTED in their most recent inspection. The college focuses on core academic subjects and vocational training for students, including Post-16 academies which teach students lifelong learning and work place skills at A-Level. The college has around 900 students. This includes around 120 in the sixth form centre. The college draws students from 13 primary schools, including the town of Newquay and surrounding rural communities. The college‚Äôs motto is: \\"Where students enjoy achieving their best\\".  Curriculum  The college teaches the full range of core curricular subjects - including the arts, science, social science, computing and vocational subjects to GCSE and A-Level. The sciences are taught in the four core subjects: Biology, Physics, Chemistry and Computer Science. Foreign languages that are taught at Treviglas are French, German and Spanish across all three key stages. Students also benefit from links with partner schools in Europe and Africa. Computing plays a large part in the college curriculum, and students can progress to Technicians Academytechnicians.treviglas.net at Post-16, which delivers industry qualifications together with academic A-Levels. The college has a Future Prospects programme, which develops and supports those who are identified as Gifted and Talented. OfSTED also acknowledged that the college also has outstanding provisions for students who require additional support, including those with disabilities, with the Effective Learning Centre (ELC).  Post 16  The college offers the full range of academic subjects for those aged 16-years-old and over, with added courses including Accountancy, Enterprise (which supports students looking to start a business), Media Studies, Public Services, Psychology, Philosophy and Ethics, Health and Social Care, Further Mathematics and Sport. At Post 16, as well as the core sciences, students can also opt for Applied Science as well as being able to undertake Animal Care. Treviglas Post-16 also offers academies for students; the Technicians, Business and Surf Academies. In the 2013 DfE league tables Treviglas featured in the top 100 schools in the county for their Best advanced vocational results, and the top 10 schools or colleges in the county for Key Stage 5. Post 16 Academies: Business ‚Äì Business students analyse business performance in Accountancy and Economics and experience running a business in Enterprise, Business or Travel and Tourism. Students also receive professional qualifications such as the SAGE Accounting software package. Technicians ‚Äì Students in the Technicians academy learn ICT to a high professional level. The academy is equipped with a wide range of new hardware including a Cisco lab bundle and numerous PC components and peripherals. Surf - Students study Business, Tourism, Sport and Enterprise. The course combines Surf Analysis, Event Management (including the Cornish Schools Surfing Championships), Beach Lifeguard and Surf Coaching qualifications. New academies currently in development at the college include Nursing, Teaching, Sport and Early Years.  Site and facilities  The Treviglas site benefits from a wide range of facilities ‚Äì including science laboratories and established design technology rooms with a wide range of tools and equipment. Treviglas also has facilities to support its vocational subjects, which include hair and beauty therapy rooms and physiotherapy training rooms. The college has a modern catering facility, offering students the opportunity to cook in the same environment as a commercial kitchen. The college benefits from a substantial art block with pottery facilities and kiln as well as a dark room for traditional photography development. The college invests heavily in art and also encourages students to utilise modern media within their artwork. In 2011 Treviglas secured funding for a ¬£2million investment in new sports facility, the SportsHub, offering sports facilities for students and the wider community. This opened in May 2012.  Sports Hub  The SportsHub features a modern gym, with equipment from Technogym, who supplied the 2012 Olympics, as well as an indoor sports hall which can cater for basketball, netball, badminton, volleyball, tennis and football as well as a range of classes ran by the SportsHub staff and external organisations. The SportsHub also has an outdoor climbing wall. The college‚Äôs gym is open to the public, even outside college hours. The college also has a range of multipurpose sports venues, including fields and pitches, cricket facilities and The Dome - an inflated structure with indoor courts ‚Äì also used by students and community.  Arts  Royal Shakespeare Company The college has a drama studio used for lessons and performances. The college is also a Hub school for the Royal Shakespeare Company‚Äôs Learning Partnership as of 2012, and frequently hold performances and workshops with the RSC. As part of Treviglas‚Äô role as Hub school for the RSC they also stage public performances of Shakespeare plays, which have included Macbeth and Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream. Students also perform in Stratford Upon Avon at the RSC, as well as organising trips to the company.  Tutor group and house system  Prior to becoming an academy in 2018, Treviglas operated a vertical tutor system, meaning each tutor group was made up of students from each of the five year groups. The system had been in place for seven years and had been successful in integrating students of all ages. The result was a sense of community in the college and positive relationships amongst students from all years. However, prior to becoming an academy, the tutor groups have been arranged horizontally, with each form containing students from a singular year. The college also has a House System split into four groups named after beaches local to Newquay: Fistral, Porth, Tolcarne and Towan. Each of the houses has a chosen house charity which are: Aid4Orphans, Shelterbox, Air Ambulance and the RNLI respectively. Students from these house groups organise a range of activities and events throughout the year to raise money for their charities, with the totals raised running well into the thousands.  College uniform  The main colours of the Treviglas uniform are black and white, with ties matching the colours of the house group the student belongs. Students wear black trousers (girls can also opt to wear skirts) and white shirts. The college jumper is black with the main Treviglas Academy emblem.‚ÜµTies are according to house colours; Towan ties are red and black, Porth ties are yellow and black, Tolcarne ties are blue and black and Fistral ties are green and black. Students also have modern PE kit, which feature the school's emblem on black clothing. They are very strict.

He later founded Door of Hope International, a Christian relief and development organization. Biography Haralan Popov was born in the small Bulgarian village of Krasno Gradishte. Although initially an atheist, Popov became a Christian as a teenager. In 1929 he was accepted as pastor in the Bulgarian Pentecostal Church. Shortly after attending Bible School in London, he married a Swedish woman, Ruth. He returned to Bulgaria before the outbreak of World War II. In 1948, in the capital city of Sofia, he was arrested on charges of espionage against the state. After eight months in prison, Popov, and other ministers who had been arrested with him, pleaded guilty through a cruel, forced confession. Popov was sentenced to 15 years in prison. He spent the next 13 years and two months in prison. He was released on September 25, 1961 and joined his family in Sweden a year later. After moving to the United States in 1970, Popov founded Evangelism to Communist Lands Inc., now known as Door of Hope International to bring Bibles and relief to people in oppressive countries in 1972. He recorded his testimony and prison experiences in his autobiography Tortured For His Faith: An Epic of Christian Courage and Heroism in Our Day. In October 1988, during Glasnost, and for the first time in 26 years, Popov was permitted by Bulgarian authorities to visit the church he pastored in Bulgaria. He died the next month on November 14, 1988 in Glendale, California of complications related to cancer.

The island has a land area of 171.98 sq mi (445.438 km¬≤), making it the 37th largest island in the United States. There was a population of five permanent residents as of the 2000 census. Cape Hinchinbrook Light is located on the southwest side of the island. Also on the southwest side is the abandoned village of Nuchek on Port Etches (bay). The Chugach Alaska Corporation now runs the Nuuciq Spirit Camp at this site. During the Cold War, a US Government White Alice radar site was located on the northeast corner of the island. This site is now abandoned, and all that remains is a trail to the former antenna site on a small hill to the southwest and several of the buildings. Nearby Boswell Bay Airport is the landing strip that formerly served this site. A few houses comprise the hamlet of Boswell Bay across the bay to the south. The State of Alaska maintains Boswell Bay Marine State Park nearby on Boswell Bay. In 1792, a battle occurred on Hinchinbrook Island between Yakutat Tlingit and a group of Russians and Kodiak Sugpiaq led by Alexander Baranov. The Tlingit had likely come to the island seeking retribution after the Chugach Sugpiaq had raided them the previous year.Frederica De Laguna, Under Mount Saint Elias: The History and Culture of the Yakutat Tlingit (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1972), p. 159.

He also trained at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where he first played Madame Galina during Rag Week.\\"Madame Galina's whirlwind tour\\", BBC Seasons followed with British Youth Opera as well as recitals at Southwark Cathedral, Loseley Hall and the Chelsea Arts Club. He held a singing tutorship at the Guildford School of Acting until he performed as Madame Galina at a private party at the Thorpeness Country Club and was spotted by club booker Emily Latham, who arranged for him to audition for Club Kabaret in the West End. Within a week he was onstage in front of Madonna, Jude Law and Kate Moss. Chance sightings of Madame Galina shows by various producers led to Edwards being showcased by Chrysalis TV, winning Busker Of The Year, and to The Big Breakfast covering his first Edinburgh Festival in 2001. He has been touring theatres ever since in Anything For A Tenor, Madame Galina Ballet Star Galactica/The New Forces' Sweetheart and Along Came Bill.

The sleeve notes label the album \\"Number 1 in the BeCalm series\\", and its songs are generally at the gentler, more introspective end of Hammill's work. Hammill's next album, the more rocking The Noise (1993), was similarly labelled as \\"Number 1 in the A Loud series\\". Hammill decided to put the quiet and loud songs he had recently written and recorded on separate albums. At around the same time, Virgin Records, the owners of Hammill's back catalogue on Charisma Records, were planning to issue a compilation of his earlier work. When he explained the concept of the BeCalm and A Loud series to them, they decided to issue two compilations along similar lines - The Calm (After The Storm) (containing quieter songs) and The Storm (Before The Calm) (containing more aggressive material). Originally, Hammill planned to continue this separation between quiet and loud music on subsequent albums, but the plan was soon abandoned. Two of the album's tracks, \\"I Will Find You\\" and \\"Curtains\\", have become staples of Hammill's live set.

The industry had numerous ups and downs until the last whaling station closed in Albany in 1978. There are two main species of whales (order Cetacea) which form aggregations along the Western Australian coastline: the southern right whale (Eubalaena australis), and the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). The southern rights are slow swimmers and their carcases tend to float due to the high concentration of oil in the blubber - hence the name \\"right\\" as it made the task of the whale chasers easier. Its conservation status is now listed as \\"endangered\\" as result of more than 150 years of hunting. Both species migrated along the north-south coastline stopping in bays such as Geographe Bay (east of Cape Naturaliste) and Flinders Bay (east of Cape Leeuwin) for mating and breeding. Other species occasionally caught were sperm whales and blue whales, although these tended to be seen mainly along the southern coast of Western Australia. Early days \\"Yankee Whalers\\" were known to have been operating in the Indian Ocean since 1789 and had been inside King George Sound before the end of 1828. A stone structure known as Sealers' Oven (c. 1800) near Albany is further evidence of this. Albany merchant Thomas Booker Sherratt was operating a bay whaling station at Doubtful Island Bay, 160km north-east of Albany, by 1836.Gibbs (2010) p.14. By 1837, two local whaling companies were operating: the Fremantle Whaling Company out of Bather's Beach below the Round House gaol in Fremantle, and the Perth Whaling Company, which was based on Carnac Island. The first whale was caught by the combined efforts of the two companies on 10 June 1837. An account of the incident is given by George Fletcher Moore in his book Diary of Ten Years Eventful Life of an Early Settler in Western Australia: > This day will be memorable in the annals of the Colony for the killing of > the first whale. At Perth, great firing was heard in the direction of > Fremantle and it was supposed that a ship had arrived, but a messenger came > in breathless haste to say that boats had struck a whale and were engaged > with it. This was all that was known when I came away but everyone was > running about elated with the news; I went to Fremantle on Thursday with the > Governor and others, to examine a jetty and proposed tunnel which has been > projected to be cut through a hill there giving easy access from the beach > to the main street. The plan is quite practicable and not very expensive for > the distance is only eighty yards and the rock is soft limestone. The Fremantle Whaling Company had been established in February of that year. A few weeks after the whale was caught, permission was given for the tunnel's construction using prisoners for the labour. The tunnel provided direct access to the Town of Fremantle for the sale of whale goods to the community. In 1837, the first year of operations, whaling had generated export revenue of ¬£3,000 from 100 tons of oil and 5 tons of whalebone. The next largest export commodity was wool which earned ¬£1,784. In the first years of the colony, large numbers of the Yankee Whalers, as well as French vessels, frequently operated close inshore including inside Cockburn Sound, causing conflicts with Western Australian-based whale chasers. There were numerous incidents of close quarter conflicts between the various companies. Governor James Stirling was lobbied to remove the foreign vessels. The American whalers were believed to have earned ¬£30,000 from catches along the Western Australian coastline in the 1837. It is estimated that in 1845 there were approximately 300 American, French, British and Australian whaling ships operating off the south coast of Australia with numerous shore stations. Legislation was passed in 1860 prohibiting unlicensed whalers from operating in Western Australian waters. However, few foreign vessels heeded the supposed restriction. At about the same time though, petroleum oil was discovered in Pennsylvania, which caused whale oil prices to crash. By 1840, increased competition and a decline in international whale oil and bone prices and increased costs led to the two local companies' closures. Some whale boats were used for ferry services on the Swan River. An improvement in commodity prices in 1843 saw operations recommence, and in 1844 whaling products comprised nearly 40% of the total value of the state's exports. The first British pelagic whaler reported off the coast of Western Australia was the Arabian (Captain Thomas Collins) in 1842.The Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal, 7 September 1842, p.3 The town of Dunsborough in Geographe Bay evolved from the establishment of the Castle Rock Whaling Station in 1845. During the convict era of Western Australia, many of the ships which brought convicts to the state were whalers, and would revert to their whaling operations for the return voyage. Throughout the 19th century, descendants of Robert and Ann Heppingstone, who had arrived in the colony in the Warrior in 1830, were prominent in the industry. Members of the family operated whalers in and around Fremantle. A granddaughter, Ellen Heppingstone, married Alf Bussell and settled in Augusta at Flinders Bay. Flinders Bay, also known to some locals as \\"The Whaling\\", became an important whaling centre during the period. Major work on the history and archaeology of the early whaling industry in Western Australia, as well as relations between colonists and American pelagic whalers, and between both groups and coastal Aboriginal peoples, has been undertaken by Martin Gibbs of the University of Sydney. A whale bone collected as an artefact at an Aboriginal camp near Kalgoorlie in 1897, transported hundreds of kilometres from any coastline, was a vertebra of a young whale that was probably obtained at Esperance and perhaps employed as a carrying dish or culturally valued object. 20th century The Western Australian Government granted a licence to a Norwegian company in 1912 to operate whaling stations at Frenchman Bay near Albany and Point Cloates (then known as Norwegian Bay) off North West Cape. The company traded profitably for a number of years by making use of the recently invented exploding harpoon and gun on steam powered chaser boats, rather than the old toggling harpoons. Approximately 4,000 whales were caught in that period. A poor whaling season in 1916 amid pressures brought on by World War I, forced the company to close down. In the early 1930s, the station at Point Cloates began servicing Norwegian whaling ships again, but again, closure was brought on by the start of World War II. Expanded use of factory ships and support chasers also lessened the need for shore based services. After the war, in July 1949, the Nor'-West Whaling Company reopened the station. In September 1950, the Australian Government commenced whaling itself as the Australian Whaling Commission in a whaling station at Babbage Island near Carnarvon. The operation ran until 1955, when the station was sold to Nor'-West Whaling Company, which closed down its Point Cloates station and relocated to the Carnarvon site. Nor'-West was later renamed as 'Nor-West Seafoods' and converted the whaling station into a factory for processing prawns. The company continues today as a prawn processor as well as operating seasonal whale and dolphin watching tours. The Albany Whaling Company operated at Frenchman's Bay east of Albany from 1947 until 1950. It took only six humpback whales. Cheynes Beach Whaling Station The Cheynes Beach Whaling Company started at Frenchman Bay in 1952. Initially the station was granted a quota of only 50 humpbacks, but this was increased and at its peak, the company took between 900 and 1100 sperm and humpback whales each year for processing. However, there was a ban on humpback whaling from 1963 which decreased the viability of the catch. Cheynes Beach struggled commercially for several years prior to its closure in 1978 because of increased fuel costs and uncertain buyers in Europe. The uncertainty of not being able to sell a product finally brought an end to the industry which had been an important contributor to the economy for 140 years and the last whale, a female sperm whale, was taken on 20 November 1978. The final season's catch had 698 sperm whales, 15 short of its quota set by the International Whaling Commission. It was the last whaling station in Australia. Cheynes Beach Whaling Station is now known as Albany's Historic Whaling Station, a popular tourist destination. Whale watching from Albany centres on humpback whales close to shore. Sperm whales are rarely seen as their migratory path takes them on a course parallel to the coast line and along the continental shelf.

Military career Campbell was the fifth son of Colonel John Campbell of Melfort and Colina, daughter of John Campbell of Achalader. From his boyhood Campbell gave evidence of a daring disposition, and in 1792, at the age of sixteen, he ran away from the Perth Academy, and entered himself on a ship bound for the West Indies. He was met in the fruit market at Kingston in Jamaica by his brother (afterwards Admiral Sir) Patrick Campbell, then serving on HMS Blonde, who brought him home. His parents yielded to his wishes, and in 1793 he became a midshipman on board an East Indiaman and made one or two voyages. In February 1795 Campbell became a lieutenant in the 3rd battalion of the Breadalbane Fencibles, then commanded by his uncle, Lieutenant Colonel John Campbell of Achalader. With the Fencibles he saw action in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. On 3 October 1799 he entered a West India regiment as ensign, and in 1800 acted as brigade-major in the island of St. Vincent. On 21 August 1801 he was gazetted a lieutenant in the 35th Foot, and at once exchanged into the 78th Foot (Ross-shire Buffs), which was then stationed in British India. He joined his new regiment at Poona, accompanied Arthur Wellesley in the Second Anglo-Maratha War against the Maharajah Scindia and the Rajah of Nagpore, and so greatly distinguished himself by leading the flank companies at the storming of the Pettah of Ahmednagar on 8 August 1803 that Wellesley at once appointed him brigade- major. In this capacity he served at the Battle of Assaye, where he was severely wounded and had two (or possibly three) horses killed under him, at the Battle of Argaum, and at the storming of Gawilghur. On leaving India Wellesley strongly recommended Campbell to his brother, Richard, Lord Wellesley, who made him his aide-de-camp, and to Lord Lake, who, on 9 January 1805, gave him a company in the 75th Highlanders. He returned to England with Lord Wellesley in 1806, and Sir Arthur Wellesley at once asked that he should be appointed brigade-major to his brigade, then stationed at Hastings. As brigade-major he accompanied Wellesley to Hanover and on the Copenhagen Expedition (1807), when his services at the battle of Kioge were conspicuous. In 1808 Sir Arthur Wellesley appointed Campbell his senior aide-de-camp, when he took command of the expeditionary force destined for Portugal, and sent him home with the despatches announcing the victory at Roli√ßa on 17 August Campbell, however, windbound and hearing the guns, disembarked, and was present at the Battle of Vimeiro. Sir Harry Burrard then gave him the Vimeiro despatch, and Campbell was promoted a major in the army by brevet on 2 September 1808, and major of the 70th Foot on 15 December 1808. On the same day he was appointed an assistant adjutant-general to a division of the reinforcements intended for the Peninsula. He was present at the passage of the Douro, at the battles of Talavera and Busaco, and was promoted lieutenant- colonel by brevet on 3 May 1810. He was frequently engaged during the pursuit of Marshal Mass√©na and was present at the Battle of Fuentes de O√±oro and at Salamanca. He obtained the post of assistant quartermaster-general at the headquarters of the army in the Peninsular, at Wellington's special request, in the spring of 1812, and acted in that capacity until the end of the Peninsular War, doing much, it is said, to smooth Wellington's relations with the quartermaster-general, George Murray. He was present at the storming of Badajoz and in ten general actions, for which he received the Peninsular Gold Cross and six clasps. On 4 June 1814 Campbell was promoted colonel in the army by brevet, and on 25 July made a captain and lieutenant-colonel in the Coldstream Guards. He was also appointed assistant quartermaster-general at the Horse Guards, and made a KCB, and a knight of the Tower and Sword of Portugal. In 1815 he was attached to the staff of the Duke of Wellington, as commandant at headquarters, and was present at the Battle of Waterloo; he held the post throughout Wellington's residence at Paris in the army of occupation, from 1815 to 1818. According to Wellington he was a great soldier but a bad French scholar: \\"When he wished his dinner to be arranged on the table, he used, as it were, to address the dishes, 'Bif-teck venez i√ßi! Petits p√¢tes allez l√†!\\" Campbell then exchanged his company in the guards for the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 65th Foot, which he held until he was promoted major-general in 1825. He held the command of the southern district for some years. Campbell became lieutenant-governor of Tobago in 1828 and Lieutenant- Governor of Portsmouth and General Officer Commanding South-West District later that year, and in 1833 was appointed lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia. In November 1840 he was promoted to the governorship of Ceylon, where he remained from September 1839 to June 1847. It was during his tenure of the latter office that the Duke of Wellington, to whose faithful friendship he owed so much, wrote to him: \\"We are both growing old; God knows if we shall ever meet again. Happen what may, I shall never forget our first meeting under the walls of Ahmednuggur\\". He was colonel 99th Foot 1834‚Äì1836, and of 72nd Foot 1836 until death. In June 1847 he returned to England, and on 13 June he died, being buried in St. James's Church, Piccadilly. A memorial to him also lies within the church.

He was a wicket-keeper who played for Sheffield Cricket Club, and for Yorkshire County Cricket Club when the latter was founded in 1863. Stephenson was born in Headford Street, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Stephenson was a right-handed batsman, a wicketkeeper and an occasional right arm fast roundarm bowler. In the 1850s, he ran a tobacconist and cricket ball shop on Bramall Lane, Sheffield, which was close to the ground that became home to both Yorkshire County Cricket Club and Sheffield United Football Club. In 1861, along with his fellow Yorkshireman Roger Iddison, Stephenson sailed to Australia on the SS Great Britainhttps://globalstories.ssgreatbritain.org/_/traveller/8432 as part of the first England cricket team to visit there. On 1, 3 and 4 March 1862, he was part of The World team that defeated a Surrey XI at Melbourne Cricket Ground by six wickets. His swan song was as part of a winning Yorkshire team against Lancashire County Cricket Club at Bramall Lane on 1 July 1873, in front of a partisan Sheffield crowd, and alongside his long-time cricketing partner and fellow Sheffielder, Joseph Rowbotham. He finished with a first- class tally of 803 runs at an average of 14.33. He held 30 catches and effected 27 stumpings in his 36 matches for the county club. In total, Stephenson played in 82 first-class matches scoring 1,940 runs at 14.80, with 56 catches and 48 stumpings. His life was filled with tragedy, losing his first wife and three children in his lifetime. Contrary to some obituary notices, Stephenson did not die at the Tuebrook Asylum for Inebriates in Liverpool. He actually died from tuberculosis in July 1898, at his home in Tuebrook, Liverpool, aged 66.

It was recorded shortly after a decision to re-form the band Van der Graaf Generator (of which Hammill was the singer and principal songwriter) and Nadir's Big Chance is actually performed by the reformed Van der Graaf Generator line-up. The album's songs vary greatly in style, as acknowledged by Hammill in the sleeve notes, which refer to \\"the beefy punk songs, the weepy ballads, the soul struts\\".

The album includes two of Hammill's most frequently performed ballads, \\"Been Alone So Long\\" (written by Judge Smith) and \\"Shingle Song\\", and a reworking of Van der Graaf Generator's first single from 1968, \\"People You Were Going To\\". The album saw Hammill's first use of the Hohner clavinet D6 keyboard, which went on to feature prominently on the next few Van der Graaf Generator albums (particularly Godbluff). In the song \\"Pushing Thirty\\" (from The Future Now, 1978), Hammill claims that he \\"still can be Nadir\\".

MP, head of Gorakhnath temple and a political rabble-rouser , Hindustan Times, 6 April 2017. 5 June 1972 Shri Yogi Adityanath: Members bioprofile , Sixteenth Lok Sabha, retrieved 19 March 2017.) is an Indian Hindu monk and politician serving as the 22nd and current Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, in office since 19 March 2017. He was appointed as the Chief Minister on 26 March 2017 after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the 2017 State Assembly elections, in which he was a prominent campaigner. He has been the Member of Parliament from the Gorakhpur constituency, Uttar Pradesh, for five consecutive terms since 1998. Adityanath is also the Mahant or head priest of the Gorakhnath Math, a Hindu temple in Gorakhpur, a position he has held since the death of his spiritual \\"father\\", Mahant Avaidyanath, in September 2014. He is also the founder of Hindu Yuva Vahini, a Hindu Nationalist organisation. He is often considered a Hindu nationalist due to his controversial views. He has an image as a right-wing populist Hindutva firebrand. Early life and education Yogi Adityanath was born as Ajay Mohan Bisht on 5 June 1972 in the village of Panchur, in Pauri Garhwal, Uttar Pradesh (now in Uttarakhand). His late father Anand Singh Bisht was a forest ranger. He was the second born in the family, among four brothers and three sisters. He completed his bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University in Uttarakhand. He left his home around the 1990s to join the Ayodhya Ram temple movement. Around that time, he also became a disciple of Mahant Avaidyanath, the chief of the Gorakhnath Math. Upon taking Diksha as sanyasi of the Nath tradition, he was given the name 'Yogi Adityanath' and designated as the successor of the Mahant Avaidyanath. While based in Gorakhpur after his initiation, Adityanath has often visited his ancestral village, establishing a school there in 1998. Spiritual career Adityanath renounced his family in 1993, at the age of 21 and became a disciple of Mahant Avaidyanath, the then high priest of Gorakhnath Math. He was promoted to the rank of Mahant or high priest of the Gorakhnath Math after the death of his teacher Mahant Aavaidyanath on 12 September 2014. Yogi Adityanath was made Peethadhishwar (Head Seer) of the Math amid traditional rituals of the Nath sect on 14 September 2014. Early political career Scholar Christophe Jaffrelot states that Yogi Adityanath belongs to a specific tradition of Hindutva politics in Uttar Pradesh that can be traced back to the Mahant Digvijay Nath, who led the capture of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya for Hindus on 22 December 1949. Both Digvijay Nath and his successor, Mahant Avaidyanath, belonged to the Hindu Mahasabha and were elected to the Parliament on that party's ticket. After the BJP and the Sangh Parivar joined the Ayodhya movement in the 1980s, the two strands of Hindu nationalism came together. Avaidyanath switched to the BJP in 1991, but nevertheless maintained significant autonomy. Yogi Adityanath was appointed Avaidyanath's successor as the Mahant of Gorakhnath Math in 1994. Four years later, he was elected to the Lower House of the Indian Parliament (the Lok Sabha). After his first electoral win, Adityanath started his own youth wing Hindu Yuva Vahini, which has been known for their activities in the eastern Uttar Pradesh and was instrumental in Adityanath's meteoric rise . There have been recurrent tensions between Adityanath and the BJP leadership over the allocation of election tickets. However, the BJP has not let the tensions mount because Adityanath has served as a star campaigner for the party.Uttar Pradesh's next CM Yogi Adityanath, a mascot of unapologetic Hindutva , Daily News and Analysis, 18 March 2017. In 2006, he took up links between Nepali Maoists and Indian Leftist parties as key campaign issue and encouraged Madhesi leaders to oppose Maoism in Nepal. In 2008, his convoy was reportedly attacked while en route to Azamgarh for an anti-terrorism rally. The attack left one person dead and at least six persons injured. Member of Parliament Adityanath was the youngest member of the 12th Lok Sabha at 26. He has been elected to the Parliament from Gorakhpur for five consecutive terms (in 1998, 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014 elections). Adityanath's attendance in Lok Sabha was 77% and he has asked 284 questions, participated in 56 debates and introduced three private member Bills in the 16th Lok Sabha. Relations with the BJP Adityanath has had strained relations with the BJP for more than a decade. He often derided and undermined the BJP, criticising its dilution of the Hindutva ideology. Having established his own independent power base in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, with the support of the Hindu Yuva Vahini and the Gorakhnath Math, he felt confident to be able to dictate terms to the BJP. When his voice was not heard, he revolted by fielding candidates against the official BJP candidates. The most prominent example was the fielding of Radha Mohan Das Agarwal from Gorakhpur on a Hindu Mahasabha ticket in 2002, who then defeated BJP Cabinet minister, Shiv Pratap Shukla by a wide margin. In 2007, Adityanath threatened to field 70 candidates for the state assembly against the BJP candidates. But he reached a compromise in the end. In 2009 Parliamentary elections, Adityanath was rumoured to have campaigned against the BJP candidates who were then defeated. Despite his periodic revolts, Yogi Adityanath has been kept in good humour by the RSS and the BJP leaders. The deputy prime minister L. K. Advani, the RSS chief Rajendra Singh and the VHP chief Ashok Singhal have visited him in Gorakhpur. During 22‚Äì24 December 2006, Adityanath organised a three-day Virat Hindu Mahasammelan at Gorakhpur at the same time as the BJP National Executive Meet in Lucknow. Despite the conflict, several RSS and VHP leaders attended the Mahasammelan, which issued a commitment to pursue the Hindutva goals despite the BJP's claimed \\"abandonment\\" of them. In March 2010, Adityanath was one of the several BJP MPs who defied the party whip on the Women's Reservation Bill in the Parliament. In 2018, he campaigned for BJP candidate Pratap Puriji Maharaj for Rajasthan state assembly election.

In August 2020, India Today-Karvy Insights's \\"Mood of the nation\\" survey showed Yogi as best performing Chief Minister in India. Personal views On 3 January 2016, a day after the terrorist attack on an Indian air force base in Pathankot allegedly by Pakistani terrorists, Adityanath compared Pakistan to Satan. Adityanath has praised the US President Donald Trump's decision to enact a ban on citizens from 7 Muslim-majority countries entering the United States and has called for India to adopt similar policies to tackle terrorism. Controversies In January 2007, Adityanath with other BJP leaders had gathered to mourn the death of a man who was killed because of religious violence. He and his supporters were subsequently arrested by the police and lodged in Gorkhapur jail on the charges of disturbing peace and violating prohibitory orders. His arrest led to further unrest during which several coaches of the Mumbai bound Mumbai-Gorakhpur Godan Express were burnt, allegedly by protesting Hindu Yuva Vahini activists. The day after the arrest, the District Magistrate and the local police chief were transferred and replaced. In 2011, the documentary film Saffron War ‚Äì Radicalization of Hinduism accused Adityanath of promoting communal disharmony in Uttar Pradesh through hate speeches. In 2017, his government ordered withdrawal of around 20,000 \\"politically motivated\\" cases, including those against himself and other politicians.  Statements  In 2010, when opposing the Women's Reservation Bill, Adityanath said that reservation doesn't affect women's domestic responsibilities such as childcare. He added that if men develop feminine traits they become gods, but if women develop masculine traits they become demons. In an undated video that surfaced on YouTube during August 2014, Adityanath, reportedly during a public speech at Azamgarh, referring to the religious conversions due to inter-religious marriages, has said, \\"if they take one Hindu girl, we will take 100 Muslims girls.\\" In the same video, he continues by saying, \\"if they kill one Hindu, there will be 100 that we\\" and pauses, as the gathered crowd shouts: \\"kill\\". In February 2015, while speaking at the Vishwa Hindu Parishad‚Äôs ‚ÄòVirat Hindu Sammelan‚Äô, Adityanath commented: \\"If given a chance, we will install statues of Goddess Gauri, Ganesh and Nandi \\" ‚Äî Hindu deities ‚Äî \\"in every mosque.\\" In June 2015, Adityanath, while talking about Surya Namaskara, and Yoga said that those who want to avoid Yoga can leave Hindustan. He \\"requested\\" those who see communalism in the Sun God to drown themselves in the sea or live in a dark room for the rest of their lives. During the intolerance debate in the Indian media in late 2015, Adityanath commented that actor Shah Rukh Khan was using the same \\"language\\" as Pakistani terrorist Hafiz Saeed.

He is remembered today as a pioneer in the art of clock design and construction. The Astrarium, which he designed and built over a period of 16 years, was a highly complex astronomical clock and planetarium, constructed only 60 or so years after the very first mechanical clocks had been built in Europe, and demonstrated an ambitious attempt to describe and model the planetary system with mathematical precision and technological sophistication. The Astrarium: tracing of an illustration in the Tractatus astrarii showing the weights, escapement, and main gear train but not the complex upper section with its many wheels Life Giovanni was the second son of Jacopo Dondi dell'Orologio and Zaccarota Centrago or Centraco of Chioggia. His father was a doctor and astronomer, and builder of a large astronomical clock in the tower of the Palazzo Capitaniato of Padua in 1344. Giovanni lived with his father from 1348 to 1359, and shared his father's interest in astronomy and clockmaking. In 1348 he began working on what he called his astrarium or planetarium. He described in detail the design and construction of this project, which was to occupy him until 1364. His manuscripts provided enough material for modern clockmakers to build reconstructions. In 1371 he served as ambassador to Venice, but after the conflict between Padua and Venice in 1372, joined the University of Pavia, and served as diplomat and scholar until his death in Abbiategrasso on 19 October 1388. He is buried at Sant'Eustorgio in Milan. Giovanni Dondi and the Padovana chicken It is frequently reported, in sources from the 19th and early 20th centuries to the present, that the \\"Marquis Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio\\" was responsible for introducing the Padovana chicken, which closely resembles the Polish breed, from Poland to Italy. However the Dondi who was ennobled was the soldier Francesco Dondi, created Marquis by King John III Sobieski in 1676; no journey to or contact with Poland by Giovanni Dondi in the 14th century is documented. Written works Dondi wrote on a wide range of subjects. His most celebrated work is the Tractatus astrarii or Planetarium, which describes the Astrarium. It is one of the earliest surviving descriptions of its kind, predated by only a few years by the Albion and Horologium of Richard of Wallingford. In the introduction, Dondi writes that his machine was built in accordance with the 13th-century Theorica planetarum of Campano di Novara, and to demonstrate the validity of the descriptions of the motion of heavenly bodies of Aristotle and Avicenna. The Tractatus survives in twelve manuscript sources. The autograph in the Biblioteca Capitolare of Padua (MS. D39) and a copy of it, also in Padua, are certainly the work of Dondi. The other sources are rewritten versions of the autograph, to which Dondi's contribution is as yet unclear. The autograph manuscript was published in 1987 in a critical edition with colour facsimile and French translation by Poulle as the first volume of the Opera omnia of Jacopo and Giovanni Dondi. Of the twenty-nine lectures on medical topics, the Sermones and Colationes, delivered between 1356 and 1388, only the titles survive, with the exception of one, the Sermo in conventu magistri Iohannis ab Aquila in medicina 1367 (Biblioth√®que Nationale, Paris, Lat. 9637), and some passages from that in Bologna in the same year cited by Francesco Scipione Dondi dall'Orologio. The twenty-four Quaestiones super libris Tegni, dating from about 1356, are preserved in a manuscript begun in 1370 by Tommaso da Crema and now in the Biblioteca Palatina of Parma (Parmense 1065); Tegne was the mediaeval name for the summary by Galenus of the works of Hippocrates. The Quaestiones are to date unpublished, as are Dondi's Experimenta or medical prescriptions, conserved in a manuscript of Iohannes de Livonia dated 1453 and now in the Biblioteca Civica of Padua (C.M. 172). Another lost work, a tractatulum Galieni occultam seriem explicantem in distinctione dispositionum corporum humanorum, quorum in libro Microtegni sub brevitate restrinxit reales differentias inter illas, preterquani in paucis assignatum, was probably written at Pavia during the plague of 1383, and may have discussed the De complexionibus of Galenus. The short practical treatise on the avoidance of plague, De modo vivendi tempore pestilentiali, was written shortly afterwards; it was published, in Italian, by Zambrini in 1866, and by Sudhoff in 1911. In natural science, Dondi wrote De fontibus calidis agri Patavini, dedicated to his friend Iacopino da Angarano, and preserved in autograph manuscript in the Biblioteca del Seminario of Padua (ms. 358) and in a copy in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan (H 107 sup.). Together with the Tractatus de causa salsedinis aquarum et modo conficiendi sal artificiale ex aquis Thermalibus Euganeis by his father Jacopo, it was published by Tommaso Giunti in De balneis omnia quae extant apud Graecos, Latinos et Arabas in 1553. A manuscript in the Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana (Ms. lat. XIV 223 (4340)), though not in Dondi's hand, contains both his own literary work and selections copied from that of others. It contains his Iter Romanum, which describes the Roman monuments of Rimini and Rome in a scientific manner, with measurements and transcriptions of inscriptions, and was published by Rossi in 1888; his Epistolario of twenty-eight letters, of which the two to Petrarch have attracted particular attention; and his Rime, consisting of forty-two sonnets, five madrigals and three ballate, published by Medin in 1895 and Daniele in 1990. Musical settings for two of the ballate survive, \\"La sacrosanta carit√† d'amore,\\" set by Bartolino da Padova, a copy of which was sent to the poet-minstrel Francesco di Vannozzo, and \\"Omay √ßascun se doglia.\\" Dondi's quaedani apostillae or notes on a letter of Seneca, mentioned in a manuscript of Gasparino Barzizza from 1411, have not been traced. The Astrarium Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci, Milan. The astrarium was considered to be a marvel of its day. Giovanni Manzini of Pavia writes (in 1388) that it is a work \\"full of artifice, worked on and perfected by your hands and carved with a skill never attained by the expert hand of any craftsman. I conclude that there was never invented an artifice so excellent and marvelous and of such genius\\". Dondi writes that he obtained the idea of an astrarium from the Theorica planetarum of Giovanni Campano da Novara, who describes the construction of the equatorium. The astrarium was primarily a clockwork equatorium with astrolabe and calendar dials, and indicators for the sun, moon, and planets. It provided a continuous display of the major elements of the solar system and of the legal, religious, and civil calendars of the day. Dondi's intention was that it would help people's understanding of astronomical and astrological concepts. Astrology was then considered a subject worthy of study by the intellectual elite and was taken reasonably seriously. In 1381 Dondi presented his clock to the Duke Gian Galeazzo Visconti, who installed it in the library of his castle in Pavia. It remained there until at least 1485. It may have been seen and drawn by Leonardo da Vinci. The final fate of the clock is unknown.

Rita Hayworth's costumes were designed by Jean Louis. Hayworth's dances for this film were choreographed by Valerie Bettis. This film was the last produced by Hayworth's production company, the Beckworth Corporation. The film stars Rita Hayworth as Salome, as well as Stewart Granger, Charles Laughton and Judith Anderson, with Cedric Hardwicke, Alan Badel and Basil Sydney. Plot Although based on the New Testament story, the film does not follow the Biblical text and is highly fictionalized, critically passing the blame of John the Baptist's death wholly upon her mother. In Galilee, during the rule of Rome's Tiberius Caesar (Cedric Hardwicke), King Herod (Charles Laughton) and Queen Herodias (Judith Anderson) sit on the throne and are condemned by a prophet known as John the Baptist (Alan Badel). Herodias resents John's denunciation of her marriage to the king, her former husband's brother, for which John labels her an adulteress. The king is not pleased with the Baptist condemning his rule, but fears he will face the same fate his father, the elder Herod, suffered after ordering the murder of firstborn males when Jesus was born. The prophecy states that if a king of Judea kills the Messiah, he will suffer an agonizing death. The king believes John the Baptist is the Messiah because of the mistaken belief of some peasants. After Marcellus, nephew of Caesar, petitions his uncle to marry Salome, he receives a message stating that he is forbidden to marry a \\"barbarian.\\" Salome is also sent a message stating that she is banished from Rome for seeking to rise above her station, and will be escorted back to Galilee, despite having lived in Rome since childhood. When Marcellus does nothing to protest Caesar's decree, she declares that she shall never love another Roman. On the boat escorting her home, Salome meets Claudius, a Roman soldier assigned to the palace of Herod. He is amused by her haughty behavior and thwarts her attempt to order him around when she demands to use drinking water instead of sea water for her bath aboard the ship. When he brings sea water instead, she slaps him. He interrupts her angry tirade by stealing a long kiss, which shocks her. Queen Herodias greets her daughter warmly when she arrives at the palace, and becomes aware of the lecherous intentions of the king, who marvels at the beauty of his stepdaughter/niece. The queen sends Salome away and consults with her advisor, who agrees that the queen can use the king's desire for Salome for her own benefit. Meanwhile, Salome sneaks into the marketplace with several servants to hear John the Baptist speak. When he calls her mother an adulteress, she repudiates him, inadvertently revealing her identity. She is then is spared from the angry crowd by John the Baptist, who calms them and denounces violence. Salome returns to the palace, upset by what she has heard. She implores her mother to leave Galilee with her for her safety, but Herodias claims that she is trapped in a loveless and potentially deadly marriage to the king because she wishes to preserve the throne for Salome's sake. Although Salome does not care about the throne, Herodias insists on its importance, and exaggerates her fear of being stoned to death by John the Baptist's followers. Knowing of Claudius's feelings for her, Salome seductively beguiles him in an attempt to have him arrest John the Baptist to spare her mother's potential death as an adulteress. When he refuses her request, she exits the room in anger. Shortly after, the king decides to arrest John the Baptist, ostensibly for treason but in reality to protect him from the actions of his wife, who has attempted to have him assassinated. The trial ends with the king imprisoning John the Baptist. Salome hears that the prophet has been arrested; she thinks that Claudius did it for her, and apologizes to him for her behavior the night before. After she leaves, Claudius rushes to the king to plead for John the Baptist's release, but is unable to persuade him. He then rushes off to Jerusalem on horseback to seek his release. The king visits Salome, who bids Claudius farewell from the balcony, and is irritated that she pays him attention. Herod attempts to gift her a necklace, and suggests she \\"find pleasure in the moment.\\" Knowing the implications of his gift, she rejects it, reminding him that his queen is her mother. Claudius meets with Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem, who refuses to release the Baptist because he preaches against Rome, which is treasonous. He dismisses the Baptist as a threat, and tells Claudius there are many such prophets in the land, mentioning a miracle worker in Jerusalem. Claudius confesses he is a follower of the Baptist and the religion he preaches, and attempts to persuade Pilate to join him as a champion of this new religion. Pilate relieves him from his post and forbids Claudius from returning to Galilee, but does not arrest him because of their friendship. Exiting their meeting, Claudius learns of where the miracle worker is located, and travels to see him. He then returns to the palace, where Salome runs to greet him with a tearful embrace. During his departure, Herodias has manipulated Salome into thinking that the only way she can save her mother's life is by dancing for the king. Salome is appalled by this suggestion, as it would mean surrendering her will and body to Herod, and becoming his possession. She pleads with Claudius to take her from Galilee, but he tells her that he needs to reveal something to her before they can leave. He then leads Salome to John the Baptist's cell, where she discovers he is a Christian convert. Claudius tells them both of the miracle worker, whom John recognizes as his kinsman, the Messiah. John's faith and words move Salome, who resolves to save his life. Claudius and Salome both rush off to try to put their plans to save John into action. Claudius clashes with the palace guards in an attempt to free John from his cell. Against Claudius's wishes, who knows what happens to those who dance for the king, Salome dances a wild, enchanting dance in which she removes layers of clothing, which she knows will please Herod. At the end of her dance she will ask him to set John free. Herod, enthralled by her dance, offhandedly muses that he would give half his kingdom for Salome. Seated beside him, Herodias quickly seizes the chance to ask him to order John's death, and John is beheaded before Salome finishes her dance. Horrified, she renounces her mother Herodias, who planned and ordered the execution, and like Claudius, becomes a Christian convert. The last scene shows Salome and Claudius listening to Christ (whose face is not shown) delivering the Sermon on the Mount.

The 15-hectare park is located on the south bank of the Maribyrnong River in Footscray in Victoria. It is classified as a heritage place on the Victorian Heritage Register for its aesthetic, horticultural and social significance to the State of Victoria and was the first gardens to be placed on the register. The park is noted for its botanical collection, ornamental ponds and garden structures. History Detail from original plan The park was established following lobbying by local citizens to establish parkland on the site. The original layout of the park was designed by architect Rodney Alsop, who won a design competition for the park in 1911. The Footscray Park Beautification Committee was formed by the residents and supported by local businesses and individuals. Much of the work was carried out by volunteers, including local Boy Scouts. By 1914 the park already had a large collection of Australian native species, predominantly Eucalyptus and Acacias. Many of the gardens structures including arbours, bridges and ponds were constructed by unemployed Victorians during the Depression. The majority of the layout and installation of features was carried out under the direction of David Mathews who was Superintendent of Parks and Gardens for the City of Footscray between 1916 and 1964. William Nicholls, an orchid specialist, also assisted in the task. The slopes of the park were a vantage point for a crowd of 40,000 to see Bert Hinkler land his plane at Flemington Racecourse in 1928 as part of an Australian tour following his successful completion of the first solo flight from England to Australia. The park has been the venue for two large Melbourne events - The Saltwater Festival and the Vietnamese Festival. Park layout and features Entrance The entrance to the park on Ballarat Road features stone walls and wrought iron grates which incorporate the wording \\"Footscray Park\\". A World War I memorial which was unveiled in 1922 stands at the entranceway. It features an Italian-sculpted marble statue of Victory on a granite base. A rustic stone columned lookout shelter and pergola which was designed and built by students from Footscray Technical School in 1928 has a view toward the Maribyrnong River and Flemington Racecourse. Nearby a mounted bust of Henry Lawson honours the Australian poet and writer and the inaugural Henry Lawson Literary Society commemorative event held in the park. The park has two (originally three) major paths running east‚Äìwest along the embankment which are bisected by a north‚Äìsouth path (the T.B. Drew Memorial Walk) which descends the embankment through a wisteria-covered arbour to Thomson Water Garden. The Alfred Green Memorial Fountain (locally known as the \\"platypus fountain\\") is an unusual granite fountain that is supported at its base by two sculpted platypus. The park also has open playing fields on the flat area near the river. Trees The park has a diverse collection of mature trees, including palms, elms, ash, oaks, cypress, various Australian species as well as a number of species which are rare in cultivation in Australia. The following trees are cited in its heritage listing: *Brahea armata (Blue Hesper Palm) *Clerodendrum glabrum (2 trees) *Cupressus macrocarpa 'Hodginsii' *Ficus microcarpa var. hillii (Hill's Fig) *Melaleuca halmaturorum *Quercus aff. stellata *Vitex agnus-castus * Ulmus glabra 'Exoniensis' (Exeter Elm) References * Heritage Council of Victoria: Footscray Park * The Footscray Historical Society: The Citizens' Memorial Statue ‚Äì Victory Category:Heritage sites in Melbourne Category:Parks in Melbourne Category:Victorian Heritage Register ","title":"Footscray Park"},{"id":"7105996","text":"State Reserves of Azerbaijan refers to the state reserves in Azerbaijan, which preserve the fauna, flora and their ecosystems.

In 1998, the channel was changed into a pan-Nordic pay channel showing nature documentaries from 6p.m. to 9 p.m. (\\"TV6 Nature World\\") and then action movies and series from 9 p.m. to midnight (\\"TV6 Action World\\"). In 2002, the channel was renamed and became Viasat Nature and Viasat Action. Viasat Nature acquires programming from international distributors and production houses. The content on Viasat Action was gradually shifted to include more crime series such as Law & Order and CSI. This strand was therefore rebranded into Viasat Crime on 1 October 2005. After several years as a six-hour channel, Viasat Nature/Crime extended its broadcasting hours on 1 February 2007. Viasat Nature would now broadcast from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. when Viasat Crime took over and broadcast until midnight. The channel has timeshared with many channels over the years. In its early years, the shopping channel TVG filled up much of the daytime schedule. In 1996, the sports channel Sportkanalen was broadcasting in the weekends. From 1997, Playboy TV has broadcast on the channel after midnight.Sat-UK #90: MORE FOR SCANDINAVIA Nickelodeon Scandinavia started broadcasting from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. later on and continued to do so until 2007 when Viasat Nature extended its broadcasting hours.

The station was closed to all traffic in January 1972. The station has since been demolished and the site redeveloped. History The station, which opened on 1 July 1852, was named \\"Carnarvon\\".Butt (1995), page 54 The town was originally the terminus of the branch line from Menai bridge; later becoming part of the Carnarvonshire Railway. In 1864 the Carnarvon and Llanberis Railway extended the branch line from Carnarvon station to Llanberis. A tunnel was constructed just south of the station to carry the new line. The tunnel was reopened in 1995 as a road tunnel. By 1871 all three original companies were absorbed into the London and North Western Railway. The station was renamed \\"Caernarvon\\" on 27 March 1926. In 1964 the lines to Afon Wen and Llanberis were closed under the Beeching Axe.Baughan (1988) On 5 January 1970, Caernarvon was closed to all services.Butt (1995), page 51 However following a fire that destroyed the Britannia Bridge over the Menai Straits on 23 May 1970, the branch and goods yard were temporarily reopened for freight traffic until 30 January 1972. The branch line to Caernarvon station was finally closed with the resumption of rail services to Anglesey and Holyhead in February 1972. The track was removed and the station completely demolished. A Morrisons store now occupies the site. Present The Welsh Highland Railway (WHR) now operates from Caernarfon railway station which uses the original trackbed of the Carnarvonshire Railway just south of the tunnel on St Helen's Road beneath the high retaining walls of Segontium Terrace. Caernarfon Council have a longer term plan to reinstate the rail transport link to Bangor. After speculation that the WHR would at some point in time extended itself to Bangor, owner the Ffestiniog Railway wrote to the council in January 2014 to confirm that they would not themselves be supportive of such a scheme in narrow gauge, but supported the reconnection of the town to the national rail network using standard gauge.

It brought together leading merchants in a regulated company in the nature of a guild. Its members' main business was exporting cloth, especially white (undyed) broadcloth, in return for a large range of foreign goods.Robert Brenner, Merchants and revolution: commercial change, political conflict, and London's overseas traders, 1550-1653 (Verso, 2003).E. Lipson, The Economic History of England ((1956), 2;196-269. In the early seventeenth century, similar groups of investors were formed to develop overseas trade and colonies in the New World: the Virginia Company (which later split into the London Company settling Jamestown and the Chesapeake Bay area, and the Plymouth Company, which settled New England). The Company of Adventurers in Canada sent forces during the Thirty Years War that achieved the surrender of Quebec in 1629. Origin The company received its royal charter from King Henry IV in 1407,\\"Merchant Adventurers\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Online Library Edition, 2013. Retrieved 22 July 2013. but its roots may go back to the Fraternity of St. Thomas of Canterbury. It claimed to have liberties existing as early as 1216. The Duke of Brabant granted privileges and in return promised no fees to trading merchants. The company was chiefly chartered to the English merchants at Antwerp in 1305. This body may have included the Staplers, who exported raw wool, as well as the Merchant Adventurers. Henry IV's charter was in favor of the English merchants dwelling in Holland, Zeeland, Brabant, and Flanders. Other groups of merchants traded to different parts of northern Europe, including merchants dwelling in Prussia, Scania, the Sound, and the Hanseatic League (whose election of a governor was approved by Richard II of England in 1391), and the English Merchants in Norway, Sweden and Denmark (who received a charter in 1408). Under the Tudors Under Henry VII's charter of 1505, the company had a governor and 24 assistants. The members were trading investors, and most of them were probably mercers of the City of London.Many records of the Court Meetings of the Merchant Adventurers of London are printed in L. Lyell and F.D. Watney (eds), Acts of Court of the Mercers' Company 1453-1527 (Cambridge University Press, 1936). However, the company also had members from York, Norwich, Exeter, Ipswich, Newcastle, Hull, and other places. The merchant adventurers of these towns were separate but affiliated bodies. The Society of Merchant Venturers of Bristol was a separate group of investors, chartered by Edward VI in 1552. Under Henry VII, the merchants who were not of London complained about restraint of trade. They had once traded freely with Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, and the Netherlands, but the London company was imposing a fine of ¬£20, which was driving them out of their markets. Henry VII required the fine to be reduced to 10 marks (¬£3, 6s and 8d).¬£1 = 3 English marks; 1 mark = 6s 8d Conflict arose with the Merchants of the Staple, who sought to diversify from exporting wool through Calais into exporting cloth to Flanders without having to become freemen of the Company of Merchant Adventurers. The Merchant Adventurers kept control of their trade and Flanders as their port. Foreign merchants of the Hanseatic League had considerable privileges in English trade and competed with the Merchant Adventurers, but these privileges were revoked by the English government in the mid-16th century. The Merchant Adventurers decided to use other ports. Emden in East Friesland and Hamburg competed to serve the Merchant Adventurers of England, who chose Emden. They soon found, however, that the port failed to attract sufficient merchants to buy the English merchants' wares, so they left abruptly and returned to Antwerp. Operations there were interrupted by Queen Elizabeth's seizing Spanish treasure ships, which were conveying money to the Duke of Alva, governor of the Netherlands. Although trade was resumed at Antwerp from 1573 to 1582, its declining fortunes ceased with the fall of the city and the subsequent development of the Amsterdam Entrep√¥t, and the Dutch Golden Age. Under the charter of 1564,Calendar of Patent Rolls, Elizabeth I, Vol. III: 1563-1566 (HMSO London 1960) pp. 178-80, item 922. the company's court consisted of a governor (elected annually by members beyond the seas), his deputies, and 24 Assistants. Admission was by patrimony (being the son of a merchant who was free of the company at the time of the son's birth), service (apprenticeship to a member), redemption (purchase) or 'free gift'. By the time of the accession of James I in 1603, there were at least 200 members. They gradually increased the fees for admission.  Conflict  The conflict of the Merchant Adventurers with the Hanseatic League continued as the latter had the same rights in England as native merchants and better privileges abroad. They could thus undersell English merchants. Hamburg was a member of the League. When the English merchants left Emden, they tried to settle in Hamburg, but the League forced the city to expel them. Emden was tried again in 1579. The Emperor ordered the Count of East Friesland to expel the merchants, but he declined. The English merchants remained there until 1587. In 1586, the Senate of Hamburg invited the Merchant Adventurers to return there, but negotiations over this broke down. The merchants who had frequented Middelburg since 1582 were invited to return in 1587 to the (now independent) United Provinces (later part of the Netherlands). Due to impositions by Holland and Zeeland, this was an unpopular choice with company members. In 1611 the company's staple was permanently fixed at Hamburg. The designated Dutch staple port was moved during the early 17th century from Middelburg to Delft in 1621, then to Rotterdam in 1635, then to Dordrecht in 1655. The years between 1615 and 1689 were marked by periods, starting with the ill-fated Cockayne Project, when the company lost and then regained its monopolistic privileges. It moved its staple port from Delft to Rotterdam in 1635. The company suffered from trouble with interlopers, traders who were not 'free of the company' (or members), but who traded within its privileged area. Hamburg Company When the Company of London lost its exclusive privileges following the Glorious Revolution of 1689, the admission fees were reduced to ¬£2. After Parliament threw the trade open, the company continued to exist as a fellowship of merchants trading to Hamburg. Because they drove a considerable trade there, members were sometimes called the Hamburg Company. The Merchant Adventurers of London still existed at the beginning of the 19th century. Exploration and development of New World In the early seventeenth century, similar groups of investors, referred to as \\"adventurers\\", were formed to develop overseas trade and colonies in the New World: the Virginia Company of Adventurers of 1609 (which later split into the London Company settling Jamestown and the Chesapeake Bay area, and the Plymouth Company, which settled New England). In addition, the Company of Adventurers in Canada sent forces during the Thirty Years War that achieved the surrender of Quebec in 1629, and colonized the island of Newfoundland.

Biography  Hunter was born in the Kenilworth area of Cape Town, South Africa where he spent his childhood. In his teen years, he and his parents returned to the family in England to live. Sometime between that arrival and the early years of World War I, Hunter began exploring acting. But in 1917, and being only 17, he joined the army to serve in France for the remainder of the First World War. On his return Hunter studied under Elsie Fogerty at the Central School of Speech and Drama, then based in the Royal Albert Hall, London.V&A;, Theatre and Performance Special Collections, Elsie Fogerty Archive, THM/324 Within two years he did indeed make his stage debut. He decided to work in British silent films taking a part in Not for Sale (1924) for British director W.P. Kellino. Hunter made his first trip to the U.S. because Basil Dean, the British actor and director, was producing Richard Brinsley Sheridan's The School for Scandal at the Knickerbocker Theater. However, the production folded after one performance. It was a more concerted effort with film the next year back in Britain, again with Kellino. He then met the film director Alfred Hitchcock in 1927 and was featured in Hitchcock's The Ring (1927) and stayed for the director's Downhill (US: When Boys Leave Home, 1927) and Easy Virtue (1928), based on the No√´l Coward play. By late 1928, he returned to Broadway for only a months run in the original comedy Olympia and stayed in America to work in Hollywood on Syncopation (1929) for RKO, his first sound film. He returned to London for Dean's thriller Escape (1930). In The Girl from 10th Avenue (1935) with Bette Davis, Hunter made his connection with Warner Bros. But before settling in with them through much of the 1930s, he did three pictures in succession with British director Michael Powell. He then appeared as the Duke in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935) for Warner's. It marked the start of a string of nearly 30 films for the studio. Among the best remembered was his jovial King Richard the Lionheart in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). Hunter was also paired in seven movies with Kay Francis between 1935 and 1938. Hunter appeared in The Little Princess (1939) as Captain Reginald Crewe. And he was the benign guardian angel-like Cambreau in Loew's Strange Cargo (1940) with Clark Gable. He was staying regularly busy in Hollywood until into 1942 when he returned to Britain to serve in the war effort. He appeared once more on Broadway in 1948 and made Edward, My Son (1949) for MGM-British with George Cukor directing and Spencer Tracy and Deborah Kerr in the lead roles. Hunter worked once more for Michael Powell (The Queen's Guards, 1961) and then retired in the middle of that decade after nearly 100 films. Among dozens of film roles, his best-remembered appearances include That Certain Woman (1937) with Bette Davis, Tower of London (1939, as King Edward IV), and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941, as Dr. Lanyon). Hunter returned to the Robin Hood legend in the TV series The Adventures of Robin Hood from 1955 in the recurring role of Sir Richard of the Lea.

The village is situated on the Kilbrannan Sound, facing Grogport on the Kintyre peninsula. Located within the parish of Kilmory, Pirnmill is flanked by several clachans, including Whitefarland to the south, Thunderguy to the north, and the original settlement of Penrioch (Scottish Gaelic: Peighinn Riabhach) above the village. Etymology Unlike many of the other villages on the island, Pirnmill's etymology is not rooted in the Gaelic or Norse heritage of Arran; rather Pirnmill takes its name from a mill that historically stood there until 1840, which produced pirns (wooden rods used in weaving) for Clarks (latterly Coats) of Paisley, which was operational from 1780 to 1840. History Early inhabitants of Pirnmill made a living through seasonal herring fishing or crofting, but later the village became a tourist destination, with many Clyde steamers plying between Glasgow and Campbeltown. The village was served by a small ferry boats that would be rowed out to the steamers, and visitors would have to decant into the small ferry to be rowed ashore. The last of these local ferry men was Archibald Currie (Sunnyside), who eventually fitted a small engine to one of his boats. The steamers were stopped during the Second World War and never really reinstated. The overwhelming majority of visitors now come to the village by road, with a few arriving by private yacht. The jetty below the shop was built in the 1930s to make it easier for visitors (and cargo) to disembark from the small ferries. Prior to this there were only duckboards. Economy Pirnmill has a church, village shop, restaurant and a B&B;, as well as a monthly 'Pop Up Pub'. north of the village, halfway between Pirnmill and Catacol, there is an ancient burial ground close to the shore at Rhubha Airigh Bheirg.

Houghton's original design was patented in 1944. Instead of the fairly hard to make Schmidt and heavy meniscus (Maksutov) corrector lenses, the corrector for the Houghton is relatively easy to make. It consists of two lenses: a positive and a negative, set at the front of the telescope which fixes the telescope's aperture. All lens and mirror surfaces are spheroidal, which eases construction. These lenses are relatively thin, though not as thin as the Schmidt corrector. With a good anti-reflective coating, light loss and \\"ghost\\" reflections are minimal. Lurie slightly modified Houghton's original design by adding a diagonal mirror to direct the focused light outside the telescope tube in the same way as a Newtonian telescope.  The corrector  Each surface of the lenses in the correctorThe total power of a \\"corrector lens\\" is 1, by definition. creates a degree of freedom to correct optical aberrations. There are enough degrees of freedom to correct for spherical aberration, coma, and field curvature. It is placed in the path of the incoming light rays, which are parallel, so the residual chromatic aberration is very nearly zero. The Houghton corrector can be made of the same type of glass (usually BK7) which reduces cost. The design tolerances are very relaxed, compared to the similar Maksutov telescopes. There are two types of correctors: symmetric and asymmetric. In the symmetric version R1 = ‚àíR3 and R2 = ‚àíR4 which allows for interferometry testing of the surfaces against each other. However, the correction is slightly worse than for the asymmetric corrector, which has four different radii. The following figure shows the equations necessary to design the symmetric-form of the corrector.Note that in these equations D is not the diameter of the primary mirror; rather, it is the distance from the mirror to the corrector as a fraction of the focal length of the mirror. Houghton doublet corrector design equations ‚Äì special case symmetric design.  The mirrors  Unlike the paraboidal mirror used in the Newtonian telescope, the Houghton uses a spheroidal primary mirror. A spheroidal mirror is much easier to make because the entire surface appears to uniformly \\"black out\\" when checked with a Foucault test. In the Houghton and the Lurie‚ÄìHoughton, the radius of curvature of the primary mirror is slightly less than that of the total system. The diameter of the primary mirror should be larger than the aperture set by the corrector, to reduce vignetting. The secondary mirror in the Lurie‚ÄìHoughton is identical to the secondary mirror in a Newtonian telescope. An advantage of the Lurie‚ÄìHoughton over the Newtonian is that the secondary mirror can be mounted to one of the corrector lenses, thus eliminating the spider mount. This eliminates star image diffraction spikes, caused by the vanes of the spider mount.

A petrosomatoglyph is a supposed image of parts of a human or animal body in rock. They occur all over the world, often functioning as an important form of symbolism, used in religious and secular ceremonies, such as the crowning of kings. Some are regarded as artefacts linked to saints or culture heroes. The word comes from the Greek œÄŒ≠œÑœÅŒ± ‚Äì petra (\\"stone\\"), œÉ·ø∂ŒºŒ± ‚Äì soma (\\"body\\"), and Œ≥ŒªœçœÜŒµŒπŒΩ ‚Äì glyphein (\\"to carve\\"). Feet are the most common; however, knees, elbows, hands, head, fingers, etc., are also found. Stylised representations of parts of the body are often open to dispute and are therefore on the fringes of acceptability as identifiable petrosomatoglyphs. Natural objects, such as rock crystals and rock formations which look like petrosomatoglyphs, whole animals, plants, etc., are collectively called \\"mimeoliths\\". Natural versus man-made petrosomatoglyphs Many examples of petrosomatoglyphs are likely to be natural in origin, such as rock-cut basins in rivers; however, they still have relevance, as they have often become associated with Saints, legendary figures, fairies, etc. Some may be man-made, but have been reinterpreted as petrosomatoglyphs by the original function being forgotten. A typical example of a possibly re-used concavity is the footprint on Dunadd which some locals at one time thought was a cast for a bronze axe head.Thomas, F.W.L. & Scot, S.A. (1878‚Äì79). Dunadd, Glassary, Argyllshire. Proc Soc Antiq. Scot. Vol. 1. - New Series. Pps. 28‚Äì47.

When the famine ceased, the cow struck its hoof against the stone leaving the imprint and then vanished. The stone itself is a flattish slab of sandstone about 60 cm x 90 cm, likely deposited during the last ice age as a Glacial erratic, and the 'hoofprint' is probably the imprint of a fossil bivalve.

Two of the markings are called the \\"Fairy Footprints\\", being 11\\" overall, close together, with narrow heels which point across the loch. The left foot has possibly artificially added toes. Close behind are two ovals and several V-hollows suggesting large hoof-prints. They were not located on a visit in 1970. On Wangan Island, one of the Penghu group between China and Taiwan, are a group of fairy footprints on the top of Tiantai hill. In the very remote Pony Hills, New Mexico, near the desert border with Mexico, are examples of shamanic rock art. The site is located around a spring-fed rock pool. The images depict a variety of spirit forms and also tiny carved footprints‚Äîthe trail of Water Baby spirits trekking from one pool to another. The devil At the ruined Kirk of Lady, near Overbister on Sanday, Orkney, are the Devil's Fingermarks, incised as parallel grooves into the parapet of the kirk. In North Kingstown is a large, granite ledge known as Devil's Foot Rock. Legends going back to the colonial era tell of a Native woman being chased by the devil. Some say that she fled from Boston. Her pursuer is said to have left his footprints at Devil's Foot Rock, then at Chimney Hill in South Kingstown, and finally at Block Island. St Pancras chapel, St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury.Wall, J. Charles (1912), Porches and Fonts. Pub. Wells Gardner, Darton * Co. London. P. 39. At Dol de Bretagne in Brittany are found the supposed claw mark of the Devil on Mont Dol as well as the footprints of St. Michael. Near Holmfirth in Yorkshire, the devil left his footprints as scorch marks on Netherton Edge. One day, the legend says that the Devil disguised himself as a druid in an attempt to gain favour with the old priests, but was discovered in his plans and so, in anger, flew out across the hills carrying a great stone with him, which he dropped from the skies and it landed where the Hood Hill Stone still remains. Also, in anger, he jumped down and stood on the great rock and in doing so, left his footprint impressed upon the stone. The site is at Kilburn, Northallerton, in Yorkshire. In Lancashire, the Devil is said to have thrown stones at Clitheroe Castle and left his footprints in Deerstones Quarry near Pendle. At Castle Bentheim in Germany, there is a curious smooth rock that in legend the Devil is said to have used as a pillow, leaving behind an imprint of his ear. In Cologne, on a heavy stone called Teufelsstein, are imprinted the hands and talons of the Devil. The Lugenstein in the cathedral square at Halberstadt was carried there by the Devil to destroy the cathedral. It was too heavy, and he dropped it, apparently leaving behind an imprint of his red hot thumb. Sir Fergus Barclay, also known as the De'il of Ardrossan, was a horseman, famous around the lands for his tremendous skill. The secret to his skill, however, was a magical bridle, which was given to Barclay by the devil, in exchange for his soul. However, the devil was tricked by Barclay into giving his soul back. Infuriated by this trickery, the devil attacked the castle in his rage and is said to have left his hoof prints on one of the rocks. The 'Packstone' is a huge whinstone block to be found at the farm of that name near Muirhead, Shotts. The story goes that the magician Michael Scot had relatives in the area and he employed the devil to build a bridge across the Firth of Forth at South Queensferry however he fell out with his builder and the devil threw down the 'pack' he was carrying and the marks of his shoulders are still to be seen on the stone.Grossart, William (1880), History of the Parish of Shotts. Glasgow. p. 15. On the eastern wall of the church of Saint Pancras in the ancient monastery of Saint Augustine outside Canterbury is to be seen the imprint of the devil's talons as he was furious that his heathen temple had become a Christian place of worship. On a coping stone of the Devil's Bridge at Kirkby Lonsdale in Cumbria are the fingermarks of the devil left behind when in his fury at being tricked out of a soul.Westwood, Jennifer (1985), Albion. A Guide to Legendary Britain. London: Grafton Books. . p. 308. The Devil's Footstep in the Munich Frauenkirche. At the entrance to the Munich Frauenkirche church in Bavaria is located the Devil's Footstep or Teufelsschritt. This mark in a tile resembles a footprint, which according to legend was where the devil stood after he had made a deal with the builder to finance construction of the church on the condition that it contain no windows. The builder managed to trick the devil by siting columns so that the windows were not visible from the spot where the devil stood at the entrance. The devil eventually worked out that he had been tricked, however he could not enter a consecrated church and could only stand in the entrance foyer, stamping his foot furiously, leaving the footprint that remains visible in the church's entrance today. Legend also says the devil then rushed outside and manifested its evil spirit in the wind that furiously rages around the church. Giants On a natural stone in Cornwall is a foot-shaped impression in a rock in the valley leading to the cliffs and coastal footpath near Chapel Porth. It is said to be the foot mark of Giant Bolster of St Agnes legend. Just below the formation, there used to be a Holy Well dedicated to St Agnes, but it dried up due to the mining in the area. Footprints at North Yell, up Hena, in Shetland were thought to be lostBreeze, David & Munro, Graeme (1997). The Stone of Destiny. Symbol of Nationhood. Historic Scotland. . Pps. 12‚Äì15. but were rediscovered in 1969 by the ordnance survey. The footprint, 12\\" by 4\\", is known locally as the \\"Wartie\\" and was used to wash in dew or rainwater, and standing in it was supposed to get rid of warts. In legend, it was made by a giant placing one foot here and the other on the Westing of Unst. In Bristol, the giants Vincent and Goram dug the Avon gorge and left their footprints. Moso's Footprint in Samoa was made when the giant Moso stepped over to Samoa from Fiji, and the other footprint can be found on Viti Levu of Fiji. It is a 1 m by 3 m rock enclosure. At the foot of the Doa mountain in Vietnam, towards the west, is a big rock. There are two human footprints on the rock. It is said that the footprints belonged to a giant who used to help the villagers with the construction of their houses. One of the footprints has been damaged. At Arthur's Stone chambered tomb in Herefordshire is a \\"cup mark\\" stone which bears the imprints of a giant's (or king's) elbow, left behind after he fell dead to the ground, killed by King Arthur.Bord, Janet and Colin (1988). Prehistoric Britain - From the air. Pub. Weidenfeld & Nicolson. Religious leaders, patriarchs and saints Adam The Sri Pada footprint in the rock atop Adam's Peak, Sri Lanka is attributed to Adam by Christians and Muslims. Abraham The Maqam Ibrahim (\\"Abraham's place of standing\\") is a rock kept in a crystal dome next to the Ka'bah in Mecca. The footprint in it is believed, by Muslim tradition, to have been made by Abraham when he was lifting stone blocks to build the Ka'bah. Archangel Gabriel In Islamic tradition, the Foundation Stone is where Muhammad ascended to heaven, and during this ascension, the rock itself started to rise at the southern end but was held down by the Archangel Gabriel, and some marks on the western side of the rock are said to be the fingerprints of Gabriel. The Buddha The footprints of the Buddha abound throughout Asia, dating from various periods. Japanese author , who spent years tracking down the footprints in many Asian countries, estimates that he found more than 3,000 such footprints, among them about 300 in Japan and more than 1,000 in Sri Lanka. They often bear distinguishing marks, such as a Dharmachakra at the centre of the sole, or the 32, 108 or 132 auspicious signs of the Buddha, engraved or painted on the sole. Buddhist legend holds that during his lifetime the Buddha flew to Sri Lanka and left his footprint on Adam's Peak to indicate the importance of Sri Lanka as the perpetuator of his teachings, and also left footprints in all lands where his teachings would be acknowledged. In Thailand, the most important of these \\"natural\\" footprints imbedded in rock is at Phra Phutthabat in Central Thailand. In China, during Tang Dynasty, the discovery of a large footprint of the Buddha in Chengzhou caused Empress Wu Zetian to inaugurate a new reign name in that year, 701 CE, starting the Dazu (Big Foot) era. There are two forms: natural, as found in stone or rock, and those made artificially. Many of the \\"natural\\" ones, of course, are acknowledged not to be actual footprints of the Buddha, but replicas or representations of them, which can be considered cetiya (Buddhist relics) and also an early aniconic and symbolic representation of the Buddha. Jesus According to legend, these impressions are a copy of the footprints of Jesus at the Church of Domine Quo Vadis, Rome. At the Chapel of the Ascension in Jerusalem, there are a pair of footprints reputed to be those of Jesus made at the time of his Ascension into heaven. These are sometimes shown in medieval depictions of the Ascension in art. The church of Saint Sebastian Outside the Walls in Rome houses a stone which, according to tradition, bears the footprints of Jesus when he appeared to Saint Peter on the Appian Way. A copy of these footprints is preserved, as an ex voto offering, at the Church of Domine Quo Vadis, the chapel marking the traditional spot of Jesus' appearance to Peter. Henry III of England was given a piece of white marble which allegedly carried a trace of one of Jesus' feet, which he had left as a souvenir to his apostles after his Ascension. Henry gave this relic to Westminster Abbey.Jusserand, Jean Jules (1888) English Wayfaring Life in the Middle Ages; trans. L. T. Smith. London: T. Fisher Unwin; p. 327‚Äì328 This may simply have been a votive copy of the footprint in the Chapel of the Ascension. Mary, the mother of Jesus In Wales, the knees and breasts of Mary are said to be imprinted on a rock beside her well at Ffynnon Fair, Llanfair, between Barmouth and Harlech in Gwynedd. Marks said to be her footprint and thumb-print are to be found nearby. Two other Mary footprints are recorded in the vicinity at Llan Maria (St. Mary) near Llanbedr, and Wenallt Hill at Llanaber. At Pochayiv Lavra in western Ukraine, there is a footprint which by tradition was left in the stone by the Theotokos (Virgin Mary) after her miraculous appearance to two monks in the 15th century. A spring of water which is believed to have miraculous powers flows from the footprint to this day. At Stow of Wedale in the Scottish Borders a stone near the Lady's Well and old church of St Mary is said to bear the footprint of the Virgin Mary.The Gazetteer for Scotland Muhammad At the Qubbat al-Sanaya (the Dome of the Front Teeth) the mark made by the Muhammad's tooth is to be found on a stone in a wall. Muhammad was attacked and lost a tooth during the incident. A mark on a stone wall is said to have been made when the tooth fell. Muhammad's footprints are (by Islamic tradition) found in numerous places, such as the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, in Damascus, and in mosques in West Bengal, Bangladesh and Gudjarat.Bord, Janet (2004). Footprints in Stone. The significance of foot- and hand-prints and other imprints left by early men, giants, heroes, devils, saints, animals, ghosts, witches, fairies and monsters. Heart of Albion Press. . It is said that the hoof print of Muhammad's steed al-BurƒÅq, upon which he was propelled to heaven, can be seen imprinted in the Foundation Stone. Rama The footprint in the rock at Hampi is attributed to that of Rama. Shiva The Sri Pada footprint in the rock atop Adam's Peak, Sri Lanka is attributed to that of Shiva by Hindus (and the Buddha by Buddhists). Human petrosomatoglyphs Footprints Saint Columba at Belmont, Londonderry Road, Ireland The Romans were accustomed to carve pairs of footprints on a stone with the inscription pro itu et reditu, \\"for the journey and return\\".Pennick, Nigel (1996). Celtic Sacred Landscapes. Thames & Hudson. . P. 40. They used them for protective rites on leaving for a journey and for thanksgiving for a safe return, when the traveler would place his feet in the footprints to mark the beginning or end of the undertaking. This same story is told of King Maelgwn of Gwynedd in North Wales, who placed his feet in carved footprints to ensure his safe return from a pilgrimage to Rome. In northern Europe, rock footprints were closely associated with Kingship or Chieftainship. Saxo Grammaticus notes that \\"The ancients, when they came to choose a King, stood on stones planted in the ground to proclaim their votes, signifying from the steadfastness of the stones that the deed would be lasting.\\" Standing on a special stone is a link between the king and the land from which his people earned their food. Links with King Arthur and \\"The Sword in the Stone\\" may be relevant in this context of kingship, a right to power over his subjects and links with nature. A similar idea seems to be associated with the Moot hill, or Boot Hill, at Scone, for the latter name comes from an ancient tradition whereby emissaries swore fealty to their king by wearing the earth of their own lands in their foot-bindings or boots. The upper echelons of the clergy of the Celtic Church were drawn from the nobility; indeed, even some kings retired to become monks and eventually even saints, as in the case of King Constantine of Cornwall, who retired to Govan on the Clyde in Scotland. This meant that the association of stone footprints was also made with the saints, bishops and others. The poet Spenser states that the custom amongst the Irish was to place the man who is to be chief upon a stone, always reserved for that purpose alone and located on a hill. Some of these had a footprint cut into them which was the size and shape of the candidate's. The oath was taken with the foot in the footprint, the individual swearing that as chief he would preserve all the ancient customs and respect the laws of royal inheritance. A Locus terribilis is a sacred place into which only a divine or sacred person could enter. Petrosomatoglyph footprints for the ordination of kings would be an example, for it was believed that only the rightful king was able to use them for the purpose that they were intended.Pennick, Nigel (1996). Celtic Sacred Landscapes. Thames & Hudson. . P. 134. Footprints may also have to do with the cult of the ancestors, whose spirits dwell in the stone, so that a newly invested King would have received the luck or mana of his predecessors through contact with it.Westwood, Jennifer (1985), Albion. A Guide to Legendary Britain. London: Grafton Books. . p. 418. Footprints have been found in Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Sri Lanka (Adam's Foot), and Uganda. Footprints in Scotland The Clickhimin Broch footprints in Shetland In Ayr, on the southern bank of the River Ayr is 'Wallace's Heel', a natural sandstone slab from which flows a small spring. Sir William Wallace is said to have left the imprint behind whilst rushing to escape English soldiers who were pursuing him. He later returned to the spring, and dug out a bigger hole to get fresh water for him and his soldiers.Love, Dane (2009). Legendary Ayrshire. Custom : Folklore : Tradition. Auchinleck : Carn Publishing. ; pp. 26‚Äì27 Among cup and ring marks on a boulder at Carnasserie, two miles (3 km) from Kilmartin in Argyll, are carved a pair of feet. At St. Mary's Church in Burwick, South Ronaldsay, Orkney, is the Ladykirk Stone on which St. Magnus is said to have sailed over the Pentland Firth. It has two clear footprints cut into it. A pair of footprints is carved in a stone slab in a causeway at the Broch of Clickhimin (or Clickemin), Lerwick, in Shetland. This site was occupied from about 1000 BC to AD 500. Two footprints are to be found at Dunadd (Dun Monaidh), ancient capital of the Gaelic kingdom of D√°l Riata. The completed one faces north and is accompanied by an image of a boar, rock- basins possibly cut for ceremonial ablutions and an ogham inscription.An Inventory of the monuments extracted from Argyll, V.6. Kilmartin Prehistoric & Early Historic Monuments. RCAHMS. ; pp. 89‚Äì90 This footprint is said to be that of Oisin or Fergus Mor Mac Erca, the first King of Dalriada, who died in AD 501. St. Columba is said to have installed Aidan as King on this rock. The best preserved footprintSharp, Mick (1997). Holy Places of Celtic Britain. Blandford. . P. 89. is 27 cm long, nearly 11 cm wide, 9 cm across at the heel and 2.5 cm deep; so large that it would fit a foot clothed in a shoe or boot. A second, incomplete footprint is a lightly pecked outline of a shod right foot, 24 cm long and 10 cm in maximum width. It has a pronounced taper to the heel; further internal peck-marks suggest that it was to have been hollowed out. It is on the same alignment as the other footprint.RCAHMS ‚Äì various reports from the Historic Scotland Canmore website. A crag near the chapel of Keil and St. Columba's Well, between Dunaverty Bay and Carskey in Kintyre, has two footprints carved at a place where St. Columba is reputed to have first set foot in Dalriada, Scotland. One is recent, and the other genuinely old. Kingship rituals may have been connected with this petrosomatoglyph. St. Columba's footprints are to be found at Southend in Argyll. Two examples exist in Angus. The caves below Keil Point on the Isle of Arran contain a slab which may have been an ancient altar. It has the prints of two right feet on it, said to be of Saint Columba.Beare, Beryl (1996), Scotland. Myths & Legends. Avonmouth: Parragon. ; p. 26 The Giant Fingal of Arran is said to have had a son born in the King's Cave who left a footprint on the cave side.Hall, T. S. (1960). Tramping in Arran. Edinburgh : Gall & Inglis. pp. 22‚Äì23 On Islay, there was a Stone of Inauguration by Finlaggan. It was seven feet square and had footprints cut into it. When a chief of the Clan Donald was installed as the King of the Isles, he stood barefoot on the imprints on the stone, and with his father's stone in his hand, was anointed King by the Bishop of Argyll and seven priests. During the ceremony, an orator recited a list of his ancestors and, he was proclaimed \\"Macdonald, high prince of the seed of Conn\\". The block was deliberately destroyed in the early seventeenth century.Bord, Janet & Colin (1976). The Secret Country. London: Paul Elek. ; pp. 66‚Äì67 At Spittal, near Drymen, is a footprint which may be due to natural weathering. It is located at the western end of a long ridge of natural rock outcrop. A quarry for two millstones is nearby. At Craigmaddie Muir, Baldernock, East Dunbartonshire is the Auld Wives Lifts. This is a complicated assemblage of carvings on a rock platform. On the rock are serpent-like forms, crosses, cups and an impression of the right foot of an adult. At Dunino Den (56.28¬∞ N 02.76¬∞ W NO5311), near St Andrews in Fife, is a footprint and a basin carved in the surface of a sandstone outcrop. A Celtic cross has been carved nearby, possibly as an attempt to Christianise the site. Footprints in Ireland The footprints and associated markings from Arzon Cromlech in Morbihan, Brittany Close to St. Olann's Well at Coolineagh, near Coachford, County Cork, are the footprints of St. Olann on a boulder. In the garden of Belmont, on the Greencastle Road, about a mile from Derry, there was, in 1837, a block called St. Columba's Stone with two footprints on it. It may have been the inauguration stone of the Kings of Aileach, brought here by the local Chief of Derry. On the Clare Hills in Ireland, on the Gort to Feakle road in the townland of Drumandoora, is the engraved outline or impression of a foot clothed by a sandal. On the Hill of Lech, or, previously, Mullach Leaght, the \\"Hill of the Stone\\", three miles (5 km) southwest of Monaghan in Ireland, was the inauguration stone of the Mac Mahons. It was used in 1595 and destroyed by a farm owner in 1809. At Clonmacnoise, County Offaly, Ireland, close to the Chapel of Clonfinlough. there are several limestone boulders, one of which is called the Fairy's or Horseman's Stone. It has many cup-shaped hollows, crosses, daggers, and a pair of human feet. At Templemore in County Londonderry is a slab named St. Columbkille's Stone. It has the imprint of two feet, each ten inches (254 mm) in length. Traditionally, it was the inauguration stone of the ancient Irish chieftains. Saint Columba's Stone near Derry has two depressions like the marks of feet. The O'Doherty's are said to have stood on this stone with bare feet at their inaugurations. At Slievenamon (The Mountain of the Women), at South Tipperary in Ireland, is the rock that bears the footprints of Goll‚Äî\\"the One-Eyed\\"‚Äîwho made a giant leap across the valley to catch up with the hunt of the Fianna. The West Pier in Howth Harbour, Dublin, displays a specimen of footprints from King George IV's visit in 1821. Footprints in England and Wales An unclothed footprint on a boulder at Trewithen in Chapeltoun, Ayrshire *\\"King Arthur's Footprint\\" is a hollow in the rock at the highest point of Tintagel Island's southern side. It is not entirely natural, having been shaped by human hands at some stage. It may have been used for the inauguration of kings or chieftains as the site is known to have a long history stretching back to the Dark Ages. *At Poole Farm in Somerset, a cist cover was found with footprints and cupmarks. The decorated cist slab is displayed in Bristol Museum. Originally it was in position on the south side of the Pool Farm Cist, which was contained within a round barrow.Poole Farm carvings Retrieved : 2011-06-29 Excavation revealed the cremated remains of a child and an adult. However, these carvings do have similarities with the Calderstones in Liverpool and others in Scandinavia. The footprinted Calderstones in Liverpool may have come from a Lancashire passage- grave.Pennick, Nigel (1996). Celtic Sacred Landscapes. Thames & Hudson. Sharkey sees a link of artistic influence between these and those at Petit- Mont in Brittany. *On a rock formerly visible at the eastern end of Holyhead church in Anglesey, Wales, was the footprint of St. Cybi.

A set of Jesus's footprints, according to legend, are preserved at the Church of Domine Quo Vadis outside of Rome. In Buddhist symbolism, a Buddhapada (footprint of the Buddha) with Dharmacakra and Triratna symbols from the 1st century is to be found at GandhƒÅra, Northern Pakistan. Sweden's rich flora of petroglyphs include many hundred footprints, singles and in pairs. On Sri Pada, or Adam's Peak, a mountain in Sri Lanka, is a footprint mark said by Buddhists to be that of the left foot of the Buddha, the right footprint being in a city about 150 kilometres distant, or at Phra Sat in Thailand. Tamil Hindus consider it to be the footprint of Shiva. Some Muslims and Christians ascribe it to Adam, where Adam the \\"first ancestor\\" is said to have set foot as he was exiled from the Garden of Eden. Sometimes Christians ascribe it to Saint Thomas, the \\"Apostle of India\\". Footprints of the Buddha also exist in Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Laos, Malaysia, the Maldives, Pakistan, Singapore, and Burma. The St. Victor's Petroglyphs in Provincial Park, Saskatchewan, Canada, feature human footprints. A human-like footprint in volcanic ash was discovered in 1970 during the construction of the Demirk√∂pr√º Dam in Turkey. The ash was dated as having been deposited about 250,000 years ago. Knee prints Rock-cut basins in Lynn Glen, North Ayrshire, showing the typical knee print appearance. A Bullaun in Chapeltoun, Ayrshire, Scotland. A tradition of body- part impressions at holy wells, rivers and beneath waterfalls comes from the fact that Celtic monks or culdees often prayed in such places, continuing the veneration of the Druids for sacred water. Folk belief ascribes healing powers to waters taken from these holy impressions, and this water was used to cure sickness, wounds and sores, as well as preventing or curing sickness in animals such as cattle. At Llangynnlo in Wales are Olgliniau Cynllo, the knee prints of King Cynllo at prayer. At Troedraur in Dyfed, South Wales are the knee-marks of St. Gwyndaf Hen impressed on a flat rock in the bed of the River Ceri. These are 'pot holes' or Rock-cut basins made by the grinding effect of stone in the river currents to the sceptics. St Cynwyl in the river at Caio in Wales. St. Beuno at Llanaelhaiarn in Wales. At Arthur's Stone chambered tomb in Hereford & Worcester is a cup-mark stone which bears the imprints of King Arthur's knees left behind after he prayed to God in thanks for victory over a giant (or king) whom he had killed and whose tomb this is. At Llanllyfni in Wales are the knee prints of St. Gredfyw. John O'Donovan, in his Ordnance Survey Letters of 1840, tells the story of Saint Moling crossing a small hill in the County Wexford district, when an evil spirit annoyed him. He knelt on a rock to curse the spirit, leaving the impression of his knees on the stone. While there is no account of the stone today, it is said that the incident gave the name to the townland Cloch na Mallacht, i.e. \\"the stones of the curses\\", linking the episode to Bullaun stones which often contain cursing stones. Near St Fillan's Kirk in Renfrewshire there is recorded a large flat rock called the 'Kneelins Stane' that had three depressions, two made by the knees of pilgrims and the third made by their staffs.

The Petroglyph National Monument has an estimated 20,000 carved images, including many of hands. These images are inseparable from the cultural landscape, the spirits of the people who created and who appreciate them. At Barnakill near Dunardy in Argyll is a stone bearing two hand prints. The hands appear to have a covering; one may be the back of the hand having interesting designs, the other being the palm with some faint markings.Proc. Sco. Antiq. Scot.

In Argyll and Bute, Kilneuair's kirk has inside, to the east of the nave door, a sandstone block bearing a now almost invisible five-toed print with nails on three of the toes and which is referred to as 'the Devil's hand'. The story goes that a local tailor did not believe in the Devil and Old Nick appeared as a skeleton just missing the man and scratching the wall with his bone hand.Pallister, Marian (2007). Argyll Curiosities. Edinburgh : Birlinn. . Page 7 Eyes At St. Mary's Church in Newchurch-in-Pendle, an eye is carved on the tower, said to be the all-seeing eye of God. Local tradition says that it was originally placed there to protect the worshippers from the witches who once plagued the district. In Almer√≠a, Spain, is a carved limestone pillar with eyes or the oculos / oculi motif. The eyes have eyebrows and/or accentuating arcs. An \\"eye goddess\\" may have existed as shown by many other examples of carved oculi. The Folkton \\"drums\\" are made of chalk and are elaborately carved, with distinct oculi or eyes. Petrospheres or carved stone balls from Scotland, especially the Aberdeen area, often have concentric carved lines, some of which appear to be stylised oculi. Pecked carvings of \\"eyebrows\\" are found on a lintel inside Holm of Papa Westray south chambered cairn, Orkney. They are similar to the 'owlish' eyes and eyebrows carved on the Folkton Drums.Sharp, Mick (1994). A land of Gods and Giants. Frazer Stewart Books. . P. 133.

The Celts are well known for their cult of the \\"severed head\\" of which many examples exist as three-dimensional carvings or sculptures. Petrosomatoglyphs are much rarer. Pump Sant Stone near Carmarthen in Wales has the imprint in it of the heads of the five saints, named Ceitho, Celynnin, Gwyn, Gwyno and Gwynoro. The stone is made of Diorite, a very hard stone brought from another district. It stands on a mound facing the Ogofau Lodge of Dolaucothi House, near to the Roman Gold Mines.

The Serpent Stone from a Roman cemetery in Maryport in Cumbria has a Celtic severed head wearing a torc carved on the top of a phallic-shaped pillar. On the back is a carving of a serpent. At Tarren Deusant, Llantrisant in Mid-Glamorgan is a pagan site with two heads originally carved, showing incised eyebrows and slit mouths characteristic of some Celtic cult heads. Six other heads have been carved since 1696, when they were first recorded. The Husjatyn god-pillar from the River Zbrucz in Galicia, Poland, has several heads carved on its four sides, together with images of horses, people and weapons.Pennick, Nigel (1997). The Celtic Cross. An Illustrated History and Celebration. Blandford. . Pps. 32‚Äì33 A pointed stone from Rottenburg am Neckar, at Stammheim in Stuttgart, has a rudimentary human face carved on it.

The female form and reproductive structures M√™n-an-Tol, Cornwall, UK It has been stated that many of the signs or symbols which accompany maze or geometric patterns from sites such as Newgrange in Ireland are identifiable or interpretable as human, the womb (lens symbol), the pubic area (lozenge symbol), fallopian horns (ram's horns), the female form (hour-glass symbol), breasts (w or omega symbol), etc. The vesica piscis shape as found on the lid of the Chalice Well at Glastonbury includes an almond- or lozenge-shaped central area that is seen as a possible representation of the female genitals. MeehanMeehan, Aidan (1996). Celtic design. Maze Patterns. Thames & Hudson. Pps. 54‚Äì55. does not, however, clearly indicate his sources for these interpretations. In the gallery-grave of Kerguntuil at Tregastel in Brittany are nine pairs of breasts above engraved necklaces.Giot, Pierre R. (1990). Menhirs and Dolmens. . Page 26 Barclodiad y Gawres is a passage-grave on Anglesey with its internal surfaces decorated with lozenges, chevrons, wavy lines and spirals. The whole tomb has been likened to a womb, that of the Mother Goddess. These symbols are also commonly used in passage graves found in Ireland and Brittany. Triangular stones are sometimes regarded as being representations of the female sexual organs or overall body shape. At Boscawen un stone circle in Cornwall, a leaning central standing stone and a large white quartz boulder may represent the male and female elements of nature. At Carn Euny Iron Age village in Cornwall is a fogou which may represent the womb of the Great Earth Mother. At Avebury and West Kennet Avenue in Wiltshire, the tall pillar and \\"broad diamond shape\\" stones were used alternately in the stone circles, possibly symbolising males and females at this famous pagan ritual site. Stoney Littleton Long Barrow near Bath has been likened to a \\"womb-tomb\\" of the Great Goddess who awaited the return of the sun. Tolmen stones, such as the example on the North Teign river on Dartmoor, England, are said to derive their name from the Cornish tol (\\"hole\\") and maen (\\"stone\\") and were thought to have been used by Druids for purification and that the wrongdoer was lowered through into the water for lustration, a purification rite or cleansing ritual. The hole in the stone represented the female birth canal in the Druid or pagan mind, and by passing through it, a person was symbolising the act of rebirth and therefore regaining innocence or being cleansed of post-parturition illness, etc.Tuck, C. (2003).Landscapes and Desire. Pub. Sutton. Stroud. Male reproductive structures Thousand 300px Phallic Petrosomatoglyph, Cilurnum Roman Fort, Chesters (Humshaugh), Scotland Shivalinga is carved in numerous Hindu temples across Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia, including in Angkor Wat, rock-cut temples in India such as Aihole, Ajanta Caves, Amarnath Temple, Badami cave temples, Ellora Caves, Gavi Gangadhareshwara Temple, Hampi, Hulimavu Shiva cave temple, Mahabalipuram, Masroor Rock Cut Temple, Udaygiri Caves, Vaishno Devi, etc. Many references have been made to the obviously phallic appearance of standing stones. It is suggested that they may serve as stylised representations of the phallus, the purpose of which is to magically enhance the fertility of humans, animals and crops. A number of practices which are supposed to give fertility to barren women are linked to standing stones throughout Europe. At Avebury and West Kennet Avenue in Wiltshire, the tall pillar and broad diamond shape stones were used alternately in the stone circles, possibly symbolising males and females at these famous pagan ritual sites. At Boscawen un stone circle in Cornwall, a leaning central standing stone and a large white quartz boulder may represent the male and female elements of nature. The Maypole is often considered a phallic symbol, coinciding with the worship of Germanic phallic figures such as that of Freyr. Phallic fertility symbols were carved for good luck, and they were also a powerful antagonist to the evil eye. The Romans regularly carved them onto military buildings, and Hadrian's Wall has several at Chesters and Housesteads forts. One at Barcombe Hill shows a crude phallus and testicles with the legs of a chicken.Graham, Frank (1990), Hadrian's Wall in the Days of the Romans. Pub. Frank Graham. . P.230. In Portugal, phalli are represented together with cup-marks, zig-zags, straggly-lines, etc., on the ninety or so stones of the 4000-year-old Cromeleque dos Almendres near √âvora.Cope, Julian (2004) The Megalithic European. Pub. Element. London. . P. 412‚Äì413. At Valhaugen in Norway a realistic representation of a phallus has been found and restored. Multiple body parts At Portpatrick on the Island of St. Kilda, there is the impression of a pair of knees and a right hand, said to be those of St. Patrick in the posture of prayer. In Cornwall, St. Newlyna knelt on a stone and left the impression of her elbows and knees in the posture of prayer. At Llanllyfni are found stones with the knee-prints, thumb and bed of St. Gredfyw. Medicine Rock in the USA was located on a hill fifteen miles (24 km) west of Gettysburg, near the mouth of the Cheyenne Creek. Indians considered it to be a sacred rock and visited it regularly. Five footprints, hand prints and animal prints were originally visible, made by the Great Spirit of the Native Americans. Recent and modern petrosomatoglyphs George Marsh. Located at Smithills Hall, near Bolton in Lancashire, is the impressed footprint at the bottom of a set of stairs of George Marsh, a Protestant martyr. In 1555, Marsh was interrogated at Smithills Hall and then taken to Boughton in Cheshire and burnt at the stake for the sake of his faith. It is said that the footprint is a divine reminder of this unjust persecution and murder. Handprints made in wet concrete Often, impressions of hands are made in concrete to commemorate the famous as at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood (USA) on pavement slabs or in wet concrete. Making footprints in stone of family members is part of New Age beliefs. In Sarajevo, there is a preserved square of footpath or pavement asphalt with two shoe prints which are believed to be those of Gavrilo Princip, made as he waited for the arrival of the motorcade of the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand in June 1914. The Archduke's assassination precipitated the start of the Great War.

This endangered species is the smallest species in its family. Description The dwarf sawfish has a torpedo-shaped body that resembles that of a shark, and grows to a length of about . It has broad, triangular pectoral fins and large, upright dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is located directly above, or slightly behind, the origins of the pelvic fins, and the caudal fin has a very small lower lobe. The snout is broad and flat and is elongated into a rostrum with around twenty pairs of rostral teeth. This fish is usually greenish-brown, or occasionally yellowish-brown, on its dorsal surface, and whitish underneath. Distribution and habitat The dwarf sawfish is native to the western and central Indo- Pacific region and historically had a much wider range than it does now. Its present confirmed range is from the Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, to the northern Pilbara region of Western Australia. A recorded sighting from the Canary Islands was probably of a different species. It typically inhabits inshore waters, estuaries, tidal mudflats and sometimes the lowest reaches of rivers. Ecology This sawfish feeds mainly on fish, but also eats molluscs and crustaceans. The rostrum has large numbers of pores adapted for electroreception and is probably also used to manipulate prey. Its sensory input helps the fish move about in the muddy waters in which it often lives. Although they are sometimes found in deep water, most movements take place while the tide is either rising or falling, and movements during each tidal cycle may be up to . At high tide the fish tend to forage and rest among the mangroves. Little is known of the breeding habits of the dwarf sawfish. The fish are ovoviviparous with the developing embryos feeding on the yolks of their eggs. It is not known how many young can be carried at one time nor how frequently the fish can breed, but the young are about long when they are born. Maximum longevity in this species is estimated to be forty-eight years. Status The dwarf sawfish is protected in Australian waters, but elsewhere in the world, sawfishes are harvested for their meat, fins, rostrums and oil. The main threat facing the dwarf sawfish is being caught as bycatch in gillnets and trawl nets. That this is the cause of declining numbers is demonstrated by the fact that populations are declining fastest in heavily fished areas. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of this fish as \\"endangered\\". There is a need for education of fishermen about safe release practices and how to manage their fisheries. However, the threats are continuing, and there is no reason to believe that the population of dwarf sawfish is recovering from previous declines. See also *List of threatened rays References 5\\\\.

The buildings are the only purpose-built provincial government buildings in New Zealand still in existence. The buildings were substantially damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, and partially demolished by the Christchurch City Council. Location View along Armagh Street The buildings are located in Christchurch Central City. They occupy the block surrounded by Armagh Street, Durham Street, Gloucester Street and the Avon River. Historical context 2008 Cycle Friendly Awards ceremony held in the Stone Chamber The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, established a bicameral New Zealand Parliament, with the lower house (the House of Representatives) being elected by popular vote, and the upper house (the Legislative Council) being appointed. Votes were to be cast under a simple FPP system by telling ones choice of candidate to the election officer, as the secret ballot had not yet been introduced. The legislation also introduced provincial government, with an initial six provinces (and ultimately ten). At the time of the 1853 election, there were no political parties in New Zealand. As such, all candidates were independents. Provincial governments and the House of Representatives were elected around the same time in 1853. Provincial governments were led by a Superintendent, who were elected separately. Building history The Stone Chamber collapsed in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake The foundation stone for the first building was laid in January 1858. The first set of buildings were a two-storey timber building, forming an L shape along the Durham Street frontage, with the Timber Chamber, modelled on 14th and 16th century English manorial halls, the meeting room for the Provincial Council. The Timber Chamber was behind the street frontage and was first used in September 1859. An extension to the north had already been commissioned at that time, which was opened in 1861. This extension was along Durham and Armagh Streets and, together with the existing buildings, formed a courtyard. The third and last set of buildings was constructed in 1864‚Äì1865. The Stone Chamber was the new meeting room for the council; it was larger than the Timber Chamber to cope with an increased size of the council. Its interior is described as provincial architect Benjamin Mountfort's most impressive achievement. Bellamy's, the refreshment rooms, were added to the back of the Timber Chamber.Map with building footprints and construction dates in the building's interpretation centre The buildings are the only purpose-built provincial government buildings in New Zealand still in existence these days. The other remaining building is that of the Southland Province in Invercargill, which was built in 1864 as a Masonic lodge and was purchased by the Southland Provincial Council as their council chambers in 1866. Earthquake damage The buildings were substantially damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. According to a Christchurch City Council spokeswoman, the Stone Chamber had been \\"flattened\\". The stone tower on Armagh Street, which acted as the buildings' entrance on their north side and which held the clock of the Victoria Clock Tower in the early years, collapsed. Dr Ian Lochhead, Associate Professor of Art History at the University of Canterbury, said that the Stone Chamber is for many the single biggest heritage loss of the February earthquake. Lochhead has been an advisor for the restoration of the buildings since 1981 and calls for the reconstruction of the Stone Chamber. Detailed engineering assessments show that the buildings have received so much damage that significant portions will have to be rebuilt. A report will be given to Christchurch City Councillors in June 2013 outlining the options. The Armagh Street stone tower collapsed in the earthquake.

Most of the inhabitants of this village emigrated to Canada where they built a replica of the church that was constructed in Sannox in 1822. The replica church in Inverness, Quebec, is no longer there (since the 1950s) and only the cemetery remains. Mining was a source of employment in the area, when in 1840 a mine was opened in the area. However operations only lasted around two decades. Operations ended when in 1862 the 11th Duke of Hamilton closed the mine, claiming that it spoiled the local area. However, the mine was reopened after the close of the First World War, and a railway and pier were built to transport the barytes that was mined there. The source of barytes ran out in 1938 and the mine closed. The railway and pier were removed in the 1940s.

Designed in 1923 by architect E.M. Frasier in Spanish Colonial Revival style, the building was built as the Security Apartments, but never opened. It was finally completed in 1929 and rechristened the Hollywood Knickerbocker Hotel in June 1929.Festivities to Mark Opening of Apartments. Los Angeles Times, June 16, 1929. The hotel catered to the region's nascent film industry, and is the site for some of Hollywood‚Äôs most famous dramatic moments. On Halloween 1936, Harry Houdini's widow held her tenth s√©ance to contact the magician on the roof of the hotel. On January 13, 1943, Frances Farmer was arrested in her room at the hotel after failing to visit her probation officer when scheduled.Frances Farmer Resists Arrest.

Griffith died of a cerebral hemorrhage on the way to a Hollywood hospital, after being discovered unconscious in the lobby of the hotel.Pioneer Film Man D.W. Griffith Dies. Los Angeles Times, July 24, 1948. In 1968, Graham Nash was staying there the day Cass Elliot picked him up to go meet Stephen Stills and David Crosby.Source: Graham Nash interview with Anthony deCurtis on YouTube Filming  The building's central-Hollywood location resulted in it appearing in numerous productions, either directly or indirectly. For example, in the 1950 film 711 Ocean Drive with Edmond O'Brien, it was the backdrop of a syndicate meeting. The hotel and its surrounding street also served as the backdrop for the opening scene of a first-season episode of the 1966 series Mission Impossible, titled \\"Operation Rogosh\\" (Season 1, Episode 3). Between 1964 and 1970, viewers of the ABC variety series The Hollywood Palace would regularly see the hotel building and its neon sign in the background of performances videotaped in the Hollywood Palace's parking lot, directly behind the hotel. The sign over the front entrance identifying it as a hotel was still in place when the TV series Mannix filmed a scene there for the 1970 episode, \\"Only One Death to a Customer\\" (Season 3, Episode 20). Celebrity guests  The hotel retained its glamor through the 1950s. Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio often met in the hotel bar. Elvis Presley stayed at the hotel (Room 1016) while making his first film, Love Me Tender (1956). For many years, it was the residence of actor William Frawley. Laurel and Hardy stayed in room 205. Graham Nash lived there in 1968. Director D. W. Griffith, died in the lobby there in July 1948. Media  Postcard circa 1940s On December 1, 1954, a camera crew from the NBC program This is Your Life surprised retired comedy legends Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy in room 205 of the hotel. The duo was relaxing there with a couple of friends who were in on the gag. While both comedians were polite throughout the show, Stan Laurel was apparently privately somewhat displeased to be put on television without his consent or prior notice.This is Your Life - December 1, 1954 Laurel & Hardy episode Events In 1962, celebrated Hollywood costume designer Irene Lentz, believed to be despondent over Gary Cooper's death, committed suicide by jumping from her 11th-floor room window. On March 3, 1966, veteran character actor William Frawley was strolling down Hollywood Boulevard after seeing a film when he suffered a major heart attack. His nurse dragged him to the hotel where he died in the lobby. Contrary to popular belief, Frawley did not live in the hotel at the time. Although Frawley had spent nearly 30 years living in a suite upstairs, he had moved to the nearby El Royale Apartments several months before. Also contrary to popular belief, Rudolf Valentino was not a regular at the bar, as the hotel opened after his death in 1926. Retirement Apartments  By the late 1960s, the neighborhood had deteriorated, and the hotel became a residence primarily for drug addicts and prostitutes. In 1970, a renovation project converted the hotel into housing for senior citizens. In 1999, a plaque honoring Griffith was placed in the lobby.

The settlement is within the parish of Kilbride. In the vicinity of the island's main village, Brodick, Cladach is the site of the Cladach Sawmill and in more recent times, the Arran Brewery. The company, Arran Aromatics is located nearby, as is Brodick Castle. History Cladach was in the past a much larger settlement, and was in fact the site of the original village on Brodick Bay, with modern Brodick being built on the south side of the Bay later. There were in the past a series of houses on the Coast Road in Cladach, but they were demolished many years ago. There were also a series of houses that were let to employees of the sawmill by the sawmill owners. However, in recent years Cladach has essentially been depopulated and the buildings that used to house residents either demolished or converted into small businesses. Geography Cladach sits on the eastern coast of the Isle of Arran, off the Coast Road across the Brodick Bay from Brodick. Economy The Cladach Visitors' Centre is now the main attraction on the site of Cladach. Cladach is the usual starting point for climbers who seek to ascend Goat Fell mountain. An entrance into Brodick Castle Gardens is also located in Cladach. There is a hydroelectric scheme based at Cladach. Water is taken from a reservoir at around 800 ft on the slopes of Goat Fell and electricity is generated at the turbines behind the Sawmill. The original electricity generation was for the Castle which was one of the first places in Scotland to receive electricity along with the Castle on R√πm. A courthouse, which was demolished in 2004, used to post important messages about hearings and agriculture on an Ash tree outside its doors. Locals still put posters up advertising events, which echo this long held tradition. The restaurant is called the Wineport, named after the former port 500 yards north, a small harbour which was where supplies for the village and castle were landed.

Mazhar's breakthrough in the world of acting came after he succeeded in playing the role of an evil prince in Roda Qalbi (Return My Heart), his third movie. Other roles soon followed, including Al-Tarik Al- Masdood (1958), Al-Ataba Al-Khadraa (1959), Doaa al-Karawan (1959), Wa Islamah (1961), Al-Dowa Al-Khafet (1961) and Ghadan Youm Akhar (1961). He starred in an American movie, Cairo (1963), starring George Sanders and Faten Hamama. More than four years later, Mazhar appeared in Shafika and Metwali alongside Soad Hosny. Other films like Al-Nemr Al-Aswad, Demoue Sahebat El-Galalah, Al- Gasousa Hekmat Fahmy and The Guns and the Fury soon followed. Death Ahmed Mazhar died at home at age 85 in Giza in 2002.

They date to the time of the Saadian dynasty and in particular to the reign of Ahmad al-Mansur (1578‚Äì1603), though members of Morocco's monarchy continued to be buried here for a time afterwards. The complex is regarded by many art historians as the high point of Moroccan architecture in the Saadian period due to its luxurious decoration and careful interior design. Today the site is a major tourist attraction in Marrakesh.  History  View of the older eastern mausoleum (right), built up against the outer walls of the Kasbah Mosque (left).  Before the Saadians  The early history of the necropolis is not well known. The necropolis is located right behind the qibla wall (in this case the southeastern wall) of the Kasbah Mosque which was built, along with the surrounding royal kasbah (citadel), by the Almohad caliph Abu Yusuf Ya'qub (al-Mansur) in the late 12th century (1185-1190). Accordingly, it is believed that this was the site of a necropolis even in Almohad times, though there's no evidence of any significant figures being buried here at that time (the Almohad rulers were buried at Tinmal instead). It is known, however, that in the 14th century, during the Marinid dynasty period, Sultan Abu al-Hasan was buried here temporarily in 1351. He died while in exile in the High Atlas mountains and Marrakesh was thus the closest city for burial (which, under Islamic tradition, must be carried out quickly). A few months later his body was then moved and reburied in the Marinid royal necropolis at Chellah (near Rabat). A marble tombstone with a long inscription attests to his first burial in the Marrakesh kasbah necropolis, and this tombstone is still found in the Chamber of the Three Niches in the Saadian tombs today (presumably moved there during or after Saadian construction). The Marinid sultan's burial here suggests that it must have already been a cemetery at the time. Afterwards, the necropolis also became the burial site of the Hintati emirs who controlled the region of Marrakesh from the mid-15th century until the 1520s. Some of their epitaphs are still visible today.  The Saadian necropolis  The present necropolis dates generally from the Saadian period but there are still some questions about the chronology and attribution of the various constructions which have not been resolved beyond doubt. The most generally cited timeline and the most complete analysis was laid out by Deverdun in 1959, based on a number of arguments and lines of evidence. Muhammad al-Sheikh and Lalla Mas'uda.|alt= The necropolis has two major structures: one to the east, surrounded by gardens on either side, and one to the west, next to the visitor entrance today. The eastern mausoleum started out first as a simple square mausoleum chamber adjoining the southern wall of the Kasbah Mosque. It is believed that this first mausoleum was built by the second Saadian sultan, Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib, between 1557 and 1574. Abdallah was already a prolific builder throughout his reign and it seems he wished to erect a mausoleum to honor his father Muhammad al-Sheikh, the founder of the dynasty, who was killed in 1557 and buried here in what was probably a simple grave. Abdallah himself was later buried next to his father in 1574, in the new mausoleum he had built. A dedicatory marble inscription panel was placed on the wall at the head of his tomb, but this panel was later moved (at an unknown date and for unknown reasons) to the Chamber of the Three Niches in the later western building. It is probable (but unconfirmed) that the fourth Saadian sultan, Abd al-Malik, was also buried next to Muhammad al-Sheikh (also his father), on the south side of the latter's tomb, in 1578 or after. The next building phase took place during the reign of Ahmad al-Mansur, another of Muhammad al-Sheikh's sons and the most powerful and wealthy of the Saadian sultans, between 1578 and 1603. When al-Mansur's mother, Lalla Mas'uda, a concubine of Muhammad al- Sheikh, died in 1591, he decided to have her buried within the same mausoleum chamber as that of his father. It was most likely on this occasion, or slightly after, that al-Mansur decided to modify and expand this mausoleum. He allegedly redid the decoration of the existing chamber, and added two rectangular loggia rooms on its eastern and western sides. He also created a much larger rectangular chamber (the so-called Grand Chamber) on the southern side, connected directly to the other three rooms. It's possible that al- Mansur intended this larger chamber to house his own tomb. At some point, he probably also commissioned two more dedicatory marble inscription panels to be placed at the heads of the tombs of his father (Muhammad al-Sheikh) and his mother (Lalla Mas'uda). Again for unknown reasons and at an uncertain date, Muhammad al-Sheikh's dedicatory panel was moved to the western building and placed on the back wall of the Chamber of the Twelve Columns, where it is still visible today. The panel dedicated to Lalla Mas'uda has remained next to her grave (although it may have been moved around too). alt= At some point during al-Mansur's expansion and embellishment of the eastern mausoleum, between 1591 and 1598 (or before 1603 at latest), he decided to abandon this work and embarked on the construction of an entirely new building to the west. This new mausoleum was clearly intended for his own burial. The building was divided into three chambers, from south to north: the Chamber of the Mihrab (a prayer room, not originally meant to house any tombs), the Chamber of the Twelve Columns (a regal tomb chamber for himself), and the Chamber of the Three Niches (an annex to the main chamber). The first person to be buried in this building was in fact one of al-Mansur's wives, Mahalla, in 1598, in a spot close to the eventual tomb of her husband in the Chamber of the Twelve Columns. Ahmad al-Mansur himself was buried in the center of this chamber upon his death in 1603. Some of the decoration in the Chamber of the Mihrab may have been left unfinished after his death. After al-Mansur, a number of other family members, including his successors, were buried in this chamber with him. Among the more important ones, the first was another of his wives, Lalla as-Sabaniyya, in 1623. Then it was their son, Sultan Moulay Zidan, in 1627, followed by Sultan Abd al-Malik II in 1631 and Sultan Muhammad al-Sheikh al- Saghir in 1653-54. Today, Moulay Zidan's epitaph is immediately to the right of his father's while to the left is Muhammad al-Sheikh al-Saghir. The ornate tombstones (of a type called mqabriya) over these five important royal family members (i.e. al-Mansur, Lalla as-Sabaniyya, Zidan, Abd al-Malik II, and al- Sheikh al-Saghir) are also the largest and finest in the mausoleum, carved in Carrara marble. Their strong similarity in style and craftsmanship has been argued as evidence that they were created by the same artisan or workshop of artisans between 1603 and 1655, with the mqabriyas of the first two (al-Mansur and Lalla as-Sabaniyya) probably being commissioned by their son Moulay Zidan and then serving as models for the other three tombstones made later. A number of other lesser royal family members are scattered around the chamber. A typical tombstone in the gardens of the necropolis.The necropolis continued to be used as a burial place for some time after al-Mansur's death and even after the demise of the Saadian dynasty, as evidenced by the profusion of graves and tombstones scattered around the cemetery today. The large rectangular chamber (or Grand Chamber) on the southern side of Muhammad al-Sheikh's and Lalla Mas'uda's mausoleum was filled with other tombs. The Chamber of the Mihrab, the southern chamber of Ahmad al-Mansur's construction which was intended to be used merely as a prayer room, was used as a mausoleum by the Alaouite dynasty up until at least the late 18th century. It is now filled entirely with the graves of Alaouite family members. One of these graves is reputedly that of the Alaouite sultan Moulay al-Yazid (died 1792), which was previously marked off by a wooden balustrade and which was sometimes visited by local pilgrims. Moulay al-Yazid's name is now also associated with the Kasbah Mosque and with the square in front of it. In total, the necropolis now contains 56 tombstones marked with mqabriyas (ornate marble epitaphs) and another hundred or so tombs marked simply with multicolored tiles.  Modern times  Eventually, the necropolis was isolated from the surrounding streets and fell out of use. In 1917 they were \\"rediscovered\\" by the Service des Beaux-Arts, Antiquit√©s et Monuments historiques (\\"Service of Fine Arts, Antiquities, and Historic Monuments\\") of Morocco, an official body created in 1912 with the beginning of the French Protectorate over Morocco. By then, the tombs were in state of severe disrepair, and from 1917 onward the Service carried out a careful restoration process. Missing parts of the decoration were restored by using surviving parts as a model. The work also opened up the site to the general public for the first time. From the 1920s onward the tombs became the object of study by scholars. Today, they have become a major tourist attraction in Marrakesh.  Architecture and layout  General layout of the Saadian Tombs today. The eastern building is the older mausoleum, consisting of a central square chamber, the Chamber of Lalla Mas'uda (1), and a larger rectangular tomb chamber, the so-called Grand Chamber (2). Two loggias are located on either side of it. The larger western building (on the left) is composed of the Chamber of the Mihrab (3), the Chamber of the Twelve Columns (4), and the Chamber of the Three Niches (5). In between these buildings are gardens full of other tombs (6). Visitors today enter via a narrow passage from the west (7). The necropolis is a large garden cemetery enclosed by a rampart to the south and by the wall of the Kasbah Mosque to the north. Inside this are two main buildings; one on the western edge of the cemetery (on the left as visitors enter) and the other further east, surrounded by the cemetery gardens. The gardens themselves are filled with graves covered by colourful tiles.  The eastern mausoleum  alt= The eastern building of the necropolis is the older of the two main buildings in the necropolis. It is often referred to as the Qubba of Lalla Mas'uda (\\"Qubba\\" being an Arabic word for a mausoleum, usually domed). It consists of a small central square chamber (the so-called Chamber of Lalla Mas'uda), two rectangular loggia rooms on either side to the east and west, and a large rectangular chamber to the south (the so-called Grand Chamber) which connects directly to all three. In addition to the two loggias which open onto the gardens, there is an opening (a door or a former window) on the southern side of the large southern chamber. This unusual and almost symmetrical layout is believed to be the result of at least two different construction phases: a square mausoleum originally erected over the tomb of Muhammad al-Sheikh by Moulay Abdallah al- Ghalib and an expansion by Ahmad al-Mansur which added the other chambers around it (see history section above). The bulk of the building is built in brick. The decoration, also believed to be from al-Mansur's time, is of high quality throughout, even though some scholars believe the decoration was left unfinished when Ahmad al-Mansur stopped working on this building and began constructing the western mausoleum.  The Chamber of Lalla Mas'uda  The central chamber is also sometimes referred to as the Chamber of Lalla Mas'uda. It is believed to be the oldest structure in the necropolis, a relatively small mausoleum erected by the Saadian Sultan Moulay Abdallah between 1557 and 1574 over the tomb of his father, Muhammad al-Sheikh, the founder of the dynasty. Today it contains the tomb of Muhammad al-Sheikh, Lalla Mas'uda (a concubine of al-Sheikh and mother of Ahmad al-Mansur), Moulay Abdallah himself, and possibly also Sultan Abd al-Malik (another son of al-Sheikh who ruled between 1576 and 1578). The chamber is square, measuring 4 meters per side. The chamber is covered by a dome of very fine and intricate muqarnas (honeycomb or stalactite-like sculpting) made of stucco which retains a part of its polychrome painting in blue and gold (among other colours). The surfaces of the tiny niches in the muqarnas composition alternate between plain surfaces and surfaces carved with Moroccan/Andalusian arabesque motifs. The upper walls of the chamber are covered in intricate stucco decoration as well, in the form of arabesque and geometric compositions, while the lower walls are covered in zellij tile mosaics with geometric star patterns. Between these two parts are bands of Arabic inscriptions in both stucco and tilework. The floor is also covered in zellij paving (although in generally simpler motifs). On the chamber's northern side is a niche, resembling a mihrab, covered by its own canopy of muqarnas. This niche contains the tomb of Lalla Mas'uda. On the lower western wall of the niche is a carved marble panel with a dedicatory text to Lalla Mas'uda. The panel is the best preserved piece of its kind in the whole necropolis, thanks in part to the fact that it was originally protected by wooden shutters. In addition to its rich carvings, it retains hints of former red paint. File:ŒúŒ±œÖœÉœâŒªŒµŒØŒø œÑœâŒΩ Œ£Œ±Œ±ŒΩœÑŒØ 1095.jpg|View towards the Chamber of Lalla Mas'uda, from the southern chamber.

The Grand Chamber  Lalla Masu'da's chamber connects to the large rectangular chamber to the south through a doorway crowned by an intricate stucco arch with muqarnas intrados (inner surfaces of the arch), which in turn is surrounded by some of the highest-quality stucco carving. The upper walls of this chamber are mostly bare but the lower walls feature zellij tilework with even more complex 16-sided star patterns. The chamber is covered by a berchla roof (a Moroccan wooden framework ceiling with particular stylistic geometric arrangements) with remnants of its former colours. The floor is covered in tilework again along with various tombs. The chamber measures 10 by 6 meters. File:0063 SAADIER-GR√ÑBER, Marrakesch (36548736594).jpg|View of the Grand Chamber.

On either side of the mausoleum are small rectangular chambers (4 by 2 meters) that open to the outside through richly- decorated loggias. The eastern loggia room has doorways opening onto both the central mausoleum chamber (via another intricate archway) and the southern Grand Chamber, while the western loggia connects only to the southern chamber. The loggias are triple-arched: a cedar wood canopy forms an arch resting on stucco-carved pillars that in turn rest on marble columns, with smaller muqarnas-carved arches crossing the space between the columns and the main walls of the structure. The wooden canopies feature a band carved with cartouches of Arabic calligraphy featuring a Qur'anic verse from the Surah al- Ahzab. The stucco carvings are again very fine and feature a variety of motifs. A band of stucco featuring a star-like pattern runs around the rest of the building on the outside, just below the wooden roof.  The western mausoleum  The western mausoleum building is divided into three chambers: the Chamber of the Mihrab, the Chamber of the Twelve Columns, and the Chamber of the Three Niches. It is believed to date entirely from the reign of Ahmad al-Mansur, though it contains many tombs from after his time as well.  Chamber of the Mihrab  The southernmost chamber was intended to be a small mosque or prayer room, which is why it features a mihrab on its south/southeast wall. In Islamic architecture the mihrab is a niche or alcove symbolizing the qibla (the direction of prayer). The mihrab here resembles that of the Ben Youssef Madrasa (also Saadian in origin): a horseshoe arch surrounded by elaborate stucco decoration and hiding a small muqarnas cupola inside. The decoration of the lower parts of the mihrab, however, appears to have been left unfinished: the outlines of a pattern have been traced but they have not been filled-in and carved. This is believed to be due to Ahmad al- Mansur dying before the decoration was completely finished and his successors lacking the will or the resources to finish it. A total of 8 engaged columns, made out of veined marble, are arranged around the base of the mihrab. The rest of the chamber is a large rectangular space marked by four columns supporting arches. The columns and the arches split the upper space of the chamber into 9 rectangular areas, with each division having its own wooden ceiling with star patterns. The ceiling in front of the mihrab, however, is different and instead features a large pyramid-shaped dome of intricate muqarnas (similar in style to the ceiling of the Chamber of Lalla Mas'uda). Since the dome has a square outline, it transitions into the rectangular space with two more sloped surfaces of muqarnas on either side. This mosque chamber was originally the only entrance into the building. The central mausoleum of al-Mansur (the Chamber of Twelve Columns) is entered via another ornate muqarnas archway directly opposite the mihrab. Nowadays, however, the floor of the chamber is covered with the tombs of family members of the Alaouite dynasty, as well as, reputedly, the tomb of the Alaouite sultan Moulay al- Yazid. As a result, visitors are generally not allowed to walk inside. File:Saadian Tombs left room.JPG|View of the Chamber of the Mihrab. The mihrab is on the left.

File:Saadian Tombs - Marrakech, Morocco (8139063028).jpg|The muqarnas archway entrance to the Chamber of the Twelve Columns.  Chamber of the Twelve Columns (Mausoleum of Ahmad al- Mansur)  This is the grand mausoleum chamber of Ahmad al-Mansur and the most richly decorated chamber in the entire necropolis, generally considered the highlight of the complex. Its layout follows a previously established plan seen at the Mausoleum of Sidi Yusuf ibn Ali in Marrakech (built by the Saadian sultan Moulay Abdallah) and in the remains of the rawda cemetery at the Alhambra of Granada. The chamber is square, measuring 10 meters per side and rising 12 meters high. A slightly smaller square is formed within the chamber by the twelve columns of Carrara marble symmetrically arranged in groups of three around the center of the room. The capitals of the marble columns have simple profiles but are covered in high-relief vegetal or arabesque carvings. What is more exceptional is that each group of three columns supports two small muqarnas arches which are also made out of marble (instead of the usual wood or stucco) and yet appear as intricately carved as the other elements in the room. The space between the column groups is spanned by wider muqarnas arches carved in stucco, but the consoles or corbels on which their bases rest are also made out of marble. Overall, the craftsmen who built the chamber took great care to make the transition from marble to stucco nearly imperceptible, so that the two highly different materials seem to blend naturally together. The use of red paint to highlight the stucco forms is still visible in many areas. The elaborate cedar wood ceilings of the chamber are also high achievements of Moroccan and Saadian art. Because of the square-within-a- square layout and the arches springing from the corners of the inner square, there is one large ceiling in the center and eight smaller square and rectangular ceilings around it. The central wood-frame ceiling is shaped like a square dome or cupola and is covered in a star pattern. Both the shape and the pattern are similar to, but less extensive than, the famous ceiling of the Hall of Ambassadors in the Alhambra palace. Below the dome itself is transitional zone of wood-carved muqarnas, and below this are two bands of painted decoration with arabesque motifs and Arabic calligraphic inscriptions. The rectangular ceilings along the sides of the chamber are flat but feature more geometric motifs as well as miniature cupolas of muqarnas. Lastly, the smaller square ceilings in the corners of the chamber are full muqarnas cupolas. The upper bands of wood running just below the ceilings here are also decorated with arch motifs as well as Kufic Arabic motifs. The ceilings are all painted in predominantly red and gold colours, still preserved today. The surfaces of the chamber walls are covered in carved stucco as well as the more usual zellij tiling along their lower parts. At the very center of the room is the tombstone of Ahmad al-Mansur. To his immediate right (from the perspective of present-day visitors seeing the room) is the tombstone of his son, Sultan Moulay Zidan (died 1627), and to his immediate left is the tombstone of Sultan Muhammad al-Sheikh al-Saghir (died 1654-55). Also in this room are the tombs of al-Mansur's wife, Lalla as-Sabaniyya (died 1623) and of Sultan Abd al-Malik II (died 1631). All of their tombstones, of a type called a mqabriya, consist of an elongated marble bloc carved with Arabic epitaphs on arabesque backgrounds. The mqabriyas of these five Saadians are particularly large and ornate, and are believed to have been made by the same workshop of artisans. The lesser tombstones of other dynasty members are scattered around the room. Curiously, the marble inscription plaque embedded in the back wall of the chamber is dedicated to Muhammad al-Sheikh (who is buried in the other mausoleum across the gardens to the east), and was apparently moved here from his tombstone in the eastern mausoleum. Why or when it was moved here is unknown. Today, since the original entrance via the Chamber of the Mihrab is off-limits, visitors enter to the edge of the chamber via an opening in the eastern wall of the mausoleum, directly from the outside. This opening was originally only a window, similar to windows found in the outer walls of other shrines in Morocco where Muslim pedestrians on the street are able to offer prayers or gifts to the deceased without having to enter the sanctuary.

File:Grabm√§ler der Saadier 07.jpg|The back wall of the mausoleum chamber.  Chamber of the Three Niches  alt= The Chamber of the Three Niches is an annex to the main mausoleum chamber and houses more tombs, including an epitaph attesting to the first (temporary) burial of the Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan in 1341 (presumably transferred here after the Saadian construction). Another marble inscription plaque, this time belonging to Moulay Abdallah al- Ghalib, is embedded in one of the walls of the chamber here. Once again, it is unknown why or when this plaque was moved from its original location (at the head of Abdallah's tomb in the eastern mausoleum) to here. The chamber is accessed from the Chamber of the Twelve Columns via two side openings in the northern wall of the latter. The layout of the chamber is simpler and its ceilings are also less elaborate. However, its walls are covered in some of the most intricate stucco carvings of the complex, featuring a variety of arabesque, geometric, and epigraphic/calligraphic motifs.  Influence and legacy  Scholars generally view the design and decoration of the Saadian Tombs as strongly and clearly embedded in the artistic traditions of earlier Andalusian and Moroccan architecture (or \\"Hispano-Moorish\\" art). Some, such as Georges Mar√ßais, even refer to Saadian art more generally as a \\"renaissance\\" of this style, before its relative decline in the following centuries. In addition to the use and continued elaboration of decorative techniques from the Marinid era of Morocco, the Saadian Tombs also suggest an influence from Nasrid antecedents in Granada, Spain. The layout of the Chamber of the Twelve Columns, for example, is similar to the layout of the rawda cemetery and mausoleum in the Alhambra and was later repeated in the Mausoleum of Moulay Isma'il in Meknes during the Alaouite period. Other Nasrid influences in Saadian architecture include the two ornamental ablutions pavilions which Ahmad al-Mansur added to the courtyard of the Qarawiyyin Mosque in Fes and which strongly resemble the two pavilions in the Court of the Lions at the Alhambra. The Saadian Tombs are frequently regarded as the high benchmark of Moroccan art and architecture in the Saadian period and in the post-medieval period generally, thanks to its extremely rich decoration and its \\"rational\\" arrangement of interior space. Shortly after they were \\"rediscovered\\" and made accessible to the public by French colonial authorities in 1917, they were praised by many contemporary art historians and observers who visited them. At the same time, many (Western) scholars still view the Saadian period as the beginning of a decline or of a \\"conservative\\" period in Moroccan art and architecture, during which existing styles were faithfully reproduced and imitated but few innovations were introduced.

Leahy was born in Creggane, in the Civil parish of Hackmys, in the barony of Coshma near Kilmallock in County Limerick, near the border between County Limerick and County Cork. He was one of seven brothers all of whom were sportsmen. His brother Con won medals in jumping at two Olympic Games. Another brother, Timothy, also jumped competitively. Patrick broke the British high jump record in Dublin in 1898 with a jump of 6 ft. 4in. (1.93m), he went on to win the British AAA high jump title in 1898 and 1899, and also came third in the long jump in 1899. Leahy also competed internationally in the long jump and the hop, step and jump (triple jump). In the 1900 Olympic Games in Paris, Leahy took part in three jump disciplines. He won the silver medal in the high jump behind Irving Baxter of the United States, and the bronze medal in the long jump behind Alvin Kraenzlein and Myer Prinstein, he also finished fourth place in the triple jumps behind Prinstein, James Connolly and Lewis Sheldon. Eight years later, Leahy was back on the Olympic scene when he competed at the 1908 Summer Olympics, held in London, he entered the high jump again, but unfortunately he only finished ninth in the qualifying so didn't advance to the final, unlike his brother Con Leahy who went on to win the silver medal. In 1909 Patrick and Con Leahy emigrated to the United States. Patrick died there in 1927, aged 50.

P. microdon and P. perotteti) is a species of sawfish, family Pristidae. It is found worldwide in tropical and subtropical coastal regions, but also enters freshwater. It has declined drastically and is considered critically endangered. A range of English names have been used for the species, or populations now part of the species, including common sawfish (despite it being far from common today), wide sawfish, freshwater sawfish, river sawfish (less frequently, other sawfish species also occur in freshwater and rivers), Leichhardt's sawfish (after explorer and naturalist Ludwig Leichhardt) and northern sawfish. Taxonomy The taxonomy of Pristis pristis in relations to P. microdon (claimed range: Indo-West Pacific) and P. perotteti (claimed range: Atlantic and East Pacific) has historically caused considerable confusion, but evidence published in 2013 revealed that the three are conspecific, as morphological and genetic differences are lacking.Faria, V. V.; McDavitt, M. T.; Charvet, P.; Wiley, T. R.; Simpfendorfer, C. A.; Naylor, G. J. P. (2013). Species delineation and global population structure of Critically Endangered sawfishes (Pristidae). Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 167: 136‚Äì164. doi:10.1111/j.1096-3642.2012.00872.x Retrieved 26 August 2013. As a consequence, recent authorities treat P. microdon and P. perotteti as synonyms of P. pristis. Based on an analysis of NADH-2 genes there are three main clades of P. pristis: Atlantic, Indo-West Pacific and East Pacific. Its scientific name Pristis (both the genus and specific name) is derived from the Greek word for saw. Description Comparison of the largetooth sawfish (top), green sawfish (P. zijsron; middle) and knifetooth sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata; bottom). Notice especially the width of the saw, the teeth on the saw, the shape of the tail and pectoral fins, and the position of the dorsal fin compared to the pelvic fins The largetooth sawfish possibly reaches up to in total length, but the largest confirmed was a West African individual that was long. An individual caught in 1951 at Galveston, Texas, which was documented on film but not measured, has been estimated to be of similar size. Today most individuals are far smaller and a typical length is . Large individuals may weigh as much as , or possibly even more. The largetooth sawfish is easily recognized by the forward position of the dorsal fin with its leading edge placed clearly in front of the leading edge of the pelvic fins (when the sawfish is seen from above or the side), the relatively long pectoral fins with angular tips, and the presence of a small lower tail lobe. In all other sawfish species the leading edge of their dorsal fin is placed at, or behind, the leading edge of the pelvic fins, and all other Pristis sawfish species have shorter pectoral fins with less pointed tips and lack a distinct lower tail lobe (very small or none). The rostrum (\\"saw\\") of the largetooth sawfish has a width that is 15‚Äì25% of its length, which is relatively wide compared to the other sawfish species, and there are 14‚Äì24 equally separated teeth on each side of it. On average, females have shorter rostrums with fewer teeth than males. The proportional rostrum length also varies with age, with average being around 27% of the total length of the fish, but can be as high as 30% in juveniles and as low as 20‚Äì22% in adults. Its upperparts are generally grey to yellowish-brown, often with a clear yellow tinge to the fins. Individuals in freshwater may have a reddish colour caused by blood suffusion below the skin. The underside is greyish or white. Distribution and habitat A largetooth sawfish in Australia, the only country that still has a relatively healthy population of this species. The largetooth sawfish can be found worldwide in tropical and subtropical coastal regions, but it also enters freshwater and has been recorded in rivers as far as from the sea. Historically, its East Atlantic range was from Mauritania to Angola. There are old reports (last in the late 1950s or shortly after) from the Mediterranean and these have typically been regarded as vagrants, but a review of records strongly suggests that this sea had a breeding population. Its West Atlantic range was from Uruguay to the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. Although there are claimed reports from several Gulf Coast states in the United States, a review indicates that only those from Texas are genuine. Other specimens, notably several claimed to be from Florida, were likely imported from other countries. Its East Pacific range was from Peru to Mazatl√°n in Mexico. Historically it was widespread in the Indo-Pacific, ranging from South Africa to the Horn of Africa, India, Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. Its total distribution covered almost , more than any other species of sawfish, but it has disappeared from much of its historical range. Adults are primarily found in estuaries and marine waters to a depth of , but mostly less than . Nevertheless, the species does appear to have a greater affinity for freshwater habitats than the smalltooth sawfish (P. pectinata), green sawfish (P. zijsron), and dwarf sawfish (P. clavata). Largetooth sawfish from the population in Lake Nicaragua appear to spend most, if not all, of their life in freshwater, but tagging surveys indicate that at least some do move between this lake and the sea. Captive studies show that this euryhaline species can thrive long-term in both salt and freshwater, regardless of its age, and that an acclimation from salt to freshwater is faster than the opposite. In captivity they are known to be agile (even swimming backwards), have an unusual ability to \\"climb\\" with the use of the pectoral fins and they can jump far out of the water; a individual jumped to a height of . It has been suggested that this may be adaptions for traversing medium-sized waterfalls and rapids when moving upriver. They are generally found in areas with a bottom consisting of sand, mud or silt. The preferred water temperature is between , and or colder is lethal. Behavior and life cycle Sexual maturity is reached at a length of about when 7‚Äì10 years old. Breeding is seasonal in this ovoviviparous species, but the exact timing appears to vary depending on the region. The adult females can breed once every 1‚Äì2 years, the gestation period is about five months, and there are indications that mothers return to the region where they were born to give birth to their own young. There are 1‚Äì13 (average 7) young in each litter, which are long at birth. They are likely typically born in salt or brackish water near river mouths, but move into freshwater where the young spend the first 3‚Äì5 years of their life, sometimes as much as upriver. In the Amazon basin the largetooth sawfish has been reported even further upstream, and this mostly involves young individuals that are up to long. Occasionally, young individuals become isolated in freshwater pools during floods and may live there for years. The potential lifespan of the largetooth sawfish is unknown, but four estimates suggested 30 years, 35 years, 44 years, and 80 years. The largetooth sawfish is a predator that feeds on fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The \\"saw\\" can be used both to stir up the bottom to find prey and to slash at groups of fish. Sawfish are docile and harmless to humans, except when captured where they can inflict serious injuries when defending themselves with the \\"saw\\". Conservation A large rostrum or \\"saw\\" from a largetooth sawfish with several teeth missing (black marks on ruler are apart) As suggested by the alternative name common sawfish, it was once plentiful, but has now declined drastically leading to it being considered a critically endangered species by the IUCN. The main threat is overfishing, but it also suffers from habitat loss. Both their fins (used in shark fin soup) and \\"saw\\" (as novelty items) are highly valuable, and the meat is used as food. Because of the \\"saw\\" they are particularly prone to becoming entangled in fishing nets. Historically sawfish were also persecuted for the oil in their liver. The largetooth sawfish has been extirpated from many regions where formerly present. Among the 75 countries where recorded historically, it has disappeared from 28 and may have disappeared from another 27, leaving only 20 countries where certainly still present. In terms of area this means that it certainly survives in only 39% of its historical range. Only Australia still has a relatively healthy population of the species and this may be the last remaining population in the entire Indo-Pacific that is of sufficient size to be viable, but even it has experienced a decline. Other places in the Indo- Pacific where still present, even if in very low numbers, are off Eastern Africa, the Indian subcontinent and Papua New Guinea, and in the East Pacific it survives off Central America, Colombia and northern Peru. Whether it survives anywhere in Southeast Asia is generally unclear, but one was captured in the Philippines in 2014 (a country where otherwise considered extirpated). The species has disappeared from much of its Atlantic range and declined where still present. The likely largest remaining population in this region is in the Amazon estuary, but another important population is in the San Juan River system in Central America. It was once abundant in Lake Nicaragua (part of the San Juan River system), but this population rapidly crashed during the 1970s when tens of thousands were caught. It has been protected in Nicaragua since the early 1980s, but remains rare in the lake today, and is now threatened by the planned Nicaragua Canal. In West Africa, the Bissagos Archipelago has often been considered the last remaining stronghold, but interviews with locals indicate that sawfish now also are rare there. All sawfish species were added to CITES Appendix I in 2007, thereby restricting international trade. As the first marine fish, there was an attempt of having it listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 2003 by the United States National Marine Fisheries Service, but it was declined. However, it was listed as P. perotteti under the ESA in 2011. Following taxonomic changes, the ESA listing was updated to P. pristis in December 2014. Sawfish are protected in Australia and the United States where a number of conservation projects have been initiated, but the largetooth sawfish has probably already been extirpated from the latter country (last confirmed record in 1961 from Nueces, Texas). Additionally it receives a level of protection in Bangladesh, Brazil, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Senegal and South Africa, but illegal fishing continues, enforcement of fishing laws is often lacking and it has already disappeared from some of these countries. Largetooth sawfish, especially young, are sometimes eaten by crocodiles and large sharks. Two largetooth sawfish at the Shanghai Ocean Aquarium, China This species is the most numerous sawfish in public aquariums, but it is often listed under the synonym P. microdon. Studbooks included 16 individuals (10 males, 6 females) in North American aquariums in 2014, 5 individuals (3 males, 2 females) in European aquariums in 2013, and 13 individuals (6 males, 7 females) in Australian aquariums in 2017. Others are kept at public aquariums in Asia.

The narrow gauge, horse-drawn Nantlle Railway had a station near the site from 1856 until 1865, when it was closed to be replaced and updated to standard gauge with contemporary facilities. It reopened in its eventual form in 1867 and closed in December 1964. The station served as the junction station for the short branch to which was overlain in 1872 on part of the former Nantlle Railway route, but its main purpose was for traffic on the former Carnarvonshire Railway line from to and beyond.

A Cambrian driver, who had never been over the line before, was retained to drive the first directors' inspection special from to . On the return journey the loco ran short of coal and ran out of steam at Penygroes. There was some peat in a nearby field, which the crew dug and the directors carried to the engine enabling steam to be raised. The passenger service along the Nantlle Branch was withdrawn in 1932, though excursions continued until 1939. The station and line closed on 7 December 1964 as recommended in the Beeching Report.

The band was formed by Jeff Kent and Doug Lubahn, who wrote and arranged their songs. It began as a trio and evolved into a horn-based band over time. They were later joined by Will Lee, Don Grolnick, Bob Mann, and Eddie Vernon. Dreams selected as their producer, composer and sound engineer, Fred Weinberg, whose work included albums for Eddie Palmieri, Tito Puente, La Lupe, Mongo Santamaria, Celia Cruz, Illustration (Alan Lorber's group), and Little Anthony. Phil Ramone, another highly respected producer and studio owner, for whom Weinberg worked at the time at a studio named A & R in New York City, gave his blessings to Weinberg to record and mix the Dreams LP with former Atlantic A-1 engineer Jim Reeves at CBS Studios in New York City. During the Dreams sessions the recording sessions were moved by CBS execs to their CBS Chicago Studios because the CBS 52nd street studios became booked for several weeks by Paul Simon, and because Dreams had a deadline for their LP release. The album received a full page ad and a favorable review in Billboard Magazine. Dreams' second and final album Imagine My Surprise was produced in Memphis by Steve Cropper. Cropper wanted to \\"help the audience to better understand the group\\" so in his production he put \\"funkier, more commercial rhythms behind [the band]\\" while trying to \\"keep jazz up front at the same time.\\" While Dreams did not achieve the commercial success of either Chicago or Blood Sweat & Tears, they served as a launchpad for eventually prominent jazz fusion artists Billy Cobham, Don Grolnick, and Randy & Michael Brecker (later known as the Brecker Brothers). Other prominent band members included guitarist John Abercrombie, trombonist Barry Rogers, guitarist Bob Mann (who later joined Mountain) and bassist Will Lee. One of the principal differences between Dreams and most other brass-infused bands was Dream's emphasis on spontaneity. The horn section would \\"work up spontaneous arrangements by jamming, always leaving them wide open to interpretations from night to night.\\" Discography * Dreams (Columbia, 1970) * Imagine My Surprise (Columbia, 1971)  References  External links *[ AllMusicGuide] Category:Jazz-rock groups Category:Columbia Records artists Category:American jazz ensembles ","title":"Dreams (band)"},{"id":"7106348","text":"Arjun Halappa Latest Hockey News, Indian Hockey Players, Article, Columns - Stick2Hockey Arjun Halappa ‚Äì The missing link in Indian hockey SportsKeedaHalappa is new hockey captain - Sport - DNA (Kannada:‡≤Ö‡≤∞‡≥ç‡≤ú‡≥Å‡≤®‡≥ç ‡≤π‡≤æ‡≤≤‡≤™‡≥ç‡≤™) (born 13 December 1980) is a professional Indian hockey player and former captain of Indian Hockey Team.

Political career In the sting Operation Duryodhana by the Noida based media firm Cobrapost, aired 12 December 2005 on the Indian Hindi news TV Channel Aaj Tak, Raja Ram Pal was caught on video accepting bribes of Rs. 35,000 for fielding questions in parliament. At one point, he says that the price of getting MPs to sign on to any petition is Rs. 25,000 per MP. He wants the money in advance; he underlines this with a colourful Hindi couplet: :sasta roye baar-baar, mehnga roye ek baar :(if you throw little money you will cry again and again, but if you throw big money you will cry only once). Expulsion from Parliament On 23 December 2005 he was expelled from the Lok Sabha following the adoption of a motion calling for the expulsion of all 11 MPs caught in the sting. The scam also led to Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati expelling him from the party, along with three others.http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/84757/ Subsequently, he joined the Indian National Congress and was elected in the 2009 Indian general elections.

It operated first as part of the Nantlle Tramway and afterwards as a railway under the auspices of several different companies. The station and line closed on 7 December 1964 as recommended in the Beeching Report. History A halt was located at the same site for the horse drawn Nantlle Tramway, which was originally used purely for transportation of goods from the quarries in the Nantlle Valley to the harbour at Caernarfon. Passenger services were introduced on 11 August 1856, which ran until 12 June 1865. The Carnarvonshire Railway took over services from the Nantlle Tramway a month later, but in most cases relocated the track. One of the exceptions was at Groeslon where the existing layout was maintained. The services under the new railway opened on 2 September 1867, and the local village gradually built up around the station. Initially the station was served by trains running between Afon Wen and Caernarvon railway stations; as there was no passing loop, all trains had to go through the station although not all stopped there. The London and North Western Railway took over all services of the Caernarfon Railway in 1870, including those passing through Groeslon. Services were expanded in 1871 with the start of passenger services on the Caernarvon Town line, and by 1895 some 12 trains were arriving at Groeslon per day. A passing loop and additional platform were added in 1911. On 1 January 1923, services were taken over by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. Further modifications to the layout took place in 1947, the loop and platforms were extended to accommodate longer trains. As lorries, buses and cars became more readily available, the use of the station gradually decreased. The report by Richard Beeching recommended the closure of the line through Groeslon. In the resultant Beeching cuts, Groeslon stopped receiving goods via railway on 4 May 1964, and closed completely on 7 December 1964.

It occurred in a period of dramatic population increase and social tensions associated with the military buildup of U.S. participation in World War II, as Detroit's automotive industry was converted to the war effort. Existing social tensions and housing shortages were exacerbated by racist white feelings about the arrival of nearly 400,000 migrants, both African-American and White Southerners, from the Southeastern United States between 1941 and 1943. The new migrants competed for space and jobs, as well as against European immigrants and their descendants. The Detroit rebellion was one of three that summer; it followed ones in Beaumont, Texas, Harlem, New York, racial riots in Los Angeles, California, and Mobile, Alabama. The rioting in Detroit began among youths at Belle Isle Park on June 20, 1943; the unrest moved into the city proper and was exacerbated by false rumors of racial attacks in both the black and white communities. It continued until June 22. It was suppressed after 6,000 federal troops were ordered into the city to restore peace. A total of 34 people were killed, 25 of them black and most at the hands of the white police force; 433 were wounded, 75 percent of them black; and property valued at $2 million ($30.4 million in 2020 US dollars) was destroyed. Most of the riot took place in the black area of Paradise Valley, the poorest neighborhood of the city.Dominic J. Capeci, Jr., and Martha Wilkerson, \\"The Detroit Rioters of 1943: A Reinterpretation\\", Michigan Historical Review, Jan 1990, Vol. 16 Issue 1, pp. 49-72. At the time, white commissions attributed the cause of the riot to black people and youths. But the NAACP claimed deeper causes: a shortage of affordable housing, discrimination in employment, lack of minority representation in the police, and white police brutality. A late 20th-century analysis of the rioters showed that the white rioters were younger and often unemployed (characteristics that the riot commissions had falsely attributed to blacks, despite evidence in front of them). If working, the whites often held semi-skilled or skilled positions. Whites traveled long distances across the city to join the first stage of the riot near the bridge to Belle Isle Park, and later some traveled in armed groups explicitly to attack the black neighborhood in Paradise Valley. The black participants were often older, established city residents, who in many cases had lived in the city for more than a decade. Many were married working men and were defending their homes and neighborhood against police and white rioters. They also looted and destroyed white-owned property in their neighborhood. Events leading up to the riot Sign posted in response to proposed Sojourner Truth Housing Project, February 1942 By 1920, Detroit had become the fourth-largest city in the United States, with an industrial and population boom driven by the rapid expansion of the automobile industry.Kenneth Jackson, The Ku Klux Klan in the City, 1915-1930, Rowman & Littlefield, 1967, pp.127-129 In this era of continuing high immigration from southern and eastern Europe, the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s established a substantial presence in Detroit during its early 20th-century revival.General Article: \\"Detroit Riots 1943\\", Eleanor Roosevelt, American Experience, PBS The KKK became concentrated in midwestern cities rather than exclusively in the South. It was primarily anti-Catholic and anti-Jewish in this period, but it also supported white supremacy. The KKK contributed to Detroit's reputation for racial antagonism, and there were violent incidents dating from 1915. Its lesser-known offshoot, Black Legion, was also active in the Detroit area. In 1936 and 1937, some 48 members were convicted of numerous murders and attempted murder, thus ending Black Legion's run. Both organizations stood for white supremacy. Detroit was unique among northern cities by the 1940s for its exceptionally high percentage of Southern-born residents, both black and white.Gunnar Myrdal, An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and American Democracy, New York: 1941, p. 568 Soon after the U.S. entry into World War II, the automotive industry was converted to military production; high wages were offered, attracting large numbers of workers and their families from outside of Michigan. The new workers found little available housing, and competition among ethnic groups was fierce for both jobs and housing. With Executive Order 8802, President Franklin D. Roosevelt on June 25, 1941, had prohibited racial discrimination in the national defense industry. Roosevelt called upon all groups to support the war effort. The Executive Order was applied irregularly, and blacks were often excluded from numerous industrial jobs, especially more skilled and supervisory positions. Due to the severe labor shortage during the war, Detroit companies began employing African Americans, but they were typically given the most grueling and dangerous jobs with low pay. For the first time, blacks and whites were in constant close proximity, resulting in hostile everyday interracial encounters. Whites accused blacks of forming a \\"bump club\\" in which members would purposely bump and shove white people in public places, on sidewalks and on the bus.  Growing population  In 1941 at the beginning of the war, blacks numbered nearly 150,000 in Detroit, which had a total population of 1,623,452. Many of the blacks had migrated from the South in 1915 to 1930 during the Great Migration, as the auto industry opened up many new jobs. By summer 1943, after the United States had entered World War II, tensions between whites and blacks in Detroit were escalating; blacks resisted discrimination, as well as oppression and violence by the Detroit Police Department. The police force of the city was overwhelmingly white and the black population resented this. In the early 1940s, Detroit's population reached more than 2 million, absorbing more than 400,000 whites and some 50,000 black migrants, mostly from the American South, where racial segregation was enforced by law. The more recent African Americans were part of the second wave of the black Great Migration, joining 150,000 blacks already in the city. The early residents had been restricted by informal segregation and their limited finances to the poor and overcrowded East Side of the city. A 60-block area east of Woodward Avenue was known as Paradise Valley, and it had aging and substandard housing. White American migrants came largely from agricultural areas and especially rural Appalachia, carrying with them southern prejudices.Sitkoff, \\"The Detroit Race Riot 1943\\" Rumors circulated among ethnic white groups to fear African Americans as competitors for housing and jobs. Blacks had continued to seek to escape the limited opportunities in the South, exacerbated by the Great Depression and second- class social status under Jim Crow laws. After arriving in Detroit, the new migrants found racial bigotry there, too. They had to compete for low-level jobs with numerous European immigrants or their descendants, in addition to rural southern whites. Blacks were excluded from all of the limited public housing except the Brewster Housing Projects. They were exploited by landlords and forced to pay rents that were two to three times higher than families paid in the less densely populated white districts. Like other poor migrants, they were generally limited to the oldest, substandard housing.  The Great Migration  After the Civil War, slavery became illegal. Former slaves and their descendants still faced severe discrimination. As a result, many former slaves could only find low paying work in agriculture or domestic service. Southern blacks migrated north in the 20th Century in hopes of leaving the oppressive culture in the South. Many considered Detroit to be the place of paradise, calling Detroit the \\"New Canaan.\\" During the Civil War, Detroit was an important stop on the Underground Railroad, as many settled in the northern city or used it as a means to get to Canada. During World War II, it was sought out as a refuge for blacks seeking to escape the lingering effects of the Jim Crow era. The promise of employment and escape from the violent racial tensions in the South drew in many African American workers to the North. Before the war, black workers in Detroit were scarce: even in 1942, 119 of 197 Detroit manufacturers surveyed did not have any black employees. However, by 1943, Detroit's labor shortage had become so severe that companies finally began employing African Americans. A report in 1944 showed that with the 44% increase of wartime employment, black employment increased by 103%. Ford Motor Company was the leading manufacturer in black employment: half of all blacks in the auto industry in the U.S. were employed by Ford, and 12% of all Ford workers were black. Ford made sure to develop close ties with African Americans, being in contact with leading clergy at major black churches and using ministers as a screening process to obtain recommendations for the best potential workers. This ensured that Ford only employed reliable long-term workers who would be willing to do the most labor-intensive jobs. Around 1910, Ford gave a salary of $5 a day to its workers, which translates to over $120 today. Because of the city's growth in population and employment opportunities, Detroit became a symbol of cultural rebirth. The statement \\"when I die, bury me in Detroit\\" became popular among the black community for these reasons.  World War II and Housing  The effect of World War II in Europe and Asia was felt heavily in the U.S. even before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The defense industry was growing rapidly because the country was immersed in a military buildup to provide assistance to their European and Asian allies. On the home front, African-Americans were subjected to low-level jobs with little security or protection against the discrimination and prejudice they faced in the work place. A. Philip Randolph and other civil rights leaders took this opportunity to speak with President Roosevelt about expanding opportunities for African-Americans by outlawing discrimination in the defense industry. At first, the president was hesitant to agree due to his political alignments but changed his mind when Randolph threatened a large march on the nation's capital. After President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802 which prohibited racial discrimination within the defense industry, he was then preoccupied with providing adequate housing for the new additions to the workforce. Housing in many cities was substandard, especially for people of color. Housing in Detroit was strained as both blacks and whites moved from southern states to Detroit to work in the booming manufacturing industry in the city. African-Americans were unable to buy houses in the suburbs during the majority of the 20th century due to racially biased practices, such as redlining and restrictive covenants. They had no choice but to live in substandard housing in downtown Detroit in an area more commonly known as Black Bottom. Properties in the city had high values for what residents were getting: single-family apartments crowded with multiple families, outstanding maintenance and, in many cases, no indoor plumbing. The influx of African-Americans to Detroit exacerbated racial tensions already present in the city and culminated at the introduction of the Sojourner Truth Housing Project.  Sojourner Truth Housing Project  In 1941, in an attempt to lessen the severity of the housing crisis, the federal government and the Detroit Housing Commission (DHC) approved the construction of the Sojourner Truth Housing Project with 200 units for black defense workers. The original location for this housing project was chosen by the DHC to be in the Seven Mile-Fenelon neighborhood in northeast Detroit. They believed that this location would be uncontroversial due to its proximity to an already existing African American neighborhood. However, this decision was met with immense backlash. White residents in the surrounding area formed an improvement association, the Seven Mile-Fenelon Improvement Association, and they were soon joined by the residents of the middle-class African American neighborhood, Conant Gardens. These two groups formed an alliance and organized the resistance to the Sojourner Truth Project. These groups protested by meeting with city officials, sending thousands of angry letters to the government, and lobbying with their congressmen against the project, among other things. Since the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) refused to insure any mortgage loans in the area after the announcement of the project, many of the residents in the area believed that this project would decrease nearby property value and reduce their ability to build on nearby vacant lots. These beliefs were not unjustified due to the history of decreased property values in other integrated parts of the city. On the other side, civil rights groups and pro-public housing groups rallied for the federal government to keep its promise to allow black residents in Sojourner Truth housing and address the housing shortage. There was only one other housing project in the city for African Americans at this time. In response to the uproar in the local community, the federal government changed its decision on the racial occupancy of the housing project multiple times. In January 1941, the DHC and federal officials declared that Sojourner Truth would have white occupants, but quickly decided instead that it would be occupied by black war workers just two weeks later. Ultimately, it was decided that the Sojourner Truth project would house black residents as originally promised, much to the frustration of the local white community. February 1942 saw the culmination of these intense feelings about racial heterogeneity. As the first African- Americans workers and their families attempted to move into their new homes, large crowds of both black supporters and white opponents surrounded the area. A billboard announcing \\"We Want White Tenants in our White Community\\" with American flags attached was put up just before the families were to move in. White residents protested the project in the name of \\"protecting\\" their neighborhoods and property value. These efforts continued throughout the day as more people attempted to move in and tensions continued to rise. More than a thousand people showed that up day and, eventually, fighting erupted between the supporters and opponents. Over a dozen police came onto the scene, but the situation worsened. The fighting resulted in over 40 injured and 220 arrested. Of those arrested, 109 were held for trial, only three of which were white. Detroit officials postponed the movement of African-Americans defense workers into the housing project in order to keep the peace. This created a problem for the workers who did not have any place to live. The one other public housing that housed black was able to take up some of the residents, but many others had to find housing in other places. After about 2 months, protesting had reduced and Detroit Mayor Edward Jeffries called the Detroit police and Michigan National Guard to escort and protect the African-American workers and their families as they moved into their new homes. The riot led the DHC to establish a new policy mandating racial segregation in all future public housing projects and promised that future housing projects would not \\"change the racial patterns of a neighborhood.\\" It also established the precedent that white community groups could utilize the threat of violence to their advantage in future housing debates.  Assembly line tensions  In June 1943, Packard Motor Car Company finally promoted three blacks to work next to whites in the assembly lines, in keeping with the anti-segregation policy required for the defense industry. In response, 25,000 whites walked off the job in a \\"hate\\" or wildcat strike at Packard, effectively slowing down the critical war production. Although whites had long worked with blacks in the same plant, many wanted control of certain jobs, and did not want to work right next to blacks. Harold Zeck remembers seeing a group of white women workers coming into the assembly line to convince the white men workers to walk out of work to protest black women using the white woman's bathroom. Harold remembers one of the women saying \\"They think their fannies are as good as ours.\\" The protest ended when the men refused to leave work. There was a physical confrontation at Edgewood Park. In this period, racial riots also broke out in Los Angeles, Mobile, Alabama and Beaumont, Texas, mostly over similar job issues at defense shipyard facilities. Riot Altercations between youths started on June 20, 1943, on a warm Sunday evening on Belle Isle, an island in the Detroit River off Detroit's mainland. In what is considered a communal disorder, youths fought intermittently through the afternoon. The brawl eventually grew into a confrontation between groups of whites and blacks on the long Belle Isle Bridge, crowded with more than 100,000 day trippers returning to the city from the park. From there the riot spread into the city. Sailors joined fights against blacks. The riot escalated in the city after a false rumor spread that a mob of whites had thrown an African-American mother and her baby into the Detroit River. Blacks looted and destroyed white property as retaliation. Whites overran Woodward to Veron where they proceeded to tip over 20 cars that belonged to black families. The whites also started to loot stores while rioting. Historian Marilyn S. Johnson argues that this rumor reflected black male fears about historical white violence against black women and children.Marilynn S. Johnson, \\"Gender, Race, and Rumours: Re- Examining the 1943 Race Riots,\\" Gender and History (1998): 10:252-77.Patricia A. Turner, (1994). I Heard It Through the Grapevine: Rumor in African-American Culture, p. 51. An equally false rumor that blacks had raped and murdered a white woman on the Belle Isle Bridge swept through white neighborhoods. Angry mobs of whites spilled onto Woodward Avenue near the Roxy Theater around 4 a.m., beating blacks as they were getting off street cars on their way to work.\\"The 1943 Race Riots\\", Detroit News, February 10, 1999 They also went to the black neighborhood of Paradise Valley, one of the oldest and poorest neighborhoods in Detroit, attacking blacks who were trying to defend their homes. Blacks attacked white-owned businesses. The clashes soon escalated to the point where mobs of whites and blacks were \\"assaulting one another, beating innocent motorists, pedestrians and streetcar passengers, burning cars, destroying storefronts and looting businesses.\\" Both sides were said to have encouraged others to join in the riots with false claims that one of \\"their own\\" had been attacked unjustly. Blacks were outnumbered by a large margin, and suffered many more deaths, personal injuries and property damage. Out of the 34 people killed, 24 of them were African American. The riots lasted three days and ended only after Mayor Jeffries and Governor Harry Kelly asked President Franklin Roosevelt to intervene. He ordered in federal troops; a total of 6,000 troops imposed a curfew, restored peace and occupied the streets of Detroit. Over the course of three days of rioting, 34 people had been killed; 25 were African Americans, of which 17 were killed by the police (their forces were predominantly white and dominated by ethnic whites). 13 deaths remain unsolved. Nine deaths reported were white, and out of the 1,800 arrests made, 85% of them were African American, and only 15% were white. Of the approximately 600 persons injured, more than 75 percent were black people. The first casualty was a white civilian who was struck by a taxi. Later, four young white males shot and killed a 58-year-old black civilian, Moses Kiska, who was sitting at the bus stop. Detroit police officers, who were patrolling Paradise Valley, told black civilians to run and not look back, and shot some in the back. Later, a white doctor ignored police warnings to avoid black neighborhoods. The doctor then went to a house call in a black neighborhood. He then was hit in the back of the head with a rock and beaten to death by black rioters. A couple years after the riot, a monument wasdedicated to this doctor at the streets of East Grand and Gratiot. A black civilian exited a bus and was grabbed and beaten by a group of whites in front of four police officers, who stood and watched. No one was arrested or cited. Aftermath After the riot, leaders on both sides had explanations for the violence, effectively blaming the other side. White city leaders, including the mayor, blamed young black hoodlums and persisted in framing the events as being caused by outsiders, people who were unemployed and marginal. Mayor Jeffries said, \\"Negro hoodlums started it, but the conduct of the police department, by and large, was magnificent.\\" The Wayne County prosecutor believed that leaders of the NAACP were to blame as instigators of the riots. Governor Kelly called together a Fact Finding Commission to investigate and report on the causes of the riot. Its mostly white members blamed black youths, \\"unattached, uprooted, and unskilled misfits within an otherwise law-abiding black community,\\" and regarded the events as an unfortunate incident. They made these judgments without interviewing any of the rioters, basing their conclusions on police reports, which were limited. Other officials drew similar conclusions, despite discovering and citing facts that disproved their thesis. Dr. Lowell S. Selling of the Recorder's Court Psychiatric Clinic conducted interviews with 100 black offenders. He found them to be \\"employed, well-paid, longstanding (of at least 10 years) residents of the city\\", with some education and a history of being law abiding. He attributed their violence to their Southern heritage. This view was repeated in a separate study by Elmer R. Akers and Vernon Fox, sociologist and psychologist, respectively, at the State Prison of Southern Michigan. Although most of the black men they studied had jobs and had been in Detroit an average of more than 10 years, Akers and Fox characterized them as unskilled and unsettled; they stressed the men's Southern heritage as predisposing them to violence. Additionally, a commission was established to determine the cause of the riot, despite the obvious and unequal amount of violence toward blacks. Later, it was found that the commission was extremely biased; it blamed the riot on blacks and their community leaders. Detroit's Black leaders identified numerous other substantive causes, including persistent racial discrimination in jobs and housing, frequent police brutality against Blacks and the lack of Black representation on the force, and the daily animosity directed at their people by much of Detroit's white population. Following the violence, Japanese propaganda officials incorporated the event into its materials that encouraged black soldiers not to fight for the United States. They distributed a flyer titled \\"Fight Between Two Races\\". The Axis Powers publicized the riot as a sign of Western decline. Racial segregation in the United States Armed Forces was ongoing, and the response to the riots hurt morale in African-American units ‚Äì most significantly the 1511th Quartermaster Truck regiment, which mutinied against white officers and military police on June 24 in the Battle of Bamber Bridge. Walter White, head of the NAACP, noted that there was no rioting at the Packard and Hudson plants, where leaders of the UAW and CIO had been incorporating blacks as part of the rank and file. These changes in the defense industry were directed by Executive Order by President Roosevelt and had begun to open opportunities for blacks.Detroit Riots of 1943, Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present: From the Age of Segregation to the Twenty-first Century, Five-volume Set, ed. Paul Finkelman, Oxford University Press, USA, 2009, pp. 59-60 According to The Detroit News: Reinterpretation in 1990 A late 20th-century analysis of the facts collected on the arrested rioters has drawn markedly different conclusions. It notes that the whites who were arrested were younger, generally unemployed, and had traveled long distances from their homes to the black neighborhood to attack people there. Even in the early stage of the riots near Belle Isle Bridge, white youths traveled in groups to the riot area and carried weapons. Later in the second stage, whites continued to act in groups and were prepared for action, carrying weapons and traveling miles to attack the black ghetto along its western side at Woodward Avenue. Blacks who were arrested were older, often married and working men, who had lived in the city for 10 years or more. They fought closer to home, mainly acting independently to defend their homes, persons or neighborhood, and sometimes looting or destroying mostly white-owned property there in frustration. Where felonies occurred, whites were more often arrested for use of weapons, and blacks for looting or failing to observe the curfew imposed. Whites were more often arrested for misdemeanors. In broad terms, both sides acted to improve their positions; the whites fought out of fear, the blacks fought out of hope for better conditions. Representation in other media Ross Macdonald, then writing under his real name, Kenneth Millar, used Detroit in the wake of this riot as one of the locales in his 1946 novel Trouble Follows Me.Trouble Follows Me, on goodreads.com Retrieved November 18, 2015. Dominic J. Capeci Jr., Martha Wilkerson wrote a book about the Detroit Race Riot too. The book is called Layered Violence: The Detroit Rioters of 1943. This book talks about the entire riot. It also talks about how blacks were considered hoodlums and the whites were known as hillbillies. This book also covers the blacks struggle for racial inequality in world war II. This also explains the rioters to be the transforming figures of racial violence in the twentieth century. Elaine Latzman Moon also gives a brief overview about the riot in her book Untold Tales, Unsung Heroes : An Oral History of Detroit's African American Community, 1918-1967. Loren D. Estleman alludes to the riots in his novel, A Smile on the Face of the Tiger. His detective Amos Walker is trying to find an old pulp writer who wrote a novel, Paradise Valley, about the riot. There is also a copy of the newspaper from the riots listed on eBay. This paper was written by the San Francisco Chronicle with the headline Detroit Mob Violence. This paper states that 23 people died, 20 black and 3 white. It also says that 700 people were injured.  Comparison to 1967 riots  From the perspective of the early 21st century, the 1943 riot has been seen as a precursor of riots of the late 1960s in several cities. The 1943 race riot was spurred by anti- black antipathy, as expressed by the proportion of whites who traveled to the primary black neighborhood to attack persons and property, by police brutality in the mostly white force, housing shortages due to racial discrimination, and fierce job competition in the late days of the Great Depression. The unequal numbers of blacks killed and wounded, blacks arrested, and property damage in the black neighborhood also expresses the social discrimination. Also expressive of this discrimination were the conclusions drawn by commissions, who ignored the evidence of the facts before them to repeat stereotypes about the rioters. The 1967 Detroit Riot was different in that both blacks and whites participated in destruction in the city. Violence was directed at attacking police and the National Guard, and destroying property.

Despite its great antiquity, the gens never attained much historical importance. The only member who obtained the consulship under the Republic was Sextus Quinctilius Varus in 453 BC. The gens produced numerous praetors and other magistrates, but did not obtain the consulship again for over four hundred years.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 634 (\\"Quintilia, or Quinctilia Gens\\"). Origin The nomen Quinctilius is a patronymic surname, based on the praenomen Quintus, meaning \\"fifth\\". Quinctilius is the correct orthography, but Quintilius is also quite common. The gens Quinctia is derived from the same praenomen. It was not unusual for multiple nomina to be derived from a common source; the Sabine name Pompo is the Oscan equivalent of Quintus, and gave rise to the gentes Pompilia and Pomponia.Chase, pp. 118‚Äì120 (\\"Pomponius\\"), 122, 123 (\\"Pompilius\\", \\"Quinctilius\\"). According to legend, the Quinctilii predated the founding of Rome. When the brothers Romulus and Remus had restored their grandfather, Numitor, to the throne of Alba Longa, they set out to establish a new city in the hills overlooking the Tiber. They offered up sacrifices in the cave of the Lupercal at the base of the Palatine Hill, which rite became the origin of the religious festival of the Lupercalia. The followers of Romulus were called the Quinctilii or Quinctiliani, while those of Remus were the Fabii or Fabiani.Ovid, Fasti, ii. 361 ff, 375 ff. In historic times, the two colleges of priests, known as Luperci, who carried out the sacred rituals of the Lupercalia, were known by these names, suggesting that in the earliest times, the gentes Quinctilia and Fabia superintended these rites as a sacrum gentilicium. Another example of such responsibilities concerned the Pinarii and the Potitii, who maintained the worship of Hercules. Such sacred rites were gradually transferred to the state, or opened to the Roman populus; a well-known legend attributed the destruction of the Potitii to the abandonment of their religious office. In later times, the privilege of the Lupercalia had ceased to be confined to the Fabii and the Quinctilii.Aurelius Victor, De Origo Gentis Romanae, 22.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Romulus\\", 22, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 61.Valerius Maximus, ii. 2. ¬ß 9.Cicero, Philippicae, ii. 34, xiii. 15, Pro Caelio, 26.Propertius, Elegiae, iv. 26.Festus, s. v. Quinctiliani, Luperci, Fabiani. Praenomina The principal names used by the Quinctilii were Publius and Sextus. A few of the Quinctilii bore the praenomina Lucius, Marcus, and Titus. Although the name must have been used by one of their ancestors, none of the Quinctilii known to history were named Quintus. Branches and cognomina The only family-name of the Quinctilii under the Republic is Varus, a common surname meaning \\"bent, crooked,\\" or \\"knock-kneed.\\" Other cognomina are found in imperial times.Horace, Satirae, i. 3. 47.Chase, pp. 109, 110.Cassell's Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. varus.

The team is managed by Iwan Spekenbrink and uses Cerv√©lo bicycles. History Team Sunweb was founded in 2005 under the name \\"Shimano-Memory Corp\\", sponsored by Skil and Shimano, and was based in the Netherlands. Thanks to aggressive strategies during Paris‚ÄìNice in 2008 and 2009, the team was awarded a wildcard for the 2009 Tour de France, making it their first appearance in a Grand Tour. After losing its sponsors at the end of 2011, the team adopted the name \\"Project 1T4i\\", standing for \\"team spirit, inspiration, integrity, improvement and innovation\\", until a new sponsor was secured. Ahead of the Tour of Flanders on 1 April 2012, the team became Argos-Shimano following the announcement of a three-year naming rights contract with the Argos North Sea Group, an oil company based in the Netherlands. In 2012, the team received their second wildcard invitation to the 2012 Tour de France, along with three French-registered teams: , and . In December 2012 it was announced that the team would compete at the World Tour level for the 2013 season. In September 2014 German shampoo manufacturer Alpecin announced that they would co-sponsor the team alongside Giant for the 2015 season. In December 2014 Sunweb (a Dutch-owned international tour operator) was announced as a new major sponsor of the team, signing a 2-year deal. On 23 January 2016 during training in Spain, six members of the team (John Degenkolb, Warren Barguil, Max Walscheid, Chad Haga, Fredrik Ludvigsson and Ramon Sinkeldam) were hit by a car that was driven into the on-coming traffic, all riders recovering. On the first rest day of the 2016 Tour de France, the team announced that Sunweb would become a named sponsor of the team for the 2017 season, and the team would move their registration from the Netherlands to Germany. In 2017, Team Sunweb won its first Grand Tour: the 2017 Giro d'Italia with Tom Dumoulin. At the 2017 Tour de France, the team won four stages and two major jerseys: Warren Barguil won the Mountains classification and Combativity Award while reaching 10th overall, and Michael Matthews won the Points classification.

It is found in shallow tropical and subtropical waters in coastal and estuarine parts of the Atlantic. Reports from elsewhere are now believed to be misidentifications of other species of sawfish. It is a critically endangered species that has disappeared from much of its historical range. Distribution and habitat The smalltooth sawfish is found in tropical and subtropical parts of the Atlantic, including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. Its original range was the smallest of the sawfish species, covering about . In the west it once ranged from the United States to Uruguay and in the east from Senegal to Angola. Today it has disappeared from much of its historical range. There are old reports from the Mediterranean Sea, but this likely involved vagrants. Smalltooth sawfish are mostly found in coastal marine and estuarine brackish waters. It prefers water less than deep, but adults are occasionally seen offshore at depths of up to . During periods with increased salinity, juveniles have been seen far up rivers. This species is mostly found in places with soft bottoms such as mud or sand, but may also occur over hard rocky bottoms or at coral reefs. They are often found in areas with mangrove or seagrass. The lower water temperature limit is . Appearance Smalltooth sawfish at the Aquarium of the Americas The smalltooth sawfish reputedly reaches a total length of up to , but this is likely an exaggeration and the largest confirmed size is . It weighs up to . Its upperparts are brownish-gray, gray, bluish-gray or blackish, and the underparts are whitish. Unlike the largetooth sawfish (P. pristis), the only other sawfish in the Atlantic, the smalltooth sawfish has a leading edge of the dorsal fin that is placed roughly above the leading edge of the pelvic fins (when the sawfish is seen from above or the side), relatively short pectoral fins and lack of a distinct lower lobe to the tail (lower lobe very small or absent). It can be separated from the more similar dwarf sawfish (P. clavata) and green sawfish (P. zijsron) by the distribution (both are only found in the Indo-Pacific) and the dorsal fin (its leading edge is placed slightly or clearly behind the leading edge of the pelvic fins in the dwarf and green sawfish). The smalltooth sawfish has a relatively narrow rostrum (\\"saw\\") with 20‚Äì32 teeth on each side. Function of the saw Pristis pectinata, X-ray image For feeding For many years, rarity of seeing a sawfish in the wild prevented scientists from collecting conclusive evidence about the use of their distinctive rostrum. This led them to falsely assume that the sawfish, like many other marine vertebrates with a \\"beak,\\" or an elongated rostrum, follow the rule that the appendage is used to either sense prey or capture prey, but never both. There are no other highly studied marine animals with similar rostral characteristics that have shown that the rostrum is used for both of these feeding techniques. Recent studies have demonstrated, however, that the sawfish utilize their rostrum to both sense and manipulate prey. A sawfish's saw is made up of thousands of sensory organs that allow them to detect and monitor the movements of other organisms by measuring the electric fields they emit. The sensory organs, also called ampullary pores, are packed most densely on the dorsal side of its beak. This allows the fish to create an image of the three-dimensional area above it, even in waters of low-visibility. This provides support for the bottom- dwelling behavior of sawfish. Utilizing their saw as an extended sensing device, sawfish are able to \\"view\\" their entire surroundings by maintaining a position low to the sea floor. Sawfish uncover sand dwelling crustaceans and mollusks, two common prey types, by using their unique anatomical structure as a tool for digging and grubbing about in sand or mud. The sawfish churn up the sea bottom with their exaggerated rostrum to uncover these hidden food sources. It is believed that the elongated rostrum first evolved for its use in prey immobilization. Smalltooth sawfish have been observed to approach large shoals of fish while striking their saw rapidly from side to side. Due to the high density of small fish in a shoal, there is a high probability that the sawfish will hit, stab, stun, or kill several prey during one shoal attack. Vertebrate biologist Barbara Wueringer, of the University of Queensland, demonstrated that sawfish use their extended rostrum to detect and manipulate prey. She observed the animals' reaction to food already at the bottom of the tank, food falling from the water's surface, and introduced electric dipoles. When the sawfish came across scraps of fish resting on the bottom of the tank, it used its rostrum to pin the \\"prey\\" down as it swam over and engulfed it. When food was identified as it fell through the water, the sawfish would approach its \\"prey\\" from the side and swiftly strike to impale the victim with the teeth of its saw. Both of these cases support the respective digging and attacking behaviors expected from feeding sawfish in the wild. In order to show that sawfish use their beak to sense their surroundings, Wueringer placed electric dipoles throughout the tank to simulate the electrical signals that surround moving prey. Just as the sawfish displayed different aggressive behaviors towards the \\"prey,\\" they also responded differently based on the electrical signals they received by either avoiding or approaching the signal source. With this evidence, the sawfish is now regarded as the only jawed fish to use its rostrum for both prey detection and manipulation. For defense The many teeth of a sawfish's saw are not actually teeth at all, but rather special types of scales known a dermal denticles. These protruding weapons, combined with the animal's ability to strike from side to side with great force, provide it with a powerful and efficient defense mechanism. Although the saw is mainly used for feeding purposes, observations of sawfish in captivity show that they may also be used for self-defense. When sharks or other marine creatures threaten them, they retaliate with three swift blows to the instigator's dorsum. Sawfish are not considered harmful to humans unless they are threatened. Reproductive behavior A juvenile smalltooth sawfish being released The reproductive behavior of smalltooth sawfish has not been well studied, despite their classification as a critically endangered species. Nevertheless, much can be inferred based on information known about the reproductive behavior of other elasmobranchs. Observations show that smalltooth sawfish may participate in precopulatory behavior in captivity. Much of this activity involves the biting of pectoral fins known as \\"courtship biting.\\" There is sexual dimorphism in the teeth of smalltooth sawfish, with males presenting a higher mean value for both left and right rostral tooth counts. The electrosensory system is believed to be used in the courtship behavior of sawfish and other elasmobranchs. Reproductively active males use the sensory organs in their saw to locate females and vice versa. Once a mate has been selected, several copulations occur during which the male inserts his claspers, which are paired intromittent organs, into the female's vagina. The claspers contain subdermal siphon sacs that provide the propulsive power for sperm transfer. It is also possible that the siphon sacs assist with sawfish sperm competition by washing away rival sperm from the female's vagina before copulations. Smalltooth sawfish have recently been observed, for the first time, to reproduce parthenogenetically in the wild. About 3 percent of the sawfish living in a Florida estuary are the result of parthenogenesis. The research team speculates that since smalltooth sawfish are so rare, females might sometimes fail to find a male during the mating season, inducing the parthenogenetic process. Elasmobranchs are ovoviparous, have relatively long gestation periods, and internal fertilization. The sawfish eggs hatch in the uterus and the young continue to grow without a placental connection to the mother. The fetal sawfish receives nourishment from a yolk sac and absorbs all the nutrients it can from the yolk before it is born. Litters have been reported of up to 20 pups and the reproductive cycle is believed to be every two years. After sex, mating pairs separate without forming a pair bond and each continues polygamous matings. Conservation status Sign for the protection of smalltooth sawfish in Florida, USA A smalltooth sawfish briefly captured for tagging as part of a conservation project Smalltooth sawfish are extremely vulnerable to overexploitation because of their propensity for entanglement in nets, their restricted habitat, and low rate of population growth. The species is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.. The Pristis pectinata species is critically endangered mainly because of the fishing pressure business which feeds into the shark-fin industry.Faria, Vicente V., et al. ‚ÄúSpecies Delineation and Global Population Structure of Critically Endangered Sawfishes (Pristidae).‚Äù Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, vol. 167, no. 1, 2012, pp. 136‚Äì164., doi:10.1111/j.1096-3642.2012.00872.x. Historically it was found in 47 countries, but it has been extirpated from 16 and possibly extirpated from another 25, leaving only 6 countries where it certainly still survives. In terms of area this means that it certainly survives in only 19% of its historical range. It is the only sawfish that certainly still survives in the United States (the largetooth sawfish, P. pristis, has likely been extirpated from this country), and it has been listed by the National Marine Fisheries Service as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 2003.NOAA Fisheries (2 January 2015). Smalltooth Sawfish (Pristis pectinata). Endangered Species Act. Retrieved 8 June 2015. It is estimated that the smalltooth sawfish population in the United States now equals less than 5% of the historical population in this country. In the United States it once occurred from Texas to New York (northern range as summer visitors), but today it is essentially limited to Florida. In the Everglades region of Florida the population is now stable and possibly slowly rising. Other countries where it certainly survives are the Bahamas, Cuba, Belize, Honduras and Sierra Leone, but whether it survives in the Western Gulf of Mexico or off the Atlantic coast of South America is unclear. The species is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Atlantis Paradise Island became the world's first aquarium to breed sawfish when four pups were born there in 2012. Small numbers are maintained in public aquariums in North America with studbooks listing 12 individuals (5 males, 7 females) in 2014. The only kept elsewhere are at a public aquarium in Colombia. It is the only species of sawfish that has been bred in captivity.

His father, Percy Lancaster, was a banker and a talented amateur gardener, who went on to become the Secretary of the Agri Horticultural Society of India in Calcutta, India. Career In 1902 Sydney Percy-Lancaster was apprenticed to the Agri-Horticultural Society and on his father's death in 1904, he was appointed an Assistant. He continued collecting and hybridising the Alipore Canna Collection, started by his father in 1892, they were the most popular garden plant in India at that time. It was said that every Canna cultivar growing in India had been derived from the Agri- Horticultural Society, where the collection was domiciled. In 1910, he became an Assistant Secretary and then the Secretary in 1914 until his retirement in October 1953, after a long service to the society and to Indian horticulture as a whole. Unlike most of his countrymen who packed up and return to England in 1947, upon the independence of India from the British Empire, Percy- Lancaster stayed on and made India his home. In 1947, he was the last Englishman to hold the post of Superintendent of Horticultural Operations, Government of India. In November 1953, he joined the National Botanic Gardens at Lucknow as Senior Technical Assistant because of his early life's association with Sikandar Bagh. He wished to spend the remainder of his life at Lucknow where the gardening traditions of his family began. He served the National Botanic Gardens of India until January 1959 when his son, Alick Percy-Lancaster pressed him to join the family at Salisbury (Southern Rhodesia), taking with him the family's Alipore Canna Collection for enjoyment in retirement. In November 1961, after his wife's death in 1960 and Alick's death in 1961, he returned to the National Botanic Gardens, where he spent the last of his years. Horticultural achievements During the work of about half a century in Calcutta, Mr. Percy-Lancaster introduced many new plants from abroad. He had a particular fascination for hybridization work and many plants found in Indian gardens owe their origin to him. A complete list of the hybrids is catalogued in the records of the Agri-Horticultural Society of India. He watched for worthwhile spontaneous mutations. He discovered many interesting mutants in: Acalypha, Canna, Codiaceum, Hibiscus, Malvaniscus, Panax and Sansevieria. In the National Botanic Gardens at Lucknow, he had an opportunity to utilize his knowledge in horticulture for public use. He helped to beautify many parts of the garden, in particular the conservatory with which he has an association as a boy. Hybridization Image:PercyLancaster 1727.JPG|Canna (Crozy Group) 'Percy Lancaster', Sydney Percy-Lancaster Percy- Lancaster had particular fascination for hybridization, and many plants found in Indian gardens originated from his work. His zoned Cosmos called 'Alipore Beauty' renamed 'RatHance' by the famous American seed's man, Bodgers, has been distributed all over the world. There are many Cosmos variations in cultivation, the choicest being the 'Bicolor White Crest'. He has also developed a beautiful pyramidal headed Hollyhock from a presumed cross between Alcea rosea and Malva sylvestris. Repeating his father's cross between Cooperia and Zephyranthes, he obtained a large number of colour variations in the ensuing hybrids named Cooperanthes. These hybrids are far superior in colour and performance to either parent. Cooperanthes has now been merged in Zephyranthes proper. He made a number of crosses at varietal and specific level in genera such as, Amaryllis, Barleria, Bauhinia, Begonia, Bougainvillea, Canna, Cassia, Chrysanthemum, Crinum, Hedychium, Hemerocallis, Hibiscus, Ixora, Lagerstroemia, Petunia, Poinsettia, Rosa, and Tecoma. Recognitions In recognition of the service rendered by the Agri- Horticultural Society, King George V permitted to prefix the word 'Royal' to the society's name, but following India's Independence, the Society dropped the royal distinction to reflect that independence. * In recognition of his success with Cooperanthes, Prof. Hamilton P. Traub (Plant Life Society, USA) named in 1954 a horticultural genus √óSydneya after him. This genus is based on the hybrids from the cross Zephyranthes √ó Habranthus. * In horticulture several 'species' and 'varieties' arising from hybridisation or as mutations are named after Lancaster and his family. To quote a few of the important ones: ** Acalypha lancasteri ** Antignon lancasteri ** Bougainvillea 'Alick Lancaster' ** B. 'Enid Lancaster' ** B. 'Mrs Lancaster' ** Cassia √ólancasteri ** Crinum lancasteri ** Hibiscus 'Percy-Lancaster' ** Panax lancasteri ** Sansevieria tri-elfasciata lancasteri ** Gephyranthes lancasteri * In 1939 he was awarded the Herbert Medal, which is the highest honour the International Bulb Society can bestow upon a person for meritorius achievement in advancing the knowledge of bulbous plants. Published works He authored and published several books, * 1929, In an Indian Garden * Everyday Gardening in India * For over 60 years he wrote several hundred articles on various aspects of gardening and garden plants as a Gardening Correspondent to several Indian newspapers, monthly magazines, and foreign journals. * He edited the material of the Royal Agri-Horticultural Society from 1904 to 1920, when this publication ceased.

He served in the Mediterranean, Pacific and Home Fleets. He is most famous for his role as leader of a naval expedition to Lake Tanganyika in 1915, where he commanded a small flotilla which defeated a superior German force during the Battle for Lake Tanganyika. Early life Geoffrey Basil Spicer Simson was born in Hobart, Tasmania, on 15 January 1876, one of five children. His father, Frederick Simson, had been in the merchant navy and was a dealer in gold sovereigns in India who eventually settled in Le Havre, France, at the age of thirty-one. There he met eighteen-year-old Dora Spicer, daughter of a visiting English clergyman, William Webb Spicer, and on marrying changed his name to Spicer-Simson. In 1874 the Spicer-Simsons moved to Tasmania, where they had some family, and ran a sheep farm for five years. Though Geoffrey was born in Tasmania, he soon moved to France at his mother's wishes. He and his siblings were sent to schools in England. The eldest, Theodore Spicer-Simson, became a world-famous medallion portrait artist,Paice, Edward \\"World War I The African Front\\". Pegasus Books, 2008, p.100 moving between France and the United States. His youngest brother, Noel, eventually joined the British Army. Geoffrey entered the Royal Navy in 1889 at the age of fourteen. He was appointed a midshipman on 14 June 1892. His naval career got off to a good start as he was advanced seven months in seniority for results that allowed him to pass out of Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. However, he lost a month of this additional seniority for leaving his ship despite having his leave stopped in 1894. He was promoted to acting sub-lieutenant on 19 February 1896, and he was confirmed in the rank of sub-lieutenant on 20 January 1897, back-dated to the original acting promotion. He was promoted to lieutenant on 30 September 1898. From that time he began to specialise in surveying, and served on the North Borneo Boundary Commission in 1901, helping in the construction of several maps and the definition of boundaries. His most important position was in command of a destroyer, which he permitted to collide with a liberty boat, resulting in his being posted to dockside watch- keeping jobs.Military History, December 2001, \\"Naval Struggle in Darkest Africa\\" He then went to China and made the first triangulated survey of the Yangtze River from 1905‚Äì1908. After China, he was posted to Africa, and from 1911-1914 was in command of a survey ship on the Gambia river. In 1902 he married Amy Elizabeth, daughter of Edmund and Phoebe Baynes-Reed of Victoria, British Columbia. He returned to Britain from Africa just a few days before Britain officially joined World War I on 4 August 1914. He had a brief tour on a contraband control vessel, but two weeks after taking command one of his gunboats was torpedoed in broad daylight.Military History, December 2001, \\"Naval Struggle in Darkest Africa He was then given an office job in the Admiralty in the department in charge of transferring Merchant sailors to the War Navy. \\"Simson's Circus\\" In April 1915, the Admiralty learned that Germany was preparing to launch Graf von G√∂tzen onto Lake Tanganyika. G√∂tzen was much larger than any other vessel on the lake and would give German forces supremacy across its entire length. With control of the Lake, Germany could easily move troops and materials to support its efforts in and around German East Africa. To counter G√∂tzen, two small, fast and well-armed motorboats would be sent from Britain. Spicer-Simson had experience in Africa and was fluent in French and German, so the Admiralty overlooked his undistinguished record and selected him to lead the expedition. His commanders saw nothing to lose in sending him to what was considered a sideshow to the events in Europe. The two motorboats, which Spicer-Simson named and (the Admiralty having rejected his initial proposal that they be named Cat and Dog), were loaded aboard on 15 June along with the expedition's equipment and supplies. Two special trailers and cradles were also brought along to allow them to be transported by rail or overland. The first leg of Mimi and Toutou's journey was completed after 17 days at sea and their arrival at the Cape of Good Hope. From Cape Town, they and the men of the expedition traveled north by railway through Bulawayo to Elisabethville, where they arrived on 26 July. After traveling to the railhead at Fungurume, they were detrained and dragged through the bush by teams of oxen and steam tractors to the beginnings of the railway from Sankisia to Bukama. At Bukama, the boats and stores were unloaded and prepared for a voyage down the Lualaba River. The Lualaba was running low, and Mimi and Toutou had to be paddled upstream, once running aground fourteen times in just . They spent seventeen days on the Lualaba before reaching Kabalo. From there, the last of the journey to Lake Tanganyika was completed by railway. The expedition, known by that point as \\"Simson's Circus\\" for all it had been through, arrived at the Belgian lake port of Lukuga on 24 October 1915.Paice, Edward \\"World War I The African Front\\".

Kingani later HMS Fifi Shortly after arriving on Lake Tanganyika, Spicer-Simson relocated his base just south of Lukuga at Kalemie, where he had been building a port better protected from the lake's storms. Mimi and Toutou were assembled and launched just before Christmas 1915. Early in the morning of 26 December, the armed German tug Kingani was spotted offshore. Spicer-Simson took Mimi and Toutou out on the lake and captured Kingani after a brief firefight that killed her commander and four of her crew. Kingani was rechristened and brought under Spicer-Simson's command. As a result, on 3 January 1916, he was promoted from lieutenant commander to commander; the promotion backdated to 26 December 1915, the date of the capture. On 9 February 1916, the German lake boat (sister vessel of the larger on Lake Nyasa) appeared off Lukuga to investigate the disappearance of Kingani. After a chase, Spicer-Simson's flotilla sank Hedwig von Wissmann.Paice, Edward \\"World War I The African Front\\". Pegasus Books, 2008, p.149-150 The capture of Kingani and the sinking of Hedwig von Wissmann greatly weakened German naval power on Lake Tanganyika. However, a survivor of Kingani reported that G√∂tzen had recently been armed with a gun from the recently scuttled German cruiser . The addition of a K√∂nigsberg gun gave the G√∂tzen the ability to effectively fire on Mimi, Toutou, and Fifi from well beyond their range. Though G√∂tzen could not be directly attacked, German supremacy on Lake Tanganyika had been broken. For the action against Hedwig von Wissmann, Spicer-Simson was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 1 May 1916. Over the course of the expedition, three of his officers were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, and twelve of his men were awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.Paice, Edward \\"World War I The African Front\\". Pegasus Books, 2008, p.234 After its initial success, Spicer-Simson's command ended in controversy. He refused to send his ships to aid the British Colonial and Belgian Army force in the capture of Mpulungu in present-day Zambia. After falling ill and retreating to his private quarters, he was sent to England for medical and mental recovery. He was also appointed a Commander of the Belgian Order of the Crown. Eccentricities Geoffrey Spicer-Simson (extreme left wearing skirt) just after the German ship Kingani had been captured. Spicer- Simson was known for his idiosyncrasies. In Britain he had originally suggested that Mimi and Toutou be named Cat and Dog, but the names were rejected by the Admiralty. After Mimi and Toutou were accepted as alternatives, he explained that these meant \\"Miaow\\" and \\"Bow-wow\\" in French. While in command on Lake Tanganyika, Spicer-Simson often wore a khaki drill skirt, and he insisted that an Admiral's flag be flown outside his hut. He smoked monogrammed cigarettes and had a number of \\"macabre tattoos\\" acquired during his time in Asia.Paice, Edward \\"World War I The African Front\\". Pegasus Books, 2008, p.147 Later life He was later Assistant Director of Naval Intelligence, with the rank of acting captain, and a naval delegate and French translator at the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919. After acting as secretary and official interpreter to the First International Hydrographic Conference, London, 1919 he was elected the first secretary-general of The International Hydrographic Bureau. He served in that role from 1921 to 1937. His later years were spent in British Columbia. He gave a series of lectures on his command in Lake Tanganyika and helped write a National Geographic article on his transportation of the two boats through the jungles of the Congo. He died on 29 January 1947.

Some species of this genus are used as ornamental plants, in particular L. biloba, L. formosa and L. macrantha.Lechenaultia species are diverse in form: they may be woody or herbaceous, upright or prostrate with leaves flat, needle-like or virtually absent in mature plants. The genus differs from other Goodeniaceae in the structure of the stigma and the fertilization mechanism. They are found in Australia (mostly in the SW corner) and New Guinea (one species). They are named for the botanist attached to the Baudin expedition to Australia, Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour. Robert Brown had met Leschenault and assumed to spell his name the French way without the 's'. However, Bentham introduced the German spelling with the 's' and subsequent writers followed suit as the name was written Leschenaultia, but reverted to Robert Brown's spelling in the 1950s. The common names of the species maintains the correction, as with the section name. The type species is Lechenaultia formosa.

Together with operations support systems (OSS), they are used to support various end-to-end telecommunication services (e.g., telephone services). BSS and OSS have their own data and service responsibilities. The two systems together are abbreviated in various ways, such as OSS/BSS, BSS/OSS, B/OSS, BSSOSS, OSSBSS or BOSS. Some commentators and analysts take a network-up approach to these systems (hence OSS/BSS) and others take a business-down approach (hence BSS/OSS). The initialism BSS is also used in a singular form to refer to all the business support systems viewed as a whole system.  Role  BSS deals with the taking of orders, payment issues, revenues, etc. It supports four processes: product management, order management, revenue management and customer management. Product management Product management supports product development, the sales and management of products, offers and bundles to businesses and mass-market customers. Product management regularly includes offering cross-product discounts, appropriate pricing and managing how products relate to one another. Customer management Service providers require a single view of the customer and regularly need to support complex hierarchies across customer-facing applications (customer relationship management). Customer management also covers requirements for partner management and 24x7 web-based customer self-service. Customer management can also be thought of as full- fledged customer relationship management systems implemented to help customer care agents handle the customers in a better and more informed manner. Revenue management Revenue management focuses on billing, charging and settlement. It includes billing for consumer, enterprise and wholesale services, including interconnect and roaming. This includes billing mediation systems, bill generation and bill presentment. Revenue management may also include fraud management and revenue assurance. Order management Order management encompasses four areas: :* Order decomposition details the rules for decomposing a Sales Order into multiple work orders or service orders. For example, a Triple Play Telco Sales order with three services - land line, Internet and wireless - can be broken down into three sub-orders, one for each line of business. Each of the sub-orders will be fulfilled separately in its own provisioning systems. However, there may be dependencies in each sub- order; e.g., an Internet sub-order can be fulfilled only when the land line has been successfully installed, provisioned and activated at the customer premises. :* Order orchestration is an objective application which is used by telcos to precisely manage, process and handle their customer orders across a multiple fulfillment and order capture network. It helps in the data aggregation transversely from assorted order capture and order fulfillment systems and delivers an all-inclusive platform for customer order management. It has been in vast application in the recent times, due to its advanced and precise order information efficiency and low order fulfillment costs, thus aggregating lesser manual process, and faster output. Its radical exception response based functioning and proactive monitoring enables it to centralize order data in accurate manner with ease. :* Order fallout, also known as Order Failure, refers to the condition when an order fails during processing. The order fallout occurs due to multiple scenarios; such as downstream system failure, which relates to an internal non-data related error; or when the system receives incorrect or missing data, which subsequently fails the order. Other Order Fallout conditions include database failure or error pertaining to network connectivity. Validation or recognition of order also occurs, in which the system marks the received corrupted order from external system as failed. Another Order Fallout condition refers to the state of run-time failure, wherein an order is inhibited from getting processed due to non-determined reliance. Order Fallout Management helps in complete resolve of order failures through detection, notification and recovery process, helping the order to process sustain-ably and precisely. :* Order status management Order management as a beginning of assurance is normally associated with OSS, although BSS is often the business driver for fulfillment management and order provisioning.

Born to a devout Muslim family of a mixed-race background in Jambi, she grew up in Yogyakarta, aspiring to be an architect or psychologist. This changed after she was discovered by Teguh Karya for his 1973 movie Cinta Pertama, a role which garnered her a Citra Award for Best Actress and convinced her to follow a career in acting. Since then, she has starred in numerous films, including 1977's Badai Pasti Berlalu and 1988's Tjoet Nja' Dhien; she also had a minor role in the 2010 Hollywood movie Eat Pray Love. , she has won six Citra Awards, received a lifetime achievement award from the Cinemanila International Film Festival, and served as a member of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival Hakim began branching out from acting in 1998, beginning with roles as producer of Daun di Atas Bantal and Pasir Berbisik and eventually spreading to documentary film-making and an activist for education and autism. Beginning in 2008, she has served as Indonesia's goodwill ambassador to UNESCO, focusing on educational issues. Biography Hakim was born in Kuala Tungkal, Jambi on 25 December 1956, but grew up in Yogyakarta. She is of mixed descent, with her relatives coming from Padang, Aceh, Banten, Pekalongan, Madiun, and the Middle East; this caused her to question her identity as a child and teenager. Despite being devout Muslims, her parents named her Christine and Natalia because she was born on Christmas Day. Originally, Hakim did not intend to be an actress, but an architect or psychologist. However, she was cast in Teguh Karya's 1973 film Cinta Pertama after he saw pictures of her modelling in a magazine; despite only modelling to help her friend and not wanting to act, she was unable to decline Karya's request for fear of being impolite to such a \\"warm and friendly\\" person. She later described Karya as having \\"reeled [her] in, slowly, slowly, like a fisherma,\\" and considered leaving acting after wrapping up filming. Her work in Cinta Pertama garnered her a Citra Award for Best Actress, which convinced her to continue acting. Karya later told her that he had fought with his producer over her casting; the producer expressed concern that Hakim was \\"too thin and had no chest,\\" to which Karya replied \\"are we selling a film or are we selling breasts?\\" The following year, Hakim starred in another Karya-directed film, Kawin Lari (Elope). The experience gave her a greater understanding of acting, causing her to \\"see life from a different perspective in studying [her] character.\\" It was followed by a role in 1976's Sesuatu yang Indah (Something Beautiful), directed by Wim Umboh. Sesuatu yang Indah was the first film in which Hakim used her own voice; her voice had been dubbed by Titi Qadarsih in previous movies; Hakim's own voice had been considered \\"too heavy.\\" The next year, she starred in Badai Pasti Berlalu, appearing on the poster and the cover of the soundtrack album. Hakim signing autographs at the 1982 Indonesian Film Festival Hakim presented 14 Indonesian films at the Nantes Three Continents Festival in November 1983; she had acted in half of them. Two years later she became an observer at the Cannes Film Festival, striking up a working relationship with Pierre Risient, who later assisted her in bringing her films to Cannes. One of these was Eros Djarot's 1988 film Tjoet Nja' Dhien, in which Hakim was cast as Acehnese guerilla leader Cut Nyak Dhien. It won the 1989 Cannes Film Festival award for Best International Film, being screened in Le Semaine de Critique. Hakim later described the role as a \\"huge honour\\" and \\"very challenging\\"; she has credited the role for answering her questions on her identity. The film later became Indonesia's submission to the 62nd Academy Awards for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Hakim screened her first work as a producer, Daun di Atas Bantal (Leaf on a Pillow) during Un Certain Regard at Cannes ten years later. When producing the film, she chose young director Garin Nugroho, whom she perceived to be highly talented; she also took the leading role. During production, she made a mistake that required the reshooting of all footage. In an attempt to cut expenses, she had saved all cans of exposed film to send to the developing lab at once; the lab then notified her that a technical fault with the camera had rendered all of it unusable and that the problem could have been detected earlier had she sent each can as it was filmed. Hakim in 2008 Another production, 2001's Pasir Berbisik (Whispering Sands), went more smoothly. The film, which Hakim co-produced and played the leading role, was screened at the Deauville Asian Film Festival. The following year she was appointed to the jury of the Cannes Film Festival, along with Michelle Yeoh. In 2005 she received a special tribute during the opening ceremony of the 7th Deauville Asian Film Festival. In 2003, Hakim began work with RCTI and Metro TV on the TV show Untukmu Guru (For You, Teacher). Five years later, Hakim was selected Indonesia's voluntary goodwill ambassador for UNESCO; she has used the position to promote education, push for education reforms in Indonesia, and promote disaster relief programs in South-East Asia. Hakim's first Hollywood experience came in 2010, Hakim played Wayan, a Balinese jamu seller, alongside Julia Roberts in Eat Pray Love. Arriving in Bali three days before shooting, she found herself rushed to read the script, be fitted, and rid herself of her green hair. She met with the person her character was based on to prepare for her role. That same year, Hakim accepted a FIAPF Award for her \\"outstanding achievements\\"; she compared the award to Viagra, saying that it \\"make[s] [her] stronger to satisfy [audiences]\\". Hakim is also a documentary filmmaker. She has made a documentary on the Indonesian UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and in 2011 produced a documentary on autism to \\"educate the public\\" that was released to coincide with World Autism Awareness Day. , she is producing a documentary on the Dayak people of Kalimantan. She is considering making a fiction film based on their culture. Activism Beginning in the early 2000s, Hakim became an activist, with a focus on education. After the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, she went on numerous humanitarian trips to Aceh. She later founded the Christine Hakim feature, a foundation to promote public education about autism. She has urged the government to eliminate misconceptions regarding autism, calling the refusal to accept autistic students in public schools \\"a violation of human rights\\". Personal life In 2000, Hakim married Dutchman Jeroen Lezer, a film producer, writer and actor. They live in Cibubur, East Jakarta, with Hakim's mother and adopted daughter Shena; Bruce Emond of The Jakarta Post describes her home as being \\"like a lush secret garden amid the creeping suburbia\\". Hakim generally avoids discussing her personal life with the press and is unwilling to discuss topics that are not of public interest. In 1992 she said that \\"90 percent of the journalists here aren't interested in [her] films, they just want to know about [her] private life.\\" Legacy Hakim has been described as the \\"grande dame of Indonesian cinema\\" as well as \\"Indonesia‚Äôs foremost actress\\". She has also received a lifetime achievement award at the Cinemanila International Film Festival. Hakim has received several awards for her films: # Citra Award for Best Leading Actress, for Cinta Pertama (1973) # Citra Award for Best Leading Actress, for Sesuatu Yang Indah (1976) # Citra Award for Best Leading Actress, for Pengemis dan Tukang Becak (1978) # Citra Award for Best Leading Actress, for Di Balik Kelambu (1982) # Citra Award for Best Leading Actress, for Kerikil-Kerikil Tajam (1984) # Citra Award for Best Leading Actress, for Tjoet Nja' Dhien (1988) # Best Actress at Asia Pacific International Film Festival Hakim has refused a position on the Asia Pacific Screen Awards numerous times, due to being unable to reconcile her schedule with the awards.

Its origin appears to be a syncretization of reverence for an 11th-century Sufi, Dada Hayath (Abdul Azeez Macci); for the 17th-century Sufi Baba Budan, said to have brought coffee to India; and for Dattatreya, an incarnation of Shiva (or of Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu). It has been controversial due to political and religious tension over its status as a syncretic shrine. Incarnation of Dattatreya The available history says that one Dada Hayath, his real name being Abdul Azeez Macci, considered to be a direct disciple of Muhammad, was sent to India in the 11th century from Saudi Arabia to spread the message of Islam and peace, in true tradition of Sufism. In fact, Dada Hayath‚Äôs religious preaching did not target Hindus as a religious community. Rather, it targeted local landlords (palegars in local parlance) who were highly oppressive against the common masses. History says that the palegars did not tolerate the intervention of Dada Hayath into their domain, as his mission was about to affect their stronghold and dominance. On many occasions, they tried to eliminate him but failed. According to some accounts, Dattatreya is a later phenomenon and it could develop a syncretic culture by synthesizing Shaivite, Vaishnavite and Sufi culture together. The people of the region believe that Bababudan is an incarnation of Dattatreya. Having a long history in Karnataka, the Dattatreya tradition ‚Äì a part of Awadhut tradition, upholds the idea of a formless god, and condemns caste and sacrificial rituals performed by Brahmin priests. Also a long tradition of the Dattatreya and Sufism going hand in hand can be witnessed by the fact that Baba Budan and Dattatreya have become interchangeable. Cave Dattatreya, for whom the shrine was once named, is considered by some Hindus to be God who is an incarnation of the Divine Trinity Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwara (Shiva), in the form of an ascetic in the discipline of Avadhuutha (God intoxicated monk). A Sufi saint known as Baba Budan is believed to have later been in the same cave for some time. Some Hindus have making a claim over the shrine, which is controlled by Muslims. This has led to tension between the two communities. This has become the place of communal riots on the occasion of Urs (the death anniversary of the Sufi saint) and the occasion of Datta Jayanti in the month of December. Hindu Shobha Yatras have been organized at the same time give rise to the communal conflict. The Supreme Court of India has ruled that only religious ceremonies which were performed prior to 1975 be permitted. As Shobha Yatra was not performed prior to 1975, police have in some years denied buses permission to approach Bababudangiri on Datta Jayanti. Baba Budan Giri represents a unique syncretic culture of Hindus and Muslims where both offer prayers in a cave- like structure. It derived its name from a Muslim Sufi saint who was in turn the disciple of another Sufi saint called Dada Hayath Meer Khalandar. Dada was one of the earliest to arrive in India (1005 AD) from west Asia to preach Sufism in India. When he came to south India, he selected the present cave for his meditation. In fact, the Puranic name of the hills was Chandra Dona, as it look like a crescent or a horse shoe. The place Dada selected was equally believed to be the seat of Dattaraya Swamy, who is said to be the last avatar of Vishnu; he is believed to have vanished from one of the caves to Kashi to be reincarnated in future. Another belief is that Dada Khalandar and Dattaraya Swamy are one and the same person. The story goes that after clearing the area Dada decided to settle down for meditation. ‚ÄúHe needed water to perform ‚Äòwazu‚Äô for his prayers. He was a stranger in this area and did not know where water was available. He prayed and started digging the ground in front of the place he had selected as his seat of meditation and found a perennial spring. He thanked god and spent the night in prayers and meditation. Early in the next morning a Brahmin and a jangama entered the cave, as per their custom, for worship. Seeing Dada absorbed in meditation they thought that he was the incarnation of Sri Dattaraya Swamy‚Äù.Sajjade Nishin, Hazrat Dada Hayat Meer Khalandar, 1979:10. Likewise the Hindus, Muslims also believe that Dada had disappeared from one of the caves to Mecca and Madina and is alive and will in due course appear before the disciples. After him, Baba Budan, one of his closest disciples who introduced coffee to this hilly region, brought from Mocha in the west Asia, carried his mission further. Baba Budan, whose history is usually traced to Bagdhad, reached Chickmagalur via Malabar and Mangalore. Baba Budan was killed in an ambush near the present cave and was buried along with two other Sufis inside the cave. He is also called Syed Meran Baba and also Jan-e-Pak Shaheed. The institution of custodian of the site although it is traced to Dada, began to centralise in a single family after the death of another Sufi saint, Syed Shah Jamaluddin. \\"For reasons not known Jamaluddin also became famous as Baba Budan during his lifetime.\\"Sajjade Nishin, Hazrat Dada Hayat Meer Khalandar, 1979:43. The custodian of the site/shrine is called Sajjade Nishin. There are a few characteristics attached to him: ‚Äúonly Sayyads can become swami, either Husseins or Khadris, the descendents of Hussen or Hassan, sons of Ali. After initiation, a Khadri becomes Shah Khadri, and after apostolic seat, he is styled Sajjade. No unmarried man can become Sajjade‚Äù Stories A large number of stories have been constructed around Dada‚Äôs dargah. These stories pertain to the spiritual and healing powers including the power to bestow children, relief to physical disorders, property disputes, etc. This is one of the reasons why the site has become famous. There are stories about how Dada protected a princess who later on came to be known as Sathi Samyukta by Hindus and Mama Jigni by the Muslims. Most important is the story about how the princely state of Mysore was bestowed with an heir to the throne by Dada, and how the maharaja would be able to break the stone laid before the cave. This is a typical story which has similarities with the stories surrounding the birth of Jahangir (with the blessings of Sufi saint Nazrath Shah Sali) and Tippu Sultan (with the blessings of Tippu Aulia of Arcot). This story is important for two obvious reasons: It provided legitimacy to the claims of spiritual power of the Sufi saints, secondly, it made the state liberal, moderate and secular: Sri Krishna Raja Wadiyar had no son in his family for a long time. He was worried much about it. Once, coming out of the dargah, he saw the stone slab where devotees broke the offered coconuts. Struck with an idea, he made a vow quietly that he would split that stone with coconuts on the birth of a son in the family. Soon after that his brother had a son, Sri Jaya Chamaraja Wadiyar. He came to the dargah with cart-loads of coconuts to fulfil his vow and began breaking coconuts one by one. The stone remained solid even after many cart-loads were finished. He was in a dilemma. He had to fulfil his vow but it appeared impossible. At long last he realised that in his anxiety he made a vow which was apparently impossible. He explained the situation and requested Hazrath Peer to take him to Dada and pray for his pardon and suggest a solution. After Hazrath Peer recited the Fateha, Maharaja expressed his gratitude to Dada, repented his folly, sought out of the dargah and following the instructions, he broke the coconut on the stone slab. To his pleasant surprise the stone developed a crack‚Äù References Category:Sufi shrines in India ","title":"Bababudangiri shrine"},{"id":"7106657","text":"Australasian Ornithological Conference is a biennial meeting of ornithologists that focuses on the Australasian region and Antarctica.

A third set of stories is awaiting release. Horowitz Horror was first published in 1999 and contained nine short stories. The stories in Horowitz Horror are written in a mixture of first- and third-person narrative. Out of the nine stories, two (\\"Light Moves\\" and \\"The Man with the Yellow Face\\") are conveyed from the viewpoint of the leading character. Synopsis *Bath Night ‚Äì A newly installed bath harbours the spirit of a Victorian era axe-murderer. The family's daughter, Isabel, has suspicions about the bath even before discovering this, and refuses to use it, eventually deciding to destroy it. Her parents catch her in the act and she is sent to an asylum. At the end of the story, the father decides to go on a killing spree whilst in the bath. *Killer Camera ‚Äì A boy buys a camera as a birthday present, unaware that it has been imbued with dark magic ‚Äì anything that is photographed is destroyed; he searches for his family, who have taken the camera with them on a trip to London. He manages to find them and is relieved to hear that they have not taken any pictures of each other ‚Äì until he is told that his brother took a picture of the London skyline. *Light Moves ‚Äì A computer formerly owned by now-deceased horse-racing journalist, Ethan Sly, has the power to give horse racing tips. A schoolboy is given the computer as a present, and ends up being forced by the local bully to give him the names of the winners. However, one of the names it gives ‚Äì \\"Light Moves\\" ‚Äì is the name of a company whose van runs over the bully. *The Night Bus ‚Äì On Halloween night, two brothers returning home from a party, go on an unexpected bus tour of London's cemeteries. *Harriet's Horrible Dream ‚Äì A rich girl's family no longer has enough money to support her and she has been sold to a restaurant owned by a family friend which serves human meat. Then she wakes up, realising that it was all a nightmare ‚Äì until she looks at her surroundings. *Scared ‚Äì A school bully gets his comeuppance while walking through the countryside. *A Career in Computer Games ‚Äì A boy who has recently left school with no qualifications, due to his obsession with computer games, thinks he has found the job of a lifetime testing an upcoming video game, but finds himself trapped in a brutally realistic world where countless men in black suits shoot at him. *The Man with the Yellow Face ‚Äì A boy gets his photo taken at a train station, in a sinister photo booth which produces pictures that foretell future events. The picture he gets shows a grown up with a hideously deformed yellow face. The train he boards crashes and injures him severely, leaving him with the same yellow face as the one in the photo. *The Monkey's Ear ‚Äì A family purchases a monkey's ear able to grant wishes. Although there is one catch ‚Äì it is partially deaf. So when the father shouts at his son to go to hell, they don't know where he has gone. More Horowitz Horror More Horowitz Horror was published as a sequel collection in 2000. The book is marketed as containing eight stories. However, the tales obviously written by Horowitz himself are supplemented by an allegedly unauthorised add-on, written satirically by a serial killer. As with its forerunner, More Horowitz Horror is not confined to third-person narrative. \\"The Hitchhiker\\" and \\"Twist Cottage\\" are written in first-person, while \\"Burnt\\" (renamed as Burned in the US release) is expressed as a series of diary entries. Meanwhile, \\"The Shortest Horror Story Ever Written\\" communicates directly with the reader through second-person narrative. Synopses *The Hitchhiker ‚Äì A family is on their way home from a day at the seaside when they unwittingly allow a psychopath, supposedly from the nearby asylum, into their car (A clue to his real identity is the false name ‚Äì \\"Mr. Rellik\\" ‚Äì he gives them, which spelt backwards is Killer). Only the son works out the truth, but his parents do not believe him. He pushes the hitchhiker out of the car and he is killed. It is then revealed that the hitchhiker was actually a gardener for the lunatic asylum, and that his name is Mr. Renwick (not \\"Rellik\\" as the boy misheard.) We then learn that the boy himself is an inmate of the asylum, and was out on day release for the first time after being committed to the asylum for pushing his older brother in front of a train and killing him. He is returned to the asylum following the murder of Mr. Renwick. *The Sound of Murder ‚Äì A deaf schoolgirl learns the horrifying truth behind her new French teacher through her malfunctioning hearing aid, and then hears his plans to murder her, too. *Burnt (North American title: \\"Burned\\") ‚Äì While on holiday, a boy called Timothy has concerns about his uncle, who is desperate to get a suntan. Timothy's aunt, who no longer loves her husband, has replaced the sun tan lotion with cooking oil, burning her husband's skin. *Flight 715 ‚Äì A girl has a nightmare, in which she foresees that the airliner which is about to fly her family home from a vacation in Vancouver is destined to crash. Since her family do not believe her, the girl takes matters into her own hands. She wanders off on her own ‚Äì making it impossible for her family to travel ‚Äì and only returns after the aircraft has taken off. What neither she nor her family find out is that the aircraft is damaged in flight, and that if their extra weight had been on board, it wouldn't have landed safely and the girl's nightmare would have come true. *Howard's End ‚Äì A delinquent teenage boy is run over by a bus and finds himself in Heaven ‚Äì or so he thinks. He becomes bored with the idyllic existence, and wants to move to Hell ‚Äì but it is revealed he was there all along (this story is similar to the Twilight Zone episode \\"A Nice Place to Visit\\"). *The Lift (North American title: \\"The Elevator\\") ‚Äì A police detective investigates the strange disappearance of a spoiled boy at Covent Garden tube station. The boy got into an elevator, but never came out. The inspector comes to the conclusion that the boy was killed by a group of cannibals. *The Phone Goes Dead ‚Äì A teenage boy discovers that his mobile phone can receive calls from the dead, after its last owner died while using it. He repeatedly receives messages telling him to tell people about how to deal with their death, but he never tells anybody. His parents later receive a phone call from him ‚Äì after he has been killed in a bus accident on a school trip. *Twist Cottage ‚Äì A man goes to sinister lengths to rid himself and his son of his dreadful second wife by moving to a cottage haunted by the ghost of a witch who kills any woman who enters. *The Shortest Horror Story Ever Written ‚Äì An add-on to the book purportedly written by a maniac, not Anthony Horowitz. He describes how his own horror story was refused publication, so he set out on a killing spree. If the first letter of each sentence is put together, then the phrase \\"I am going to murder you soon\\" is spelled out.

The Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica brings together manuscripts and printed works in the field of Hermeticism, more specifically the 'Christian-Hermetic' tradition. It is located in the center of Amsterdam. The library Corpus Hermeticum: first Latin edition, by Marsilio Ficino, 1471 CE. The Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica was founded in 1957 by Joost Ritman, opened to the public in 1984, and is not linked to any public organisation or library. The Bibliotheca co-operates with international libraries and organizations, such as the Russian Rudomino Library for Foreign Literature in Moscow, the Herzog August Bibliothek in Wolfenb√ºttel, the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence, and the Biblioteca Marciana in Venice. To date, the library holds more than 23,000 volumes on hermetica, Rosicrucianism, alchemy, mysticism, gnosis, esotericism and comparative religion, and has great scientific and artistic value. Other areas of the collection are Sufism, Kabbalah, anthroposophy, Freemasonry, Judaica and the Grail. There are around 4,500 manuscripts and books printed before 1800 CE, and around 17,000 books (primary and secondary sources) printed after 1800 CE. Among the treasures of the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica are the Corpus Hermeticum published in 1471, the first illustrated edition of Dante's La Divina Commedia from 1481, and Cicero's De Officiis printed in 1465. History The founder of the library, Joost R. Ritman (1941), was an Amsterdam businessman with a deep interest in spirituality. He began collecting rare books at a young age, after his mother had presented him with a copy of a seventeenth-century edition of ‚ÄúThe Aurora‚Äù, a work by Jacob B√∂hme, one of the authors who are a lasting source of inspiration to him. When he conceived the plan to turn his private collection of books into a library, his vision was to bring together under one roof manuscripts and printed works in the field of the Hermetic tradition, and to show the interrelatedness between the various collecting areas and their relevance for the present day. Following a difficult year in the shadow of the financial crisis and cuts, The Ritman Library reopened its doors on December 16, 2011. Future The library is currently focussing on reshaping the once privately funded library into a self-sustaining and public institution, and on preparing the move to the Huis met de Hoofden (House with the Heads) in Amsterdam. The originally private library therefore acquired the status of a Public Benefit Institution (ANBI). With the rehousing to the Keizersgracht 123, a new era begins in which the library will be passed on to a new generation and made accessible to a broader audience. Digitizing the collection In June 2016 it was announced that author Dan Brown, who did research in the library for some of his books, will donate ‚Ç¨300,000. This money will be used to digitize the library's core collection of 4,600 early printed books and 300 older manuscripts. These will be available online in spring 2017. The Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds is donating Euro 15,000.NRC Handelsblad. Dan Brown donates to Amsterdam library. 16 June 2016.

Description Comparison of the longcomb sawfish (middle), largetooth sawfish (P. pristis; top) and knifetooth sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata; bottom). Notice especially the teeth on the saw, the shape of the tail and pectoral fins, and the position of the dorsal fin compared to the pelvic fins The longcomb sawfish is possibly the largest species of sawfish, reaching a total length of up to , but rarely more than today. Its upperparts are greenish-brown to olive, while the underparts are whitish. A combination of characters are necessary to distinguish it from the other sawfish species: the longcomb sawfish has teeth to near the base of the rostrum or \\"saw\\" (unlike the knifetooth sawfish, Anoxypristis cuspidata), 23‚Äì37 teeth on each side of the rostrum (18‚Äì24 in the dwarf sawfish, P. clavata, 20‚Äì32 in smalltooth sawfish, P. pectinata, and 14‚Äì24 in largetooth sawfish, P. pristis), the teeth towards the tip of the rostrum are clearly closer to each other than those at its base (unlike the dwarf, smalltooth and largetooth sawfish where either equally spaced or only marginally closer to each other towards the tip of the rostrum), a relatively narrow rostrum, width equalling 9‚Äì17% of its length (typically wider in dwarf and largetooth sawfish), a rostrum that is 23‚Äì33% of the total length of the fish (20‚Äì25% in dwarf sawfish), relatively short pectoral fins (unlike the knifetooth and largetooth sawfish), a leading edge of the dorsal fin that is located clearly behind the leading edge of the pelvic fins (in front of in largetooth sawfish and roughly above in smalltooth sawfish) and it has a very small or no lower tail lobe (present in knifetooth and largetooth sawfish). It can be further separated from the two most similar species, the dwarf and smalltooth sawfish, by the considerably smaller maximum size of the former species, and the less greenish colour (when alive/recently dead) and essentially Atlantic distribution of the latter species. The smalltooth and longcomb sawfish might historically have come into contact in South Africa, but sawfish appear to have been extirpated from this country. Distribution and habitat A pair of longcomb sawfish at the Aquarium of Genoa, Italy The longcomb sawfish is native to tropical and subtropical waters in the western and central Indo-Pacific. Historically its distribution covered almost and it ranged from South Africa, north to the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, east to the South China Sea, through Southeast Asia to Australia. In Australia, it ranged from Shark Bay, along the northern part of the country, and south to Jervis Bay on the eastern coast. Today it has disappeared from much of its historical range. It can live in colder waters than its relatives, as also evident by the range in Australia where it occurs further south than the other species of sawfish. The longcomb sawfish is mainly found in coastal marine, mangrove and estuarine habitats, even in very shallow waters, but can also occur far offshore to a depth of more than . There are records from rivers far inland, but it is not frequent in freshwater. It is mainly found in places with a bottom consisting of sand, mud or silt. Behavior and life cycle The longcomb sawfish feeds on fish, crustaceans and molluscs. It thrashes its rostrum from side-to-side to dislodge prey from the seabed and to stun groups of fish. All sawfish are harmless to humans, except when captured where they can cause serious injuries when defending themselves with their \\"saw\\". Little is known of its life cycle, but it is ovoviviparous and the young are long at birth. It is often said that there are about 12 young in each litter, but the basis for this number is unclear (in other sawfish species litter size ranges from 1 to 20). The females give birth in inshore areas, and the young stay near the coast and in estuaries in the first part of their lives. Sexual maturity is reached at an age of about 9 years, and a length of . The maximum age is unknown, but it might be in excess of 50 years, and an individual caught as a juvenile lived for 35 years at an aquarium. Conservation The rostrum or \\"saw\\" of a longcomb sawfish (each red or black section on ruler is ) The longcomb sawfish has declined drastically and is listed by the IUCN as \\"Critically Endangered\\" in its Red List of Threatened Species. The fins (for shark fin soup) and saw (as novelty items) are highly valuable, while some parts are used in Asian traditional medicine and the meat is eaten. Fishing is the main threat, but it is also threatened by habitat loss. Because of the potential threat they (or rather their \\"saw\\") represent to humans, they are sometimes killed before being brought onto the boat when accidentally caught. Because of the \\"saw\\", all sawfish are particularly prone to becoming entangled in fishing nets. Historically the longcomb sawfish has been recorded in 37 countries, but it has been extirpated from 2 and possibly extirpated from another 24, leaving only 11 countries where it certainly still survives. In terms of area this means that it certainly survives in only 62% of its historical range. The total population is believed to have declined by more than 80% over three generations. The subpopulations in Australia are among the few that remain viable, but even they have declined, and the species no longer occurs in New South Wales. It receives a level of protection in Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Qatar, South Africa (where already extirpated) and the United Arab Emirates, but enforcement of fishing regulations are often lacking. All sawfish species are listed on CITES Appendix I, which restricts international trade. Longcomb sawfish have few natural enemies, but can fall prey to large sharks and crocodiles. Small numbers are kept in public aquariums, with studbooks listing 13 individuals (7 males, 6 females) in North America in 2014, 6 individuals (3 males, 3 females) in Europe in 2013, and 2 individuals in Japan in 2017.

Almancil is known for its three Michelin star restaurants, the most of any town in the Algarve. The town had a population of 10,677 inhabitants in 2011,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica (INE), Census 2011 results according to the 2013 administrative division of Portugal in an area of . History First referred to as Almansil, Almancil had an Arabic origin; it was likely Alman√ßal, which means \\"inn\\" or another variant suggesting a watercourse (Almansil). The territory that is today Almancil remotes to the Paleolithic, with archaeological excavations unearthing vestages from remote settlements. The more important artifacts come from the Roman occupation from S√£o Jo√£o da Venda, Ludo and Quinta do Lago, with the latter occupied by Islamic forces. In the 16th century, Alexandre Massai (who served the Portuguese Crown) realized excavations along the coastal fortifications in the Algarve, discovering the plans for the fort of Farrobilhas, the old fortification that dominated Almancil (but today lost due to the coastal advance). Visits by the members of the Order of Santiago, in the middle of the 17th century, mentioned the existence of the hermitage of Nossa Senhora de Farrobilhas (also destroyed since this period). In the 18th century, the reconstruction of the hermitage of S√£o Louren√ßo, then in ruins, in fulfillment of a promise made to the saint by the population, brought new impetus to the communal religious life. The temple, which was barely touched by the 1755 earthquake, became one of the most important in the region after its restoration: celebrations occur annually on 10 August, in honour of Saint Lawrence. Almancil has been a civil parish since 1836; following expansion and development in the 19th century, the parish of S√£o Jo√£o da Venda was divided between the municipalities of Faro and Loul√©. In the west, the civil parish of S√£o Jo√£o Batista de Almancil and portion of the neighbouring territory of S√£o Clemente was integrated into the new Almancil. Due to an influx of tourism into the Algarve, the resident population of the parish expanded, resulting in the 18 December 1987 elevation of the parish to category of town. Geography Almancil is located along the south-eastern coastline of the municipality of Loul√©, fronting the civil parishes of Quarteira and S√£o Clemente (in the municipality of Loul√©) and Santa B√°rbara de Nexe, Faro (S√© e S√£o Pedro) and Montenegro (in the municipality of Faro). The natural landscape of the parish is marked by the Nature Park of the Ria Formosa, a site of great botanical value and a natural habitat of rare ornithological species. Along the coast are the several popular beaches: Anc√£o, Quinta do Lago, Garr√£o and Vale do Lobo. Economy The economy of Almancil supports the nearby holiday and residential developments: Quinta do Lago and Vale do Lobo. In addition to several tourist- oriented restaurants, real estate offices, supermarkets, flowershops, garden centers, interior decorators and furnishing shops support the local market. With average land prices starting at ‚Ç¨5000 per , Quinta do Lago has the most expensive property rates in Portugal, with the Almancil and Vale do Lobo.

The first Kastrioti mentioned in historical documents was a kephale of Kanin√´ in 1368. At the beginning of the 15th century the family controlled the region around Debar (modern westernmost North Macedonia and easternmost Albania) at the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th century. The most notable member was Skanderbeg, a magnate and general, regarded as an Albanian national hero. After the fall of the Principality and Skanderbeg's death in 1468 the Kastrioti family gave their allegiance to the Kingdom of Naples and were given control over the Duchy of San Pietro in Galatina and the County of Soleto in the Province of Lecce, Italy, Ferrante (-1561), son of Gjon Kastrioti II, Duke of Gelatina and Count of Spoleto is the direct ancestor of all male members of the Kastrioti family today. The family consists of two branches, one in Lecce and the other in Napoli History Origins Kastrioti, who was a kephale of Kanina in 1368, was the first member of the Kastrioti family mentioned in historical documents. In the 14th century, Kastrioti family was one of the less powerful noble families in Albania, whose power and influence was far less than those of Thopia, Dukagjini, Bal≈°iƒái or Arianiti. According to Kabashi, the Kastrioti were first mentioned in 1394.Kabashi, August 2005, p. 12: \\"The Castriotas were first mentioned in sources in 1394 and 1410 when John, Scanderbeg‚Äôs father, notified the Republic of Venice of his decision to send his son over to the Turks as hostage.17 According to the Turkish sources, the Castriota family originated from the village of Kastrat in northeastern Albania. Unlike the Thopias and the Comnenis, the Castriotas did not have a long history as members of the aristocracy. In fact, their elevation of status began with Scanderbeg‚Äôs grandfather, Paul Castriota, who initially owned two villages named Sinja and Lower Gardi.18\\" Kabashi explains that Turkish sources say that the family originated from Kastrat in north Albania. According to Malcolm, they originate from western Kosovo. According to several historians, their surname has its origin in the Greek word kastro (Œ∫Œ¨œÉœÑœÅŒø), from Latin castrum, pl. castra, \\"military camp\\" or \\"fortress\\").Thall√≥czy 1916, p. 80 : \\"Kastriot, die einen griechischen Namen f√ºhrten, ‚ÄûStadtb√ºrger\\", kastriotis von kastron, Stadt (aus lat. castrum ; polis war nur Konstantinopel allein).\\"Schmitt 2009, : \\"Der Name des Stammes Kastrioti leitet sich laut Schmitt vermutlich vom griechischen Wort ¬´kastron¬ª (Festung) ab\\" Elevation to nobility The Kastrioti, unlike the Thopia and the Arianiti, did not have a long history as nobility. The first nobleman mentioned in historical sources was either Pal Kastrioti (1394), the lord of Sin√´ and Lower Gardi (Gardhi i Posht√´m),Buda, p. 239: \\"N√´ fund t√´ shek. XIV Pal Kastrioti kishte k√´tu dy fshatra. Sinj√´n dhe Gardhin e Posht√´m.\\"Noli 1947: \\"he had not more than two villages, called Signa and Lower Gardhi.

Aleksa Kastrioti controlled three villages. Konstantin Kastrioti was protovestiar of Sina (Serina) near Durrazo. According to Venetian document discovered by Karl Hopf his title was Lord of Cer√ºja castle (). Pal held a small area of Sinja (in Arras) and Lower Gardi (Unknown location). His son, John (Gjon) Kastrioti (‚Ä† 1437), became the lord of Matia (Mat). He managed to expand his territory but was ultimately subdued by the invading Ottomans. The most notable member was George Kastrioti Skanderbeg (1405‚Äì1468), declared an Albanian national hero, renowned in Albanian folklore for his fight against the Ottoman forces.

The book belongs to the subgenre of secret history - i.e. with a plot in which real historical figures play a substantial part, doing things which are the author's invention but which supposedly (for reasons given in the plot) remained secret and did not come to the knowledge of the public. In the book, a British doctor meets in 1936 with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who is unaware that the doctor is a Nazi sympathizer. The visitor manages to secretly photograph the President in a compromising position with his secretary, Missy LeHand. By 1940, senior Nazi leader Reinhard Heydrich possesses the picture and intends to use the photo for blackmail and prevent Roosevelt from running for a third term - in the hope that whoever gets elected instead would be more likely to keep the US out of the Second World War. The President must recover the photo before the Democratic Party Convention which is about to nominate him. What makes the situation more difficult is that Roosevelt also needs to bypass the FBI - for apprehension that should the photo fall into the hands of J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI Director might use it for his own brand of blackmail. Instead, Roosevelt employs former FBI Agent Jackson, who had left the Bureau under a cloud and incurred Hoover's personal enmity, and who is completely loyal to the President. The bulk of the book follows Jackson's chase after the photo, starting from Paris at the very eve of its fall to the Wehrmacht and concluding with a cataclysmic confrontation at a secret Michigan base of the \\"Silver Shirts\\" - a murderous, power-mad American Fascist militia. The chase ends with a mixed result - the Nazi agents have been killed or captured, but the negative did fall into the hands of the FBI who caught the scent of what was going on. The book ends on a cynical note: Hoover meets the President at the White House, claims to have destroyed the negatives (which is manifestly untrue) and proceeds to imperiously demand the sacking of Jackson - obviously he is under the impression that he now holds Roosevelt's fate in his hand.

The school uses a house system to arrange the students. The head of house remains the same person for each pupil for the whole first 5 years of school. In the upper school there is no house system.  Lower school  The lower school comprises the compulsory education pupils, years 7 to 11. School pupils wear uniform, whilst sixth formers can wear office-suitable clothing. The uniform includes striped ties, blue and white pinstriped blouses/shirts and a navy blue blazer. In activities such as sports day, the houses compete for the sports day trophy. There are also inter-house sporting activities, such as football, netball, rugby and other sports. There is a trophy for most of these sporting events, as well as the inter-house chess contest. The houses are named after geological deposits in the local Dorset area. Their names and colours are: *Wealden - Green *Kimmeridge - Purple *Purbeck - Blue *Portland - Red *Gault - Yellow *Agglestone - Amber The lower school are involved in theatrical productions, such as Godspell and The Sound of Music with the sixth form and years 10 and 11 playing the lead roles. In 2007, all years were involved in a theatrical production of Barnum. In 2009, they performed Alice in Wonderland. There have also been lower school productions such as Ernie's Incredible Hallucinations (2007), Blood Brothers (2008), Oliver! (2009) and Romeo and Juliet (2009) whilst entering the Rock Challenge. In 2010 Lytchett Minster School ran the school production of Chess. Also in early 2011 Lytchett Minster school ran the school production of West Side Story.  Sixth form  The school has a sixth form, years 12 and 13, of students studying for, among others, GCE 'A' Level exams. The sixth form has its own centre, housing the common room, offices of the head and deputy head of sixth form, sixth form staff room and 2 classrooms. There is also a sixth form study room in the school's manor house building which was opened in September 2006; it contains a computer room, work room and small reference library. The sixth form student structure has a head boy and head girl with 6 deputies in year 13. Each of the 6 deputies chairs a sixth form committee. In the year 2006/7 these committees were; social and common room, lower school liaison, public relations and media, cultural, sports and charity, and fund raising. There is also the sixth form forum which is made up of one elected student from each tutor group, the head boy and girl and the chairperson of the school council.  Achievements  The school uses its arts college status to improve its musical and dramatic performances. The school often scores well in Battle of the bands, a county-wide competition where amateur bands play to impress a crowd and judges. The school also performs in Rock Challenge UK, and has reached as high as 2nd place over the whole of England but has come 1st on many occasions in the sub-category of \\"Best Costume.\\"  History   Manor House  In 1890 Baronet and MP Sir Elliott Lees bought land in Dorset and moved into South Lytchett Manor. The Manor was requisitioned in WW2, serving as the battery headquarters of an anti-aircraft defence regiment. It had 29 bedrooms and 13 bathrooms. Ater Sir John Lees' death in 1955, his heir, Sir Thomas Lees, decided to sell rather than renovate, and the Lees family moved to Post Green House, then a farmhouse on the estate. It was bought by the local Council and became Lytchett Minster Secondary Modern School.  Fires  The school was targeted by an arsonist in June 2000, just before the turn of the academic year. The fire was started in a science lab, and spread (with the aid of the gas filled supply taps to all science labs) to devastate the whole of the science, maths, and humanities blocks, including the school theatre. As the building was completely destroyed, and an investigation had to be undertaken by police and the fire brigade, the school was forced to remain closed, adding an extra two weeks onto the six-week summer holiday. The blocks that were destroyed were replaced with temporary classrooms on the other side of the playing field (known as \\"the village\\"). This led to problems, such as the need for travelling time between lessons, to enable pupils to walk the from the main site to the 'village' without missing education time and also that the government has to pay the land owners to use the land. After many delays, involving disagreements over budget and design, and the discovery of a rare type of protected tree on the site, a new building has recently been completed, which will replace the \\"village\\". This building houses the science labs, maths and humanities departments, plus two house areas (Wealden and Kimmeridge). A fire on 27 December 2012, thought to have been started by a lightning strike, destroyed the school's creative arts block. The resulting classrooms shortage meant students had to take turns attending some classes. Temporary classrooms were provided using portable structures that were used as athlete accommodation at the 2012 Summer Olympics. The creative arts block was eventually rebuilt in March 2016. Building plans The building for the new dining hall, science, humanities and maths classrooms started at the end of October 2006. Large areas of the school site were sealed off for building work. On 24 February 2009, students moved into the new building named the MSH Block. On 20 May 2009, there was an open evening for students to show their parents around the new building block.

It is located south of Plantation on SR 84. On February 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The lock is on the south bank of the North New River Canal about southeast of the origin of the canal at Lake Okeechobee. Lock No. 1 was the first lock constructed in the South Florida canal system built by Napoleon B. Broward. It was designed by world renowned engineers Major S. Sewell and Ben Johnson and built by the Furst- Clark Construction Company. The lock consisted of six-foot-thick concrete walls and large wooden gates that were operated by a hand-driven rack-and- pinion mechanism. View of lock looking west and showing modern water control structure in background Part of the Everglades Drainage District, the lock played a vital role in early operations of the New River Canal, a major transportation artery connecting Fort Lauderdale, the Everglades, and Lake Okeechobee. Using the canal and lock, boats brought lumber, farm equipment and people to communities such as Okeelanta and South Bay in the state's interior section south of Lake Okeechobee. The boats then ferried produce from the communities' farms back to the coast, where the goods were shipped north by rail. Due to shoaling in the canal and the construction of roads and rail links, the lock was closed to boat traffic in 1926. After the lock was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, local historical groups militated for the construction of a park surrounding the lock. In 1992, the South Florida Water Management District removed a flood control spillway running perpendicular to the old lock structure, and built a modern concrete water control structure just west of the lock. At the same time, various governmental and county groups worked together to restore the lock, which is now the centerpiece of Broward Memorial Lock Park.

The Borghese Gladiator is a Hellenistic life-sizeHeight 1.99 m. marble sculpture portraying a swordsman, created at Ephesus about 100 BC, now on display at the Louvre. Sculptor The sculpture is signed on the pedestal by Agasias, son of Dositheus, who is otherwise unknown. It is not quite clear whether the Agasias who is mentioned as the father of Heraclides is the same person. Agasias, son of Menophilus may have been a cousin. Rediscovery It was found before 1611, in the present territory of Anzio south of Rome, among the ruins of a seaside palace of Nero on the site of the ancient Antium (modern Anzio and NettunoPaola Brandizzi Vittucci, Antium: Anzio e Nettuno in epoca romana, Roma, Bardi, 2000 ). From the attitude of the figure it is clear that the statue represents not a gladiator, but a warrior contending with a mounted combatant. In the days when antique sculptures gained immediacy by being identified with specific figures from history or literature,The phenomenon is noted by Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, Taste and the Antique: the Lure of Classical Sculpture, 1500‚Äì1900 (Yale University Press), 1981, who offer numerous examples of fanciful 16th to 18th-century identifications. Friedrich Thiersch conjectured that it was intended to represent Achilles fighting with the mounted Amazon, Penthesilea.Friedrich Thiersch, Epochen der bildenden Kunst, 1816‚Äì1825. The sculpture was added to the Borghese collection in Rome. At the Villa Borghese it stood in a ground- floor room named for it, redecorated in the early 1780s by Antonio Asprucci. Camillo Borghese was pressured to sell it to his brother-in-law, Napoleon Bonaparte, in 1807; it was taken to Paris when the Borghese collection was acquired for the Louvre,Inventaire MR 224 (n¬∞ usuel Ma 527) where it now resides. Misnamed a gladiator due to an erroneous restoration, it was among the most admired and copied works of antiquity in the eighteenth century, providing sculptors a canon of proportions. A bronze cast was made for Charles I of England (now at Windsor), and another by Hubert Le Sueur was the centrepiece of Isaac de Caus' parterre at Wilton House;A copy of the Borghese Gladiator in a similar central position in a Dutch garden, appears in a painting by Pieter de Hooch in the Royal Collection (Lionel Cust, \\"Notes on Pictures in the Royal Collections-XXVIII. Two Paintings by Pieter de Hooch\\", The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 25 (July 1914: 205‚Äì207, illus. pl. 1). that version was given by the 8th Earl of Pembroke to Sir Robert Walpole and remains the focal figure in William Kent's Hall at Houghton Hall, Norfolk. Other copies can be found at Petworth House and in the Green Court at Knole. Originally a copy was also located in Lord Burlington's garden at Chiswick House and later relocated to the gardens at Chatsworth in Derbyshire. In the United States, a copy of \\"The Gladiator at Montalto\\"Possibly referring to a statue that used to stand in the large hall of Sixtus V's Villa Montalto in Rome, described in the artist Willem Schellinks' Dagh-Register, an unpublished manuscript describing his travels in 1646 and 1661‚Äì1665, (Royal Library, Copenhagen, NKS370, vol.

In painting * Having seen the sculpture on his Italian travels, Rubens included a figure of Fury in the same pose (seen from behind) in one of the scenes of his allegorical Palais de Luxembourg cycle of paintings for Marie de' Medici, the Conclusion of the Peace at Angers, conserved at the Louvre; the figure of Fury is bottom right.Louvre catalogue entry * The figure in the water (Brook Watson) in Watson and the Shark by John Singleton Copley is based on the sculpture's pose. * It was known, although not in the French national collection, when M√©nageot included it in the background of his The Death of Leonardo da Vinci in the arms of Francis I (1781); indeed, he probably saw it at the Villa Borghese during his stay at the French Academy in Rome from 1769 to 1774. However, it was an anachronism in such a setting since Leonardo died in 1519, about ninety years before the statue was discovered. * The stance and attitude of the warriors in Sydney Parkinson's Two of the Natives of New Holland, Advancing to Combat, a typical painting in the noble savage ideal, is said to have been based upon the Borghese Gladiator. * The headless statue in Thomas Cole's 1836 painting Destruction (the fourth painting in his The Course of Empire series) is based on the Borghese warrior.The Course of Empire- Destruction Notes References *Louvre catalogue *Two copies at the Louvre here and here. *Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, 1981.

Name The Latin specific epithet polyanthum means ‚Äúmany-flowered‚Äù. Description thumb When supported, the plant can grow up to 6 metres in height. The compound leaves with 5 to 9 leaflets are dark green on the upper surface and a lighter green beneath, with glabrous, terete or angular branches. The terminal leaflet is noticeably larger than the other leaflets. Inflorescence The species is heterostylous, meaning that a few distinct flower morphs (forms) are available, though each plant bears only one morph. In late winter and early spring it produces an abundance of reddish-pink flower buds, followed by fragrant five-petalled starry white flowers which are about 2 cm in diameter. The bracts are subulate (tapering to a point), 1-6 mm. Each flower is carried by a pedicel (single stalk) of 0.5 - 2.5 cm. The calyx forms a 1-2 mm tube terminating in 5 triangular or subulate-linear lobes, only 2 mm long, and a corolla, white, with a red underside and red buttons. The fruit is a black, globular berry.Fred Whitsey, Tony Lord, The garden at Hidcote, Londres, Frances Lincoln, 2011, 160 p. ( et 0711232350) Cultivation Jasminum polyanthum is well known as a house plant in the USA and Europe. It grows fast and easily, and flowers well.See for instance Jasminum polyanthum in Floridata.com It can also grow in the garden, when climate conditions are good; but it cannot tolerate freezing temperatures (USDA hardiness zones: 8 - 11). Outside it can be used to cover walls and fences etc., in suitable climates, in sun or light shade. It is propagated by seed and by suckers. Jasminum polyanthum was given the Award of Garden Merit (AGM) by the RHS in 1993. It was chosen on the Bicentenary list of 200 plants for the RHS: ‚ÄúThis popular houseplant is an easily-grown, evergreen, half-hardy climber with loose panicles in summer of many strongly-fragrant pink-backed, white, trumpet-shaped flowers. It does not suffer pest or disease problems and is simple to propagate.‚Äù Invasive species Jasminum polyanthum is naturalized in AustraliaJasminum polyanthum in Australia and New Zealand.Information on Jasminum polyanthum on NZPCN (New Zealand Plant Conservation Network) It can be regarded as an invasive species in these regions.e.g. Jasminum polyanthum on the Weeds of Blue Mountains Bushland website (Australia) and information on Jasminum polyanthum from the Auckland Regional Council (New Zealand) This species of jasmine spreads rapidly as it can grow from any small section of stem material. The stems layer profusely and runners spread long distances. It is highly shade tolerant and can flower under a full canopy. It forms dense ground cover, preventing the growth of native seedlings, and smothers all other vegetation up to mid-canopy level.

Francesco Maria Richini (also spelled Ricchini) (9 February 1584 ‚Äì 24 April 1658) was an Italian Baroque architect. Biography He was born in Milan and trained under Lorenzo Binago. He was patronized by Cardinal Federico Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan. After a stint in Rome, he became capomastro under the main architect of the Cathedral of the city, Aurelio Trezzi, in 1605. He was elevated to the latter's position himself from 1631 to 1638. Like his famous elder cousin, Carlo Borromeo, author of a guide to religious architecture, Federico Borromeo promulgated classical or antique models. In Richini he found a deviation to the Baroque, as exemplified by his churches of Santa Maria alla Porta and of San Giuseppe. This small church in central Milan (consecrated 1616) has a highly decorated facade (finished 1630) with volutes. The interior are two Bramante-inspired squares. He also worked on the palazzos of Brera (1627‚Äì1628), Annoni (1631), Litta (1642‚Äì1648), and Durini (1648). He contributed to the design of the courtyard of the Ospedale Maggiore (1625‚Äì1649), in collaboration with Giovan Battista Messina, Fabio Mangone and Giovanni Battista Crespi. He also designed the concave facade for the Collegio Elvetico, and also for the Collegio Borromeo in Pavia. He helped in the construction of Sant'Alessandro in Zebedia in Milan. He designed the \\"Altar of Our Lady of the Assumption\\" in the Como Cathedral, a work that lasted several decades and was completed in 1686. \\"Altar of Our Lady of the Assumption\\" in the Como Cathedral His son, Gian Domenico, was also an architect.

The area is about 25 miles (40 km) due west of Birmingham in the West Midlands region. There is also use of this term to apply to areas around the River Severn as far south as Gloucester, and as far north as Ironbridge. To the north of Bridgnorth, the area around the river becomes much steeper and is known as Ironbridge Gorge. From Stourport on Severn south to Gloucester, the riverside has a much larger flood plain and loses its distinctive \\"valley\\" hillsides found a few miles north in Bewdley. To the south of Gloucester, it becomes the Vale of Berkeley and then the Severn Estuary. History The Severn Valley was under the rule of Ceawlin of Wessex after the Battle of Deorham in 577 AD as part of The Kingdom of Hwicce. In 628 AD, Penda of Mercia's victory in the Battle of Cirencester led to his rule over the Severn Valley. Geology and roads The Severn Valley between Highley and Arley The area is typified by a substantial river bed with deep fast-flowing channels, surrounded by a small flood plain and rolling wooded hills. Due to the soft sandstone banks, it is difficult to build bridges that can bear heavy loads. The only public road bridges are at Bridgnorth and Bewdley, meaning that there is no way for road traffic to cross the river for 16 miles(26 km). The two main roads along the valley are the A442 on the east side from Bridgnorth via Alveley to Kidderminster and the B4555 on the west from Bridgnorth via Highley to Bewdley. Both of these run north-south roughly parallel with the river. Towns and villages Starting north at Bridgnorth and running south downstream, the area encompasses the following locations: *Through Shropshire: :*Bridgnorth (both sides ‚Äì two public road bridges) :*Quatford (east bank) :*Chelmarsh (west bank ‚Äì also private waterworks bridge to Hampton Loade) :*Quatt (east bank) :*Hampton (west bank) and Hampton Loade (east bank) (connected by the Hampton Loade Ferry ‚Äî also private waterworks utility bridge to Chelmarsh capable of carrying light trucks and small emergency vehicles; gated and usually locked) :*Alveley (east bank ‚Äì public bridalway/footbridge to Highley) :*Highley (west bank ‚Äì public bridalway/footbridge to Alveley) *Through Worcestershire: :*Arley (both sides ‚Äì public footbridge ‚Äì also railway bridge for SVR) :*Trimpley (west bank ‚Äì river enters Wyre Forest ‚Äî also private waterworks, electricity and gas pipeline bridge) :*Bewdley (both sides ‚Äì two public road bridges ‚Äì severe flooding used to be common in spring before defences) Some definitions continue through Worcestershire and into Gloucestershire as far south as Gloucester. Features There are riverside footpaths throughout almost the entire length of the Severn Valley on both sides, including the Severn Way long distance footpath, making it a popular haunt for anglers and ramblers, often combining a leisurely walk with a return trip on the Severn Valley Railway. A number of traditional pubs cater for the tourist trade. At the centre of the area, between Highley and Alveley, is the Severn Valley Country Park, with level-access and wide flat footpaths for wheelchair users, plus conveniences and a small visitors' centre. During periods of low water (typically August), fording the river is occasionally possible at almost any point along the Severn Valley, notably near the old bridges at Bridgnorth and Bewdley, and at the appropriately named Quatford. At mid and high water, fording is dangerous due to deep, fast-flowing and often non-visible river channels. Forders are advised to test depth with a long stick as they progress. In fiction The term Severn Valley is also used to refer to a fictional location in horror novels based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft. However, this fictional location is based on the Gloucestershire, Vale of Berkeley and Cotswolds regions, some 60 miles (100 km) further south of the real-life Severn Valley. Characters in the interwar novels of Francis Brett Young typically breathe \\"the Severnside air\\" and wander its pastoral byways (see for example his 1937 Portrait of a Village). Parke Godwin's King Arthur series (Firelord, et. al) puts Camelot in the Severn Valley The Severn Valley Railway has featured in a number of films and television episodes.

The town was founded by the Count of Aumale in the mid-thirteenth century, and had more than one hundred houses and a flourishing market by 1299, when it was granted a borough charter.George Sheeran, Medieval Yorkshire Towns, p.24 In the 13th century the town was a more important port than Kingston upon Hull, further up the Humber, and was represented in the Model Parliament of 1295, but as the sandbanks shifted the town was swept away.

In May 2018, Zef Eisenberg, the fastest motorbike on sand was recorded at 201.5 mph over 1.5 miles at Pendine sands in Wales on a supercharged Suzuki Hayabusa. This was a one way record, officiated and recorded by UKTA and the British Record club. Zef Eisenberg also holds the record for World's fastest Turbine bike and Britain's fastest ever naked bike (no fairing) on his Rolls Royce C20B Turbine powered motorbike with an average speed of 225.75 mph over a mile from a standing start at Elvington Airfield on 17 May 2015. This was recorded by UKTA and Guinness World Records. On 6 April 2019, Zef Eisenberg, recorded the fastest ever wheel powered flying mile on a supercharged Suzuki Hayabusa at 182.49 mph at Pendine Sands, exceeded the flying mile record of Idris Elba in 2015 and that of Sir Malcolm Campbell in 1927. On 17 May 2019, Zef Eisenberg, returned to Pendine with a bespoke 1200 hp Porsche 911 Turbo and on his very first pair of runs, he achieved the following records; \\\\- Fastest sand speed record achieved by a wheel-powered vehicle at 210.332 mph at Pendine Sands. \\\\- Fastest flying quarter (one way) wheel powered record at 206.492 mph, Pendine record (and MSA under 5000cc record). \\\\- Fastest flying mile (one way) wheel powered record at 196.970 mph, Pendine record (and MSA under 5000cc record). \\\\- Fastest Flying mile (2 way) 187.962 mph (same measurement as Sir Malcolm Campbell), Pendine record \\\\- As of 2019, Zef Eisenberg, is the only person in history to have achieved over 200 mph on bike and car at Pendine, and a flying mile record in bike and car in Britain, and the only person to hold car and bike records, other than John Surtees. Non wheel-driven vehicles On 25 September 1980 Thrust2 driven by Richard Noble broke the Flying Mile record at a speed of 248.87 m.p.h. and the Flying Kilometre at 251.190 m.p.h. at RAF Greenham Common.Thrust, by Richard Noble, Bantam Books, 1999, Pages 80-81. In the summer of 1998, Colin Fallows bettered Richard Noble's outright UK Record in his Vampire jet dragster at an average speed of 269 m.p.h. at Elvington, Yorkshire.The Guardian, 8 June 1999, Page C4. See also: The Guardian, 20 August 1997, Page 2. Mark Newby raised this to 272 mph in Split Second in July 2000 but Colin Fallows raised the record again on the same day using Vampire to record an average speed of 300.3 mph with a peak of 329 mph. On 7 July 2006, Colin Fallows raised this 300.3 mph average speed again by 1 mph with an each-way average of 301 mph at RAF Fairford in Vampire. His peak speed was 331 mph, considerably in excess of the 314 mph peak achieved by Richard Hammond a few weeks afterwards just prior to crashing the car. At the same event at RAF Fairford on 7 July 2006, Mark Newby drove his jet car Split Second to an MSA/FIA accredited average speed of 338.74 mph with a peak of 362 mph, the fastest speed ever recorded in the UK. The car was unable to make a return run so the one-way record remains an unofficial one. (Sources: UK Speed Record Club, FAST Facts. RACMSA) On 20 September 2006, Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond reached a peak speed of whilst being taught to drive the Vampire jet car. It was not a record attempt, and no official MSA or FIA Accredited timekeeping was in place, the peak speed of 314 mph being recorded by the BBC's own on-board data management equipment.

It was founded as an expansion of Tsun Jin Primary School (ms), founded in 1913.Official Website of SJK (C) Tsun Jin The early 20th century witnessed a sweeping worldwide trend to establish schools. With the aim to educate and to equip the younger generation, the prudent predecessors of The Selangor Fui Chiu Association thus founded the Tsun Jin Primary School in 1913. In the early 1950, responding to the urgency to provide students with a holistic Chinese education and to pass on the excellent Chinese culture, the Tsun Jin Board of Governors thus endeavored to establish an independent Chinese high school. The high school section was officially in operation in 1955. In 1962, many local Chinese schools opted for systemic reformation. Convinced of the unique and significant mission of the independent Chinese high school, the Tsun Jin Board of Governors courageously resolved to stay in the noble course. Manifesting the great spirit of self-reliance and striving against all odds, various construction plans have been sequentially and successfully implemented. Today, the school's facilities include a library, 8 badminton courts, an air- conditioned hall with a capacity of 800 persons which provides a venue for concerts and lectures, and a main hall built in 2009 having a capacity of 2,500 persons. A music room is usually occupied by the choir society. Among the many clubs and societies are the Police Cadet, Editorial Club, St.John Ambulance, Boy's Scout and Girl's Guide, Orchestra, Debate, and Elocution (debate and elocution are divided by three languages). The timetable for this school is fixed except for assembly days. Besides that, the school has celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2015 and the school held a performance on 25 and 26 July 2015. The school hired Mr Beh Kim Chuan as the Head Director of the performance. Tsun Jin High School's students are known for their exceptional skills in the field of elocution. Their Chinese Debate team captain Justin has won the Asian Debate Cup several times while their English Debate team has won several awards over the years including the HELP University 2014 International Chinese Secondary School Debate Competition. The Tsun Jin basketball team has also made a name for themselves as being one of the top high school basketball teams in the state. They have won numerous awards over the years including the Ruby Cup, Selangor-Kuala Lumpur Chinese Independent High School Inter-school Tournament and many others. Team members have to go through an audition and are carefully chosen by both the coach and teachers.

Calcium-binding proteins have specific domains that bind to calcium and are known to be heterogeneous. One of the functions of calcium binding proteins is to regulate the amount of free (unbound) Ca2+ in the cytosol of the cell. The cellular regulation of calcium is known as calcium homeostasis. Types Many different calcium-binding proteins exist, with different cellular and tissue distribution and involvement in specific functions. Calcium binding proteins also serve an important physiological role for cells. The most ubiquitous Ca2+-sensing protein, found in all eukaryotic organisms including yeasts, is calmodulin. Intracellular storage and release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is associated with the high-capacity, low-affinity calcium-binding protein calsequestrin.Siegel, George (Ed.). Basic neurochemistry: molecular, cellular and medical aspects. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins / 1999 Calretinin is another type of Calcium binding protein weighing 29kD. It is involved in cell signaling and shown to exist in neurons. This type of protein is also found in large quantities in malignant mesothelial cells, which can be easily differentiated from carcinomas. This differentiation is later applied for a diagnosis on ovarian stromal tumors. Also, another member of the EF-hand superfamily is the S100B protein, which regulates p53. P53 is known as a tumor suppressor protein and in this case acts as a transcriptional activator or repressor of numerous genes. S100B proteins are abundantly found in cancerous tumor cells causing them to be overexpressed, therefore making these proteins useful for classifying tumors. In addition, this explains why this protein can easily interact with p53 when transcriptional regulation takes place.http://nmr.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ikura/publication/PDF%20Articles/2002/The%20role%20of%20calcium%20binding%20proteins.pdf Calcium-binding proteins can be either intracellular and extracellular. Those that are intracellular can contain or lack a structural EF-hand domain. Extracellular calcium-binding proteins are classified into six groups. Since Ca (2+) is an important second messenger, it can act as an activator or inhibitor in gene transcription. Those that belong to the EF-hand superfamily such as Calmodulin and Calcineurin have been linked to transcription regulation. When levels of Ca(2+) increase in the cell, these members of the EF-hand superfamily regulate transcription indirectly by phosphorylating/dephosphorylating transcription factors. Functions With their role in signal transduction, calcium-binding proteins contribute to all aspects of the cell's functioning, from homeostasis to learning and memory. For example, the neuron-specific calexcitin has been found to have an excitatory effect on neurons, and interacts with proteins that control the firing state of neurons, such as the voltage-dependent potassium channel. Compartmentalization of calcium binding proteins such as calretinin and calbindin-28 kDa has been noted within cells, suggesting that these proteins perform distinct functions in localized calcium signaling. It also indicates that in addition to freely diffusing through the cytoplasm to attain a homogeneous distribution, calcium binding proteins can bind to cellular structures through interactions that are likely important for their functions.

The Optimists, being the largest club in Luxembourg and the only one with its own ground, works in close cooperation with the Luxembourg Cricket Federation to help organise cricket in the Grand Duchy. History The Optimists are the oldest cricket club in Luxembourg, having been founded in 1976 by British expatriates, whose ranks had been swollen by Luxembourg City's growth as a financial centre and by the UK's entry into the European Economic Community. The Optimists participate in both the Belgian Cricket League and the Luxembourg Cricket League but its main competitive focus is in the Belgian cricket league,http://www.cricket-belgium.com/ which it won on three occasions in the early 1990s (1991, 1994, 1995). The Optimists have won the 2nd division of this competition for the past three seasons (2015, 2016 and 2017) but are currently prohibited from promotion to the top division due to the Belgian Sports Ministry's policy on clubs situated outside Belgian territory. Ground The club plays at the Pierre Werner Cricket Ground, in Walferdange. The ground is named after the late Pierre Werner, a former Prime Minister of Luxembourg (1959‚Äì74, 1979‚Äì84). Werner had fallen in love with cricket when living in London in 1930, and went on to become the Honorary President of the OCC, which had been established when he was Prime Minister. Werner opened the OCC's new ground when it was opened in 1992. Widely viewed as the best cricket grounds in mainland Europe (excluding grounds in the Netherlands), the ground lies in the picturesque setting just ten minutes from Luxembourg City center. It boasts a large outfield (with two tracks laid on different bases), four practice bays, a clubhouse with catering facilities), a cricket/tennis pavilion and various other amenities.http://www.optimists.cc/location/default.aspx?locationID=2137 Facts The club is currently captained by Richard Neale and William Heath is the chairman of the club's committee.http://www.optimists.cc/contact/default.aspx The club's sponsors have included New Delhi Restaurant, Citco, Brasserie Nationale, Citadel, Dresdner Bank, Schroders, as well as support from the commune of Walferdange.

The streets within the estate are all named after famous poets and wordsmiths. It was originally known as the Conqueror's Farm housing estate after a farm which had been situated in the local area, but the Straits name was adopted by the local community soon afterwards as it was situated around The Straits, a main through route along which several shops to serve the new estate were built. The estate was constructed around a large residence called The Straits House, which was built during the 1830s. It had once been occupied by a succession of affluent local people, but by the time the surrounding estate was completed, it had been converted into a public house. This pub was the centre of most activities in the estate, with fairs, and fates on the car park and grounds. It opened as a pub in 1960, when the new housing estate was being built. However, due to being depreciated by the brewery was closed in 2006. Despite Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council declining the planning application multiple times, it has since been converted into flats.

It includes major collections of Caravaggio, Raphael, and Titian, and of ancient Roman art. The Borghese also bought widely from leading painters and sculptors of his day, and Scipione Borghese's commissions include two portrait busts by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Most of the collection remains intact and on display at the Galleria Borghese, although a significant sale of classical sculpture was made under duress to the Louvre in 1807. Scipione Borghese Cardinal Scipione Borghese, an important art collector, was the collection's instigator and collected the majority of the collection. His collection was poetically described as early as 1613 by Scipione Francucci. In 1607, the Pope gave the Cardinal 107 paintings which had been confiscated from the studio of the painter Cavalier D'Arpino. In the following year, Raphael's Deposition was removed by force from the Baglioni Chapel in the church of San Francesco in Perugia and transported to Rome to be given to the Cardinal Scipione through a papal motu proprio. Later additions In 1682, part of Olimpia Aldobrandini's inheritance entered the Borghese collection; it included works from the collections of Cardinal Salviati and Lucretia d'Este. Housing the collection Dan√§e by Correggio. Scipione developed a large estate and vineyard on the Pincian hill in Rome into a vast garden and complex of palaces, the Villa Borghese, to house his collection. He also used the Villa Mondragone for this purpose. In 1775, in homage to his Borghese ancestors, Prince Marcantonio IV Borghese and the architect Antonio Asprucci embarked upon renovations to Villa Borghese, which had always been a semi-public museum since the 17th century. Integrating the sculptures of the Borghese collection and existing vast Baroque ceiling decors, they created a spectacular monument to the Borghese family (Paul 2000). Galleria Borghese The Villa still houses a major part of the collection, as the Galleria Borghese. Many of the sculptures there are displayed in the spaces they were intended for, including early works by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Caravaggio paintings *Boy with a Basket of Fruit *St. Jerome *Sick Bacchus *John the Baptist (John in the Wilderness) *Madonna of the Palafrenieri *David with the Head of Goliath *Portrait of Pope Paul V Other notable paintings *Sacred and Profane Love by Titian *Deposition by Raphael *Dan√§e by Correggio *Portrait of a Man by Antonello da Messina (See also Image) *Diana by Domenichino *Venus and Cupid by Cranach *Circe by Dosso Dossi *The Deposition by Rubens *Tobias and the Angel by Savoldo *Madonna and Child with Saints by Lorenzo Lotto *The Last Supper by Jacopo Bassano * Various works by Federico Barocci *Leda and the Swan by followers of Leonardo da Vinci Bernini collection The small collection of works by Bernini (whose first patron was Scipione) comprises a large proportion of his lifetime output of secular sculpture; in this collection one can see the sponsored Bernini mature from juvenile, but talented works, such as The Goat Amalthea with the Infant Jupiter and a Faun (1615) to his supreme and dynamic Apollo and Daphne (1622‚Äì25) and David (1623), considered seminal works of baroque sculpture. In addition, the gallery contains three busts, two of Pope Paul V (1618‚Äì20) and one marvelously conversive and stunningly innovative portrait of his patron, Borghese (1632). Finally it has some early, somewhat mannerist, but masterful works such as Aeneas, Anchises, and Ascanius (1618‚Äì19) and the Giambologna-emulating Pluto's Rape of Prosperpine (1621‚Äì22), and also a personal allegory of Truth Unveiled by Time (1646‚Äì52). At the Louvre Ares Borghese in the Louvre In 1807, due to financial difficulties and pressure from his new brother-in-law Napoleon Bonaparte, Camillo Filippo Ludovico Borghese sold 344 antiquities (154 statues - including some major examples -, 160 busts, 170 bas-reliefs, 30 columns and various vases), from the collection to the French state at below their market price. These pieces, which now reside at the Louvre Museum, include: *sculptures recently excavated at Gabii *the Antinous Mondragone *the Borghese Gladiator *the Borghese Hermaphroditus *the Borghese Vase He replaced them in the Villa with other pieces from excavations on Borghese property (e.g. the Gladiator Mosaic, found in 1834) and paintings from his residences' stores and cellars, so that already by the 1830s these gaps seem to have been filled and despite the losses the collection was still reckoned as one of the world's finest., page 180 Camillo even bought Correggio's celebrated Dan√§e in Paris in 1827.

The boy is virtuous and wise; however, he has little practical experience of the world, and so his counsellors advise the Duke to send his son travelling. One of the lords, Proditor, says in asides that he hopes the Phoenix will go and never come back. The Phoenix enters, with his servant Fidelio; his father advises him to see the world, to find out what men are really like. He agrees to go in disguise, so that he will not be flattered in the way that princes always are. In private with Fidelio, he decides not to go abroad at all, but to stay in his own kingdom, to see what men are like at home and mark all their abuses. A young girl enters‚Äîshe is the niece of Justice Falso and true love of Fidelio. She bids him goodbye; he instructs her to watch his mother, who has newly remarried a Captain, without his own knowledge or consent, and he wants to know if she is being treated well. Scene 2: A room in the Captain's house The Captain at home. He very much regrets his marriage, since he hates the thought of being tied down, especially as his new wife isn't rich. She enters and he verbally abuses her, telling her to be more respectful to him, and asking why she married him. She laments. Proditor enters and seems to take a fancy to the wife (who is called Castiza). The Captain promptly hatches a plan to have Proditor take his wife off his hands. Proditor meanwhile tells him about Phoenix's journey with Fidelio, and says in an aside that Phoenix will not live long. The Captain resolves to seek out advice about divorce from a crafty lawyer he knows. Scene 3: Another room in the Captain's house Proditor woos Castiza, but she rebuffs him. Scene 4: A room in an inn Phoenix and Fidelio enter an inn where they are lodging. The lawyer Tangle enters with two legal suitors. He is adept at leading such suitors on long chases through the ins and outs of the legal system. He then uses their money to finance his own lawsuits, as he explains to Phoenix: he loves suing people. He exits to speak to the Captain, who has just arrived, and Phoenix laments at how the law has been abused by this man. Tangle and the Captain re-enter and Phoenix learns that the Captain is trying to sell his wife. Phoenix and Fidelio resolve to save the lady. Scene 5: A street in Ferrara Enter a Jeweller's wife and her boy. She is engaging in a relationship with an impoverished knight: she gets money from her husband and gives it to him. Scene 6: A room in Falso's house Falso's house. He is a Justice of the Peace, who accepts bribes from suitors to give warrants. His servant brings news that his brother has just died, and his niece (Fidelio's sweetheart) is therefore given to him as a ward. He has inherited his brother's wealth, but is charged to give the girl five thousand crowns as a dowry if she marry to his liking. Falso decides that he will marry the girl himself. The jeweller's wife turns out to be Falso's daughter; she introduces the knight as her husband's brother, and Falso offers him lodging at his house, which will facilitate their adultery. Act II Scene 1: A room in the inn Phoenix and Fidelio are at the Inn, plotting to defeat the Captain and save Fidelio's mother. Fidelio is disguised as a scrivener; Phoenix as a wealthy farmer's son and speculator. Scene 2: A room in the Captain's house The Captain tells Castiza that he is selling her; she protests and appeals to his and her honour but can do nothing. Proditor enters, followed by Phoenix and Fidelio. Fidelio makes out a bond, which says that the Captain is selling his right to Castiza‚Äîbut does not say that she is being sold to Proditor. The Captain, counting out money, is hardly listening, and signs his mark to it. Phoenix holds forth in an aside on the sacredness of matrimony. Fidelio and Phoenix offer themselves as employees to Proditor, pretending to be corrupt. Proditor agrees and exits, saying he will come back for his new woman later. Phoenix and Fidelio uncover themselves to the captain and arraign him. They give the money to Castiza; she gives the Captain a few coins and his liberty and he flees. Scene 3: A room in Falso's House Falso, the Knight and the Jeweller's wife. Falso sends the pair off to a private room together; meanwhile he calls his niece to him and woos her. She is disgusted at the incest, and says that her heart is Fidelio's anyway. She would rather be a beggar than yield. Tangle enters‚Äîan old friend of Falso's. They have a mock-fencing match, using rapiers and daggers and linking them with specific legal terms and concepts‚Äîthe writ of delay is the long sword, etc. Tangle \\"overthrows\\" Falso and wins the game. Act III Scene 1: Falso's House Falso's house. He calls for his servants, who have been out robbing a house. They enter in false beards and beg his mercy; he agrees to collude with it. One of the men, Furtivo, was captured in the robbery; Falso regrets that they should have to be dishonest in this unhand way‚Äîit's better to be a justice and cheat men openly. Phoenix and Fidelio enter, followed by officers who bring in Furtivo for trial. Falso indulges his vanity by making Furtivo talk about what a good, generous, noble man his master is; he then sentences him to prison‚Äîand, apparently on second thoughts, says that actually he can punish him better by taking him into his own care. Phoenix, Fidelio and the officers are fooled; the officers go away satisfied. Meanwhile, Phoenix and Fidelio lurk to see the niece. She enters and tells them that they have been tricked: Furtivo is Falso's own man; also, Falso is trying to force her to commit incest. They realise Falso's wickedness and agree to save her: she is to run away to stay with Castiza, Fidelio's mother. Scene 2: A street The Knight making arrangements to meet with the Jeweller's wife again. He will come that night and turn the ring on the door; the maid will know him by that signal and let him in. He will then be given a hundred and fifty coins. Act IV Scene 1: A street before the Jeweller's house and the Court of Law Proditor tells Phoenix his plan: to pretend to the court that the duke's son had plotted to murder his own father (and presumably, therefore, Proditor plans to kill the duke also). Then when Proditor's own men kill the prince, no one will mind. Phoenix agrees to go along with this. Tangle enters, oppressed by his suitors: he is worried about his own cases and cannot think about theirs at the moment. Falso enters to say that his niece has vanished. A cry from offstage: Tangle's law-cases have been overthrown. Tangle immediately goes mad, babbling law-terms and talking in riddles and visions. Phoenix points out the justice in the madness. Tangle loved to torment others, but now he himself is tormented. Fidelio meanwhile has discovered a miracle‚ÄîQuieto, a lawyer who has escaped the law, turned peaceable and unlitigious. Phoenix admits that he loves the man for this. Officers meanwhile appear to arrest the knight for his debts. Scene 2: A room in the Jeweller's house The Jeweller's House. Phoenix accidentally turns the ring on the door and is admitted by the maid. He is taken to a dark room where the wife (mistaking him for the knight) pays him money and then laments that he has never taken her to court. He agrees that she shall go and gives her a diamond so that she will be known and admitted. Meanwhile, Phoenix is nursing thoughts of returning to his true identity, being \\"sick of all professions.\\" Scene 3: A street before the Jeweller's house The knight is arrested but pleads to be allowed to get some money to pay the debts. The officer knocks the door, but this is not the signal and the maid turns the knight away. The knight is being led to jail but a gentleman intervenes and distracts the officer, allowing the knight to run away. Act V Scene 1: The presence chamber in the Duke of Ferrara's palace The palace. Proditor enters with Phoenix, Proditor promising him riches if he follow the plan. Various nobles enter, followed by the Duke. Fidelio enters in his proper form, with a paper for the Duke, which he claims is Phoenix's account of his travels. The duke reads it out ‚Äì and the first section warns him of Proditor's evil plot, saying that even now Proditor has brought in a man to murder him. Phoenix stands up and ‚Äòconfesses‚Äô that he is the man. Proditor is aghast and tries to deny everything. Attendants seize Proditor. The paper also accuses two other lords, Lussurioso and Infesto, of riotous living and pimping (something we haven‚Äôt seen), and phoenix says that he was also hired to help with that. Falso enters to protest the loss of his niece; the Duke reads out the next section, which indicts Falso for abusing the niece and abetting his thieving servants. Phoenix testifies again and the niece confirms it. Falso wonders who has informed against him; Phoenix finally uncovers himself. The Duke is overjoyed and passes all power over to his son. Phoenix banishes Proditor forever for his ugly crimes. He then turns his attention to the other sinners. Fidelio brings in the jeweller's wife, who is accused as a lustful harlot. She promises to live modestly from now on. She is pardoned after the niece intercedes on her behalf. Falso is banned from being a justice and has his money given to the niece as punishment for his crimes The mad Tangle enters and is quietened by Quieto, who purges him of all his law-terms by binding him, forcing his spite and anger to burst out, and finally anointing him with healing balm. He will give up the devil now and pray and live at peace. (This is a long, symbolic ceremony, which brings a sense of harmony.) Phoenix approves of all, and there is peace. References * Chambers, E.

The first branch stood on the corner of 4th and G Streets in Anchorage, Alaska. First National Bank Alaska's original location in downtown Anchorage, Alaska, in 2016. History The bank was founded in 1922 by candy maker Winfield Ervin Sr. at the corner of 4th and G Streets in Anchorage, Alaska. The bank still operates a branch at this location today. Known at the time as The First National Bank of Anchorage, the business benefited from the Alaska Railroad construction boom of the early 1920s. Bruce Parham, ‚ÄúCuddy, Warren N.,‚Äù Cook Inlet Historical Society, Legends & Legacies, Anchorage, 1910-1940, http://www.alaskahistory.org In 1941, the bank was purchased by Warren N. Cuddy, who took over as president. Cuddy first came to Alaska in 1914, settling in Valdez and working as a grocery clerk in the Valdez Mercantile Company. During this time he began to study law and met his future wife, Lucy Hon. They moved to Anchorage in 1933, where Cuddy continued his legal work and took over the law practice of J.S. Truitt. Cuddy became involved with the Alaska Rural Rehabilitation Corporation (ARRC), which was established in 1935, and served on the board of directors. The ARRC was the main administrative agency of the Matanuska Colony, a New Deal experiment that brought two hundred farming families into the Matanuska Valley. This resettlement of families also brought with it $200 million into southcentral Alaska between 1935 and 1941 at the height of the Great Depression. It was during this time that Cuddy became interested in the struggling bank, and began his long career in the banking business of Alaska. Cuddy secured the bank's membership in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which enabled it to grow much faster during the wartime since federal agencies and the military did business only with government-insured banks. Cuddy died in 1951, and his son, D.H. Cuddy, succeeded as president, a position he retained for 63 years until his passing in 2015 at the age of 94. Cuddy's daughter, Betsy Lawer, succeeded as first as Chair and President, now Chair and CEO, making the bank continually operated by the Cuddy family for more than 75 years. In 1960, First National opened Alaska's first drive-through bank. In September 2001, the bank's name was changed to First National Bank Alaska. The similarly named National Bank of Alaska had been absorbed into Wells Fargo in 2000. The bank has consistently ranked among the nation's top performing banks, in 1989 being listed among the nation's top 10 performing banks by Veribanc, meeting the \\"highest standards in the industry.\\" In May 2007, Bauer Financial Reports gave First National a \\"five-star\\" rating, the highest such rating they offer. It is the 73 consecutive quarter First National has earned the five-star rating, the longest such streak of any Alaska bank. Because First National has maintained this rating in each quarter for at least 10 years, it also earned Bauer's distinction of an \\"Exceptional Performance Bank.\\" Most recently, First National has been recognized two years in a row, by the readers of Alaska Business Magazine, as the \\"Best Place to Work in Alaska;\\" MSN also listed the bank in early 2018 as the \\"Most Admired Company in Alaska.\\" First National reported more than $3.61 billion in assets in its 2016 Annual Highlights. In April 2006, the bank opened its 29th branch in Glennallen. The bank currently operates 28 branches in 18 Alaska cities. First National Bank Alaska stock currently trades as FBAK on the OTC Markets stock exchange. The company has consistently paid quarterly dividends since November 2003. FBAK increased its quarterly dividend to $20 in May 2016, citing a strong capital account and a unique position to operate competitively versus national chains. As of September 22, 2020, the stock trades at a P/E ratio of 11.38 with a dividend yield of 6.40%.

It is a well known fertilizer tree. It is a member of the Fabaceae (pea) family and is indigenous to the dry volcanic slopes of the Canary Islands, but it is now grown in Australia, New Zealand and many other parts of the world as a fodder crop. Biology Tagasaste is an evergreen shrub that has rough yellow-grey bark and velvety hairy young growth. Its leaves are composed of three greyish-green equal-sized leaflets, which are slightly paler on the underside. Its scented, creamy-white flowers form in small clusters in the leaf axils. Its flat pea-like pods are green, ripening to black. The seeds are tiny (45,000/kg), shiny and black. Tagasaste is considered to be a promiscuous legume, compatible with cowpea and Tagasaste 1502 Rhizobium. It will nodulate with a wide range of rhizobia. Tagasaste is suited to sandy, well-drained soils of pH range 4‚Äì7. On deep, freely drained soils its roots can extend down to at least 10 metres. Any physical or chemical barrier in the soil that restricts root growth will reduce the productivity and survival of tagasaste. Cultivars from arid sandy areas are very susceptible to root rot fungus on poorly drained soils, specifically Fusarium, Pythium and Rhizoctonia. It will tolerate winter temperatures as low as ‚àí9 ¬∞C, but cultivars exist that can handle winter temperatures down to minus 15 ¬∞C as in Orange, Eastern Australia. Tagasaste leaves will be burnt by frost and seedlings can be killed at temperatures below 0 ¬∞C. Growth of mature trees will slow at winter temperatures below 20 ¬∞C. Tagasaste can tolerate temperatures up to 50 ¬∞C, but above 36 ¬∞C leaves close up from stress. Tagasaste flowers during the early rainy season, typically June to October in Australia, New Zealand and East Africa. Tagasaste has two types of roots. There are a few large 'sinker' roots that can extend down to at least 10 metres. These are used to extract moisture from that depth during the long dry summers. There are also many 'feeder' roots that are mostly confined to the top 1 metres. These can extend out at least 15 metres from the trunk. They extract mineral nutrients from the soil, and also water in winter. In summer the soil water can be taken up at depth by the sinker roots, drawn into the shallow feed roots and then pumped into the soil. This 'hydraulic lift' allows the tagasaste to keep extracting nutrients from the shallow soil which would otherwise be too dry. This hydraulic lift is also seen in the native banksia shrubs that grow naturally on these soils and have a similar root design. When tagasaste is planted in rows that run north‚Äìsouth, it has been found that both the shoots and the roots grow twice as fast on the west side of the plant as on the east side. Fodder crop Tagasaste is a valued forage for ruminants because of its good palatability and high protein content. It can be grazed directly, or cut and fed fresh or dried.Heuz√© V., Thiollet H., Tran G., Hassoun P., Bastianelli D., Lebas F., 2017. Tagasaste (Cytisus proliferus). Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/310 As a fodder crop tagasaste delivers between 23 and 27% crude protein (14‚Äì30% in Western Australia) and 18‚Äì24% crude indigestible fibre. With proper application of fertiliser it can maintain these levels even when grown on poor soils. Phosphorus is particularly important both for the growth of tagasaste and for the growth of the animals grazing on it. Higher levels of phosphorus are required for the maximum growth of the animals than for maximum plant growth. Fertiliser will also reduce the level of phenolic compounds (similar to tannins) that increase when the plants are moisture stressed. These phenolic compounds make the tagasaste less palatable and reduce the animals' feed intake. The phenolics suppress the utilisation of protein in the rumen, and as a result feed intake. Despite the crude protein always being above 14%, supplementing with a high- protein feed like lupin seed stimulates animal feed intake when phenolics are high in tagasaste. Tagasaste typically has the same nutritional value as the best type of alfalfa when planted on good soil balanced in nutrients. Daily weight gains of 1 to 1.5 kg per steer per day are achieved during the growing season, with 6-10 rotations per year, typically one every 6=8 weeks. Flowering also changes the palatability of tagasaste. In Western Australia it will commence flowering in winter (~ June). The seeds are mature and shed in early summer (first warm day in December). In the summer following flowering the palatability changes in different parts of the plant. In tagasaste that has not flowered the leaves will be grazed and bark on the stems ignored. After flowering the leaf becomes less palatable and the bark more palatable. This results in stock stripping bark off the trunk. Also the growth rate of the plant slows and leaves will be shed. The grazing management is designed to prevent flowering and keep tagasaste in the vegetative juvenile state. Trials have shown that if tagasaste is heavily grazed an or mechanically cut in the first six months of the year, it will not flower in the second half of the year. Occasionally when mechanically cutting, one limb on a plant can be missed. This limb will go on to flower, and show all the other problems, while the rest of the plant is maintained in a vegetative state. Initially tagasaste was developed to replace hand feeding sheep during autumn in Western Australia, when feed supplies were normally very low. This involved locking the tagasaste up for 11 months and then grazing it with 100 sheep per hectare for a month. As the tagasaste grows to about 3 metres height in 11 months, it must be mechanically cut while the sheep are in the paddock. Sheep can not be set stocked on tagasaste as this can lead to plant deaths. A breakthrough came with the discovery that cattle can be set stocked on tagasaste. Cattle tongues are too large to pick off the new shoot buds, and some leaves always remain on the plant. Sheep can remove every leaf from tagasaste but this does not cause plant deaths. The removal of new buds by sheep, which appear about six weeks after grazing, can lead to plant deaths. Today the majority of tagasaste is used for cattle grazing with plantations able to be grazed at any time of year. Though it can grow up to 5 metres in height, when managed for grazing it is kept to less than 2 metres in height. On the poor white sands in Western Australia tagasaste has increased the animal carrying capacity from 1 to 2 dry sheep equivalents, with annual pastures to 8-10 dry sheep equivalents (~ 1 cow) per hectare with mature tagasaste. This is roughly a tenfold increase in soil fertility-based carrying capacity. The yield of edible dry matter (leaves and fine stems) in the West Midlands is mostly in the range of 3-5 tonnes per hectare. It also prevents the wind erosion and excessive ground water recharge that were major environmental problems before. Recently it has been found that tagasaste can sequester carbon at the rate of about 6 tonnes CO2 equivalent per hectare per year. About half the CO2 being stored is as organic carbon in the soil and half is in the wood of the branches, trunk and roots. Tagasaste typically yields roughly 1 ton of edible material per 100mm of rain per hectare per year. Tagasaste by country Australia The potential of tagasaste as a Spanish fodder was identified by Dr Perez, a medical practitioner, based on La Palma island in the Canary Islands in the 1870s, and Spanish cattle farmers. He wrote to the Spanish authorities promoting tagasaste as a fodder shrub but could not get them interested. He then sent seed to Kew Gardens in England. Kew Gardens tested tagasaste and then sent seed to all its colonies around the world. In Australia, tagasaste's potential was promoted by a number of individuals over the next century (e.g. Dr Schomburge in South Australia and Dr Laurie Snook in Western Australia) but was not adopted on a large scale until the 1980s in Western Australia. The first 2 ha of tagasaste in the West Midlands was planted by John Cook on his farm near Dandaragan in 1982. The success of this small paddock excited the interest of local farmers and researchers. Before this the farming systems in the region were totally based on annual pastures and crops. The region has strongly winter dominant rainfall, with up to eight months without rain over some summers. Until the development of tagasaste it was believed it was not possible to grow perennial pastures in this region. In 1984 the Martindale Research Project was started by the University of Western Australia with a large grant from Sir James McCusker. This project encouraged the participation of local farmers and the Western Australia Department of Agriculture in research and development. Farmers such as John Cook and Bob Wilson at Lancelin developed seeding and mechanical cutting equipment that allowed tagasaste to be sown and managed cheaply by farmers on a broadacre scale. The Martindale Research Project resolved many issues relating to agronomy, animal production and economics that resulted in a reliable package that farmers could adopt with confidence. The Western Australia Department of Agriculture also conducted trials on their Badgingarra Research Station and at Bob Wilson's farm at Lancelin. Local farmers and researchers formed the West Midlands Fodder Shrub Improvement Group. This evolved into the Evergreen Group, which expanded its interests to include a range of other shrubs, grasses and perennial legumes. There are now about 100,000 ha of tagasaste in Western Australia. In Western Australia it is mostly grown on deep, infertile sands in regions nearer the coast with 350 to 600 mm rainfall. Most of the tagasaste in Western Australia is in the West Midlands sand plain to the north of Perth. New Zealand The use of tagasaste as a fodder crop was identified as early as 1897 in the Taranaki Region. it is still recommended as a fodder crop in some parts of the country but it also is becoming an invasive species. The Department of Conservation, a government agency responsible for protecting public conservation land, considers tagasaste to be an \\"environmental weed\\". Cultivars In Australia a prostrate form of tagasaste has been developed by selection, called Weeping Tagasaste. It is hoped that this plant will not require mechanical cutting or pruning. It is too early to say whether Weeping Tagasaste will yield the same production levels as that of normal tagasaste. Initial indicators are that production is lower and that the plant may be more vulnerable to soil disease. In South Africa three eco adapted genetic lines have been trademarked: \\"Green Kalahari\\"\\"Green Kalahari\\" for arid areas (300-500mm), \\"Cattle Candy\\"\\"Cattle Candy\\" for temperate areas (600-800mm) and \\"Kilimanjaro\\"\\"Kilimanjaro\\" cultivar for tropical highland areas (800-3500mm) of rain. commercial breeding of tree lucerne cultivars have led to improved varieties with increased hardiness, disease resistance and a wider range of growing conditions and applications. The use of tree lucerne for silvopasture agroforestry as a companion crop is one example of dual use of the same land for increased production. Sheep are then used to suppress weeds and keep the tree lucerne in check, preventing it from shadowing out the main forestry crop. The biological fertilisation is enhanced with green manure and trampling, improving the soil over time, and leading to production increases.

One hundred and twenty- eight persons, of 209 aboard, lost their lives when the ship sank. The lighthouse was constructed by contractor James McMahon who hired sailors from San Francisco after his original crew refused to work in the dangerous conditions. Mile Rocks Lighthouse was finished in 1906 after considerable difficulty caused by the heavy seas and strong currents near the site.

An adventurous pedestrian tour across the European continent followed graduation, terminating in a brief service in the French army in Algeria. On his return to England he studied law at Gray's Inn, abandoning it shortly for literary pursuits. In 1843 he published \\"The Irish Revolution, or What can the Repealers do? And what shall be the New Constitution?\\" (\\"Tablet\\", IV, 532), and in 1845 a vindication of the Jesuits (Oxford and Cambridge Review, September, 1845), a controversial article that provoked more than passing interest. The results of his pedestrian tour and military service were apparent in a series of contributions to Colburn's \\"United Service Magazine\\" (from September, 1845 to October, 1846). For a few months in 1846 he became editor of \\"Dolman's Magazine\\", and on 21 November of that year, married Anne de la Pierre, daughter of an English army officer. In 1847 appeared his \\"Life of Saint Alexis, the Roman Patrician\\". For the next twelve years he served on the staff of The Morning Post, becoming its representative at St. Petersburg in 1850. In 1852 his first novel, Harding, the Money-Spinner, appeared, serially, in the London Journal, and in 1856, on the occasion of the coronation of Alexander II of Russia, he was again at St. Petersburg representing The Morning Post. On this occasion he met Boucher de Perthes, in whose reminiscences Keon is pleasantly appreciated. On his return in 1859 from Calcutta in British India, where he had been sent \\"under a mistaken arrangement\\" to edit the \\"Bengal Hurkaru\\", he was appointed colonial secretary at Bermuda, a position which he held until his death. In 1866 appeared \\"Dion and the Sibyls, a romance of the First Century\\". The year following, at Mechanics' Hall, Hamilton, he gave a course of lectures on \\"Government, its Source, its Form, and its Means\\", declining subsequently to lecture in the United States on account of his official position. He attended the opening of the First Vatican Council at Rome in 1869.

The play was first published in quarto in 1611, printed by Nicholas Okes for the bookseller Thomas Archer. The title page of the first edition states that the play was performed at the Fortune Theatre by Prince Henry's Men, the troupe known in the previous reign as the Admiral's Men. The title page also attributes the authorship of the play to \\"T. Middleton and T. Dekkar\\", and contains an \\"Epistle to the Comic Play-Readers\\" signed by \\"Thomas Middleton\\". The Epistle is noteworthy for its indication that Middleton, atypically for dramatists of his era, composed his plays for readers as well as theatre audiences.Logan and Smith, p. 52. The Roaring Girl is a fictionalized dramatization of the life of Mary Frith, known as \\"Moll Cutpurse\\", a woman who had gained a reputation as a virago in the early 17th century. (The term \\"roaring girl\\" was adapted from the slang term \\"roaring boy\\", which was applied to a young man who caroused publicly, brawled, and committed petty crimes.) She was also the subject of a lost chapbook written by John Day titled The Mad Pranks of Merry Moll of the Bankside, which was entered into the Stationers' Register on 7 August 1610.The lost work by Day was probably a pamphlet, not a play; Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 289. Frith also appears in Nathaniel Field's Amends for Ladies, which dates from this same era of ca. 1611.Chambers, Vol. 3, pp. 296‚Äì7. On the basis of documents from a surviving lawsuit, the actual Mary Frith seems to have been the type of person that Middleton and Dekker depicted.Logan and Smith, p. 15. The real Mary Frith may have even stepped in once to play her own part as Moll in a performance of The Roaring Girl at the Fortune Theatre. Characters * Moll ‚Äì the Roaring Girl * Sebastian Wengrave ‚Äì a cunning young man, wants to marry Mary Fitz- Allard regardless of her social status * Sir Alexander Wengrave ‚Äì Sebastian's overbearing father who will let him marry only a woman with a large dowry * Mary Fitz-Allard ‚Äì a young woman * Sir Guy Fitz-Allard ‚Äì Mary's father * Neatfoot ‚Äì Sir Alexander's man * Trapdoor ‚Äì a spy * Sir Adam Appleton * Sir Davy Dapper ‚Äì father of Jack Dapper * Sir Beauteous Ganymede * Lord Noland * Jack Dapper ‚Äì son of Sir Davy Dapper * Gull ‚Äì Jack Dapper's page * Laxton ‚Äì a gallant * Goshawk ‚Äì a gallant * Greenwit ‚Äì a gallant * Tiltyard ‚Äì a feather- seller * Openwork ‚Äì a sempster * Gallipot ‚Äì an apothecary * Mistress Gallipot ‚Äì Gallipot's wife, has an affair with Laxton Synopsis Act I Scene 1: Sebastian's chambers in Sir Alexander's house Mary Fitz- Allard and Sebastian are in love, but their fathers will never permit the union, as Sebastian's father (Sir Alexander) demands too large a dowry for Mary. However, Sebastian has a plan to enable the match: he will pretend to be in love with Moll Cutpurse, a notorious cross-dressing thief, and his father will be so worried that he will see marriage to Mary as the preferable alternative. Scene 2: The parlour of Sir Alexander's house Sebastian's father is worried about his son's pursuing a grotesque \\"man-woman.\\" Sebastian pretends to be outraged, and asks if his father would be happy if he married Mary instead. His father says no. Sir Alexander calls the spy and parasite Trapdoor, and sets him to follow Moll, get into her services, and find a way to destroy her. Trapdoor agrees. Act II Scene 1: The three shops open in a rank A scene in the street. Various gallants are talking to the shopkeepers and flirting with their wives. The gallant Laxton flirts with Mistress Gallipot in the tobacco-shop. He does not actually like her much, but is keeping her on a string in order to get money from her to take other girls out. Jack Dapper, a young profligate, enters to buy a feather to show off with. Moll enters and Laxton takes a fancy to her, assuming that because she dresses as a man, she is morally loose. Laxton courts Moll; she agrees to meet him at Gray's Inn Fields at 3 PM. Trapdoor then presents himself to Moll and offers to be her servant. She is dubious but agrees to meet him in Gray's Inn Fields a bit after 3 PM. Scene 2: A street Sebastian's father is spying on him at home. Moll enters and Sebastian woos her. She is polite but rebuffs him: she is chaste and will never marry. He says he will try again later. She exits and Sir Alexander rebukes his son, saying that Moll will disgrace him because she is a whore and a thief. Sebastian says that there is no proof of those accusations. Sir Alexander exits, still more resolved to publicly shame Moll. Sebastian decides that he must confess his plan to her in hopes that he will get her to help him and Mary. Act III Scene 1: Gray's Inn Fields Laxton enters for his rendezvous with Moll. She appears dressed as a man; he goes towards her but she challenges him to a fight: he has impugned her honor, assuming that all women are whores. He is wrong to assume so‚Äîand also wrong to treat whoring lightly, as it is a sin that many good women are forced to, for lack of an alternative. They fight and she wounds him; he retreats and exits, shocked. Trapdoor enters. Moll teases and taunts him, but she finally accepts that his motives are good and agrees to take him on as her servant. Scene 2: Gallipot's house Mistress Gallipot is continuing her covert affair with Laxton, which her husband does not suspect. He has sent her a letter asking for a loan of thirty pounds, which she does not have. She formulates a plan, tearing the letter and wailing. She tells Gallipot that Laxton is an old suitor, to whom she was betrothed before they married. She thought him dead, but now he has returned to claim his wife. Gallipot is horrified, as he loves his wife and has had children by her. She suggests buying Laxton off with thirty pounds and he agrees. Laxton enters. Mrs. Gallipot quickly apprises him of the situation and Gallipot offers him the money. Feigning anger at the loss of his \\"betrothed,\\" he takes it and exits, musing on the deceitfulness of women. Scene 3: Holborn Street Trapdoor tells Sir Alexander what he has learned: Sebastian and Moll plan to meet at 3 o'clock in his (Sir Alexander's) chamber to have sex. They decide to trap her. Meanwhile, Sir Davy Dapper talks to Sir Alexander about his son, Jack, who is still wild and profligate, whoring, drinking, and gambling. Sir Davy has decided to teach his son a lesson: he will arrange to have Jack arrested, trusting a few days in the counter (the debtor's prison) to bring him to his senses. The sergeants enter and Sir Davy (pretending not to be Jack's father) gives them their instructions. Jack and his servant Gull enter, and are about to be set on by the sergeants; but Moll, who has been watching, warns him away. Jack escapes, and Moll mocks the police, who can do nothing. Act IV Scene 1: Sir Alexander's chamber Sir Alexander and Trapdoor await Moll and Sebastian. Sir Alexander lays out diamonds and gold in the hope that Moll will try to steal them. Sebastian and Moll enter with Mary Fitz-Allard (who is disguised as a page). Moll, in on the plan, aims to help them. She plays on the viol and sings. She then sees the jewels but only comments on them, rather than stealing them. Scene 2: Openwork's house The citizens' wives discuss the gallants, agreeing that they don't really understand life, women, or relationships. A young man enters pretending to have legal document calling the Gallipots to court for breach of contract. This is Laxton's doing‚Äîafter the thirty pounds, he demanded another fifteen, and now he is asking for a hundred in order to hold his peace. Mistress Gallipot is shocked. Her husband wants to pay Laxton off again, but she feels forced by the enormity of the sum to confess that all this was a lie, that she was never betrothed to Laxton. Gallipot asks for an explanation. Laxton \\"confesses\\" that he had courted Gallipot's wife but had been refused, but that she promised she would always help Laxton out if he were in need; thus they concocted this story to get money. Gallipot believes them; Laxton is not punished, but ends up being their guest for dinner. Act V Scene 1: A street Moll tells Jack how she saved him from the sergeants and he thanks her. He knows that his father set the law on him, and is amused at the idea that time in jail would cure him, when in fact jail just teaches people how to be worse. Moll has grown to suspect Trapdoor's honesty and has discharged him. Trapdoor enters, disguised as a soldier, but Moll sees through him. A gang of cutpurses enter to try to rob them, but Moll sees them off: she is known and feared by all rogues. Moll explains that she thinks it her duty to protect the honest through her knowledge of London's low-lifes. Scene 2: Sir Alexander's house Sir Alexander hears that his son and Moll have fled to get married. Sir Guy, Mary's father, gently mocks Sir Alexander, saying it is his fault for opposing the match with Mary. Sir Guy then offers to wager all his lands, against half of Sir Alexander's, that Sebastian and Moll will not wed. Sir Alexander takes the bet, declaring that anyone in the world but Moll would make a welcome daughter-in-law. A servant announces Sebastian and his bride; he enters, hand in hand with Moll. Sir Alexander is horrified, but demands Sir Guy's lands. The trick is then revealed: Mary is brought in as Sebastian's bride. Sir Alexander, vastly relieved, apologizes to both Mary and her father, and happily grants half his lands to the happy couple. Moll, asked when she will marry, says she never will. Trapdoor enters to confess that he was set on her by Sir Alexander, who promises never again to value someone according to public opinion. Authorship Critics and scholars who have attempted to differentiate the shares of the two collaborators in the play have not reached a full consensus, though the general tendency has been to attribute the romantic main plot of Mary Fitz-Allard largely to Dekker, and the Moll Cutpurse subplot mainly to Middleton.Logan and Smith, p. 27. David Lake, in his study of authorship problems in Middleton's canon, produces the following division of authorship. :Dekker ‚Äî Act I; Act III, scenes ii‚Äìiii; Act IV, scene ii; Act V, scene i; :Middleton ‚Äî Act II; Act III, scene i; Act IV, scene i; Act V, scene ii. Lake also favors the view of Fredson Bowers that the play was printed from a manuscript in Dekker's autograph.Lake, pp. 52‚Äì6. Paul Mulholland emphasizes that \\"most scenes reveal evidence of both dramatists\\", while \\"Few scenes point conclusively to either dramatist as the main writer\\". He quotes with approval Cyrus Hoy's observation that \\"the designation 'Middleton and Dekker' is the only one appropriate for much of the play\\".Mulholland, pp. 8, 11. Analysis There is much speculation surrounding the impact of Moll Cutpurse's character within The Roaring Girl. Critics have discussed how she shapes gender relations, and how she represents a woman's situation in Early Modern England. Because she is a \\"man-woman\\", scholars have debated over Middleton and Dekker's use of this construct. The contradictory ideals Moll exposes throughout the play challenge her reputation and whether her ill-repute is deserved or not. Moll's male attire upholds her \\"female\\" modesty by literally covering her body. Her male attitude creates an identity of immorality regarding women having a male libido. Yet, she is chaste and not interested in pursuing relations with men (which is not to say that she is asexual necessarily). Her negative reputation is seemingly not deserved but is upheld throughout the play.  See also  * Hic Mulier * Haec-Vir References ; Notes ; References * Chambers, E. K.

Author  According to chapter 2 (Subjects of copyright) of the Law No. 8/1996 on authors rights and related rights, the Author is the natural person or persons who created the work. It is presumed to be the author the person under whose name the work was first brought to public knowledge. When the work has been made public in anonymous form or under a pseudonym that does not allow the identification of the author, the copyright shall be exercised by the natural or legal person making it public with the consent of the author, as long as he does not disclose his identity.

Works protected by copyright According to chapter III (Object of copyright) of the Law No. 8/1996 on authors rights and related rights, any original works (creation of human mind) in the literary, artistic or scientific fields, whatever the mode of creation, mode or form of expression, and regardless of their value and purpose, are protected by copyright. The article 7 of the Law No. 8/1996 on authors rights and related rights provides a non-exhaustive list of works protected by copyright, such as: # literary and publicist writings, conferences, sermons, pleadings, lectures and any other written or oral works, as well as computer programs; # scientific, written or oral works such as communications, studies, university courses, school textbooks, scientific projects and documentation; # musical compositions with or without text; d) dramatic, dramatic and musical works, choreographic works and pantomime; # cinematographic works, as well as any other audiovisual works; # photographic works, as well as any other works expressed by an analogue process of photography; # works of graphic or plastic art, such as sculpture, painting, engraving, lithography, monumental art, scenography, tapestry, ceramics, glass and metal, drawings, designs and other works of art intended for practical use; # architectural works, including drawings, layouts and graphic works that make up architectural projects; # plastic works, maps and drawings in the field of topography, geography and science in general.  Copyright formalities  In Romania, there is no requirement for a copyright notice in order to obtain copyright protection, as original works are automatically protected by copyright as of their creation. However, the author and other copyright holders are entitled to place on their works a copyright notice consisting of the letter C in a circle together with their name, and the place and year of the first publication. In cases where such a copyright notice is displayed, there is a presumption that the work is copyright protected in favour of the person using the copyright notice, until otherwise proven.  Duration of copyright protection  Duration of copyright protection is defined by chapter V (Object of copyright) of the Law No. 8/1996 on authors rights and related rights. The general rule is that the patrimonial rights of the author last for seventy (70) years after his or her death. If there are no heirs, the exercise of these rights rests with the collective management body mandated during the lifetime by the author or, in the absence of a mandate, by the collective management body with the largest number of members in the field of creation.  Copyright infringement  Holders of copyright or related rights can file for infringement when there is: * Unauthorised use of their works (by reproduction, distribution, loan, lease, communication to the public (including making available), importation, broadcasting, retransmission by cable networks or by making derivative works). * Infringement of moral rights (first publication, attribution, right to choose name for publication, right to maintain integrity of the work, and right to retract the work). * Infringement of the droit de suite (right to equitable remuneration).

Role and history Its role was and is to enter into agreements with the Government as to how compensation claims from people who have been involved in accidents which were caused by uninsured or untraced drivers may be compensated. Section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 requires every insurer dealing with compulsory motor insurance to belong to the MIB and to contribute to its funding. According to the MIB's website's FAQ section, the cost of funding the MIB is ultimately borne by law-abiding motorists who pay their insurance premiums. The offices are near the junction of the A422 (Monks Way) and B4034 (Marlborough Street) in Linford Wood, Milton Keynes.  MIB schemes  The MIB run three types of schemes that help the victims of negligent drivers named \\"The uninsured drivers scheme\\", \\"The untraced driver‚Äôs scheme\\" and \\"The green card scheme\\".  The Uninsured Drivers Scheme  This scheme deals with compensation claims arising out of accidents caused or contributed to by an uninsured driver. Where it is shown that no policy of insurance exists covering the responsible party‚Äôs vehicle, the MIB will consider dealing with a claim for compensation from the \\"victim\\". Liability still needs to be assessed but because the negligent (and uninsured) party has been formally identified, the MIB recognise that the innocent victim has rights of full legal redress once fault is proven. This assumes that the MIBs own claims criteria are met. Claims will be considered for the cost of repairing/replacing the vehicle (comprehensively insured policyholders precluded), hire charges, loss of use and property damage. An injured party can also claim for treatment and/or rehabilitation for pain and suffering. Legal costs are paid in full by the MIB once the claim is proven.  The Untraced Drivers Agreement (hit and run) scheme  This scheme applies to the victims of hit and run driver accidents. Where the driver deemed to be responsible for an accident, leaves the scene and is not traced, the MIB will consider a claim for compensation in respect of both property and personal injury damages. There are a number of restrictions imposed with this scheme not least the fact that one cannot recover legal fees in full.  The Green Card Scheme  This scheme involves accidents caused by the negligent driving of foreign motorists. The MIB will under certain circumstances agree to step in and deal with claims from innocent victims of such accidents, rather than force the injured victim to seek compensation from a potentially uncommunicative foreign insurer. The concept of this scheme was introduced to the UK as a result of European Union (EU) legislation. The MIB is a member of the international Council of Bureaux Scams The MIB has issued a warning about scammers who spoof the MIB's telephone number and make cold calls encouraging people to make false insurance claims.Scam calls on MIB web site This scam has been known about since at least August 2013.Scam Warning ‚Äì Motor Insurer‚Äôs Bureau Claims See also * Association of British Insurers Notes External links * The Motor Insurers' Bureau - Official website News items * Uninsured drivers in September 2009 * Young uninsured drivers in August 2009 * Bradford drivers in February 2008 * Inner city drivers in September 2006 * Working Lunch August 2006 * Rogue drivers in June 2006 * Merseyside crime in February 2006 Category:Vehicle insurance Category:Insurance companies of the United Kingdom Category:Companies based in Milton Keynes Category:Financial services companies established in 1946 Category:1946 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Driving in the United Kingdom ","title":"Motor Insurers' Bureau"},{"id":"7107397","text":"Zack Kim Yong Woon or Zack Kim is a Korean guitarist.

Biography Vamplew joined Mid-Kent Astronomical Society in 1979, later becoming chairman and editor of the society's quarterly journal, Pegasus. His first radio appearance was on BBC Radio Kent in 1986 during the approach of Halley's Comet. On the same station, Vamplew soon created his astro-persona \\"Captain Cosmos\\", presenting a monthly live phone-in. This was followed by an astronomy series entitled the Essential Guide to the Night Sky, which ran for eight months. From March 1993 to July 2002 he toured schools, colleges and museums, giving talks about space and astronomy to children and adults in the Astrodome inflatable mobile planetarium. He was also involved in writing the shows. In November 1996 he was asked to write and present a Universe Special for the BBC World Service youth programme, Megamix. He then became a regular presenter of the programme (along with Nikita Gulhane and Brenda Emmanus) until it ended in March 1999. During that time he produced a series of features entitled the Captain Cosmos Guide to the End of the World. Also on the World Service, Vamplew wrote and presented a 10-part astronomy series: Captain Cosmos' Galactic Guide which was broadcast twice in 1998, plus he was the resident astronomy expert from March 1999 to March 2000 on the youth programme, The Edge. On 5 November 1997, he made his first of 30 regular appearances on the BBC Children's programme, Blue Peter. For a time Vamplew became known as the Blue Peter Astronomer BBC - Communicate - Chat Archive and undertook two overseas assignments to the telescopes of La Palma and Hawaii. In 1999 Vamplew joined the Royal Observatory Greenwich working as a presenter in their original Caird Planetarium. Once the redevelopment of the Observatory site began in late 2004 he joined the team that would equip the new, then to be named, Peter Harrison Planetarium. He left his newer role of Planetarium Producer and the Observatory itself in May 2007. He wrote the Beginners' Guide in the BBC Sky at Night magazine from February 2006 util May 2013.

It is located on Long Pine Key Road in the Everglades National Park. The site with 22 buildings opened in 1964 and closed in 1979 when it was turned over to the National Park Service. History and description The Homestead-Miami Defense Area was established as a result of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and was the last fixed air defense missile system to remain in operation in the continental United States. HM-69 was the westernmost of the Nike-Hercules sites ringing Miami. The south Florida sites were unique in operating an anti-tactical ballistic missile version of the Nike-Hercules, intended to intercept missiles fired from Cuba.Hach, p. 86 A portion of the district's missiles were armed with nuclear warheads.Hach, p. 85 The battery was initially stationed in temporary facilities from 1962 to 1965 just outside the park entrance at a site near State Road 9336. Construction of the completed Battery A, as it was known, was completed in 1964 in a portion of the park known as the \\"Hole in the Donut\\", formerly occupied by Iori Farms. The launch site consisted of three above- ground launch units, each with four missiles. Above-ground units were required in the Everglades due to the high water table. A mobile HIPAR radar unit provided radar coverage. The fire control site was located to the north and is used by the Park Service as the Daniel Beard Research Center.Hach, p. 45 Preservation On July 27, 2004, Battery A/HM-69 was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

It allows website publishers to more easily find and participate in affiliate programs which are suitable for their website (and thus generate income from those programs), and allows websites offering affiliate programs (typically online merchants) to reach a larger audience by promoting their affiliate programs to all of the publishers participating in the affiliate network. Uses Traditional affiliate networks enable merchants to offer publishers a share of any revenue that is generated by the merchant from visitors to the publisher's site, or a fee for each visitor on the publisher's site that completes a specific action (making a purchase, registering for a newsletter, etc.). The majority of merchant programs have a revenue share model, as opposed to a fee-per-action model. For merchants, affiliate network services and benefits may include tracking technology, reporting tools, payment processing, and access to a large base of publishers. For affiliates, services and benefits can include simplifying the process of registering for one or more merchant affiliate programs, reporting tools, access to product API's and payment aggregation. Affiliates are generally able to join affiliate networks for free, whereas there is generally a fee for merchants to participate. Traditional affiliate networks might charge an initial setup fee and/or a recurring membership fee. It is also common for affiliate networks to charge merchants a percentage of the commissions paid to affiliates, this is known as an 'over-ride' and is payable on top of the affiliates commission. Affiliate networks are also wary of new affiliates who do not have any known connections or experience in the industry because there have been many instances where individuals have tried to game the affiliate network. The current technological advances have given many tools to affiliate networks to fight cyber fraud in a more meaningful and effective way. Affiliate Marketers can also join as an affiliate directly with major companies as they may have affiliate programs on their websites. Performance network In addition to the traditional networks, performance networks also exist. Performance networks are typically networks that, in addition to performance based promotions also offer CPM- or CPC-based display advertising. Performance networks, on the other hand, are often so-called \\"Middle Men\\" who are themselves affiliates of merchants via the traditional affiliate networks.

Grammatica was born in either Siena or Rome. According to Giovanni Baglione the artist was given the name Antiveduto (\\"foreseen\\") because his father had a premonition that he would soon be born during a journey between his native Siena and Rome. It was in Rome that Antiveduto was baptised, raised and based his career. His apprenticeship with the Perugian artist Giovanni Domenico Angelini (Giandomenico Perugino) introduced him to small-scale work, mostly on copper. He gained the nickname \\"gran Capocciante\\" because he specialised in painting heads of famous men. A decade later, in 1591, Antiveduto set up as an independent artist. Grammatica's earliest surviving public commission, an old-fashioned configuration depicting Christ the Saviour with St. Stanislaus of Krakow, St. Adalbert of Prague and St Hyacinth Odrowaz, was painted for the high altar of Santo Stanislao dei Polacchi. Characterized by Giulio Mancini as most zealous in his profession, Antiveduto began his association with the Accademia di San Luca in 1593. He gained great familiarity with the two protectors of the Academy, Cardinals Federico Borromeo and Francesco Maria Del Monte, and was closely attached to the latter; so much that he was elected to the highest office of the association as \\"principe\\" in 1624. Shortly after this, however, he became embroiled in scandal. The machinations of Grammatica‚Äôs enemy Tommaso Salini over the attempt to sell off the Accademia's altarpiece, thought to be by Raphael, brought about a humiliating retreat, when Cardinal Del Monte intervened to re- establish the constitution of the institution. His fortunes were in a way linked with the Cardinal himself, who was much frowned upon by the Barberini, and his death preceded that of Del Monte by four months, in April 1626. His works are exhibited in numerous public collections, including the State Hermitage Museum - St Petersburg, the Museo Nacional del Prado ‚Äì Madrid, the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, the Muzeul Na≈£ional Brukenthal - Sibiu/Hermannstadt, Romania, the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum ‚Äì Glasgow, and the Maison D‚ÄôArt Gallery, Monaco.

These migratory fish are found only in the Mae Klong, Mekong, and Chao Phraya River basins in Indochina. Populations have declined drastically due to habitat loss and overfishing, and the giant barb is now considered critically endangered. Thursday, 8 August 2019 Distribution and habitat Giant barbs are usually seen in large pools along the edges of large rivers, but seasonally enter smaller canals, floodplains, and flooded forests. Young barbs are usually found in smaller tributaries and swamps, but can acclimate to living in ponds, canals, and swamps. The fish generally live in pairs.Southeast Asia Rivers Network. \\"The Return of Fish, River Ecology and Local Livelihoods of the Mun River : A Thai Baan (Villagers') Research\\" n.p. November 2004. p. 59 These are migratory fish, swimming to favorable areas for feeding and breeding in different parts of the year. These slow-moving fish subsist on algae, phytoplankton, and fruits of inundated terrestrial plants, rarely (if ever) feeding on active animals. In the lower Mekong basin, young giant barbs have been reported as occurring primarily in October. Physical characteristics Barb captured in a fishing boat The head is rather large for the body, with no barbels. The giant barb ranks among the largest freshwater fish in the world, and is probably the largest fish in the family Cyprinidae.Nelson, Joseph S. (2006). Fishes of the World. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. It may reach (although this claimed maximum length needs confirmation) and weigh up to . Among the cyprinids, only the golden mahseer can reach a comparable length, but it is a relatively slender fish that weighs far less. Few large giant barbs are caught today. For example, no individual weighing more than has been caught in Cambodia since 1994. Today, the maximum length is about . This fish is a tetraploid, meaning it has four of each chromosome (as opposed to diploid, the normal number in animals). Conservation status Today, few barbs live to maturity. The main threats are from habitat loss (e.g., pollution and dams) and overfishing. The sharp population decline is well illustrated by catch data from Cambodia, where 200 tonnes of giant barbs were caught in 1964. By 1980, only about 50 fish were caught, and by 2000, only 10. It was formerly an important fish in local catches below the Khone Phapheng Falls, but surveys between 1993 and 1999 only located a single small individual. Consequently, the giant barb is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. It has been entirely extirpated from the Chao Phraya River. In a 2005 royal decree, the Kingdom of Cambodia designated this fauna as the national fish to bring conservation awareness to this species. In 2005, the giant barb was successfully domesticated and reproduced for the first time at the Vietnam National Breeding Center for Southern Freshwater Aquaculture. In 2012, it was successfully reproduced in the Breeding Center of An Giang Province of Vietnam. In 2010, the Vietnam National Breeding Center released 50,000 young giant barbs into the Tien River in Dong Thap province Vietnam, but a survey showed that only a few of them survived long enough to reach a weight of over one kilogram. At Mae Klong River in the area of Samut Songkhram Province, central Thailand. There are a lot of big giant barbs living there, and Chinese New Year every year. They will float up to eat Khanom chin noodles fed to them by people.  Cultivation  In recent years, raising giant barb has become common in Vietnam due to its high economic value. Two breeding centers in southern Vietnam offer about 1 million breeder giant barbs to farmers per year. When kept in floating cages in rivers, the fish grow fast and gain 7 kg to 9 kg per year. In ponds where the main diet is natural algae, the fish gain 2 to 5 kg per year. Usually, giant barbs are harvested after three years of cultivation when they weigh 6 to 10 kg, but some farmers keep raising their fish in ponds for more than seven years for them to reach 50 kg before harvesting.

Topical allusions suggest the play was written most likely in 1621. Authorship The play was first published in quarto in 1662 by the bookseller Francis Kirkman, with a title- page attribution of authorship to Middleton.The 1662 quarto crams the full- length play into only 52 pages, by printing all the verse as prose‚Äîa tactic Kirkman employs in other plays he printed, like The Birth of Merlin, also from 1662. Yet while Middleton's distinctive style is clearly present in some portions of the text, there are other sections that suggested to some critics the presence of a second hand. The early twentieth-century critic H. Dugdale Sykes was the first person to argue in favour of Webster as the second author.Sykes, pp. 159‚Äì72. Sykes' hypothesis won acceptance from a range of other scholars.Lake, pp. 175‚Äì6.

His new wife was raised in the court, and Beaufort worries that she will be profligate in her spending. Sir Francis replies that she may be young but she is sober and pious. Walter Camlet, a citizen and cloth merchant, enters, complaining that his own wife is always nagging him. He is looking after Sir Francis's two youngest children, who have been sent to him to be out of the way of their new stepmother. Knavesbe enters: a corrupt lawyer, with a fair and witty wife. He seeks advancement from Beaufort, who invites him to his house to work out a suitable arrangement. Young Cressingham (who has quarrelled with his father over his remarriage) and Young Franklin contemplate how they might improve their economic circumstances; after contemplating going to sea, Young Franklin says he has a plan to get money out of Camlet. Lady Cressingham enters, demanding richer and better clothes from her husband. Camlet pities Sir Francis, who has got himself caught by such a woman. Lady Cressingham tells her husband that she has heard about a land-deal: he should sell his estates and in return buy new land worth more. She also insists he give up the practice of alchemy. He agrees to be advised by her in all things. Act II Knavesbe and Mistress Knavesbe at home. He tries to make her confess that she has been unfaithful to him, telling her that he himself has slept around. This is, it emerges, part of his scheme with Lord Beaufort: Beaufort wants to sleep with her, and Knavesby has agreed to prostitute his wife in exchange for preferment. She is horrified. Beaufort enters and flirts with her; she is non- committal. When the two men exit, she reflects: she is shocked at the plan's wickedness, but has a scheme to derail the plot. Meanwhile, Mistress Camlet is suspicious of her husband, believing Cressingham's two children who are boarded in her house to be Camlet's bastards. Young Franklin and Young Cressingham, in disguise as a rich knight and his tailor, arrive at the Camlets' shop and persuade Camlet to let them take some very expensive fabrics on credit. Camlet's apprentice, Ralph, delivers; he is parted from the goods and left alone with Sweetball the barber-surgeon, who, persuaded that Ralph is suffering from venereal disease, threatens to cut off his penis. Ralph makes a swift exit, leaving the cloths behind. Act III Lord Beaufort's house; Knavesbe's wife turns up and flirts with Beaufort's page Selenger. When Beaufort agrees to see her, she \\"confesses\\" that she is in love with Selenger, and will give herself to Beaufort so long as she is given the page in return. He is disgusted by this insult and sends her back home, vowing vengeance on her husband. She exults at having kept her honesty in this way and hopes Beaufort will carry out his threat against Knavesbe, who she now hates. Meanwhile, Camlet catches up with Young Franklin and attempts to arrest him for the theft of the cloths; Franklin, with the help of a passing French bawd, manages to persuade Camlet that he is a Frenchman and it is a case of mistaken identity. George enters to say that Mistress Camlet will never trouble her husband again: enraged at the continuing presence of the children, she has left home to stay with her cousin, Knavesbe, and insists that she wants a divorce. Camlet is distraught: for all his wife's shrewishness, he loves her and wants her back. He resolves to send the children home. Act IV Sir Francis is distraught: he seems to have given over all his power to his wife, who is having his lands surveyed before organising the sale. Young Cressingham must also sign the bill of sale, and he laments at selling the inheritance; he brings in his two younger siblings (back from the Camlets') to sway their father's heart. Sir Francis, moved, refuses to sign; Lady Cressingham enters and flies into a rage, insisting that the lands be sold and new ones bought in Ireland. She threatens to leave her husband, never sleep with him again, and so on. Meanwhile, Mistress Knavesbe returns home to her husband, who is eager to hear how her assignation went. She affects to put on airs, insisting that she will never sleep with him again now she has tasted the life of the rich. He is a little worried but happy to reflect on the prosperity that lies ahead once he is rewarded. George enters, with an invitation for the couple to come to Camlet's wedding: he has decided that he too wants a divorce, and has taken up with a new woman. They tell Mistress Camlet and she is furious, resolving to go and kill everyone involved in her jealous frenzy. But it is all a plot; George has arranged for Margarita (the French bawd of Act III) to pose as Camlet's new bride. Mistress Camlet is madly jealous, but when she discovers that it is all a set-up, she repents; she loves her husband really. Act V Young Cressingham goes to his father's house, where Sir Francis is miserable: he has sold his land as his wife wanted and now he is treated like a child, given a meagre allowance. Old Franklin is in mourning; his son has faked his own death and is in disguise as a servingman. Young Cressingham accuses his stepmother of ruining the family; she is bold and laughs at him, and says, mysteriously, that hereafter she will treat him quite differently. He curses her, hoping she will die repenting her actions. Old Franklin pays off his \\"dead\\" son's debts, including those incurred by his theft of goods from Camlet. Meanwhile, Knavesby claims his reward from Lord Beaufort, only to be told that his wife did not fulfil the bargain, that she has instead run off with his page. Knavesby vaguely resolves to commit suicide. Mrs Knavesby enters with the \\"page\\" and reveals all: the page is actually Young Cressingham's wife, left with Lord Beaufort in disguise to protect her virtue. Lady Cressingham then enters and announces that she has only been testing her husband with her feigned shrewishness and avarice; she wanted to teach him to be wise and thrifty. Sir Francis is happy that his wife is really kind and virtuous, and he takes his lands back. Knavesby apologises to his wife for his behaviour and she forgives him. Young Franklin is revealed to be alive, which his father in fact knew all along (his \\"death\\" allowed Old Franklin to get away with only paying half his son's debts). All are reconciled, and Lord Beaufort invites everyone home to dinner. Notes References * Lake, David J. The Canon of Thomas Middleton's Plays.

(Annam was the common name of Vietnam at that time.) It was created by leaders of the Communist Youth League. The Communist Youth League was formed by Ho Chi Minh in 1926 as a section of the Vietnam Revolutionary Youth League.template Initially based in Guangzhou, southern China, the League created publications that were clandestinely smuggled into Vietnam. In 1927 the communists were expelled from Guangzhou by Chiang Kai-shek. The league's first (and only) congress was held in Hong Kong in May 1929. It was marred by factionalism that mirrored the struggle between Joseph Stalin and Nikolai Bukharin then going on in Moscow. Inspired by Stalin's call for communist separatism, Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Cung, head of league's Tonkin section, led a walkout by a group of delegates. Cung returned to Vietnam and, on June 17, founded the Communist Party of Indochina. Other Vietnamese communist leaders were reluctant to act decisively until the outcome in Moscow was clear. In August, the remaining leadership of the league founded the CPA.Noung, The prehistory of the Vietnamese Communist Party, Everything2.com.

On October 27, 1929, Comintern issued a letter criticizing the CPA, praising the ICP, and directing that a conference be held to reunite the parties.Duiker, p. 160. (This was the method of resolving the dispute proposed by the CPA leadership.) The two parties merged in February 1930 at a conference in Kowloon, forming the Communist Party of Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh, at this time a representative of Comintern, presided over this conference.

This involves calculating an estimate of the motor's magnetic flux and torque based on the measured voltage and current of the motor. DTC control platform Stator flux linkage is estimated by integrating the stator voltages. Torque is estimated as a cross product of estimated stator flux linkage vector and measured motor current vector. The estimated flux magnitude and torque are then compared with their reference values. If either the estimated flux or torque deviates too far from the reference tolerance, the transistors of the variable frequency drive are turned off and on in such a way that the flux and torque errors will return in their tolerant bands as fast as possible. Thus direct torque control is one form of the hysteresis or bang-bang control. 600 px Overview of key competing VFD control platforms: The properties of DTC can be characterized as follows: * Torque and flux can be changed very fast by changing the references * High efficiency & low losses - switching losses are minimized because the transistors are switched only when it is needed to keep torque and flux within their hysteresis bands * The step response has no overshoot * No dynamic coordinate transforms are needed, all calculations are done in stationary coordinate system * No separate modulator is needed, the hysteresis control defines the switch control signals directly * There are no PI current controllers. Thus no tuning of the control is required * The switching frequency of the transistors is not constant. However, by controlling the width of the tolerance bands the average switching frequency can be kept roughly at its reference value. This also keeps the current and torque ripple small. Thus the torque and current ripple are of the same magnitude as with vector controlled drives with the same switching frequency. * Due to the hysteresis control the switching process is random by nature. Thus there are no peaks in the current spectrum. This further means that the audible noise of the machine is low * The intermediate DC circuit's voltage variation is automatically taken into account in the algorithm (in voltage integration). Thus no problems exist due to dc voltage ripple (aliasing) or dc voltage transients * Synchronization to rotating machine is straightforward due to the fast control; Just make the torque reference zero and start the inverter. The flux will be identified by the first current pulse * Digital control equipment has to be very fast in order to be able to prevent the flux and torque from deviating far from the tolerance bands. Typically the control algorithm has to be performed with 10 - 30 microseconds or shorter intervals. However, the amount of calculations required is small due to the simplicity of the algorithm * The current measuring devices have to be high quality ones without noise because spikes in the measured signals easily cause erroneous control actions. Further complication is that no low-pass filtering can be used to remove noise because filtering causes delays in the resulting actual values that ruins the hysteresis control * The stator voltage measurements should have as low offset error as possible in order to keep the flux estimation error down. For this reason the stator voltages are usually estimated from the measured DC intermediate circuit voltage and the transistor control signals * In higher speeds the method is not sensitive to any motor parameters. However, at low speeds the error in stator resistance used in stator flux estimation becomes critical These apparent advantages of the DTC are offset by the need for a higher sampling rate (up to 40 kHz as compared with 6‚Äì15 kHz for the FOC) leading to higher switching loss in the inverter; a more complex motor model; and inferior torque ripple. The direct torque method performs very well even without speed sensors. However, the flux estimation is usually based on the integration of the motor phase voltages. Due to the inevitable errors in the voltage measurement and stator resistance estimate the integrals tend to become erroneous at low speed. Thus it is not possible to control the motor if the output frequency of the variable frequency drive is zero. However, by careful design of the control system it is possible to have the minimum frequency in the range 0.5 Hz to 1 Hz that is enough to make possible to start an induction motor with full torque from a standstill situation. A reversal of the rotation direction is possible too if the speed is passing through the zero range rapidly enough to prevent excessive flux estimate deviation. If continuous operation at low speeds including zero frequency operation is required, a speed or position sensor can be added to the DTC system. With the sensor, high accuracy of the torque and speed control can be maintained in the whole speed range. History DTC was patented by Manfred Depenbrock in the US and in Germany, the latter patent having been filed on October 20, 1984, both patents having been termed direct self-control (DSC). However, Isao Takahashi and Toshihiko Noguchi described a similar control technique termed DTC in an IEEJ paper presented in September 1984 and in an IEEE paper published in late 1986. The DTC innovation is thus usually credited to all three individuals. The only difference between DTC and DSC is the shape of the path along which the flux vector is controlled, the former path being quasi-circular whereas the latter is hexagonal such that the switching frequency of DTC is higher than DSC. DTC is accordingly aimed at low-to-mid power drives whereas DSC is usually used for higher power drives. (For simplicity, the rest of the article only uses the term DTC.) Since its mid-1980s introduction applications, DTC have been used to advantage because of its simplicity and very fast torque and flux control response for high performance induction motor (IM) drive applications. DTC was also studied in Baader's 1989 thesis, which provides a very good treatment of the subject. The first major successful commercial DTC products, developed by ABB, involved traction applications late in the 1980s for German DE502 and DE10023 diesel- electric locomotives and the 1995 launch of the ACS600 drives family. ACS600 drives has since been replaced by ACS800 and ACS880 drives. Vas, Tiitinen et al. and Nash provide a good treatment of ACS600 and DTC. DTC has also been applied to three-phase grid side converter control. Grid side converter is identical in structure to the transistor inverter controlling the machine. Thus it can in addition to rectifying AC to DC also feed back energy from the DC to the AC grid. Further, the waveform of the phase currents is very sinusoidal and power factor can be adjusted as desired. In the grid side converter DTC version the grid is considered to be a big electric machine. DTC techniques for the interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (IPMSM) were introduced in the late 1990s and synchronous reluctance motors (SynRM) in the 2010s. DTC was applied to doubly fed machine control in the early 2000s. Doubly fed generators are commonly used in 1-3 MW wind turbine applications. Given DTC's outstanding torque control performance, it was surprising that ABB's first servo drive family, the ACSM1, was only introduced in 2007. In fact, since DTC's implementation requires more sophisticated hardware to provide comparable performances to the FOC, its first industrial application came much later. From the end of 90's several papers have been published about DTC and its modifications such as space vector modulation, which offers constant switching frequency. In light of the mid-2000s expiration of Depenbrock's key DTC patents, it may be that other companies than ABB have included features similar to DTC in their drives.

Pre-war life Born in Paris, Kentucky, Colonel Dickey moved to Macomb, Illinois in 1834 to study law under Cyrus Walker and was admitted to the Illinois Bar in 1835. The next year, he moved Rushville, Illinois where he edited a newspaper and speculated in real estate in addition to his legal practice. In 1839, he again moved, this time to Ottawa, Illinois where he continued his legal career. Upon the outbreak of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War he raised a company of volunteers and received a commission as captain. At the end of the war, he returned to Ottawa, Illinois and was elected a judge of the Illinois Ninth Judicial Circuit in 1848. He resigned his position as judge in 1851 but continued in the practice of law. He was a prominent political supporter of Stephen A. Douglas, making many stump speeches for him in 1858 and 1860. Civil War career Dickey was authorized by the State of Illinois to raise a company of cavalry in August 1861. This company became the nucleus of the 4th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Cavalry, the recruitment of which resulted in a dispute between Colonel Dickey and Illinois Governor Richard Yates over the commissions to be granted to the officers of the regiment, a valuable tool of political patronage. In the end, Governor Yates accepted Colonel Dickey's choices and granted them their commissions. The 4th Illinois Cavalry completed its organization and was officially mustered into service on September 26, 1861. The regiment was sent to Cairo, Illinois soon after it was mustered in. Colonel Dickey commanded the regiment during the advance of Grant's army on Fort Henry, serving as the scouts and screening force, served in a supporting role during the attack on that place, and then again led the advance on Fort Donelson. Colonel Dickey's regiment was shipped to Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee where it participated in the Battle of Shiloh. Postwar career From 1868 to 1870, he served as an Assistant Attorney General for the United States for all suits in the court of claims, and often argued before the United States Supreme Court in that role. Dickey was elected a justice of the Illinois Supreme Court in December 1875 and held that office until his death in 1885.Illinois State Supreme Court Website Biography of Colonel Dickey Notes Category:1811 births Category:1885 deaths Category:People from Paris, Kentucky Category:Illinois state court judges Category:Justices of the Illinois Supreme Court Category:People of Illinois in the American Civil War Category:People from Macomb, Illinois Category:People from Rushville, Illinois Category:People from Ottawa, Illinois Category:American military personnel of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War ","title":"Theophilus Lyle Dickey"},{"id":"7107631","text":"A.K.S.

History This chapel received damage from bombs which fell during the Battle of Britain in 1940 and a hole made in the stonework has been preserved and covered with glass. The Tudor glass in the window had also been blown out at the same time. The Dean of Westminster was approached early in 1943 by Mr. N. Viner-Brady who suggested the idea of a memorial to The Few and Dean Labilliere chose this small chapel as one suitable for the purpose. Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Trenchard and Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding headed a committee to raise funds for the furnishing of this chapel and for a stained glass window, which was unveiled by King George VI on 10 July 1947. Later the ashes of Trenchard and Dowding were interred there. Subsequently, the Battle of Britain Roll of Honour was placed in the chapel. It contains the names of the 1,497 pilots and aircrew killed or mortally wounded during the Battle of Britain. Illuminated by calligrapher Daisy Alcock, the original work was paid for by Captain Bruce Ingram. It is paraded annually during the Service of Thanksgiving and Rededication on Battle of Britain Sunday. Originally escorted by 12 Battle of Britain veterans, today the Roll of Honour Escort comprises Battle of Britain Veterans and serving Royal Air Force Junior Officers from an extant operational Squadron that fought in the Battle of Britain. Also buried in the RAF chapel are notable leaders of the RAF, including Lord Trenchard and Air Chief Marshal Dowding, as well as \\"Bomber\\" Harris, the man who led RAF Bomber Command during much of the Second World War. A tradition has grown that the remaining Battle of Britain veterans and their families hold their own, private service in the chapel prior to the Service of Thanksgiving and Rededication on Battle of Britain Sunday. Service of Thanksgiving and Rededication The annual service on Battle of Britain Sunday is held in Westminster Abbey on the Sunday on or following Battle of Britain Day (15 September), and has taken place annually since 1943; the first service took place in St Paul's Cathedral and since has taken place in Westminster Abbey. The format of the service has not changed since 1943. The Battle of Britain Roll of Honour is paraded through the abbey. Originally, it was escorted by 12 Battle of Britain veterans; today, the escort is made up of six veterans and six serving Junior Officers in the RAF. The RAF Fighter Command Silk Ensign is also carried through the abbey, borne and escorted by serving Junior RAF Officers from an extant Battle of Britain squadron that is currently operational. The Ensign Bearer always wears the Moneypenny Sword. The service is a ticket-only event, arranged by the Royal Air Force Ceremonial Office. Notices are placed in The Times and The Daily Telegraph newspapers in June. Applications can be made in writing to SO3 RAF Ceremonial Events at RAF Northolt by former Battle of Britain aircrew, relatives of Battle of Britain aircrew now deceased (either during the war or since), past or present members of the RAF or its reserve forces and members of the public.

It is one of the earliest California lighthouses and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Pen & Ink Drawing - U.S. Coast Guard Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo sailed along the California coast in search for glory and gold. On October 18, 1542, he encountered heavy winds upon rounding the Point and was forced to turn back to San Miguel Island where he died. Second-in-command Bartolom√© Ferrer took charge and again tried to round the Point but he was also unsuccessful. The Point was named Punta de la Limpia Concepcion by Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no in 1602, who was the next Spanish sailor to venture the Pacific waters along the California coast after Juan Cabrillo. The 1835 experience of the sailing ship Pilgrim, which was damaged and nearly capsized in a sudden change of weather here, is typical of boaters even today. It was here at Point Conception in 1856, that the lighthouse was built high on the sandstone cliffs, above the location of the present lighthouse. The first order Fresnel lenshttp://www.nps.gov/maritime/light/ptconc.htm and steel tower for the lighthouse were made in France at a cost of $65,068 and was transported around Cape Horn. A report indicates that the lighthouse was severely damaged during the Fort Tejon earthquake of January 9, 1857. Aerial view, 2009 The lighthouse was moved in 1881 because the fog would be less likely to obscure the light, and was rebuilt from the top of the bluff to a mesa halfway down, above the Pacific Ocean. The light station was automated by the United States Coast Guard in 1973. The lighthouse was used as the location for the film The Monster of Piedras Blancas (1959). In recent years Vandenberg Air Force Base restricts access from the northwest, and the Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve restricts access from the adjoining land although a few people have reached the lighthouse by hiking west along the narrow rugged public beach several miles from the nearest road during low tide. Some have also arranged well in advance with the Coast Guard for access.

Early career The attempt to rescue the Glorieux a pivotal moment in his career; tomb of Denis Decr√®s. Decr√®s was born in Ch√¢teauvillain, Haute-Marne on 18 June 1761 and joined the Navy at the age of 18, in the squadron of Admiral De Grasse. He took part in all the combats which this fleet had to sustain. While he was a member of the crew of the Richmond, during the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April 1782, he went in a boat under fire from British ships to attach a tow cable to the Glorieux, which had been dismasted out of the danger in which it was placed. He was rewarded with a promotion to enseigne de vaisseau. This event is commemorated on one side of his tomb. He was in India when the French Revolution broke out. Revolutionary era In October 1793, Decr√®s was sent as a messenger to request assistance for the Isle de France (now Mauritius). He was arrested on his arrival in Lorient, on 10 April 1794, for being a member of the nobility. He was restored to his rank of capitaine de vaisseau in June 1795, and promoted to command of the 80-gun ship Formidable in October 1795. While in command of her, he took part, as a division commander, in the failed attempt to invade Ireland in 1796. Promoted to contre-amiral in April 1798, he was in command of a light squadron during the campaign in Egypt, covering the landing on Malta. Napoleon appointed him to command the frigate squadron accompanying Brueys's fleet in the expedition to Egypt, and took part in the disastrous French defeat at the Battle of the Nile on the 40-gun frigate Diane and managed to escape to Malta, where he hoisted his flag aboard the 80-gun ship Guillaume Tell. During the period of 1799 - 1800, Decr√®s had under his command a rear admiral, Jacques Bedout, whom he saw fit to relieve of his command. Bedout's subsequent resignation was refused and in 1802, Napoleon gave Bedout a five-ship squadron. The flagship was the Argonaute.

Attacked by three British ships as he was trying to break the blockade of Malta on 30 March 1800, with 200 sick and 1000 soldiers aboard, he surrendered early next day with half of his crew killed or wounded. He was exchanged in August 1800, and returned to France, where the First Consul personally gave him an honour sabre - a grant of the \\"Arms of Honour\\" which Napoleon had introduced as a decoration before instituting the L√©gion d'honneur - and appointed him as maritime prefect at Lorient. From 3 October 1801 to the end of the Empire on 1 April 1814, he served as Napoleon's Minister of the Navy. During this period, he was again promoted - this time to vice-amiral - on 30 May 1804, In 1808, he was made a count of the empire. In April 1813 he was made a duke, and on 3 November that year he married Marie- Rose Rosine Clary of the influential Clary family, she was the cousin by birth of Julie Clary.

It opened at the Royalty Theatre in London on 1 January 1879. Tita in Thibet was written as a vehicle for the music hall star Kate Santley. Fred Leslie and W. H. Seymour, who would become the stage manager of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company for 20 years, also played in the piece, as did ex-D'Oyly Carte player Walter H. Fisher. The setting of the piece took advantage of the Victorian fad for anything Far East-themed. The became Desprez's most frequently played work and was later played by the Majilton theatre company more than a thousand times in the British provinces. Synopsis In China, a European idol merchant called Brum has a jealous wife named Tita. Brum decides to test his wife by pretending that love letters have been sent to him by another woman. Meanwhile, two Tibetan merchants (Chin-Chin and Po-Hi) and a young tea-gardener (Young Hyson) all seek to wed Tita. They point out that the customs of the country permit every wife to have four husbands. Brum is disgusted and enraged. To punish her husband for his imagined flirtations, Tita pretends to be charmed by the idea of marrying these suitors, and she agrees to meet them in the Temple of Fo to hold the wedding ceremonies. Brum hides in the Temple and disguises himself as an idol to watch the ceremony. Tita dresses Chin-Chin as a woman and fools Po-Hi and Young Hyson into making their expressions of love to \\"her\\". Eventually, Tita and Brum reconcile, and all ends happily. Critical reception The Era, a London newspaper, reviewed the piece, as follows: :Miss Santley appeared as Tita, a part which seemed to please her immensely. Her singing, like her speaking, was spoiled by affectation, although it is only right to say that in \\"I wish I was a man\\" and in \\"Poor Mrs. B.\\" ‚Äì both songs of the Music Hall class ‚Äì she was vociferously applauded by the youths in the gallery. In the second act Miss Santley wears a dress which gives a very liberal display of personal charms. Mr. W. H. Fisher played the part of Brum with considerable \\"go,\\" and his acting in the idol business of the second act was decidedly funny. Mr. Charles Groves exhibited some dry humour as Chin-Chin, but the everlasting talk about the umbrella which he carries may be modified with advantage. Very comical indeed was the Po-Hi of Mr. Frederick Leslie, whose method of indicating mental anguish called forth considerable merriment. Miss Alma Stanley made an imposing Young Hyson, and was of service in the interpretation of the music; the Great and Little Bonzes being respectively represented by Mr. C. A. White and Mr. W. H. Seymour. To those in search of a good and refined entertainment we certainly cannot recommend a visit to the Royalty.The Era, 5 January 1879, p. 12c/d Roles and original cast *Brum (a European idol merchant) ‚Äì Walter H.

The term Kashmiriyat has come to signify a centuries- old indigenous secularism of Kashmir. Emerging around the 16th century, it is characterised by religious and cultural harmony, patriotism and pride for their mountainous homeland of Kashmir. In recent 2007 poll conducted by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in New Delhi, 84 percent of people in Srinagar want to see the return of Kashmiri Pandits.87 pct in Kashmir Valley want independence - poll, Reuters, 13 August 2007 A 2001 MORI survey of popular opinion in the then-state of Jammu and Kashmir, including the Kashmir Valley, found 92% respondents opposed to the state being divided on the basis of religion or ethnicity. Kashmiris reject war in favour of democracy, Frontline, 8 June 2002.MORI Survey in Jammu and Kashmir, South Asia Terrorism Portal, 2001. However, scholar Christopher Snedden states that the concept of Kashmiriyat has been 'romanticised' and Kashmiriyat could not prevent antipathy and rivalry between the Kashmiri Pandits and the Kashmiri Muslims. Origins The Kashmir region enjoys significant ethnic, cultural and religious diversity. The region has historically been an important centre for Hinduism and Buddhism. Islam was introduced in the medieval centuries, and Sikhism also spread to the region under the rule of the Sikh Empire in the 18th and 19th centuries. Kashmir has a significant place in the mythology and history of all four religions. The region derives its name from the Kashmiri Pandit ancestor, named Rishi Kashyapa and is believed to have been the abode of the celestial beings. The region is home to many legendary Hindu and Buddhist monuments and institutions. The Hazratbal shrine houses a relic that is believed to be the hair of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. In his journeys seeking religious enlightenment, Guru Nanak travelled to Kashmir. Kashmiris believe that the ideas of Kashmiriyat the rule of Sultan Zain ul Abedin, who gave equal protection, importance and patronage to Kashmir's different religious communities. Philosophy Kashmir's existence is characterised by its insular Himalayan geography, harsh winter climate and isolation in economic and political terms. The region has also seen political turmoil and foreign invasions. Kashmiriat is believed to be an expression of solidarity, resilience and patriotism regardless of religious differences. It is believed to embody an ethos of harmony and a determination of survival of the people and their heritage. To many Kashmiris, Kashmiriat demanded religious and social harmony and brotherhood. It has been strongly influenced by Kashmir Shaivism, Buddhism and Sufism, carrying a long-standing conviction that any and every religion will lead to the same divine goal. Kashmir was also influenced by the Mughal emperor Akbar's genesis of a syncretic philosophy of Din-i-Illahi, which emphasized the blending of Hindu and Muslim ideals and values. Works in the Kashmiri language, art, culture and literature strongly expound and emphasize Kashmiriat as a way of life. However, the impact and importance of Kashmiriat has been concentrated in the Kashmir Valley only, which is the real historical Kashmir. The farther regions of Gilgit, Baltistan, Jammu and Ladakh have not been influenced by this philosophy, as these regions are not Kashmiri in terms of culture, language or ethnicity. Modern challenges The culture and ethos of Kashmiriat was greatly eroded at the onset of the Kashmir conflict, when the region was claimed by Pakistan and India and its territory divided during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947. In the political debate on sovereignty over Kashmir, many interpret Kashmiriat as nationalism and an expression for political independence from both Pakistan and India. The onset of militancy in Kashmir from 1989 has led to the exodus of almost all Hindus from Kashmir and violent attacks against the remaining communities of Hindus and Sikhs, further eroding the fabric of Kashmiriat. Amidst the wider dispute between India and Pakistan. Conscious efforts to revive Kashmiriat have been made by various communities of Muslims and Hindus through united opposition to violence in the state. Efforts to promote Kashmiriat through cultural activities, social programmes and literature have increased throughout Jammu and Kashmir and amongst expatriate Kashmiri communities.

Established in 1960, it was opened to the public in 1979 and became the first zoo in India to join World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) in 2009. It also contains a botanical garden and part of it has been declared a sanctuary. Nandankanan, literally meaning The Garden of Heaven, is located near the capital city, Bhubaneswar, in the environs of the Chandaka forest, and includes the Kanjia lake. A major upgrade was done in 2000 (after the damage caused by the super-cyclone of 1999 in coastal Odisha). More than 3.3 million visitors visit Nandankanan every year. History Forest officials decided in 1960 that including rare plants and animals in the Odisha pavilion at the World Agricultural Fair in Delhi would help increase attendance. Word was sent to the forest department to capture as many small animals as possible for the display. In all, the forest department managed to capture two spotted deer (Axis axis), two barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), two black buck (Antilope cervicapra), one mouse deer, one leopard cat, one flying squirrel, one racket-tailed drongo, one hornbill, two parrots, two hill mynah, one peacock, and a mongoose. In addition, the divisional forest officer of Deogarh captured a pangolin (scaly ant-eater) and two porcupines, and the divisional forest officer of Puri captured a pair of wild boars and a Python. All of these animals were delivered to the Delhi fair and exhibited at the Odisha pavilion. The State Finance Department raised objections to a zoo in Odisha because of the cost of both establishing and maintaining the facility. While the issue was being debated, animals arrived back at Bhubaneswar in May 1960, posing problems to the forest department for housing and feeding them. P. Mohandra (Divisional Forest Officer, Puri) and G. K. Das (Divisional Forest Officer, Deogarh) built temporary structures at Khandagiri for the animals, and the community of Jain helped feed them. Discussions about a real zoo started soon after Dr. H. K. Mahatab, then Chief Minister of Odisha, visited the animals. The initial proposal placed the zoo at Ghatikia close to Khandagiri and Udayagiri caves. However, this was deemed to pose water problems in the future. A zoo needs lot of water to meet the need of animals, cleaning of animals sheds and for various other purposes. The then Range Officer, Chandaka suggested Jujhagarh forest block on Kanjia lake near Barang Railway station as the most ideal location. The then Chief Conservator of Forests, Divisional Forest Officer, Puri, Range Officer, Chandaka and D.P. Ghosh, Forest Ranger visited the place and were impressed with its scenic beauty. Kanjia lake with its vast expanse over 125 acres low and undulating hills of Jujhagarh and Krushnanagar D.P.F.S. with lush green vegetation on both sides of the lake presented a picturesque site. Jujhagarh Forest Block had all the advantages for locating the zoo except communication from Bhubaneswar and the only approach was via Chandaka covering a distance of 38 km. A committee consisting of Dr. Radhanath Rath, Sri G.C. Dash and Sri D.N. Choudhury, the then Minister of Forests, Secretary, Forest and the Chief Conservator of Forests respectively visited the place. They were very much impressed with its aesthetic beauty and recommended location of the zoo there with construction of a straight road (a distance of 14 to 15 km) from Bhubaneswar. Accordingly, it was decided to locate the Zoological Park in Jujhagarh Forest Block, Botanical garden in Krushnanagar Forest Block and develop Kanjia lake for Boating and Angling. The Director, Fisheries agreed to develop a portion of the lake for rearing various kinds of fish for visitors to see. Initially it was decided to keep spotted deer, barking deer, black bucks, wild boars, sambars, nilagai and bears in spacious enclosures. Other animals like leopard cat, mongoose, flying squirrel, porcupine, python, monkeys, hyena, jackal, civet cat, pangolin, jungle cat, parrots, mynah and other birds in suitable cages. It was decided to put efforts to capture tigers and leopards which could be exhibited in suitable cages for the time being and the suitable spacious enclosures would be built for them later on. It was also decided to raise a good flower garden and to plant important species and medicinal plants of Odisha inside proposed Botanical garden in Krushnanagar D.P.F. Eventually the site around the Kanjia Lake was chosen. The lake would be developed for recreation as well. A road was built to the site, and Nandankanan Biological Park was officially inaugurated on 29 December 1960, by Sri S. K. Patil, then Indian Minister of Food and Agriculture. A botanical garden was opened in 1963. The first tiger arrived at the zoo in 1964 from the Alipore Zoo in Calcutta, along with a pair of African lions, a pair of Mugger crocodiles, and a puma. The facility was renamed Nandankanan Zoological Park in 1981. In 2009 Nandankanan Zoological Park became the first zoo in India to become a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). Animals and exhibits The zoo is home to about 1660 individual animals representing 166 species, including 67 species of mammals, 81 species of birds, and 18 species of reptiles.Odisha Government Portal.

In Odisha alone, 130 species of orchids have been documented to date. Breeding programs The zoo enjoys a good reputation internationally for successfully breeding black panthers, gharials, and white tigers in captivity. White tigers White tiger in the Zoo Three white tigers were born in the Nandankanan Zoo in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India in 1980. Their parents were an orange father‚Äìdaughter pair called Deepak and Ganga, who were not related to Mohan or any other captive white tiger. One of their wild-caught ancestors would have carried the recessive white gene, and it showed up when Deepak was mated to his daughter. Deepak's sister also turned out to be a white gene carrier. These white tigers are therefore referred to as the Odisha strain, as opposed to the Rewa strain, of white tigers founded by Mohan.Roychoudhury, A.K.

One of the three was later bred to her creating another blend of two unrelated strains of white tigers. This lineage resulted in several white tigers in Nandankanan Zoo. Today the Nandankanan Zoo has the largest collection of white tigers in India. The Cincinnati Zoo acquired two female white tigers from the Nandankanan Zoo, in the hopes of establishing a line of pure-Bengal white tigers in America, but they never got a male, and didn't receive authorization from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA)'s Species Survival Plan (SSP) to breed them. The Zoo Outreach Organisation used to publish studbooks for white tigers, which were compiled by A.K. Roychoudhury of the Bose Institute in Calcutta, and subsidized by the Humane Society of India. The Columbus Zoo had also hoped to breed pure-Bengal white tigers, but were unable to obtain a white registered Bengal mate for Rewati from India.Ferguson, David A., & Kohl, Steven G. (1987) Developing International Conservation Programs, Tigers Of The World, Noyes Publications Park Ridge, New Jersey USA There were also surprise births of white tigers in the Asian Circus, in India, to parents not known to have been white gene carriers, or heterozygotes, and not known to have any relationship to any other white tiger strains. There was a female white cub born at Mysore Zoo in 1984, from orange parents, descended from Deepak's sister. The white cub's grandmother, Thara, came from the Nandankanan Zoo in 1972. Mysore Zoo had a second female white tiger cub from New Delhi Zoo in 1984. On 29 August 1979, a white tigress named Seema was dispatched to Kanpur Zoo to be bred to Badal, a tiger who was a fourth generation descendant of Mohan and Begum. The pair did not breed so it was decided to pair Seema with one of two wild- caught, notorious man-eaters, either Sheru or Titu, from the Jim Corbett National Park. Seema and Sheru produced a white cub, and for a while, it was thought there might be white genes in Corbett's population of tigers, but the cub didn't stay white.Roychoudhury, A.K. (1989) The Indian White Tiger Studbook, Zoo Zen, International Zoo Outreach Org., Tamil Nadu, IndiaThe first captive-bred white tigers. zoopros.com There have been other cases of white tiger, white lion, and white panther cubs being born, and then changing to normal colour. White tigers which were a mixture of the Rewa and Odisha strains, born at the Nandankanan Zoo, were non-inbred. A white tiger from out of the Odisha strain found its way to the Western Plains Zoo in Australia. Australia's Dreamworld, on the Gold Coast, wanted to breed this tiger to one of their white tigers from the United States. Crocodilians Crocodile Captive breeding units of all the three crocodilian species have been established at Nandankanan Zoo.Crocodile Conservation. wildlifeorissa.in In 1980, the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) was bred in captivity for the first time at the Nandankanan Biological Park in Odisha. This successful effort involved the collaboration and coordination between international and national zoological parks. The male came from the Frankfurt zoo and the females were from the Nandankanan and Trivandrum zoos. A large part of the credit for this first time ex-situ breeding in captivity goes to the meticulous planning and designing of the breeding enclosure at the Nandankanan Zoo by Dr. H. R. Bustard, which simulates the gharial's natural habitat of a deep flowing river with adequate high-rise sandbanks. The breeding enclosure, together with a judicious mix of adult size classes to form a social group, minimal disturbance and provision of natural food culminated in that success story, which continues to the present date. The Nandankanan Biological park has since provided many zoos around the world with captive-bred gharials for display and education.Ex-Situ conservation ‚Äì Crocodile Breeding in Indian Zoos BC Choudhury. wii.gov.in Muggers bred at Nandankanan Zoo have also been released in Satkosia Gorge. Pangolins The zoo was the first in India to successfully breed pangolin.

There are 10 pangolins in Nandankanan Zoo, including six females. Adopt-an-Animal programme Asiatic lion in the zoo To help involve the general public in animal conservation and raise money, the zoo started the Adopt-an-Animal programme in 2008 for all of its animals. Adopters receive a customized adoption certificate and one free entry ticket for each animal adopted. In addition, the adopter's name is displayed on a special board and a special mention made in the annual report of the zoo. Adopters can pay from 500 for a small bird to 100,000 for a tiger for a year. The zoo authorities have made available two of the most attractive sites for adoption which are the Lion Safari and Tiger Safari for which the adoption cost is 1,000,000 and 500,000 respectively. Although other zoos also have adoption programs, Nandankanan was the first zoo to get a tax exemption under section 80G of the Income Tax Act. Funds received under the program are used to support the zoo's care and services for all its inhabitants by providing quality food to meet their nutritional requirements, medical care, equipment, enclosure upgrades, and biodiversity enrichment. The parents of two students Sristi and Prakriti from Cuttack were the first to adopt, paying 4,000 to adopt a blue and yellow macaw. The State Bank of India donated 500,000 to adopt six endangered animals including a one-horned rhinoceros, white Bengal tiger, chimpanzee, and an orangutan. The Confidence Factory, near Bhubaneswar, adopted a Royal Bengal Tigress Rebati in 2012.

They compete in the British SGB Premiership. Meetings are staged on most Thursdays from March until October, normally commencing at 7.30pm (first race 7.45pm). The Witches are currently promoted by former Ipswich rider John Louis, the father of former rider and Sky Sports presenter Chris Louis.John Louis A Celebration of 43.45 years in Speedway History  Early history  Foxhall Stadium was purpose-built for speedway in 1950, and meetings were held there from 1951 to 1965 when the track was resurfaced for stock car racing. Attendances approached 20,000 people and made stars of riders such as Syd Clarke, Junior Bainbridge, Tich Read and Peter Moore.  1970s-2000s  In 1969, John Berry built a new smaller track inside the stock car circuit and re-opened the club with a team which would soon include the promoter John Louis. In 1970 and 1971, the Witches won the British League Division Two Knockout Cup, before John Berry applied for membership of the British League in 1972. The Witches went on to become a dominant force in the top flight of British speedway, winning the British League Championship in 1975, 1976 and 1984, plus four Knock-Out Cup wins (doing \\"the double\\" in 1976 and 1984). Following the death of Ipswich rider Billy Sanders in 1985 and Berry's subsequent decision to quit, the club struggled and almost closed before being saved by a consortium which included former rider John Louis. The new Witches began competing in the National League (second tier) in 1989 and 1990, before joining the amalgamated British League and then, after a further restructuring of speedway in Britain, the Elite League. In 1998, Ipswich won the Elite League Championship, the Knock-Out Cup and the end of season Craven Shield tournament. In addition, Ipswich riders won the World Championship (Tony Rickardsson), the British Speedway Championship (Chris Louis) and the British Under-21 Championship (Scott Nicholls). The team also included the Polish star Tomasz Gollob, who finished third in the World Championship.Ipswich Speedway About Us  2010s  In November 2010, the Witches moved down to the Premier League (second tier). In 2011, the Witches finished in third place in the final Premier League table and won the Premier League Four-Team Championship staged at Leicester. During the winter of 2011/12, Director of Speedway Chris Louis brought in Australians Rohan Tungate and Cameron Heeps. In the first meeting of the 2012 season‚Äîa challenge match with Rye House at Foxhall‚Äîboth Taylor Poole (broken left arm) and Morten Risager (damaged lower vertebrae) were ruled out, and Ipswich asset Leigh Lanham re-joined the club as a replacement for Risager. Ipswich reached the League Cup and Knockout Cup finals, finishing runner-up in both competitions. For 2013, a new number one rider, Ben Barker, was signed. An early exit from the Knockout Cup against Workington Comets was tempered by qualification for the League Cup final after an aggregate victory against the Edinburgh Monarchs. However, after defeating Newcastle in the first leg of the League Cup final at Foxhall, the season ended with five consecutive defeats; a 27‚Äì65 loss at Newcastle surrendered the League Cup. Ipswich were runners-up to the Somerset Rebels, but they failed to defeat Scunthorpe Scorpions or Edinburgh Monarchs in the play-off mini-group. In 2014, Richie Worrall joined as the new number one, and American Gino Manzares was signed as the other new rider. The Witches finished third in the Premier League and reached the Knockout Cup final. The play-off mini group with Scunthorpe and Somerset ended with two home wins, but no points from away fixtures and the Knockout Cup final was another runners-up medal, as the Witches were dominated both home and away by the Edinburgh Monarchs. The Witches came seventh in the Premier League in 2015, fifth in 2016, second in 2017, and seventh in 2018. Shortly before 2019, Ipswich decided to move to the first division, the SGB Premiership. They remained in the league in preparation for 2020.

Constructed over four years (1925‚Äì28), it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on January 4, 1989. The building is 361 feet tall with 28 floors. When it was built, it was the tallest building in Miami and in Florida. It is still in use as the main civil courthouse of Miami-Dade County.Miami-Dade County Clerk's webpage History When county government was established following the Civil War, public records were so sparse they could be carried in a carpetbag and most probably were. Therefore, the \\"courthouse\\" was wherever the county's chief office holder decided to do business. In 1890, Dade County's first courthouse stood in the town of Juno, Florida some north of West Palm Beach. At that time, Dade County covered more territory than it does today, stretching from Bahia Honda Key, in the middle Keys, up to the St. Lucie River, near present-day Port St. Lucie. Juno was chosen as the \\"county seat\\" because of its strategic location at the southern terminus of the Jupiter-Juno railroad. Juno also held the northern terminus of the boat and connecting stagecoach line to Miami. The courthouse remained in Juno (now no longer in existence) until 1899, when it was moved to Miami down the inland waterway on a barge and was placed on the banks of the Miami River, east of the old Miami Avenue bridge. The building was two story wooden frame construction, housing offices and jail cells on the ground floor and a courtroom on the second floor. It has a Neoclassical design, in 1904 this building was replaced by a new courthouse building situated on Flagler Street (then known as Twelfth Street). It was a magnificent building constructed of limestone, having an elegant red-domed top, at the cost of $47,000. It was anticipated that this courthouse would serve the city for at least 50 years; however, no one was prepared for the rapid growth Miami experienced during this period, and by 1924, only twenty years later, there was serious talk of the need for a larger courthouse. In the early 1920s, architect A. Ten Eyck Brown entered a design competition for Atlanta City Hall, which was rejected. He then made the plans available to Dade County, and City and County officials readily approved them.http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-716 It was decided by the officials to build the new courthouse at the same location as the existing one on Flagler Street. Construction began in 1925, with workers erecting the new building around the existing structure, which was then dismantled. Community leaders and citizens alike voiced excitement over the new 28 story \\"skyscraper\\" that would soon dominate the skyline. Unexpectedly, construction was halted when the building reached ten stories. It was discovered that the \\"high-rise\\" was sinking into the spongy ground. Engineers consulted with an architect from Mexico City, whom had encountered a similar problem while building the city's opera house. The consultant determined that the foundation pilings were not set deep enough. To correct the problem, cement supports were poured, which take up much of the space in the building's basement file room even to this day. The courthouse was finally completed in 1928 at the cost of $4 million (USD 2013 $54.5 million). Initially, it served as both the Dade County Courthouse and the Miami City Hall. Jail cells occupied the top nine floors because these heights offered \\"maximum security\\" and were considered escape proof. In 1934, a prisoner housed on the 21st floor picked the lock of his jail cell window and used a fire hose to lower himself to freedom. In the years following, more than 70 prisoners escaped from this so-called \\"secure\\" prison. Present day For many years, the Miami-Dade County Courthouse, at an elevation of 360 feet, was reputed to be the tallest building south of Baltimore. It was the County's first high-rise and is in the National Register of Historic Places. Efforts to refurbish this magnificent structure and restore it to its original grandeur have been underway since 1981 by Architect James W. Piersol, AIA of M.C Harry Associates Architects of Miami. The restoration and renovations initially stabilized the terra cotta facade, and installed new life safety systems. In 1982, the idea of restoring the lobby to its original distinction was the passion of both Architect James Piersol and engineer Don Youatt, of the Miami-Dade Planning and Development Department. With a little less than half of the funding necessary for the lobby restoration project in hand ($300,000 grant approved by the Legislature in 1996), the Dade County Bar Association acted as the fund-raising umbrella and initiate a drive to raise the remainder needed from lawyers and the general public. A few years later, the same team restored Courtroom 6-1, which had been the site of many infamous trials over the years. Today, the Miami- Dade County Courthouse provides offices, chambers, and courtrooms for the clerks and judiciary assigned to both the Circuit and County Civil Court.

Jurisdiction California Government Code section 23138, added in 1947, describes the northern boundary of San Francisco County as \\"Thence, Easterly, through Point Bonita and Point Calvaljo, to the most southeastern point of Angel Island, all on the line of Marin.\\" In 1960, to add the watchroom, the Bay was filled in between the southeastern point of Angel Island and the Point Blunt Rock - originally an Island. Consequently, Point Blunt is an exclave of San Francisco County; however, the land itself is a Federal Enclave. The area below the mean high tide of the Federal Enclave, however, is not a Federal Enclave because California assumed sovereignty over the waters when it became a State in 1850. As a port facility, the lighthouse served the Port of San Francisco, which was transferred from State to San Francisco control in 1969. In 1976, the People of the State of California adopted the Coastal act, making the area below the mean high tide a condominium of the County and the California Coastal Commission, and the Coastal Act required beach access for all California beaches, meaning there is a constitutionally-guaranteed right of way through the State Park property to the beach of the Federal Enclave. Because the beach above the mean high tide is a Federal enclave and not part of Angel Island State Park, like Baker Beach in the Presidio of San Francisco, it is not subject to local ordinances. There is no federal or statewide law prohibiting nudity. Moreover, because it is part of a Port of call, any vessel flying a friendly flag may anchor and its inhabitants may disembark and disrobe as long as they stay below the mean high tide. If they cross above it, they must proceed directly to customs; however, there is no customs house on the point. Immunity from local law applies to individuals in transit to customs as long as they do not tarry, so they will have transit immunity while they walk through Angel Island State Park to the ferry, over the Golden Gate Bridge, and to the Federal Customs House near Fishermans' Wharf.

This is particularly evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country. The country's water systems are continually changing under the influence of natural forces and human introduced industrial activities. Artificial rivers (canals) and ponds are a part of Azerbaijan's water systems. The hydrography of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the Caspian Sea basin. Rivers A map of the Caspian Sea drainage basin to which all rivers in Azerbaijan flow to. Kur and Aras are the longest rivers of Azerbaijan and their drainage basin covers most of the country. Araz River along the Iranian border with Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan. Rivers form the principal part of the water systems of Azerbaijan. There are 8,359 rivers of various lengths within Azerbaijan. Of them, 8,188 rivers are less than long. Only 24 rivers are over long. The largest rivers that flow through the country are: * K√ºr, main water source and the artery of the country * Araz * Qanƒ±x, located in Alazan * Qabƒ±rlƒ±, also known as Iori * Khrami * Samur * Pirsaat√ßay * Bolgar- Chay, located in Jalilabad District * Aƒüstafa * Hekeriychay, also known as Hekeri * Kurekchay * T…ôrt…ôr√ßay ** Aƒüdaban√ßay ** Lev√ßay ** Turaƒüay√ßay * T√ºryan√ßay * Vilesh * Qarqar√ßay River system The rivers in Azerbaijan can be divided into three groups: #The Kur basin rivers (Qanix, Qabirri, Turyan, Agstafa, Shekir, Terter, Khachin, etc.) #The Araz basin rivers (Arpachay, Nakhchivan, Okhchu, Hekeri, Kondelenchay, etc.) #Rivers, flowing directly into the Caspian Sea (Samur, Gudyal, Velvele, Vilesh, Lenkeran, etc.) Azerbaijan river systems are changing and evolving under the influence of various physiographic factors: climate, landscape, geological structure, soil and vegetation. The density of the river network increases, then gradually decreases later with higher altitudes. Except for the Talysh region (1.6-2.2 km/km¬≤), the river system density is the highest (1‚Äì2 km/km¬≤) at 1,000-2,500 kilometers, while in the area of the Talysh mountains it peaks at 1.6-2.2 km/km¬≤ at 500‚Äì1,000 km. The average density of the river system of Azerbaijan is 0.39 km/km¬≤. The density is even lower than 0.05 km/km¬≤ in the plains. Kura and Aras The Kur and Aras are the longest rivers in Azerbaijan. They run through the Kur-Araz Lowland. The rivers that directly flow into the Caspian Sea, originate mainly from the north-eastern slope of the Greater Caucasus and Talysh Mountains and run along the Samur-Devechi and Lenkeran lowlands. The Kura River basin area (86,000 km¬≤) up to the junction with the Aras River is smaller than the Aras water basin (101,937 km¬≤). The river is still called Kura on the junction because the water level of the Kura is twice as high as that of the Aras River.

If each is read in combination with Âè£ (kuchi) - the shape of the central bowl - then the characters become Âêæ, ÂîØ, Ë∂≥, Áü• which translates literally as \\"I only know plenty\\" (Âêæ = ware = I, ÂîØ = tada = only, Ë∂≥ = taru = plenty, Áü• = shiru = know). The underlying meaning, variously translated as \\"what one has is all one needs\\", or \\"learn only to be content\\" reflects the basic anti-materialistic teachings of Buddhism.

Pelz, who also designed Point Fermin's sister stations, East Brother Island Light in Richmond, California, Mare Island Light, in Carquinez Strait, California (demolished in the 1930s), Point Hueneme Light in California (replaced in 1940), Hereford Inlet Light in North Wildwood, New Jersey, and Point Adams Light in Washington State (burned down by the Lighthouse Service in 1912), all in essentially the same style. The original fourth order Fresnel lens was removed in 1942 and a wood replica lantern was installed in 1974. The lighthouse was saved from demolition in 1972 and refurbished in 1974, and a new lantern room and gallery were built by local preservationists. In 1972, the light was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Historical Information from Coast Guard web site: *Point Fermin Light was built in 1874 with lumber from California redwoods. *In 1941, the light was extinguished due to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. There was fear that the light would serve as a beacon for enemy planes and ships. Later, the lantern room and gallery were removed. They were replaced by a lookout shack that remained for the next 30 years and was referred to as \\"the chicken coop\\" by locals. *In 1972, the light was added to the National Register of Historic Places. *The light fell into disuse and disrepair. A new lantern room and gallery were built in 1974. *The building has now been restored to its original state and is open to the public as the Point Fermin Lighthouse Historic Site and Museum. U.S. Coast Guard Archive The original Fresnel lens from the lighthouse, removed in the 1940s, had been missing for decades. After being found and positively identified, on November 13, 2006, the lens was relocated to a display in the restored lighthouse museum from the real estate office of Louis Busch in Malibu, California, where it had been on display. The lighthouse is open daily except Monday and holidays. In 1986, the lighthouse appeared in a second-season episode of Amazing Stories, \\"Magic Saturday\\". The lighthouse also featured in two episodes of MacGyver: \\"Flames's End\\" and \\"D.O.A.: MacGyver\\". In June 2011, the General Services Administration made the Point Fermin Light (along with 11 others) available at no cost to public organizations willing to preserve them.

Early life  Gore-Browne was born in London, England. His father was Francis Gore Browne, a lawyer and writer on company law, his paternal grandfather was Sir Thomas Gore Browne, who had been governor of New Zealand and Tasmania. His paternal aunt was Ethel Locke King. He was educated at Wixenford Preparatory School for five years and Harrow School for a further three. He passed into the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich in 1900 and was commissioned into the Royal Field Artillery. From 1902 to 1904 he did survey work in Natal before returning to England to take up motor racing at Brooklands. He went to Northern Rhodesia in 1911 as part of an Anglo-Belgian boundary commission, laying out the border between the Belgian Congo and Northern Rhodesia. From his boyhood, Gore-Browne had an ambition to own an estate but though comparatively wealthy, knew that he could not afford much land in Britain. When he heard in 1914 that the British South Africa Company which administered Northern Rhodesia was selling land very cheaply to white settlers in the north-east of the country, he travelled there looking for a site which he found at Lake Ishiba Ng'andu. His development of this estate is covered in the linked article.  Settles at Shiwa Ngandu  During the First World War, Gore-Browne was sent to the Western Front, where he reached the rank of Lt.-Colonel and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). In 1920 he retired from the army and returned to Northern Rhodesia to settle at Shiwa Ngandu and build his estate; the story of the establishment of his estate is told in The Africa House by Christina Lamb. At his new home Gore-Browne cultivated a military bearing and wore a monocle. He often frightened his workers with an explosive anger; the Bemba people called him Chipembere ('Rhinoceros', alternative spelling Chipembele), a name which had originally been given to him when he shot a rhinoceros at Shiwa Ngandu, but later they used it to refer to his temper. As a young man Gore Browne courted Lorna Bosworth Smith for three years, but she married someone else. She and her husband died young, and in England in 1927, Gore Browne met their orphaned daughter Lorna Goldmann (1908‚Äì2002). Despite the quarter-century difference in their ages, they married that year and went to live at Shiwa Ngandu. They had two daughters, Lorna and Angela. However, from 1934 the couple spent much time apart. Lady Gore-Browne did not share her husband's dreams for the estate and they divorced in 1950. She moved to London where she called herself 'Mrs Browne'.Obituary of Lady Gore Browne, The Daily Telegraph, London 26 February 2002.  Political career  Gore-Browne's political career began in 1935, when he was elected to Northern Rhodesia's legislative council. Gore-Browne represented one of seven constituencies of voters. He disagreed with British colonial ‚Äòtrusteeship' and, instead, looked to a future 'partnership'. He thought settlers ought to have a larger share in government, but also argued for the interdependence of \\"white and black\\" prosperity. Unlike other white politicians, such as his friend Roy Welensky, a trade union leader, Gore- Browne felt no threat from African social and educational advance, and the consequent addition of qualified voters to the electoral roll. These political views can be seen as relating to his management and development of the Shiwa Ngandu estate, where he was completely dependent on the African people and isolated from white settler society by hundreds of kilometres. He realised the need to educate and train local people in the skills his estate required, and realised that it would also benefit from a prosperous local community. To an extent he was paternalistic but was also capable of friendships and good working relationships with many Africans. From 1938 to 1951 he was nominated to represent African interests in the legislative council, for which he was knighted in 1945. In the Legislative Council, Gore-Browne soon became a power in the land. He helped set the stage for Northern Rhodesia. He was more closely attuned to African thinking than the administration was and \\"[h]e always enjoyed the respect and trust of Africans ... [h]e was an eloquent speaker and his speeches were the most statesman like that had ever been heard in Northern Rhodesia. He was a man of outstanding calibre, forceful and courageous\\", said Welensky. When African mineworkers went on strike in 1940, Gore-Browne counselled limiting the use of force. He also sought out African opinion and denounced various forms of the colour bar (a form of racial segregation). He welcomed the growth of African welfare societies and trade unions, and managed to get the white government to set up African representative councils. In Britain, he made contact with Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda (the future president of Malawi) and his faith in African abilities was strengthened by visits to Uganda and West Africa in 1946‚Äì47. However, by 1946 Roy Welensky had begun campaigning for the amalgamation of Northern Rhodesia with Southern Rhodesia, where white settlers enjoyed self-government. Gore- Browne was opposed to Welensky's push for amalgamation and resigned in protest from the leadership of the elected members of the legislative council. Instead, he devised a scheme intended to appeal to both white and black people, calling for 'responsible government'. However, he mishandled the scheme's presentation in 1948 and alienated his African supporters. By 1950 he felt that he no longer had a role in politics and resigned from the legislative council in 1951 and retired to devote his energies to Shiwa. He continued to advise first the African National Congress under his early prot√©g√©, Harry Nkumbula and later, after the break away, the United National Independence party, under his close friend, Kenneth Kaunda. By the late 1950s Shiwa Ng'andu epitomised everything Sir Stewart represented ‚Äì orderly, neat, precise. For years it had been an oasis for travellers on the Great North Road, a place where hospitality had never been refused; and this little bit of England in Africa never ceased to impress its visitors. Family in Africa In 1962 after a failed attempt to come back into politics, he went to live quietly at Shiwa with his daughter and son-in-law, Lorna and John Harvey (who managed the estate), and his four grand children, Penelope, Charles, Mark and David. Lady Gore-Browne, still living in England made occasional long visits to Shiwa. Their second daughter, Angela, married with two daughters, Karen and Miranda, had moved to Kenya where she lectured at the Royal College in Nairobi. His constant companion was his chauffeur of more than 30 years, Henry Mulenga. Together they had toured much of Africa and, in 'seven seas tours', most of Europe; between them there was a strong bond of friendship. \\"Sir Stewart has bought me a farm of my own 15 miles from Shiwa\\", Henry once revealed. \\"My family live there and I visit them on weekends. When my services are no longer required at Shiwa, I shall retire there to become a full-time farmer\\".  Semi-retirement  Gore-Browne spent most of his later years at Shiwa Ngandu, where he replaced citrus crops with cattle. However, he remained actively interested in politics. When, in 1953, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was imposed against the wishes of some local settlers and urban Africans, Gore-Browne opposed it because he felt that it was based on the discredited idea of 'partnership'. By 1960 he was committed to African majority rule, and was friendly with Kenneth Kaunda, leader of the United National Independence Party. In the general election of 1962, Gore-Browne stood for that party. However, he failed to win enough white votes to qualify. In 1964 he was an honoured guest at Zambia's independence ceremonies in Lusaka. He died from pneumonia at Kasama Hospital, Zambia, on 4 August 1967. He was buried at Shiwa Ngandu two days later in Zambia's only to date state funeral for a white person. Kenneth Kaunda, then President of Zambia, gave the eulogy. Lady Lorna Gore-Browne died in London in 2002 at the age of 93.

Although it had been initially created by Aabid Surti a few years earlier, it was finally offered to Indrajal Comics. Aabid Surti was at that time freelancing for Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd.. After he moved on, Jagjit Uppal took over the task. The artwork was illustrated by Govind Brahmania and later by his son, B Pramod. The comics were published in various languages including Hindi, English and Bengali. Besides regular comics, the series was also featured in dailies and weeklies along with other comic heroes. Characters Bahadur The comic strip was created in December, 1976. Dacoity was at its worst in India in the 1970s and the Bahadur series focussed a lot on dacoits. Bahadur himself was the son of a dacoit Bhairav Singh, who died in combat with Police. Bahadur, then a teenager, was adopted by Vishal, the police officer who shot Bhairav Singh. Citizen's Security Force (CSF) Upon growing up, Bahadur set up the Citizen's Security Force or the Hindi translation Naagrik Suraksha Dal (NASUD) that aids the police in combating dacoits. Though Bahadur dealt with many kinds of villains, he displayed a much softer corner towards dacoits trying to rehabilitate them. One of his assistants Lakhan was also a reformed dacoit. After surrendering to the police, he started helping Bahadur in curbing crime. Bela Bela is Bahadur's love interest in the comic series and very skilled in martial arts. She assists Bahadur in his missions against the villains. Whenever, Bahadur would ask Bela to go out with him Bela's favorite reply was \\"Neki, aur puchh, puchh\\". Others The other prominent characters featuring regularly in the series were Sukhiya, Mukhiya and Lakhan. While Sukhiya was a policeman, Mukhiya (meaning head of the village in Hindi) was the village leader. Bahadur also got a dog Chammiya in some of the later stories. Evolution left The stories evolved with time and portrayed the changing face of India. While beginning with dacoits in deep ravines and the small town of Jaigarh, Bahadur later moved to tackling themes such as espionage. The town itself moved from being a small sleepy town to a modern city. Aabid Surti conceived of Bahadur and started the comic strip in 1976. \\"Bennett, Coleman & Co wanted me to create an Indian character that could take on the popularity of the four foreign comics that ruled the market in India then‚ÄîThe Phantom, Mandrake, Flash Gordon and Tarzan,\\" he says. \\"During that time, the Chambal Valley was becoming increasingly notorious, and there were exhortations to people to group together to fight crime. So I developed the character of Bahadur as someone who helps create a citizens' police force to fight the dacoits.\\" Surti has an interesting explanation for why Bahadur sports a saffron kurta and jeans. \\"A kurta and saffron were symbols of Indianness. And jeans were a Western import and indicated progress. Hence, the combination,\\" he says. \\"In fact, I have showed Bahadur and his girlfriend, Bela, in a live-in relationship‚Äîsomething unheard of in those times. But it was very well accepted by the audience.\\" Though Bahadur's portrayal also changed with time as the artists drawing the series changed, Bahadur's appearance remained the same until 1986, when his trade mark long-hair chopped to shorter & a neat look, which gave him a necessary urban look, and his outfit was changed from an orange kurta to a tight-fitting pink long-sleeved T-shirt. This series stopped in April 1990 when Times of India cancelled the Indrajal Comics that year. Mukhiya had a habit of saying \\"Kasam Ganga maiya ki\\" for everything.

It first aired on October 18, 2006, on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), making it the 52nd episode of the series. The episode was written by showrunner Carlton Cuse and supervising producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and was directed by Stephen Williams. The series follows the survivors of the crash of a commercial passenger jet flying between Sydney and Los Angeles, on a mysterious tropical island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean. In this episode, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) recovers from the Hatch implosion and rescues Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) from a polar bear. Locke is featured in the episode's flashbacks. The episode featured the return of previous main cast member Ian Somerhalder. It also introduced the characters of Nikki and Paulo (Kiele Sanchez and Rodrigo Santoro), who were added in the wake of some criticism that the series focused too much on the same fifteen survivors. An estimated 16.31 million Americans watched the episode upon its original broadcast. \\"Further Instructions\\" received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Plot Flashbacks Locke is a member of a commune in Humboldt County, California. He considers its members his new family. One day Locke picks up a young hitchhiker, named Eddie Colburn (Justin Chatwin), who tells him he is leaving home. Eddie joins the commune, but after six weeks, he asks Locke why he is never allowed to know what is going on in a greenhouse (into which he sees an exceptional amount of fertilizer going). Eddie expresses his discontent with being kept out of the secret and affirms to Locke his desire to be in on \\"whatever you guys are trying to blow up\\". Locke laughs and says he will talk to the commune leaders, Mike (Chris Mulkey) and Jan (Virginia Morris). Upon entering the greenhouse some time later, in which marijuana is grown, Locke finds Mike and Jan in the midst of a frantic preparation to flee. They blame Locke for bringing Eddie, whom they have discovered is an undercover police officer. Locke promises to fix the situation. He takes Eddie hunting and holds Eddie at gunpoint. Eddie says that Locke was chosen because his psych profile said he would be \\"amenable for coercion\\". Eddie walks away, stating that Locke will not shoot him because he is \\"a good man,\\" though Locke insists that he is a hunter, not a farmer. On the Island John Locke wakes up in the jungle and sees a naked Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) run by, but Locke cannot speak. Mr. Eko's (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) stick falls from above nearly hitting him. In the frame of Eko's church, he builds a sweat lodge and convinces Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) to stand guard. Locke takes a hallucinogenic drug and enters the lodge in order to \\"speak with the Island\\". There, Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) appears to help him \\"find [his] way again, so that [he] can bring the family back together\\". Locke (mutely) apologizes for the day Boone died, and he accepts the apology, however, in a taunting and seemingly sarcastic manner. Locke's hallucination takes him to Sydney airport. Boone wheels Locke through the airport where he tells him someone is \\"in serious danger\\". Locke sees his fellow survivors, and is told by Boone that he must \\"clean up [his] own mess\\". Locke finds Eko's stick covered in blood and Boone tells him \\"they have him, you don't have much time\\". Upon exiting the sweat lodge he sees a flash of a polar bear. He recovers his ability to speak and tells Charlie that he is going to save Eko. Locke and Charlie track Eko, who Locke believes has been captured by a polar bear. They pause at a large pit in the ground where the hatch imploded. They encounter Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), who tells them that Jack, Kate, and Sawyer were kidnapped by the Others, and that \\"Henry Gale\\" is their leader. While continuing back to the camp alone, Hurley finds Desmond naked and lends him a tie-dyed t-shirt. Desmond says the electromagnetic anomaly may have been destroyed, and Hurley questions why Desmond was not destroyed. Desmond mentions Locke's speech and his plan to save Jack Shephard, Kate Austen, and James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford. However, Hurley responds, \\"What speech?\\", as Locke has yet to give any such speech. Desmond seems confused, and drops the whole matter. Locke finds the polar bear's cave and rescues Eko from the polar bear. While Charlie fetches water from a stream, Locke apologizes to an unconscious Eko for his lack of faith. Eko appears to briefly awaken and tells Locke that he must rescue Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Upon arriving at camp, Hurley informs the camp that Jack and the others have been captured. As an explanation, Locke announces to the survivors that he plans to rescue Jack, Kate, and Sawyer, as Desmond indicated to Hurley earlier. Hurley mentions to Charlie a sense of d√©j√† vu. Production Actor Ian Somerhalder guest starred in \\"Further Instructions\\", his first appearance since the second season episode \\"Abandoned\\". \\"Further Instructions\\" was written by showrunner Carlton Cuse and supervising producer Elizabeth Sarnoff; Stephen Williams served as the director. As the third episode of the season, \\"Further Instructions\\" was the first episode to feature the fate of the main cast camped on the beach, as well as the first to begin resolving the Hatch storyline from the season two finale. Leading up to the third season's broadcast, ABC attempted to reveal as few details as possible to the public. Ian Somerhalder's return was one piece of information that press releases included. Somerhalder, a former series regular, was credited as a guest actor to play his character Boone Carlyle in Locke's hallucinations, as his character died during the first season.

Upon its original broadcast on October 18, 2006 in the United States on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), \\"Further Instructions\\" was watched live by an estimated 16.31 million viewers. In the 18-49 demographic, Lost received a 6.5/16 ratings share, helping ABC place first for the night when compared to the other major networks. The episode has received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Chris Carabott of IGN wrote that \\"Further Instructions\\" was \\"an entertaining hour of television.

It includes, for example, rhymes and games played in the school playground. The best known researchers of the field were Peter and Iona Opie. Overview The subject matter of childlore includes the traditions of children between the ages of about 6 and 15 such as games, riddles, rhymes, jokes, pranks, superstitions, magical practices, wit, lyrics, guile, epithets, nicknames, torments, parody, oral legislation, seasonal customs, tortures, obscenities, codes, etc.Sutton- Smith 1970:1‚Äì8. as well as individual activities such as solitary play, daydreaming, fantasies, imaginary friends and heroes, collections, scrapbooks, model worlds, comic reading, mass media interests, dramatizations, stories, art, etc. As a branch of folklore, childlore is concerned with those activities which are learned and passed on by children to other children. The stories and games taught by adults to children are not considered childlore except insofar as the children adapt and make them their own. In western culture most folklorists are concerned with children after they join their peers in elementary school or kindergarten. The traditions of childhood generally stop after the child enters intermediate school, which coincides with puberty and adolescence.Grider 1980:159‚Äì160 Opie and Opie demonstrate that the culture of children is quite distinctive and is as unnoticed by the sophisticated world, and quite as little affected by it.

It is internationally renowned for introducing laparoscopic surgery to the UK as well as being a leading centre in developing fields such as the management of cancer, medical genetics and robotic surgery. Within the UK, it is also a major NHS facility for psychosurgery. The medical school was ranked 1st in the UK in 2009. The hospital has nursing and research links with the University of Dundee and is managed by NHS Tayside. History The proposal for the new hospital was put forward in May 1960 and final permission was accepted by Parliament in February 1962. The first phase of the project was due to take 6 years at a cost of ¬£9 million. Designed by Robert Matthew Johnson-Marshall and partners, the protracted construction began in August 1964. The hospital was initially designed to hold 800 beds, and the ward units were planned on the 'race track' principle. The foundation stone was laid on 9 September 1965, by Lord Hughes. The infirmary was built onto the side of a hill and the practicalities of the design were influenced by airport check in. Phase I of the building was completed in 1973, although some sections were not finished until 1975. The final cost was estimated as ¬£25 million. Hospital admittances started on 31 January 1974 and the hospital was officially opened by the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother on 23 October 1974. At the opening ceremony, she stated \\"nothing that science can devise, nor money provide, will be lacking for the treatment of the patients\\". By 1986 the hospital employed over 5,000 people and had 830 beds over 39 wards. At that time, the total annual cost of patient care was said to be ¬£22 million. The opening of Ninewells had a major impact upon Dundee's existing hospitals. Dundee Royal Infirmary, which had opened in 1798 and moved to larger premises in the 1850s, had been Dundee's main hospital until the opening of Ninewells. From 1974 many of its functions and responsibilities were transferred to Ninewells and the infirmary ultimately closed in 1998. Maryfield Hospital, which had formerly been the East Poorhouse, was closed to patients in stages between 1974 and 1976 as a result of the opening of Ninewells. In the 1990s and 2000s many functions of the city's King's Cross Hospital were also transferred to Ninewells. In 2001 a new psychiatric unit opened in the grounds of the hospital taking over some of the functions of Royal Dundee Liff Hospital. The pediatric department of the hospital was redeveloped and officially re-opened as the Tayside Children's Hospital in June 2006. In 2016 the hospital became one of the four major trauma centres in Scotland. The archives of the hospital are held by Archive Services, University of Dundee. The same archive also has a collection of microfilm copies of plans and documents relating to the construction of the hospital by Robert Matthew Johnson-Marshall & Partners. Services the hospital had 862 staffed beds. In addition to the hospital, there is a teaching section that includes the Ninewells medical school and the nursing school of the University of Dundee. As such it was the second purpose built medical school in UK, and has garnered a reputation for excellence in academic research. In particular the hospital has one of the world's leading leukemia research units. Tayside Children's Hospital Tayside Children's Hospital is a children's hospital located within Ninewells Hospital. It serves children, age from birth up until their fourteenth birthday, who live in Dundee, Angus, Perth and Kinross and north east Fife and, as such, it was so named after a region rather than a city to reflect the wide area that it covers. Maggie's Dundee Maggie's Centre at Ninewells Hospital On the Ninewells site there is also a Maggie's Centre building, intended as a calming and accommodating place to support patients and their families. The building was designed by architect Frank Gehry, in conjunction with James F Stephen. It occupies a hilltop position which enhances the building‚Äôs sculptural form when viewed from the approach road. The structure was the first new-build commissioned by the cancer support organisation. It was officially opened by Bob Geldof on 25 September 2003. Maggie's Dundee was named as the Royal Fine Art Commission's building of the year in 2004. A garden with a labyrinth design by Arabella Lennox-Boyd and other landscaped features were added in 2008. In the first ten years, around 100,000 people had passed through its doors. Ninewells Cancer Campaign The Ninewells Cancer Campaign was set up in 1990 following a successful CAT Scan fundraising appeal. The campaign was founded by Dr Pat McPherson who worked closely with Dr Jacqui Wood, who chaired the campaign from 1991, until her own death from cancer in 2011. She was succeeded as chair by Lady Fiona Fraser. Collaboration between the Ninewells Cancer Campaign and DC Thomson led to the use of Dennis the Menace as the campaign's mascot, with the slogan \\"Help Dennis Beat the Menace\\". The campaign has raised over ¬£17 million to fund equipment and research into cancer. The campaign successfully raised ¬£2 million to fund the creation and equipping of the Jacqui Wood Cancer Centre, a research centre established at the University of Dundee's Medical School at the hospital. The campaign continues to raise funds to support the research work being undertaken at the centre.

In order for such transfer to be approved, the transfer must comply with Internal Revenue Code section 5891 and any applicable state structured settlement protection law. Purpose of a structured settlement factoring transaction A structured settlement factoring transaction is a means to raise liquidity where there is no other viable means, via the transfer of structured settlement payment rights, for items such as unforeseen medical expenses, the need for improved housing or transportation, education expenses and the like, or in a situation where the individual has simply spent all his or her cash. To meet this need, the structured settlement recipient may involve the sale (or, less commonly, the encumbrance) of all or part of certain future periodic payments for a lump sum. Generally such lump sums are discounted. If a person sells the structured settlement payment rights, he or she will never receive the full amount of the payments originally contracted for when the individual settled his or her case and the structured settlement was established. A judge must review the submission and determine that the structured settlement transfer is in the best interest of the payee and any applicable dependents.  History  Structured settlements experienced an explosion in use beginning in the 1980s. ¬ß 1-14‚Äì1-17 Growth in the United States was most likely attributable to the favorable federal income tax treatment for such settlements receive as a result of the 1982 amendment of the Internal Revenue Code to add 26 USC ¬ß 130. Beginning in the late 1980s, a few small financial institutions started to meet this demand and offer new flexibility for structured settlement payees. Financial commentators and lawyers suggest caution in the sale of structured settlements. Sale of a structured settlement \\"is tempting, but it's typically not smart.\\" \\"Any person entering into a structured settlement should be on guard for potential exploitation in relation to the settlement\\". Controversy Concerning \\"Servicing\\" of Structured Settlement Payments by Factoring Companies Servicing of structured settlement payments occurs when a structured settlement payee sells only a portion of their future structured settlement payment rights, yet concurrent with the transfer, the factoring company also enters into an agreement to \\"service\\" the structured settlement payments that have not been sold. In \\"servicing\\" practice, one check is made payable to the factoring company instead of one to the factoring company and one to the payee. The factoring company receives the entire structured settlement payment, when due from the annuity issuer, takes what is owed to it and \\"passes through\\" the balance to the payee. This involves issuing a separate check to the payee issued off the factoring company account. It has been alleged that annuity issuers will not address questions of payees whose payments are subject to a servicing agreement. Some factoring industry commentators suggest the reason for this phenomenon is that some structured annuity issuers will not \\"split\\" annuity payments (i.e. make payments to more than one place)ostensibly to save administrative cost. Others say that the practice is driven by the factoring companies simply as a means to secure new business. Several industry commentators have expressed concerns questioned whether such servicing agreements are in the structured settlement payee's \\"best interest\\". What they say needs to be addressed is what effect the bankruptcy of a factoring company \\"servicing company\\" would have on the payee, with respect to the payments being serviced. Until this issue is decided, payees who are considering partial structured settlement transfers should be wary about participating in \\"servicing agreements\\". One possible solution has been suggested-that there be a requirement that servicing companies post a bond. Factoring Terminology Discount Rate In the beginning, the factoring industry had some relatively high discount rates due to heavy expenses caused by costly litigation battles and limited access to traditional investors. However, once state and federal legislation was enacted, the industry's interest rates decreased dramatically. There is much confusion with the terminology ‚Äúdiscount rate‚Äù because the term is used in different ways. The discount rate referred to in a factoring transaction is similar to an interest rate associated with home loans, credit cards and car loans where the interest rate is applied to the payment stream itself. In a factoring transaction, the factoring company knows the payment stream they are going to purchase and applies an interest rate to the payment stream itself and solves for the funding amount, as though it was a loan. Discount rates from factoring companies to consumers can range anywhere between 8% up to over 18% but usually average somewhere in the middle. Factoring discount rates can be a bit higher when compared to home loan interest rates, due to the fact the factoring transactions are more of a boutique product for investors opposed to the mainstream collateralized mortgage transactions. One common mistake in calculating the discount rate is to use ‚Äúelementary school math‚Äù where you take the funding/loan amount and divide it by the total price of all the payments being purchased. Because this method disregards the concept of time (and the time value of money), the resulting percentage is useless. For example, the court in In Re Henderson Receivables Origination v. Campos noted an annual discount rate of 16.8% where the annuitant received $36,500 for the assignment of payments totaling $63,364.94 over 84 months (two monthly payments of $672.32 each, beginning September 30, 2006 and ending on October 31, 2006; eighty-two monthly payments of $692.49 each, increasing 3% every twelve months, beginning on November 30, 2006 and ending on August 31, 2013). However, had the court in Henderson Receivables Origination applied the illogical formula of discounting from ‚Äúelementary school math‚Äù ($36,500/ $63,364.94), the discount rate would have been an astronomical (and nonsensical) 61%.Henderson Receivables Origination, LLC v. Campos, 2006 N.Y. Slip Op. 52430(U) (N.Y. Sup. 2006). Discounted Present Value Another term commonly used in factoring transactions is ‚Äúdiscounted present value,‚Äù which is defined in the National Conference of Insurance Legislators's model transfer act as ‚Äúthe present value of future payments determined by discounting such payments to the present using the most recently published Applicable Federal Rate for determining the present value of an annuity, as issued by the United States Internal Revenue Service.‚ÄùTexas Revised Civil Statute Annotated ¬ß 141.002(4). The discount rate, also known as the Applicable Federal Rate (AFR), is used to determine the charitable deduction for many types of planned gifts, such as charitable remainder trusts and gift annuities. The rate is the annual rate of return that the IRS assumes the gift assets will earn during the gift term. The IRS discount rate is published monthly. Present tax rates. In Henderson Receivables Origination, the court calculated the discounted present value of the $63,364.94 to be transferred as $50,933.18 based on the applicable federal rate of 6.00%. The ‚Äúdiscounted present value‚Äù is a measuring stick for determining what the value of a future payment (i.e., a payment that is due in the year 2057) is today. Hence, the discounted present value of a payment corrects for inflation and the principle that money available today is worth more than money not accessible for 50 years (or some future time). However, the discounted present value is not the same thing as market value (what someone is willing to pay). Basically, a calculation that discounts a future payment based on IRS rates is an artificial number since it has no bearing on the payment's actual selling price. For example, in Henderson Receivables Origination, it is somewhat confusing for the court to evaluate future payments totaling $63,364,94 based the discounted present value of $50,933.18 because that is not the market value of the payments. In other words, the annuitant couldn't go out and get $50,933.18 for his future payments because no person or company would be willing to pay that much. Some states will require a quotient to be listed on the disclosure that is sent to the customer prior to entering into a contract with a factoring company. The quotient is calculated by dividing the purchase price by the discounted present value. The quotient (like the discounted present value) provides no relevance in the pricing of a settlement factoring transaction. In Henderson Receivables Origination, the court did consider this quotient which was calculated as 71.70% ($36,500/ $50,933.18). United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau warning The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) hs issued a warning to consumers that consumers could receive much less cash than their settlement is worth. Dealing with companies that offer lump sum payments for their disability, personal injury or structured settlement payments can be risky. Some companies target people with disabilities who have structured settlements. If an individual receives a flyer or solicitation promising fast cash or a lump sum payment for monthly payments, the individual should use caution. The CFPB cautions that individuals should consider all options, including talking to trusted people or to a lawyer or financial counselor, before trading future payments for instant cash. The CFPB warning follows several high-profile news stories and lawsuits over the alleged abusive business practices by companies that purchase structured settlement payments. Several states have implemented structured settlement protection reforms in order to minimize abuses.  Process  Pre-2002 Congress enacted law to provide special tax breaks for payments received by tort victims in structured settlements, and for the companies that funded them. The payments were tax free, whereas if the tort victim had been given a lump sum and invested it themselves, the payments from those investments would be taxable. Companies liked structured settlements because it allowed them to avoid taxes to a certain extent, and plaintiffs liked them because it allowed them to receive tax-free payments of what became, over time, a much larger amount of money than the original amount paid out by the settling party. Such settlements were also considered an especially good idea for minors, as they held the money safe for adulthood and ensured that youth would not find the money wasted or ill-spent. ‚ÄúDespite the best intentions of plaintiffs, lump sum settlement awards are often quickly dissipated because of excessive spending, poor financial management, or a combination of both. Statistics showed that twenty-five to thirty percent of all cash awards are exhausted within two months, and ninety percent are exhausted within five years.‚ÄùAndrada, ‚ÄúStructured Settlements ‚Äì The Assignability Problem,‚Äù 9 S. Cal. Interdis. L.J. 465, 468 (Spring 2000). An explanation of Internal Revenue Code section 130 was given during discussions of possible taxation of companies that bought future payments under those structured settlements. ‚ÄúBy enacting the PPSA, Congress expressed its support of structured settlements, and sought to shield victims and their families from pressures to prematurely dissipate their recoveries.‚Äù145 Cong. Rec. S52281-01 (daily ed. May 13, 1999) (statement of Sen. Chaffee). Congress was willing to afford such tax advantages based on the belief that the loss in income taxes would be more than made up by lower expenditures on public assistance programs for those who suffered significant injuries. A strict requirement for a structured settlement to qualify for this tax break was that the tort victim was barred from accessing their periodic payments before they came due. It was for this reason that the annuity had to be owned by another who had control over it. The tort victim could not be seen to have ‚Äúconstructive receipt‚Äù of the annuity funds prior to their periodic payments. If the tort victim could cash in the annuity at any time, it was possible that the IRS might find constructive receipt. According to Joseph M. Mikrut, ‚ÄúCongress conditioned the favorable rules on a requirement that the periodic payments cannot be accelerated, deferred, increased or decreased by the injured person. Both the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee Reports stated that the periodic payments as personal injury damages are still excludable from income only if the recipient is not in constructive receipt of or does not have the current economic benefit of the sum required to produce the periodic payments.‚ÄùTestimony of Tax Legislative Counsel Joseph M. Mikrut to the Subcommittee on Oversight of the Committee of Ways and Means, March 18, 1999. ‚ÄúThese factoring transactions directly undermine the policy objective underlying the structured settlement tax regime, that of protecting the long term financial needs of injured persons . . . ‚Äú Mikrut was testifying in favor of imposing a punitive tax on factoring companies that engaged in pursuit of structured settlement payments. Despite the use of non-assignment clauses in annuity contracts to secure the tax advantages for tort victims, companies cropped up that tried to take advantage of these individuals in ‚Äùfactoring‚Äù transactions, purchasing their periodic payments in return for a deeply discounted lump sump payment. Congress felt that factoring company purchases of structured settlement payments ‚Äúso directly subvert the Congressional policy underlying structured settlements and raise such serious concerns for the injured victims,‚Äù that bills were proposed in both the Senate and the House to penalize companies which engage in such transactions. Before the enactment of IRC 5891, which became effective on July 1, 2002, some states regulated the transfer of structured settlement payment rights, while others did not. Most states that regulated transfers at this time followed a general pattern, substantially similar to the present day process which is mandated in IRC 5891 (see below for more details of the post-2002 process). However, the majority of the transfers processed from 1988 to 2002 were not court ordered.Hindert, supra, ¬ß 8A-3. After negotiating the terms of the transaction (including the payments to be sold and the price to be paid for those payments), a formal purchase contract was executed, effecting an assignment of the subject payments upon closing. Part of this assignment process also included the grant of a security interest in the structured settlement payments, to secure performance of the seller's obligations. Filing a public lien based on that security agreement created notice of this assignment and interest. The insurance company issuing the structured settlement annuity checks was typically not given actual notice of the transfer, due to antagonism by the insurance industry against factoring and transfer companies. Many annuity issuers were concerned that factoring transactions, which were not contemplated when Congress enacted section 130, might upset the tax treatment of qualified assignments. House of Representatives Bill 2884 (discussed below) resolved this question for annuity issuers. Federal legislation In 2001, Congress passed HR 2884, signed into law by the President in 2002 and effective July 1, 2002, codified at Internal Revenue Code ¬ß 5891.. Through a punitive excise tax penalty, this has created the de facto regulatory paradigm for the factoring industry. In essence, to avoid the excise tax penalty, IRC 5891 requires that all structured settlement factoring transactions be approved by a state court, in accordance with a qualified state statute. Qualified state statutes must make certain baseline findings, including that the transfer is in the best interest of the seller, taking into account the welfare and support of any dependents. In response, many states enacted statutes regulating structured settlement transfers in accord with this mandate. Post-2002 Today, all transfers are completed through a court order process. As of January 1, 2013, 47 states have transfer laws in place regulating the transfer process. Of these, 37 of the laws are based in whole or in part on the model state law enacted by NCOIL, the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (or, in cases when the state law predates the model act, they are substantially similar). Most state transfer laws contain similar provisions, as follows: (1) pre-contract disclosures to be made to the seller concerning the essentials of the transaction; (2) notice to certain interested parties; (3) an admonition to seek professional advice concerning the proposed transfer; and (4) court approval of the transfer, including a finding that it is in the best interest of seller, taking into account the welfare and support of any dependents. In 2005, the ABA Journal, a publication of the American Bar Association, published Transfers of Structured Settlement Payment Rights: What Judges Should Know about Structured Settlement Protection Acts. The article cites the \\"unusual combination of state law requirements and federal tax law sanctions\\" and \\"explains the SSPAs and their relationship to the IRC and discusses some of the key questions that courts need to address in ruling on SSPA applications.\\" Federal tax law Internal Revenue Code section 130 provides substantial tax incentives to insurance companies that establish ‚Äúqualified‚Äù structured settlements.Scales, supra, at 869. There are other advantages for the original tort defendant (or casualty insurer) in settling for payments over time, in that they benefit from the time value of money (most demonstrable in the fact that an annuity can be purchased to fund the payment of future periodic payments, and the cost of such annuity is far less than the sum total of all payments to be made over time). Finally, the tort plaintiff also benefits in several ways from a structured settlement, notably in the ability to receive the periodic payments from an annuity that gains investment value over the life of the payments, and the settling plaintiff receives the total payments, including that ‚Äúinside build-up‚Äù value, tax-free.Robert W. Wood, Taxation of Damage Awards and Settlement Payments 7--16 (Tax Institute 1991). However, a substantial downside to structured settlements comes from their inherent inflexibility.Hindert, supra, ¬ß 1-30. To take advantage of the tax benefits allotted to defendants who choose to settle cases using structured settlements, the periodic payments must be set up to meet basic requirements set forth in Internal Revenue Code section 130(c). Among other things, the payments must be fixed and determinable, and cannot be accelerated, deferred, increased or decreased by the recipient.Adam F. Scales, supra note 3, at 876. For many structured settlement recipients, the periodic payment stream is their only asset. Therefore, over time and as recipients‚Äô personal situations change in ways unpredicted at the settlement table, demand for liquidity options rises. To offset the liquidity issue, most structured settlement recipients, as a part of their total settlement, will receive an immediate sum to be invested to meet the needs not best addressed through the use of a structured settlement. Best Interest Standard Internal Revenue Code Sec. 5891 and most state laws require that a court find that a proposed settlement factoring transaction be in the best interest of the seller, taking into account the welfare and support of any dependents.Internal Revenue Code ¬ß 5891; see, e.g., Model State Structured Settlement Protection Act ¬ß4; See also, Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code ¬ß141. ‚ÄúBest interest‚Äù is generally not defined, which gives judges flexibility to make a subjective determination on a case-by-case basis. Some state laws may require that the judge look at factors such as the ‚Äúpurpose of the intended use of the funds,‚Äù the payee's mental and physical capacity, and the seller's potential need for future medical treatment.In re Petition of Settlement Capital Corp., 774 N.Y.S.2d 635,638-39 (N.Y. Sup. Ct., 2003).Settlement Capital Corp. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 646 N.W.2d 550, 556 (Min. Ct. App. 2002). One Minnesota court described the ‚Äúbest interest standard‚Äù as a determination involving ‚Äúa global consideration of the facts, circumstances, and means of support available to the payee and his or her dependents.‚Äù Courts have consistently found that the ‚Äúbest interest standard‚Äù is not limited to financial hardship cases.Barr v. Hartford Life Ins. Co., 2004 NY Slip Op 50980U, 3, 4 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2004). Hence, a transfer may be in a seller's best interest because it allows him to take advantage of an opportunity (i.e., buy a new home, start a business, attend college, etc.) or to avoid disaster (i.e., pay for a family member's unexpected medical care, pay off mounting debt, etc.). For example, a New Jersey court found that a transaction was in a seller's best interest where the funds were used to ‚Äúpay off bills‚Ä¶and to buy a home and get married.‚ÄùIn re Transfer of Structured Settlement Rights by Joseph Spinelli, 803 A.2d 172, 175 (N.J.

Born in Pune in the Bombay Presidency, he was first appointed Judge to the Supreme Court of India on 28 August 1972 and is the longest-serving Chief Justice in India's history at 7 years and 4 months. His nickname was Iron hands after his well-regarded unwillingness to let anything slip past him.  Tenure as Chief Justice of India  Justice Chandrachud was appointed Chief Justice of India during the term of the Janata government, under Prime Minister Morarji Desai. During his tenure as Chief Justice, he sent Sanjay Gandhi to jail in the \\"Kissa Kursi Ka\\" case. When Indira Gandhi's Congress government came back to power a few years later, Chandrachud became a strong opponent of the government, and was known for staunchly defending the independence of the judiciary. The Indian-born Canadian scholar Bhagwan D. Dua wrote later on: :\\"Though the entire judicial system was pressured to conform, the ruling party zeroed its attack on the pater familias. Unlike Justice Bhagwati, who was labeled as a Congress (I) man for his laudatory letter to Mrs. Gandhi, Chief Justice Chandrachud had a very low rating with the ruling household. Appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India by the Janata government ‚Äì a disqualification in itself under the new regime ‚Äì Chandrachud had not exactly endeared himself to the Gandhis for sending Sanjay to jail in 1978 or for turning volte face during the Janata period. By mid-1981, the estrangement between Chandrachud and the ruling party was so great that Ashoke Sen, a Congress (I) MP and the President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, even hinted at his impeachment by Parliament. Undaunted, the Chief Justice continued to defend the judiciary against executive interference and called upon the Bench and Bar to be united as this was ‚Äòthe only way we could fight the provocation and attack on the judges‚Äô‚Ä¶.Throughout 1980, the Chief Justice had refused to submit to pressures and made the government appoint eight chief justices to High Courts (and five judges to the Supreme Court) according to well-established constitutional practices.\\"Bhagwan D. Dua, A Study in Executive-Judicial Conflict: The Indian Case, 4 ASIAN SURVEY 463, 464 (1983)  The Habeas Corpus case  In one of the most notable cases in Indian constitutional history, during the Indian Emergency (1975-1977) of Indira Gandhi, a bench constituted of the five most senior judges of the Supreme court of India heard the famous Habeas Corpus case (A.D.M. Jabalpur vs. Shukla), where detenues under the restrictive Maintenance of Internal Security Act had argued that the Right to Life and Liberty (article 21 in the Indian constitution) could not be suspended even during periods of national emergency. The Indian constitution during that time itself provided that all fundamental rights, including the right to life under article 21 of the constitution, could be suspended during an Emergency. The Habeas Corpus majority decision therefore deferred to the original intent of the framers of India's constitution. However, the Indira Gandhi government flagrantly misused their powers during the Emergency, and as a result, the doctrine of \\"original intent\\" has never taken a firm hold in India. Despite widespread high court support for Habeas Corpus, Justice Chandrachud went along with Justices A.N. Ray, P.N. Bhagwati, and M.H. Beg, to reject this position, stating: in view of the Presidential Order dated 27 June 1975 no person has any locus to move any writ petition under Article 226 before a High Court for habeas corpus or any other writ or order or direction to challenge the legality of an order of detention. The only dissenting opinion was from Justice H. R. Khanna, who has been widely acclaimed for his dissent. Minerva Mills Case In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court provided key clarifications on the interpretation of the basic structure doctrine. The court unanimously ruled that the power of the Parliament of India to amend the constitution is limited by the constitution. Hence the parliament cannot exercise this limited power to grant itself an unlimited power. In addition, a majority of the court also held that the parliament's power to amend is not a power to destroy. Hence the parliament cannot emasculate the fundamental rights of individuals, including the right to liberty and equality.  The Shah Bano case  In the Shah Bano case, the bench headed by Chief Justice Chandrachud, invoked a provision in The Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 to order maintenance compensation to the divorced Muslim woman. This case caused the Rajiv Gandhi government, with its absolute majority, to pass the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 which diluted the judgment of the Supreme Court.

Pelz, USCG photo Point Hueneme Light is a , buff-colored 1940 Art Deco style tower on a fog-signal building on the Santa Barbara Channel at the Port of Hueneme. The original lighthouse was completed in 1874 at Point Hueneme after the construction of a in 1872.Later lengthened to When a storm destroyed the wharf in 1938, Oxnard Harbor District was formed and finished construction of the Port of Hueneme in 1940. The extant lighthouse structure was completed in 1941. The fourth-order Fresnel lens was used in both the original and the current lighthouse towers until 2013. In November 2012, the Ventura County Cultural Heritage Board voted to preserve the 1899 lens by retiring it from active service, so it can be displayed on a lower floor of the lighthouse and more easily viewed by the public. The original 1874 lighthouse was designed by Paul J. Pelz, who also designed Point Hueneme's sister stations, Point Fermin Light in San Pedro CA, East Brother Island Light in Richmond, California, Mare Island Light, in Carquinez Strait, California (demolished in the 1930s), Hereford Inlet Light in North Wildwood, New Jersey, and Point Adams Light in Washington State (burned down by the Lighthouse Service in 1912), all in essentially the same style.  Shipwreck  Point Hueneme Light was the site of an unrelates shipwreck. The veteran passenger liner La Jenelle, once removed from her role as a cruise liner, lay at anchor off Port Hueneme on April 14, 1970 awaiting plans for conversion to a floating restaurant. The owners were attempting to cut down on moorage costs by leaving the vessel at anchor in the open ocean, directly offshore. With only one watchman aboard, the vessel fell victim to storm-tossed seas, causing the ship to slip her anchor cables. The California State Lands Commission became much concerned about the problem both from the standpoint of leaking oil and a menace to navigation. They voted unanimously to have the ship scrapped, \\"as is, where is,\\" and accordingly put out bids. The big steel ship still remains but is being torn apart bit by bit by human and natural elements. Lighthouse tours The lighthouse is federal property operated by the United States Coast Guard. The U.S. Coast Guards Aids to Navigation Team Los Angeles/Long Beach(CG ANT LA/LB) is in charge of operation and maintenance of the lighthouse and Fresnel Lens. Members from the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, who are also members of the CG ANT LA/LB, are in charge of the tour and openhouse at the lighthouse. These members are recognized as Lighthouse Keepers by the USCG Auxiliary and Technicians by the CG. In March 2008, the City of Port Hueneme and Oxnard Harbor District dedicated a new \\"Lighthouse Promenade\\", beginning at the Hueneme Sunset Beach alongside the perimeter fence of the port to the lighthouse.

The Tree of Hippocrates is the plane tree (or platane, in Europe) under which, according to legend, Hippocrates of Kos (considered the father of medicine) taught his pupils the art of medicine. Paul of Tarsus purportedly taught here as well. The Platanus in Kos is an oriental plane (Platanus orientalis), with a crown diameter of about 12 metres, said to be the largest for a plane tree in Europe. Hippocrates' tree resides on the Plat√≠a Platanou (or \\"Square of the Platane\\"), in front of the Castle of Knights and next to the Gazi Hassan Mosque (erected in 1776) in the centre of Kos town. The current tree is only about 500 years old, but may possibly be a descendant of the original tree which allegedly stood there 2400 years ago, in Hippocrates' time. The tree has become hollowed out over the years, and some branches are supported by metal scaffolding. Next to the tree is a white tap with engravings in the Arabic language, also built by the Turkish Governor Gazi Hassan. Derivatives of the original tree The Medical Association of Cos presented a gavel made from wood of the plane tree to the President of the Canadian Medical Association in 1954. Tree of Hippocrates at the United States National Library of Medicine Seeds or cuttings from the tree have been spread all over the world. A cutting of the tree was presented as a gift from the island of Kos to the United States and the National Library of Medicine, and planted on December 14, 1961 on the grounds surrounding the library.

The name of the group is an Italian way to describe something very dark, but at the same time the word pesto can also refer to the typical Ligurian pasta sauce, pesto. As a matter of fact the band's logo, characterized by a strong green colour, resembles a Ligurian basil leaf, which is the most important ingredient for pesto. The musical style varies from rock, to rap, to reggae and to folk music. The most important characteristic of their lyrics is the strong sarcasm and comic irony which gives the music a peculiar goliardic touch. In 2005, Genoa gave Buio Pesto the Disco D'Oro (Gold record) because they reached 50,000 albums sold. History Buio Pesto were founded in 1983, although their very \\"professional\\" period started in 1992 with the recording of their first album, Voglio una fidanzata (I want a Girlfriend), published first by Deadline / Discomagic and then in 1996 by Sony. Significantly, in 1995 the music career of Buio Pesto changed fully, along with their decision to sing in the local dialect, in Ligurian. From then until now, they have sold 60,000 records and performed more than 400 concerts (with a total of 680,000 people among the audience), while collecting more than 254,000,000 Lire for charity. Their second album, Cosmolandia, was released in 1998 and sold more than 3,000 copies; it contains an unedited song Cosmolandia as sung by Franco Malerba, the first Italian astronaut in space for NASA in 1992 with the Space Shuttle Atlantis STS-46. In 1999 the Space Shuttle Discovery STS-103 was launched from Cape Canaveral transporting the album on board . Cosmolandia was the first Italian song album to fly to space. Buio Pesto even produced the first sci-fi movie entirely shot in Italy: InvaX√∂n - Alieni in Liguria.

Life Johnston was born in Armagh, Ireland, son of William Johnston, also an architect, and studied architecture. He practised in Armagh, and then lived in Drogheda from 1786 before moving to Dublin about 1793. In 1805 he was appointed to the Board of Works as an architect. In 1824 he was made president of the Royal Hibernian Academy of Arts which had been founded the previous year, and he provided headquarters for the Academy in Lower Abbey Street at his own expense. Works Two early projects were the completion of Rokeby Hall and Ballymakenny Church, Co. Louth, to the designs of Thomas Cooley in whose office he first trained. In 1789 he was commissioned by Richard Robinson, 1st Baron Rokeby, and Archbishop of Armagh to design the Armagh Observatory and in 1790 he designed a new club house for Daly's Club on College Green, close to the Irish Houses of Parliament. Townley Hall, 5 km west of Drogheda, built between 1794 and 1798, is considered his finest work.Casey, C. and Rowan, A. 1993 The Buildings of Ireland: North Leinster. London, 51-2, 503‚Äì8. He was responsible for the design of Armagh Courthouse built between 1806 and 1809. The GPO (left) and Nelson's Pillar in Dublin, ca 1830 At a time of huge rebuilding in Georgian Dublin, Johnston was one of the architects responsible for Sackville Street (now O'Connell Street). The great Pillar and Post Office were designed to harmonise with each other in the street adding grandeur and elegance to the boulevard. His work is interesting from an architectural point of view, in that it spans both the Neo-Classical and Neo-Gothic styles. His Chapel Royal in Dublin Castle (1807‚Äì1814) is a fine example of an early Gothic revival church in Dublin. On this project (as on many others) he worked closely with the stuccodore George Stapleton, son of the better-known Michael Stapleton. The chapel proved a seminal building for later Gothic revival architects in Ireland, with the Cork architect Thomas Deane using the detailing from the windows as a model for those of the Aula Maxima of University College Cork, formerly known as Queens College Cork. Among his other most notable projects were the construction of St. George's Church on the North side of Dublin (1802), overseeing the conversion of Parliament House into the Bank of Ireland (1803‚Äì1808) and the construction of the Richmond Tower at the junction of Watling Street and Queen's Bridge in 1812. This gateway had to be moved to the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham after the arrival of the railway in 1847 increased traffic congestion (obviously not new to Dublin!). He had placed his personal coat of arms above the arch, concealed by a piece of wood painted to match the stone, his idea being that his arms would be revealed to future generations after the wood became rotten. However, his little trick was uncovered when the gateway was taken down for removal. The coat of arms at present on the gateway is that of the Royal Hospital. The designs of Galtrim House, Co. Meath (c. 1802) and Ballynegall House, Co. Westmeath, built in 1808, are attributed to Johnston. In 1813 he began work on Richmond Gaol as a prison to relieve the pressure on Newgate Prison, Dublin, which had been designed by his teacher Thomas Cooley. He played a major role in designing Nelson's Pillar in Dublin, the construction of which was started in 1808. The original plans for the Pillar were submitted to the organising committee by William Wilkins, a London architect, Fellow of Caius College, Cambridge, and accepted by them in 1808. However, for some reason, the committee wrote later that they were incapable of \\"executing his design precisely as he had given it.\\" Johnston \\"afforded the necessary assistance with his acknowledged ability, which...he did with the utmost cheerfulness.\\" He made several drawings, one of which met the approval of the committee sufficiently for construction to start. Curiously, the table of expenditure for the Pillar does not include an architect's fee. The Pillar was destroyed by a bomb in 1966. St. George's Church, Hardwicke Place, 1833. He was responsible for the design of Charleville Forest Castle in Tullamore, County Offaly, considered one of the finest of its type in the country. As well as the 1807 design of Ballycurry House, Ballycurry Demesne, Ashford, County Wicklow.Philip Smith (writer), An Introduction to the Architectural Heritage of County Wicklow (Dublin: Wordwell Press / Government of Ireland, Department of the Environment, Heritage, and Local Government, National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, 2004). p.49. The design (c. 1810) of Turbotstown House, Coole, County Westmeath has been attributed to Johnston. He assisted in the design of plans that were later used for St. Andrew's Church, Westland Row, Dublin, and designed the east gates of Slane Castle demesne in County Meath.. In Drogheda, County Louth, he added the Gothic tower and balustrade to Saint Peter's Church of Ireland church in 1793, designed the Corn Exchange (now the Court House) in Fair Street, and designed Saint Peter's Roman Catholic Church in West Street, that was replaced by a Neo-Gothic church in 1881. He was the architect who assisted the 2nd Earl of Longford in turning Tullynally House of County Westmeath into Tullynally Castle, completing these works in 1803. In Swords, County Dublin, he designed the Old Borough School (now a public house) on the main street, completed 1809, and designed Saint Columba's Church of Ireland church, completed 1818. Johnston designed the Courthouse in Duleek, County Meath. It was built circa 1838 as a sessions house for the Meath Grand Jury, commissioned by John Trotter. It was converted to a library and environmental offices in 1960. He lived for many years in his house at 64 Eccles Street, where he kept a large collection of curiosities. He died in 1829 and was buried in St. George's churchyard, which was attached to a temporary church on Whitworth Road (later taken over by the Whitworth Hospital).Townley Hall history. - page 5 References External links *Architects of Ireland ‚Äì Francis Johnston Category:1760 births Category:1829 deaths Category:Irish architects Category:People from Armagh (city) Category:Irish ecclesiastical architects Category:Burials at St. George's Church Cemetery, Dublin ","title":"Francis Johnston (architect)"},{"id":"7108330","text":"Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust provides healthcare for people in the south west Essex, in the East of England.

The original Point Arguello lighthouse, built in 1901, had a white square tower attached to a one-story keeper's house. It had a fourth order Fresnel lens, which was transferred from the Point Hueneme Lighthouse. The tower was replaced in 1934 by a square pyramidal skeletal steel tower, which was in turn replaced by the current post light. History Point Arguello The area of land now known as Point Arguello was originally known by the 'Chumashan‚ÄîCanalino Indian' name \\"Nocto\\" and was part of the territory ruled by Chief Salipuata at the time of the occupation by the Spanish missionaries. The Native Americans were part of the third indigenous people in the area, the Canalino branch of the Chumash people. In Paleo-indian times, a people of Mongolian heritage first settled along the Southern California coast in areas where oak trees were plentiful, from which characteristic they have been named \\"The Oak Tree (Grove) People\\". They vanished some hundreds of years B.C.E., and after a period without archaeological evidence, a second semi‚Äînomadic group arrived. These \\"hunting people\\" gradually merged with a third group, the Chumash people, as they settled here.from Coast Guard website On August 28, 1769, the Portola expedition camped near Point Arguello, where they found a small Chumash rancheria. This area had many excellent flints, and so they named it Los Pedernales, The Flints. This name continued to be used for the point on Spanish maps until Mexican Independence in 1821. The American and non-Spanish European designation was Point Arguello, from the name given by George Vancouver in 1793, in honor of Jos√© Dar√≠o Arg√ºello, then Commandant of the Presidio of Monterey.from Coast Guard website Lighthouse The original Point Arguello tower - U.S. Coast Guard ArchiveThe skeletal Point Arguello tower - U.S. Coast Guard Archive In 1901, the lighthouse service built the first light station at Point Arguello. Due to erosion, The tower was replaced in 1911 with a standalone tower. Between 1934 and 1938, increased coastal shipping necessitated the service establish a lifeboat station.http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=645.com/light.asp?ID=645 In 1934, the tower was razed and replaced with a skeleton tower. . accessed 8/8/2010 On July 1, 1939, the Lighthouse Service was combined with the Coast Guard to augment the Service by 8,000 men who took their place in forming a nucleus for our present day light stations and aids to navigation work. During the interim of World War II, the Coast Guard manned Point Arguello Light and Point Arguello Lifeboat station, as well as a newly established LORAN Station. After 12 years-operation following the War, it was deemed economical to disestablish the lifeboat station and so in 1958, Point Arguello Lifeboat Station was retired.from Coast Guard website Point Arguello had, until 1967, an allowance of 12 enlisted personnel and accommodations for eight families.from Coast Guard website Shipwrecks The history of Point Arguello has been one of shipwrecks, the area having been termed the \\"Graveyard of the Pacific;\\" probably the most famous tragedy was the wreck of the \\"Yankee Blade\\" on October 1, 1854. When the steamship hit the rocks offshore 415 people perished. She carried a fortune in gold bullion which has since been recovered. In 1911, the Santa Rosa ran aground at Saddle Rock, just north of the lighthouse after the Third Officer mistook railroad construction lights for the lighthouse.http://www.noozhawk.com/article/080811_wreck_of_the_santa_rosa Access 2/2/2012 In 1923 what has been called the U.S. Navy's greatest peacetime disaster, the Honda Point Disaster, occurred off the Point when seven 4‚Äîstacker destroyers mistook Point Arguello for Point Conception and sank, with 22 sailors lost. Mariners say that the chief reason that so many boats have struck there is that in bad weather typical of that shoreline, sailing a boat into the channel between San Miguel Island and Points Arguello and Conception is like sailing into the eye of a needle. Rockets history Point Arguello also boasts one of the few space launch facilities in North America, at Vandenberg Air Force Base where many other rocket launch sites have been built since the start of the Space Age. Light operation The Point Arguello Light is a reporting point for the National Weather Service.

Content adaptation is usually related to mobile devices, which require special handling because of their limited computational power, small screen size, and constrained keyboard functionality. Content adaptation could roughly be divided to two fields: # Media content adaptation that adapts media files. # Browsing content adaptation that adapts Web site to mobile devices. Browsing content adaptation Advances in the capabilities of small, mobile devices such as mobile phones (cell phones) and Personal Digital Assistants have led to an explosion in the number of types of device that can now access the Web. Some commentators refer to the Web that can be accessed from mobile devices as the Mobile Web. The sheer number and variety of Web-enabled devices poses significant challenges for authors of Web sites who want to support access from mobile devices. The W3C Device Independence Working Group described many of the issues in its report Authoring Challenges for Device Independence. Content adaptation is one approach to a solution. Rather than requiring authors to create pages explicitly for each type of device that might request them, content adaptation transforms an author's materials automatically. For example, content might be converted from a device- independent markup language, such as XDIME, an implementation of the W3C's DIAL specification, into a form suitable for the device, such as XHTML Basic, C-HTML, or WML. Similarly, a suitable device-specific CSS style sheet or a set of in-line styles might be generated from abstract style definitions. Likewise, a device specific layout might be generated from abstract layout definitions. Once created, the device-specific materials form the response returned to the device from which the request was made. Another way is use the latest trend responsive design based on css, covered in this article (RWD). Content adaptation requires a processor that performs the selection, modification, and generation of materials to form the device-specific result. IBM's Websphere Everyplace Mobile Portal (WEMP), BEA Systems' WebLogic Mobility Server, Morfeo's MyMobileWeb, and Apache Cocoon are examples of such processors. Wurfl and WALL are popular Open Source tools for content adaptation. WURFL is an XML-based Device Description Repository with APIs to access the data in Java and PHP (and other popular programming languages). WALL (Wireless Abstraction Library) lets a developer author mobile pages which look like plain HTML, but converts them to WML, C-HTML, or XHTML Mobile Profile, depending on the capabilities of the device from which the HTTP request originates. GreasySpoon lets the developer build plugins for content editing, in JavaScript, Ruby (programming language), and more, just like the Firefox application GreaseMonkey. Alembik (Media Transcoding Server) is a Java (J2EE) application providing transcoding services for variety of clients and for different media types (image, audio, video, etc.). It is fully compliant with OMA's Standard Transcoder Interface specification and is distributed under the LGPL open source license.

Recent renovations  Lately many renovations have been done to Den Dam, including new road surfaces, new footpaths and the renovation of the central square (\\"het Damplein\\"). Next to the square there was a large terrain that was owned by the Belgian Railroads for repairing and maintenance of trains. In 2001 the city of Antwerp bought the grounds and started the renovation project. The buildings on the terrain were removed and the grounds were cleaned. The whole terrain is now large and has been transformed into a big new parc, as a new green lung of the city, called Park Spoor Noord (Northern Rail Parc). On 24 November 2009 the new BMX and Skatebowl opened; on 25 May 2009 the west side of the parc was opened; it contains a very large grass zone, with walking paths, bicycle roads, kiosks, playgrounds; the map shows you the entire parc; the west side divided by the road was opened. Map of the parc At the end of 2009, the eastern section was also opened. The parc then also contains some basketball fields, petanque fields, fountains and ponds. There will also be a hall for all kinds of events. Some apartment buildings will be built on the edge of the parc.

Reviving the ancient Roman artistic traditions of portrayals of mortal individuals in the guise of the gods, and of the beautiful female form reclining on a couch (as most often seen in reclining portrayals of Hermaphroditi), it was commissioned by Pauline Bonaparte's husband Camillo Borghese and executed in Rome from 1805 to 1808, after the subject's marriage into the Borghese family. It then moved to Camillo's house in Turin, then to Genoa, only arriving in its present home (the Galleria Borghese in Rome) around 1838. The sculpture Nude portraits were unusual, with subjects of high rank usually having strategically placed drapery (though Canova did produce another of the Bonaparte family, with his 1806 Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker). It is a matter of debate as to whether she actually posed naked for the sculpture, since only the head is a realistic (if slightly idealised) portrait, whilst the nude torso is a neo-classically idealised female form. When asked how she could pose for the sculptor wearing so little, she reputedly replied that there was a stove in the studio that kept her warm, though this may be apocryphal or a quip deliberately designed by her to stir up scandal., page 205 She holds an apple in her hand evoking Aphrodite's victory in the Judgement of Paris. The room in which the sculpture is exhibited at the Galleria Borghese also has a ceiling painting portraying the judgement, painted by Domenico de Angelis in 1779 and inspired by a famous relief on the fa√ßade of the Villa Medici. Canova was first instructed to depict Pauline Bonaparte fully clothed as the chaste goddess Diana, hunter and virgin, but Pauline started to laugh and said that nobody would have believed she was a virgin. She had an international reputation for easy promiscuity, in France and in Italy, and may have enjoyed the provocation of posing naked in the Catholic Rome. Further, when Pauline was asked whether she really posed naked in front of Canova, she replied that in fact she was naked, and that it did not constitute a problem because Canova \\"was not a real man\\", and that the room was too warm to pose dressed. The subject of the sculpture may have also been affected by the Borghese family's mythical ancestry: they traced their descent to Venus, through her son Aeneas, the founder of Rome.Canova's Paolina Borghese as Venus Victorious, Ben Pollitt, Smarthistory, accessed December 20, 2012. The wooden base, draped like a catafalque, once contained a mechanism for rotating the sculpture, as in the case of other works by Canova and in the adapted bases of ancient sculpture in galleries, so that a viewer could observe it from all angles without moving him/herself. In the era of its production, viewers would also admire the sculpture by candlelight. The sculpture's lustre was not only due to the fine quality of the marble but also to the waxed surface, which has been recently restored. The plaster original The Museo Canova has the plaster cast of Venus Victrix, originally used as a model for the marble, in its , the museum's plaster cast gallery. During the first Battle of Monte Grappa in 1917, a Christmas-time bombing severed the head of the plaster and damaging parts of the hands, feet, and cloth. A 2004 restoration repaired this damage. In 2020, a tourist broke some of the toes as he sat on the plaster while posing for a selfie.

Most Jains fast at special times such as birthdays, anniversaries, during festivals, and on holy days. Paryushan is the most prominent festival, lasting eight days in Svetambara Jain tradition and ten days in Digambar Jain tradition during the monsoon. The monsoon is a time for Jains to observe most of the religious procedures. However, a Jain may fast at any time. Jain saints usually perform fasts every now and then but at times it becomes a compulsion for them when they have committed an error in relation to the preachings of Mahavira. Variations in fasts encourage Jains to do whatever they can to maintain whatever self control is possible for the individual. According to Jain texts, abstaining from the pleasures of the five senses such as sounds and dwelling in the self in deep concentration is fasting (upavƒÅsa).  Aims for fasting  Fasting can be done to purify both the body and the soul but fasts are also done as a penance.  Pro≈üadhopavƒÅsa  The word Pro≈üadha refers to the holy days in the lunar month. It means giving up the four kinds of food. Pro≈üadhopavƒÅsa is fasting on the eighth and fourteenth days of the lunar cycle. According to Jain text, Puru≈üƒÅrthasiddhyupƒÅya: The person fasting discards bodily adornments such as bath, perfume, garlands, and ornaments, and spends their time in a sacred place such as the abode of a saint or a temple, or somewhere on their own contemplating pure thoughts by listening to scripture. Types of fasting There are several types of fasts:http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/workshop/Sutaria%20Jain%20Rituals.pdfhttp://www.jainworld.com/philosophy/austerities_others.asp *Chauvihar Upvas: Any type of food and water is restricted in this fast, starting from previous sunset to 3rd day sunrise. This upvas is considered toughest. *Tivihar Upvas:Jinendra, Jai. \\"Importance of Fasting during Paryushan.\\" Jain Square. N.p., n.d. Web. To give up only food for the whole day, starting from previous sunset to 3rd day sunrise and so approximately 36 hours. Only boiled water can be consumed in Tivihar Upvas from 48 minutes after sunrise till sunset on the 2nd day only. *Aayambil: To have just one meal in the entire day (typically, lunch) and boiled water. This meal cannot include the following foodstuffs: **Any forms of spices like chilly powder, turmeric powder, dhaniya jeera powder, cumin seeds, sugar and foodstuffs like oil, ghee and honey. **Any form of dairy products like milk, curd, cheese, paneer. **Any forms of direct or processed dryfruits, fruits or vegetables. **Any form of beverages like tea or coffee. **You cannot have anything that tastes sweet, sour, or spicy. Only basic food is permitted which includes foodstuffs made from primary grains and pulses like wheat, rice, green gram, chickpea, urad dal etc. You can have food prepared using the flours of these grains and pulses - wheat flour, rice flour, gram flour (besan). The allowed spices include salt, black pepper, asafoetida powder, baking soda. You can have chapatis, rice, idli and dosa if made without oil, ghee, butter or any of the ingredients listed above. This fast is considered to be tougher than staying hungry (upvas) because you need to accept (almost) tasteless food to complete this fast. *Chauvihar: No food or water after sunset until at least Navkarsi next day. Many Jains practise this daily. Many Jains leave food or water before forty-eight minutes of sunset. *Partial fasting (unodar): Eating less than you desire and to simply avoid hunger. *Vruti Sankshep: Limiting the number of items eaten. *Rasa Parityag: Giving up favourite foods. *Aathai: No food for constant 8 days, only boiled water. *Navai: No food for constant 9 days, only boiled water. *Solbhathu: No food for constant 16 days, only boiled water. *Great fasts are fasts for months at a time. Maaskhaman: To give up food and water or only food continuously for a whole month. *Varshitap is Upwas, fasting for 36 hours, on alternate days for 13 lunar months and 13 days continuously. In Varshitap a person eats on alternate days between sunrise and sunset only. A person can not eat on any two consecutive days for the period of fast but can fast on two consecutive days.  Sallekhana  SallekhanƒÅ is the last vow prescribed by the Jain ethical code of conduct. The vow of sallekhanƒÅ is observed by the Jain ascetics and lay votaries at the end of their life by gradually reducing the intake of food and liquids. This practice has been subject to ongoing debate by human rights experts.

Career  Education  Graduated at ≈†PUD (The School of Applied Arts and Design in Zagreb), graphic department (1972-1977) and attended two years at Academy of Fine Arts, University of Zagreb, graphic department (1977-1979).  Novi kvadrat  Igor Kordej started as a professional graphic designer when he was 18, and as a professional comic artist and illustrator when he was 19 years old, joining a very influential group of comic artists Novi kvadrat (New square) 1976-1979https://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=44279 (in Croatian), and publishing in all relevant Yugoslavian youth magazines of that era. In 1979 Novi kvadrat won the prestigious national award 7 sekretara SKOJ-a, thus marking a break-up of the group.  SLS studio  At the beginning of the eighties Kordej teams-up with Mirko Iliƒá again in SLS studio (acronym for ‚ÄúSlow, Bad and Expensive‚Äù), and focuses on producing album covers and posters for Yugoslavian pop musicians and groups. After the break-up with Iliƒá he continues with solo career, doing illustration for Yugoslavian mainstream magazines, film and theater postershttp://politikaplus.com/novost/155640/u-novoj-predstavi-tresnja-ce- ozivjeti-legendu-o-plemenitim-sljivarima (in Croatian), logotypes and album covershttp://www.beforeafter.rs/muzika/5-najboljih-omota-domacih-albuma/ (in Serbian).  Early international work  He started a career in European comic market in 1986 (France, Spain, Germany), and since 1989 on the US market (Heavy Metal Magazine). His most significant work from that period is album Les cinq saisons ‚Äì Automne, published in 1990 by Dargaud. That album was appointed by the Ministry of Culture in France as a work of significant cultural value and was assigned to all public libraries in France (in 2011 the same album was featured in Paul Gravett‚Äôs book 1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die. Kordej moves from Zagreb to a small Istrian village, Groznjan in 1988 where he leads, as an artist and supervisor, a group of over 20 artists and story writers (among others a young Darko Macan, Edvin Biukoviƒá and Goran Sud≈æuka), as well as veterans Radovan Devliƒáhttps://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radovan_Devli%C4%87 (in Croatian) and Dragan Filipoviƒá Fipahttps://uzicanstveno.rs/uzicanstveno/upoznajmo-fipu- fantastiku-da-bi-ga-vise-voleli/ (in Serbian), producing comics and design for the German market.  Moving abroad  He moves to Denmark in 1991, invited by Semic International company, where he spends almost a year, producing comics and illustrations for Malibu Comics. In 1997 he moves to Canada, invited by Digital Chameleon company, working as a creative director. Having disputes with management, he leaves the company after eight months and becames a freelancer again.  Marvel  His career in Marvel Comics can be divided in two phases; the first one (when he simultaneously worked for Dark Horse Comics) is from 1994-1996, under editor-in-chief Marcus McLaurin, when Kordej produced several hand-painted comics for Tales of Marvels series. Second phase begins in 2001 when he got invited by editor-in‚Äìchief Joe Quesada, to work on Cable series, as well as New X-Men series. Shortly after 9/11 attacks many of Marvel artists produced illustrations inspired by the tragedy. They all went on public auction, with all profit given to families of fallen rescuers. Kordey‚Äôs illustration Pennsylvania Plane was bought by The Library of Congress. Because of his speed as an artist, at his peak, Kordej was producing artwork for three or four monthly books at the same time. However, as a result, he has attracted heavy criticism for the quality of his art, especially from the readers. Eventually he got fired from Marvel in April 2004.  Delcourt  However, that event opened up a new chapter in Kordey‚Äôs career. Just a few months later he signed his first contracts with Editions Delcourt, and his prolific collaboration with that French publisher continued until nowadays. In a period of fifteen years, producing 4-5 albums per year, concluding with 2019 he published close to seventy albums on francophone market, out of which only L‚ÄôHistoire secrete series sold out over 1,000.000 copies. In 2006 he moves back to his homeland.  Style and recognition  Igor Kordej at Festival de la BD de Buc, 2017 Through out all those years Kordej continued to produce graphic design and illustrations for both francophone and ex-Yugoslavian region markets, occasionally doing illustrations for US comics market. He has a very diverse repertoire, moving between traditional pencils and inks to fully painted panels, using watercolors and gouache. His works are collected, among others, in The Library of Congress, LucasFilm (CA) and MoMa ‚Äì Museum od Modern Art (NY).

It is tall and stands on a cliff with a height of . It is between Point Loma Lighthouse to the south and Point Conception Lighthouse to the north. The lighthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The lighthouse is owned by the United States federal government and is managed by the United States Coast Guard. It is not usually open to the public, but the Coast Guard Auxiliary run tours once per month and it is used annually for the city's \\"Whale of a Day\\" festival. History Point Vicente Lighthouse was built in 1926, following years of complaints by shippers about the dangerous waters around the Palos Verdes peninsula. It was constructed using a Parisian Fresnel lens with a width of , which had been in use in Alaska since its construction in 1886. In 1934 the Long Beach Radio Station opened in a neighboring building, which was used to monitor for distress signals. The light source was dimmed to just 25 watts during World War II to avoid aiding the enemy. It was automated in 1971, and the radio station was closed in 1980. In 2015, the Coast Guard announced its intention to replace the original third order lens with an LED light with a 14 nm range, replacing the current light and lens. In February 2019 the lens was removed from the light room. The Point Vicente Lighthouse is just north of the entrances to the Los Angeles/Long Beach Harbors. It was operated and maintained by the United States Lighthouse Service prior to that Service being merged with the U.S. Coast Guard, which was delegated all aid-to-navigation responsibilities in 1939. The lighthouse was manned until 1971 when it was automated by a remote electronic aids-to-navigation monitoring system. The white cylindrical tower is tall,Inventory of Historic Light StationsCalifornia LighthousesPoint Vicente Light and the masonry structure is built on the edge of a cliff. This places the center of the lantern above the ocean. The Coast Guard Light ListLight List Vol VI, p. 36, retrieved July 2016 specifies its light characteristic as being a pair of two white flashes, repeating that pair every 20 seconds. An emergency light of reduced intensity operates if the main light is extinguished. The most striking feature in the lighthouse was the classical third-order rotating Fresnel Lens located in the lantern. This particular lens was manufactured around 1910 in Paris, France, by Barbier, Benard, et Turenne, the oldest lens making company in the world. This lens is made up of hand-ground prisms held in place by a cast brass frame. The prisms and frame represent an excellent example of the precision achieved by optical scientists and the lens making art in utilizing the known principles and properties of light. When it was active, the 1.1 million candlepower-beam had a nominal (clear weather) visible range of . Now removed from the lantern room, the lens will in the future be displayed at the Point Vicente Interpretive Center.https://www.rpvca.gov/1095/PVIC-Phase-II This lighthouse once incorporated a pleasant-sounding foghorn to audibly warn ships during times of low visibility which are common to the area.

A section of scholars earlier considered it as a Hindu sect or a Buddhist heresy, but it is one of the three ancient Indian religions. On 30 January 2014, the Government of India explicitly awarded the status of a \\"minority religion\\" to the Jain community in India, as per Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) Act (NCM), 1992. History of Jain demand for minority status * The Jain demand for minority status is almost a century old, when in British India the Viceroy and Governor General of India, Lord Minto took a decision in principle of giving representation to important minorities in the Central Legislature. Seth Manek Chand Hirachand from Mumbai, an eminent Jain leader from Mumbai and the then Acting President of the Bharatvarshiya Digamber Jain Sabha made an appeal in 1909 to the Governor General for the inclusion of the Jain community for representation in the Council.Manabendra Nath Roy (June 1999 reprint) The Radical Humanist vol 63, no. 3, p. 29 Seth Manek Chand's petition was transferred to the Government of Bombay and the Secretary to the Government of Bombay stated in his reply dated 15 October 1909 as follows: ::\\"I am directed to inform you that a number of seats have been reserved for representation of minorities by nomination and that in allotting them, the claim of the important Jain Community will receive full consideration. \\" * In a Memorandum by the Representative of the Jain Community to the Constituent Assembly in March/April 1947 a strong appeal was made for the inclusion of the Jain community as a minority religious community. * In his speech on 3 September 1949, Jawahar Lal Nehru said: No doubt India has a vast majority of Hindus, but they could not forget in fact there are also minorities Muslims, Christians, Parsis and Jains. If India were understood as Hindu Rashtra it meant that the minorities were not cent per cent citizens of the country: * Jainism is mentioned as a religion along with Buddhism and Sikhism in explanation II of the Article 25 of the India Constitution relating to Fundamental Right to religions freedom. On this issue Jawahar Lal Nehru, the then prime Minister, in his letter dated 31.01.1950 assured a Jain Deputation that they need not have any misgivings on this clear constitutional position. * The second stanza of Jana Gana Mana, Indian National Anthem clearly enunciates Jainism as a separate religious denomination in line with Hinduism, Islam and other religions.Aharaha tava ahvƒÅna prachƒÅrita, ≈õuni tava udƒÅra vƒÅni,Hindu-Bauddha-≈öikha-Jaina-PƒÅrasika-MusalmƒÅna-KhristƒÅni, Purava- pa≈õcima-ƒÅse tava singhƒÅsana pƒÅse, Prema-hƒÅra haya gƒÅmthƒÅ, Jana gana aikya vidhƒÅyaka jaya he bhƒÅrata bhƒÅgya vidhƒÅta, Jaya he, jaya he, jaya he, jaya jaya jaya jaya he! * The Indian Supreme Court in 2005 ruled that Jains, Sikhs and Buddhist are part of broader Hindu fold, as they are Indic religions and interconnected to each other, although they are distinct religions. Recommendation of National Minorities Commission In 1993, the National Minorities Commission arrived at their recommendation that the Jain community be declared as a minority religious community.National Minorities Commission - notification dated 23-10-1993 It was in consideration of the following: *the relevant constitutional provisions, *various judicial pronouncements, *the fundamental differences in philosophy and beliefs (theism vs.atheism principally) vis-a-vis Hinduism, and *the substantial number of Jain population in the country. It resolved to recommend to the Government of India that the Jains deserve to be recognised as a distinct religious minority, and that, therefore the Government of India may consider including them in the listing of \\"Minorities.\\" The Bal Patil Judgement In 2005, the Supreme Court of India declined to issue a writ of Mandamus towards granting Jains the status of a religious minority throughout India. The Court however left it to the respective states to decide on the minority status of Jain religion. In one of the observations of the Supreme Court, not forming part of the judgment, the Court said:Appeal (civil) 4730 of 1999, Bal Patil & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. Indian Supreme Court Decided on 08/08/2005 The Supreme Court also noted: \\" ‚Ä¶ that the State Governments of Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have already notified Jains as 'minority' in accordance with the provisions of the respective State Minority Commissions Act.\\"[para 7 of the Bal Patil Judgment] This cast a doubt on the independent standing of Jain religion. Scholars in the Jain tradition, as well as several groups amongst the Jain community protested, and emphasised that Jain religion stands as a religion in its own right. While Hinduism as a mode of living, and as a culture is to be found across various religions in India because of several common customs, traditions and practices, but as religions Hindu religion and Jain religion are distinct. 2014: National minority status granted On 20 January 2014, the Government of India awarded the minority status to the Jain community in India, as per Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) Act (NCM), 1992. This made the Jain community which makes for 7 million or 0.4 percent of the population as per 2001 census, the sixth community to be designated this status as a \\"national minority\\", after Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis. Though Jains already had minority status in 11 states of India including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, in 2005 a petition was filed with Supreme Court of India, by community representatives, which was also backed by the National Minorities Commission. In its judgement the court left the decision to the Central government. U.P. Basic Shiksha Parishad Judgment In 2006, the Supreme Court opined that \\"Jain Religion is indisputably is not a part of Hindu Religion\\".(para 25, Committee of Management Kanya Junior High School Bal Vidya Mandir, Etah, U.P. v. Sachiv, U.P. Basic Shiksha Parishad, Allahabad, U.P. and Ors., Per Dalveer Bhandari J., Civil Appeal No. 9595 of 2003, decided On: 21.08.2006, Supreme Court of India) Illustrations noted by the Supreme Court Jainism and Other Religions: Illustrations noted by Supreme Court of India in the U.P. Basic Shiksha Parishad Judgment (the para numbers refer to the paragraphs in the Judgment): Jawaharlal Nehru Prime Ministers letter to Jain delegation On 3 September 1949, while addressing a public meeting at Allahabad, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru said:Jawaharlal Nehru's speech reported in the English daily newspaper The Statesman dated 5 September 1949 :\\"No doubt India has a vast majority of Hindus, but they could not forget the fact that there were also minorities - Muslims, Parsis, Christians, Sikhs and Jains. If India was understood as a Hindu Rashtra, it meant that the minorities were not cent percent citizens of this country.\\" The said speech can be considered to be a clarification on Article 25 of the Constitution of India. 10.2 On 31 January 1950, the PPS to the then Prime Minister of India sent a letter to the Jain Deputation on behalf of the then Prime Minister, which reads as under: (See adjoining image for original letter) :\\"With reference to the deputation of certain representatives of the Jains, who met the Prime Minister on the 25 January 1950, I am desired to say that there is no cause whatever for the Jains to have any apprehensions regarding the future of their religion and community. Your deputation drew attention to Article 25, explanation II of the Constitution. This explanation only lays down a rule of construction for the limited purpose of the provision in the article and as you will notice, it mentions not only of Jains but also Buddhists and the Sikhs. It is clear therefore, there is no reason for thinking that Jains are considered to be Hindus. It is true that Jains in some ways closely linked to Hindus and have many customs in common, but there can be no doubt that they are a distinct religious community and constitution does not in any way affect this well recognized position. :Yours faithfully, :Sd. :A.V. Pai :Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister\\" 10.5 Jawaharlal Nehru, in his book Discovery of India, mentioned as under: :\\"Buddhism and Jainism were certainly not Hinduism or even the Vedic Dharma. Yet they arose in India and were integral parts of Indian life, culture and philosophy. A Buddhist or Jain, in India, is a hundred per cent product of Indian thought and culture, yet neither is a Hindu by faith. It is, therefore, entirely misleading to refer to Indian culture as Hindu culture.\\" Dr. S. Radhakrishnan 10.3 Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, the former President of India, in his book \\"Indian Philosophy Vol I\\" mentioned as under: :\\"The Bhagawat Purana does not endorse the view that Rishbhadeva was the founder of Jainism. It is highly doubted that Jainism prevailed even before Vardhamana Mahaveera or Parsvanatha. The Yajurveda does mention three names similar of the tirthankaras -Rishabh, Ajitnath & Aristanemi but the Vedic definitions are different from the Jain definitions.\\" 15\\\\. Dr. Radhakrishnan, who edited the 6th Volume of The Cultural Heritage of India, mentioned as under: :\\"The Jains claim quite a great antiquity for their religion. But, it cannot be competed with the antiquity of Sanadhana Dharma. In the earliest Brahmanic literature are found traces of the existence of a religious Order.\\" \\"Freedom of Religion Bill\\" controversy in Gujarat The Freedom of Religion Bill was a controversial bill passed by the Gujarat state assembly. The bill was passed in 2003. An amendment to the bill was passed on 19 September 2006 which banned the forced conversion from one religion to another. The Anti-Conversion Act passed earlier was not clear on what forced conversion meant and to whom should it apply. Under the amendment Bill, a person need not seek permission in case he/she is converting from one sect to another of the same religion. It clubbed Jainism and Buddhism as denominations of Hinduism, like Shia and Sunnis are of Islam or Catholicism and Protestantism of Christianity. The move evoked strong protests from the state's Jain, Buddhist and Christian communities. The National Commission for Minorities also criticised the Gujarat Assembly's decision to club Jainism and Buddhism with Hinduism terming it to be in contravention of its 23 October 1993, notification classifying Buddhists as a \\"minority community.\\" Ultimately on 31 July 2007, finding it not in conformity with the concept of freedom of religion as embodied in Article 25 (1) of the Constitution, Governor Nawal Kishore Sharma returned the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2006. The Governor held that Jainism and Buddhism are recognised as religions rather than denominations of Hinduism, something that the Amendment Bill sought to wrongly convey. A press release issued by Raj Bhavan, said \\"the proposed amendment would amount to withdrawing the protection against forceful or inappropriate religious conversions, particularly in case of Jains and Buddhists\\". The release cited large scale protests from different religious and social organisations, especially from the Jain and Christian communities, in indicating toward the unacceptability of the proposed amendment. Chronological order of various court judgments on Jainism as a separate religion #1927 - In 1927 Madras High Court in Gateppa v. Eramma and others reported in AIR 1927 Madras 228 held that \\"Jainism as a distinct religion was flourishing several centuries before Christ\\". Jainism rejects the authority of the Vedas which form the bedrock of Hinduism and denies the efficacy of the various ceremonies which Hindus consider essential. #1939 - In Hirachand Gangji v. Rowji Sojpal reported in AIR 1939 Bombay 377, it was observed that \\"Jainism prevailed in this country long before Brahmanism came into existence and held that field, and it is wrong to think that the Jains were originally Hindus and were subsequently converted into Jainism.\\" #1951 - A Division Bench of the Bombay High Court consisting of Chief Justice Chagla and Justice Gajendragadkar in respect of Bombay Harijan Temple Entry Act, 1947 (C.A. 91 of 1951) held that Jains have an independent religious entity and are different from Hindus. #1954 - In The Commissioner Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt reported in AIR 1954 SC 282 this Court observed that there are well known religions in India like Buddhism and Jainism which do not believe in God, in any Intelligent First Cause. The Court recognised that Jainism and Buddhism are equally two distinct religions professed in India in contrast with Vedic religion. #1958 - In well known Kerala Education Bill's case, 1957 reported in AIR 1958 SC 956, this Court held that to claim the minority rights, the Community must be numerically a minority by reference to the entire population of the State or country where the law is applicable. In that way also, the Jain Community is eligible for the claim. #1968 - In Commissioner of Wealth Tax, West Bengal v. Smt. Champa Kumari Singhi & Others reported in AIR 1968 Calcutta 74, a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court observed that \\"Jains rejected the authority of the Vedas which forms the bedrock of Hinduism and denied the efficacy of various ceremonies which the Hindus consider essential. It will require too much of boldness to hold that the Jains, dissenters from Hinduism, are Hindus, even though they disown the authority of the Vedas\\". #1976 - In Arya Samaj Education Trust, Delhi & Others v. The Director of Education, Delhi Administration, Delhi & Others reported in AIR 1976 Delhi 207, it was held as follows: \\"Not only the Constitution but also the Hindu Code and the Census Reports have recognised Jains to belong to a separate religion.\\" In the said judgement, the Court referred to the observations of various scholars in this behalf. The Court quoted Heinrich Zimmer in \\"Philosophies of India\\" wherein he stated that \\"Jainism denies the authority of the Vedas and the orthodox traditions of Hinduism. Therefore, it is reckoned as a heterodox Indian religion\\". The Court also quoted J. N. Farquhar in Modern Religious Movements in India wherein he stated that \\"Jainism has been a rival of Hinduism from the beginning\\". In the said judgment, in conclusion, the Court held that \\"for the purpose of Article 30(1), the Jains are a minority based on religion in the Union Territory of Delhi\\". #1993 - In A.M. Jain College v. Government of Tamil Nadu (1993) 1 MLJ 140, the Court observed that it is also an admitted fact that the Jain community in Madras, Tamil Nadu is a religious and linguistic minority. #2005 - Supreme Court of India gave verdict that Jainism, Sikhism (and Buddhism) are distinct religions, but are inter-connected and inter- related to Hinduism, so these three are part of wider broader Hindu religion, based on the historic background on how the Constitution had come into existence after. #2006 - Supreme Court of India found that the \\"Jain Religion is indisputably not a part of the Hindu Religion\\".para 25, Committee of Management Kanya Junior High School Bal Vidya Mandir, Etah, Uttar Pradesh v.

He previously served as the Chief Executive Officer of the National Rugby League between February 2002 and June 2012. He was also the Secretary of the Rugby League International Federation from its inception in 1998 up until his resignation on 5 June 2012. Biography Gallop was born in Canberra and lived there until the age of 14 while his father worked as a lawyer. He spent a short time in Darwin before returning to Canberra in the suburb of Narrabundah. Gallop played cricket at Canberra Grammar and his father persuaded him to become a Canberra Raiders supporter. He started a sports administration course at Canberra College of Advanced Education but bowed out after just a week for arts at the Australian National University. He then moved to Sydney in 1984 to study law at the University of Sydney, graduating in 1988. In 1989, he travelled to England to play cricket in the Kent League. In 1990, he married wife Kathy and together they have two children, Thomas and Anna. Football administration Rugby league During the summer of 1994‚Äì95, Gallop was working as an associate with the Sydney law firm Holman Webb Lawyers, and playing cricket on weekends with a University of NSW Cricket Club side. A UNSW teammate had set up a meeting with John Ribot, who had come up with the Super League idea, and Gallop first became involved in Rugby league as Legal Affairs Manager for Super League in 1995. Having previously acted as the NRL's Director of Legal and Business Affairs, Gallop was closely involved in all key decisions involving the game since the NRL's inception in late 1997. He was voted the New South Wales Sports Administrator of the Year in 2002. In 2006, he was voted the Australian Sports Administrator of the year at the Confederation of Australian Sport Awards. In 2008, he was appointed to the Board of the Australian Sports Commission. In 2010, he was named acting Chairman of the Australian Sports Commission.Farewell to Outgoing Chairman of the ASC Board Greg Hartung In April 2010, in the greatest sporting scandal in NRL history, he announced the stripping of two premierships and three minor premierships from the Melbourne Storm team. He further announced they would play out the remainder of the 2010 season for no points. Gallop was widely criticised by many for these heavy penalties with much of the criticism directed at the apparent conflict of interest. Gallop's employer - News Limited - was also the owner of the Melbourne Storm. Gallop was also close friends with John Hartigan - the then Chairman of News Limited Australia. Hartigan identified Storm's ex- CEO Brian Waldron as the 'chief rat'. All penalties were handed down despite Gallop not seeking board approval prior to doing so, and were handed down before any investigation was conducted. In order to diffuse some of this criticism, the NRL Board finally came out a month later and backed Gallop's stance. This was the second major salary cap scandal under Gallop's leadership. In 2002, the then table-topping Canterbury Bulldogs were stripped of all competition points and finished wooden spooners after being found cheating the salary cap. However, just two years later they won the premiership with largely the same playing roster. Gallop also had to deal with the mid-season defection of Bulldogs star Sonny Bill Williams to French rugby union. In 2011, he again fell into hot water in his first visit to Melbourne after the Storm salary cap scandal of 2010, when he likened Melbourne Storm fans to terrorists after they booed him during the presentation of the 2011 Minor Premiership. This coming after the Storm were presented the minor premiership on 11 September, exactly the tenth anniversary of the 11 September attacks in America. He was forced later to clarify his comments which did little to ease the already fractured relations between the NRL and the Melbourne Storm fans. In February 2012, co-inciding with the formation of the new NRL independent commission and the exit of News Limited from its control of the game, Gallop's contract as CEO was formally extended a further four years. His contract extension was a condition placed by News Limited with the ARL. 2012 was Gallop's 10th year in charge of Rugby League in Australia; however, on Tuesday, 5 June 2012 Gallop's reign as NRL CEO came to an end when the new Independent Commission announced his immediate departure. This was mostly due to the fact that the ARL wanted to go 'in a different direction'. Football On 21 August 2012, David Gallop was announced as the new chief executive of the Football Federation Australia, replacing previous CEO and former Australian Rules footballer Ben Buckley. During his time as CEO, Gallop oversaw the introduction of the FFA Cup competition bringing together clubs from the national level A-League as well as state based leagues. In his time as CEO, Australia's men's and women's national teams also underwent substantial change, with Holger Osieck replaced as the men's team by Ange Postecoglou who took charge for the 2014 FIFA World Cup finals and Australia's successful appearance at the 2015 AFC Asian Cup. Australia's women's team coach Alen Stajcic was dismissed in the months leading up to the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, leading to some criticism in the media. Gallop would prove to become an unpopular administrator within Australian football, with fan boycotts of A-League games reducing crowds by 32% in late 2015, protesting his decision to not defend the Australian football community after an article by News Corp journalist Rebecca Wilson leaked the identity of 198 supporters who had been banned from matches by the FFA, as well as a lack of a transparent appeals process for bans.A-League crowds well down as fans boycott in protest against Football Federation Australia, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 7 Dec 2015, archived 21 May 2020David Gallop speaks about week of controversy in the A-League, Fox Sports, 1 Dec 2015, archived 21 May 2020Football in Australia is doomed to be a marginal sport unless its leaders show vision, Simon Hill, Guardian Australia, 14 July 2020 In July 2019, it was announced that Gallop would stand down from his role as FFA CEO in December 2019.

During this time, the first Russian university was founded, a library, a theatre, a public museum, as well as relatively independent press. Like other enlightened despots, Catherine the Great played a key role in fostering the arts, sciences, and education. The national Enlightenment in the Russian Empire differed from its Western European counterpart in that it promoted further modernization of all aspects of Russian life and was concerned with abolishing the institution of serfdom in Russia. The Pugachev Rebellion and French Revolution may have shattered the illusions of rapid political change, but the intellectual climate in Russia was altered irrevocably. Russia's place in the world was debated by Denis Fonvizin, Mikhail Shcherbatov, Andrey Bolotov, Alexander Radishchev, and Ivan Boltin; these discussions precipitated the divide between the radical, western, conservative and Slavophile traditions of Russian thought. Intellectuals often used the term prosveshchenie, promoting piety, erudition, and commitment to the spread of learning. Catherine the Great personally wrote the words for her ambassadors and consuls in order to compile a Comparative dictionary of Catherine the Great.  Early developments  The ideas of the Russian Enlightenment were first espoused by the \\"learned druzhina\\" of Peter the Great. It is the spirit which animates the sermons of Feofan Prokopovich, the satires of Antiokh Kantemir, and the historiography of Vasily Tatishchev. During the reign of Peter's daughter Elizaveta Petrovna the ideas of the Enlightened Absolutism found their way into Russia. Elizaveta's favourite, Ivan Shuvalov, was an ideal enlightened courtier: he was instrumental in the establishment of the Moscow University and the Imperial Academy of Arts, which would start the careers of most intellectuals active during the last quarter of the 18th century. Shuvalov was also the patron of the greatest Russian polymath‚Äì Mikhail Lomonosov‚Äì who left his mark in various branches of science, religious philosophy, poetry, and fine arts. Although his research inevitably eroded the authority of religious doctrines, Lomonosov himself was a devout Christian.  Catherine the Great  View of Ivan Shuvalov's art gallery Catherine the Great considered herself an enlightened despot. She read the most prominent philosophes of the day, including Montesquieu and Voltaire and tried to adhere to Enlightenment ideas.Billington, James H. The Icon and the Axe: An Interpretive History of Russian Culture. Toronto: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1966. pp. 217‚Äì26. Print. She wished to bring Russia up to par with its neighbors not only in a military sense, but also politically, culturally, and intellectually. Many of Catherine's contemporaries questioned her adherence to Enlightenment ideals and thought she was an egoist, merely using concepts from the Age of Enlightenment to further her selfish gains.Riasanovsky, Nicholas V., and Mark D. Steinberg. A History of Russia. 8th ed. Vol. 1. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011. n.p. Print. Gender played a primary role in these criticisms. Contemporaries interpreted her personality as combining masculine strength with feminine vanity. \\"Westernization\\" carries different meanings in different countries over varying time periods. But in relation to Russia during the 18th century, the term meant legislative changes to economics, politics and culture. It also entails the Russian gentry's adherence to a set standard and its imitation of the Western values.Kahan, Aracadius. \\"The Costs of \\"Westernization\\" in Russia: The Gentry and the Economy in the Eighteenth Century.\\" Slavic Review 25.1 (1966): 40‚Äì66. Westernization in Russia included the modernization of machinery, the refinement of a more efficient bureaucracy, and the acceptance of Western European tastes. Russia produced more goods, and enlisted thousands of troops during Catherine's reign. While she acquired new lands, including Crimea and Poland, updated the army, and supported burgeoning manufactures, she really wanted to westernize Russia by reforming it, specifically the lives of the gentry, qualitatively. Bringing Russia to an equal level with the rest of Europe intellectually was a major concern of Catherine's. For this reason she created laws that justified her rule. Foreign policy Almost every Russian ruler has sought to conquer ports in warm waters. Peter I fought the Ottoman Empire over the Crimea. Gaining access to the Crimea would have given Russia access to the Black Sea and the Dardanelles. While Russia occupied Poland, France realized that the Ottoman Empire was the only country in a position to topple Catherine. Supported by France, the Turks told Russia to leave Poland. Russia declared war on the Sultan immediately afterward.Troyat, Henri. Catherine the Great. New York: Penguin Books, 1980. n.p. Print. After several successful victories including the destruction of the Turkish naval fleet, Catherine impressed many European powers. \\"Catherine, who had at first been treated as a dilettante in politics, now appeared to all the Western chanceries as an evil genius. Catherine returned to the Crimea in November 1776, and imposed a ruler for the reoccupation of the peninsula because of disturbances there.de Madariaga, Isabel. Catherine the Great: A Short History. Vol. 1. n.p.: Yale University, 1990. N. pag. 1 vols. Print. The Crimeans revolted in 1778, after which the Russians went in the same year and installed their own leader to the throne. Because she gained significant diplomatic power in the early 1770s Catherine considered something called the \\"Greek Project\\". This consisted of pushing the Turks out of Europe but it also carried another more utopian aspect: reclaiming Constantinople from Muslim to Orthodox Christian rule. The Second Turkish War, 1787‚Äì1792, ended with Russia gaining the fortress of Ochakov and the Black Sea shore to the Dniester river, and the Ottoman Empire recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea. Retaking Constantinople and creating a Christian empire centered there does not appear to be a very enlightened plan. However, Catherine saw land grabbing as an easy way to assert Russia's intentions. By declaring that Constantinople would one day belong to Christians, she also appeased the Church, which still held significant influence in the 18th century. She wished to show Western Europe that her country would be a powerful presence in European political matters. Catherine's partition of Poland was an even more blatant example of power politics. Russia invaded three separate times, in 1772, 1793, and 1795, and divided the once important European state between itself, Austria and Prussia. The 3rd May Constitution of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth voted in 1791 was considered by Catherine as a JacobinWolfgang Menzel, Germany from the Earliest Period Vol. 4, Kessinger Publishing, 2004, , Google Print, p.33 threatJohn Markoff, Waves of Democracy, 1996, , p.121. and as a therefore presenting a threat to Russia's monarchy and its influence in Poland,Paul W.

But she went far beyond this type of modernization that Peter the Great used in Russia. The institution of laws and importation of liberal Western European thought served as means of expanding the state. Politics At the advice of her learned correspondents, Catherine introduced a number of changes, ranging from the vast secularization of monastic properties to the domestic reform which envisioned more rational planning for the Russian towns. Catherine believed in Enlightenment political thought. She reformed the strong and powerful bureaucracy Peter the Great established.Whittaker, Cynthia H. \\"The Reforming Tsar: The Redefinition of Autocratic Duty in Eighteenth-Century Russia.\\" Slavic Review 51.1 (1992): 77‚Äì98. Print. She established fifty \\"gubernii\\" provinces, divided into ten districts. 300,000 to 400,000 people lived in each province and 20,000 to 30,000 lived in every district. A governor, and a network of officials, divided by executive, legislative, and judicial functions were ideally supposed to run each province. Catherine also wanted the gentry to play a role in local political affairs. Catherine's political reforms went beyond perfecting Russia's bureaucracy. Her Nakaz or \\"Instruction\\" expressed her political ideals.de Madariaga, Isabela. Politics and Culture in Eighteenth-century Russia. New York: Addison Wesley Longman Inc., 1998. She wrote this for her Legislative Commission, summoned in 1767 to draft a Code of Laws for Russia. Representatives from all the free estates of the realm, government bodies, and non-Russian people considered the state of Russia's laws. Several of her advisers suggested putting in place a council to regulate legislation but this was promptly rejected. Once Catherine began to lose the slightest amount of power she reverted to the ways of the past: autocratic rule. She ruled through a series of functional colleges headed by boards under presidents, who worked in cooperation with an appointed administrative Senate of 20 or 30 people. The Senate possessed no legislative powers. Catherine kept the power to pass laws. She realized the need for the establishment of laws. Some argue that Catherine used the Enlightenment as a way of placing \\"her rule on firm philosophic foundations and providing a national guide for the moral leadership of Europe.\\" Others say she used her laws for purely practical reasons. She established a civil law code in January 1774 and a criminal code during the second half of the 1770s, but never finished a unitary code.Dixon, Simon. The Modernisation of Russia 1676‚Äì1825. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999. She drew heavily in the Nakaz from the latest continental jurisprudence but ignored references to natural law. Criticism of the Empress's reforms abounded. Professor Semeon Desnitskii, a follower of Adam Smith, suggested that Catherine institute elections every five years of a representative Senate and separation of powers. Mikhail Kheraskov used novels and poems to show that the duty of the autocrat was to transition from an enlightened absolute monarch to a constitutional or limited monarch. To understand the significance of Catherine's rule, one must look back on Peter the Great's reign. Peter established the idea of a \\"reforming tsar.\\" He broke away from the old Muscovite conception of the Russian sovereign as \\"good tsar.\\" From his reign on all tsars were judged by the standard of: modernizing economics, society, politics and cultural life, gaining influence abroad, and leading Russia on secular Western European ideas. No longer did leaders paternalistically protect the Russian homeland. Russia became a major European power because of Peter's reforms. From Peter's rule set the precedent for succeeding leaders. For the next 150 years, Russian rulers followed \\"reform conservatism\\" which consisted of maintaining the state's power, fighting off fundamental change, but also adopting progressive changes that gave the autocracy a feature of liberalism, which was actually conservative in practice. Culture Considered the \\"only articulate ideologist to rule Russia between Ivan IV and Lenin\\", Catherine not only wanted to have military and political equality with Western European countries but she also strove to emulate their enlightened rule by supplanting western thought and practices onto the Russian gentry. Catherine did this because of universal standards Europeans used to compare themselves.Kelly, Catriona. Refining Russia: Advice Literature, Polite Culture, and Gender from Catherine to Yeltsin. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. In contrast to Peter I, who regulated Russian society through public ceremony and legislation, Catherine promoted \\"the internal mechanisms of behavior regulation.\\" She attempted to achieve this remarkable goal through education. Russia set up state-run schools that provided students with learning in the three Rs, as well as about behavior proper for citizenship. The schools stressed two principles above all else: the need to be patriotic, and the need to accept innovation. The upper classes' increased purchasing power caused them to see themselves as equals to the French, British, Swiss, Danish and Swedes. This led the gentry, viewed as the \\"pillar of absolutism and of the Russian state,\\" to \\"domesticate‚Äîin the most literal sense of the word‚Äîthe appointments of Western European polite society.\\" Catherine called the gentry, in her Nakaz as \\"an Appellation of Honour, which distinguishes all those who are adorned with it from every other Person of Inferior Rank.\\" In 1785, she fused the notion of reward for service with the idea of inherited rank in \\"Declaration of the Rights, Freedom and Privileges of the Well-Born Russian Nobility\\": \\"The right to the name of dvoryanin (gentry) comes down from the quality and virtue of those men who took the lead in ancient times and distinguished themselves by particular service.\\" She codified this by ordering assemblies of the gentry in regional centers to keep genealogical records. Catherine's reforms allowed those with historically powerful families to keep their status in society, and others to rise due to service. A nobleman no longer showed his refinement through his servitude to the court but through what he owned and what company he kept. Catherine's Smol'nyi Institute in St. Petersburg, based on the French Maison royale de Saint Louis, taught upper-class girls polite manners in society and gave them a moral education. Girls studied not only \\"dance, music, sewing, drawing, and household economy\\" but also \\"law, mathematics, languages, geography, history, economy, architecture, science, and ethics.\\" Quarenghi's design for the Smolny Institute Her Sub-Commission on Education concerned itself not with the subtleties of sciences, but with primary, secondary, and higher education. The idea was to teach children the duties required of those who live in society. The Sub-Commission began its work in May 1768 and used English universities, the Prussian system of national education and \\"Irish school\\" as models. The state then established free, co-educational high schools and primary schools in provincial towns in 1786. By 1764, district towns received primary schools however; rural schools did not come into existence. Few children attended public schools. Around 176,000 children passed through Russian public school between 1786 and 1796. Russia lacked the finances and teachers to run schools properly. Secularization, a \\"western\\" principle, officially came to Russia through monetary necessity. Of course Enlightenment ideas about religion influenced the gentry but Catherine established the Commission on Church Lands on February 6, 1764 to support the finances of the state. The appropriation of Church lands to the state brought a substantial amount of money, land, and peasants under Catherine's control. Economics The state's efforts to \\"westernize\\" Russia's gentry greatly affected their economic cirmcumstances. The wealthiest classes gained more income in order to afford education and western habits. The gentry consisted of a fairly impoverished majority and small extremely wealthy minority. The lower gentry farmed and lived slightly better than the few serfs they had. In 1777, 59 percent of the gentry owned less than twenty serfs. The lives of serfs and peasants remained relatively the same during Catherine's reign. In 1762 the peasantry was divided into three groups: private serfs, Church peasants, and state peasants. Consisting of 56 percent of the peasantry, private serfs were bound to their villages because of tax purposes and military conscription. Their masters had a legal responsibility to feed them in time of famine, care for them in old age, and pay their poll-tax. The upper classes of Russia put more money into manufacturing, which grew during Catherine's reign. The number of enterprises increased from 600‚Äì700 in 1762 to over 2,000 when her reign ended. Russian agriculture grew during Catherine's reign due to the economic pressure put upon the gentry that needed more wealth in order to indulge in Western European tastes. The gentry used potentially arable land in old areas as well as new land on the peripheries of the empire. This expansion occurred during the 1780s and 90s. Throughout Catherine's reign she tried to find a balance between liberal political economic ideas in the tradition of Adam Smith, and the strong regulation started by Peter I. She preferred hired labor in industry, lowered internal tariffs and custom duties, and did not support monopolies. Catherine forbade the purchase of serfs for industry. Mining was a source of Russian wealth. Catherine invited German mineralogy expert Franz Ludwig von Cancrin to Russia and put him in charge of a major salt mine at Staraya. Cancrin's son Georg von Cancrin joined him later in Russia, where he rose to the post of Minister of Finance. In the 1762, the Church owned two-thirds of ploughed land. After Catherine's reform, secularized Church land brought the state \\"an annual income of 1,370,000 rubles, of which less than 463,000 was returned to the Church each year between 1764 and 1768.\\" Catherine and Voltaire Catherine first initiated the relationship between herself and Voltaire, and she went to very great lengths to make his acquaintance. In the autumn of 1763, Catherine arranged for her Genevan secretary Fran√ßois-Pierre Pictet, an acquaintance of Voltaire, to send Voltaire a letter (supposedly written by Catherine herself) in which Pictet praised her at great length.Catherine II, Empress of Russia, Voltaire. Voltaire and Catherine the Great: Selected Correspondence, trans. A. Lentin (Cambridge: Oriental Research Partners, 1974), 33. Catherine made many other attempts to link herself to the French philosophes: she offered to publish the Encyclop√©die in Russia, arranged for several of Voltaire's plays to be produced at the Court of St. Petersburg, asked for copies of his complete works, and invited him to come to Russia. Her flattery eventually won over Voltaire, and they began writing letters to each other in the autumn of 1763, continuing to do so until Voltaire's death fifteen years later. A relationship with Voltaire benefited Catherine for several reasons. Firstly, Catherine felt the need to strengthen her claim to power, having only recently taken the throne from her husband in a coup d'√©tat. Since the philosophes significantly shaped public opinion in Western Europe, Catherine wanted desperately to gain Voltaire's approval. She used him to spread support of her policies throughout Western Europe. Voltaire also interested Catherine on an intellectual level, as they shared a common interest in politics, philosophy, and literature. Her correspondence with Voltaire provided an outlet for her intellectual curiosity.For an overview of Catherine's many intellectual interests, see: Frank T Brechka, \\"Catherine the Great: The Books She Read\\", The Journal of Library History 4, no. 1 (Jan. 1969): 39‚Äì52. Voltaire likewise benefited from Catherine's friendship. Long an admirer of enlightened despotism, Voltaire approved of Catherine's secular policies. He thought that his correspondence with Catherine would help him explore the possibilities for enlightened despotism and allow him to compare the laws and customs of Russia with those of France. By 1763, Voltaire had long been interested in Russia on an intellectual level, having written in 1759 the Histoire de l'Empire de Russie sous Pierre le Grand. Furthermore, because Voltaire was persecuted in Europe for his ideas and even exiled from Paris, he appreciated the Russian Empress's flattery and recognition of his talents and progressive thinking. Voltaire played an important role in promoting Catherine's image in Europe. He has been described as Catherine's \\"most distinguished western partisan, her most enthusiastic devotee, and her most indefatigable and eloquent propagandist.\\"Catherine II, Empress of Russia, Voltaire. Voltaire and Catherine the Great: Selected Correspondence, trans. A. Lentin (Cambridge: Oriental Research Partners, 1974), 12. In addition to singing her praises among his circles of friends, Voltaire wrote pamphlets that supported Catherine's policies and had her pronouncements and letters published in the western press, particularly targeting anti-Russian publications such as the Gazette de France, the Gazette de Cologne, and the Courrier d'Avignon. Voltaire even succeeded in convincing the French historian Claude-Carloman de Rulhi√®re not to publish his Histoire ou anecdotes sur la r√©volution de Russie en l'ann√©e 1762, which provided a disparaging account of Catherine's rise to power. Voltaire as propagandist A foreign-born woman and usurper of the Russian throne, Catherine the Great held no legitimate claim to the crown. Her sole connection with the house of Romanov derived from her marriage to the late Emperor, Peter III, whose murder she was widely known to have orchestrated. The royals who held genealogical claims to the throne overtly devised plots to replace the new Tsarina. Both Ivan VI and Paul I, armed with supporters, threatened Catherine's rule, as well as the guards who possessed the military might to overthrow the Empress.(Lentin 9) In a letter to Voltaire on September 21, 1762, Catherine acknowledged the conspirators and potential traitors all around her: \\"Every guardsman when he looks at me can say: 'I made that woman.'\\" A shrewd politician, Catherina also knew she needed the support of the Court, the public, and other powerful regimes in order to maintain power, suppress rebellion, and emerge as a leading world power. Catherine's letters to Voltaire often served as a means to woo the influential philosopher to her cause. Rather than pursue intellectual subjects, Catherine utilized her letters to flatter and cajole the philosopher. While Voltaire often attempted to initiate the Empress in an intellectual dialogue, Catherine often sidestepped his inquiries.(Wilberger 19) For example, \\"Voltaire did try to start a discussion‚Ä¶in the case of the [Claude Adrien] Helvetius translation by Golitsuin. In response to Voltaire's comments‚Ä¶Catherine blithely agrees‚Ä¶but confesses she has not read the book yet,\\".(Wilberger 157) One has the impression that Voltaire would have liked to dwell on literary, philosophic or artistic subjects as he did with his other correspondents. However, Catherine was far more interested in winning the philosopher's approval than in entering a philosophical dialogue. The content of her letters does not permit one to see her primary motives as anything other than propagandistic. She is not at all interested in broadening her cultural and intellectual horizons. Catherine seeks no advice from Voltaire on how to rule Russia‚Ä¶. Instead Catherine tries to impose her views, justify her policies and explain away her failures. Voltaire is, for Catherine, the best method of diffusing favorable information in Europe.(Wilberger 182) As a testament to Catherine's political ingenuity, she skillfully kept Voltaire at arm's length, feigning a belief in absolute liberalism in her letters while, in practice, implementing repressive reforms in her country. For example, the opinion she shares with Voltaire regarding serfdom did not always correspond with the laws she passed. \\"The Empress turned over 800,000 peasants to private proprietors. The 1763 law limiting freedom of movement by requiring the peasant to get a permit from the landlord before he/she could leave the property has been cited as evidence that Catherine enserfed peasants in the name of fiscal expediency,\\".(Henderson 17) Catherine's correspondence largely acted as propaganda intended to assure Voltaire (and Europe) of Russia's prosperity. Handicapped by distance and a lack of information, Voltaire was simply too willing to believe in Catherine's liberalism. Despite her impure intentions, Catherine remained a loyal and unwavering disciple of Voltaire. Catherine revered the philosopher whose work she had read since her youth. Upon receiving a poem from Voltaire dedicated to her, the empress was \\"totally overwhelmed by her emotions‚Ä¶In a letter full of flattery and profound respect‚Ä¶Catherine announced that she had no desire to read any literary works that were not written as well as Voltaire's,\\".(Gorbatov 74) She often called Voltaire her \\"teacher\\", her \\"thinking instructor\\", and her \\"master of thought,\\".(Gorbatov 65) After his death in 1778, Catherine wrote letters to her contemporaries imploring them to study and memorize his works. \\"She believed that the study of his work educated citizens, that it helped to form geniuses, heroes and writers, and that it would help to develop thousands of talents,\\".(Gorbatov 66) Her devotion to Voltaire after his death remains evident of her sincere and genuine reverence of him. Throughout her reign, Catherine remained committed to intellectual pursuits and encouraged members of her court to engage in them as well. The empress provided her palace staff with a library and reportedly spent an average of 80,000 rubles annually on books.(Henderson 15) In his essay, \\"Catherine the Great: Enlightened Empress?\\" Simon Henderson implores the reader to consider the constraints the empress faced when deciding if she was truly an enlightened despot. Henderson asserts that despite her deceptive tactics, she always possessed an \\"unswerving commitment to modernizing Russia,\\". Early on, Catherine concerned herself with the philosophies and culture of the enlightenment. Though she often agreed with their liberal positions, her status in court was entirely reliant upon the support of noble families. As a result, the Empress could not always implement reforms the way she would have liked. For example, when confronted with the issue of serfdom, Catherine initially suggested in her proposal of \\"the Instruction\\" that landowners offer serfs the option to \\"purchase their freedom\\" (Henderson 16) or that the government limit the period of servitude to six years. However, the nobles omitted this section from the document as it did not benefit them. \\"Rather than seeing her as insincere in her concern for the peasantry, historians have recently highlighted‚Ä¶what she might have achieved had the circumstances been different,\\". Despite the constraints, Catherine did manage to implement few policies that benefitted the serfs. In 1767 it was forbidden for foster parents to enserf illegitimate children and in 1781 enserfment of prisoners of war was prohibited and a law passes that saw marriage of a free man to a serf woman emancipate the woman. Catherine is known to have investigated and then bought out landowners who were reported to ill-treat their serfs,. Voltaire outwardly supported emancipation of the serfs. The philosopher believed that the Russian aristocracy \\"should not permit the vast majority of the people to go on suffering from the arbitrariness of [the] very laws who ought to be to afford protection to each and all,\\".(Neserius 36) Furthermore, in an attempt to create a more educated bureaucracy, Catherine moved to bring better education to her people. In 1786, she established the Russian Statute of National Education to launch a national school system. As a result of her campaign to modify Russia, Catherine successfully introduced the tsardom to the Western world and furthered the degree to which it was involved in European affairs. While Catherine worked to bring enlightenment principles to Russia, Voltaire worked to improve her reputation in Europe. The philosopher enthusiastically adopted her cause, commending her to friends in high places, advising her in politics, and distributing her texts to the liberal media, thereby cementing her title as an enlightened despot. \\"Voltaire participated in a campaign to protect Catherine's reputation‚Ä¶he wrote pamphlets in support of her policies‚Ä¶[and] published her pronouncements in the western press,\\".(Lentin 14) In a letter to Marquis D'Argenson, a French statesman, Voltaire asked him to help \\"re-establish [Catherine's] reputation in Paris\\", (Lentin 13). Catherine, happy with rise to popularity, admits to Prince De Ligne: \\"It was certainly Voltaire who brought me into fashion,\\". However, Voltaire certainly recognized the benefits of fraternizing with the Empress of Russia. The philosopher enjoyed socializing with Europe's elite and often boasted of his influential friends. \\"He avowed the usefulness of having a crowned up [his] sleeve‚Ä¶\\".(Lentin 16) Furthermore, as a result of his association with Catherine, Voltaire saw it beneficial for his own reputation to rid the Empress of her disparaging image. \\"As Catherine's name was linked more and more to that of the philosophes, it became important that she be cleared of such any unsavory charges,\\".(Wilberger 147) Thus neither pen pal was possessed entirely \\"pure\\" intentions. Yet, despite their ulterior motives, the correspondence remains an important document recording the political pursuits of an Empire. Catherine's alignment with Voltaire acted as an early indication of the Russian tsardom moving towards closer relations with Europe. Correspondence The main topics of discussion in the Voltaire-Catherine letters were Russia's foreign and domestic affairs. Despite their mutual affection for literature, art and philosophy, very rarely did Catherine and Voltaire discuss such topics. One scholar has suggested that Catherine did not have the intellectual capacity to have such discussions with Voltaire, and that Catherine brought up primarily political affairs in her letters in order to impart her political ideas onto Voltaire.Carolyn H. Wilberger, \\"Voltaire and Catherine the Great.\\" in Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century, ed. Theodore Besterman (Oxford: The Voltaire Foundation, 1976), 159. They did discuss cultural matters in the year 1772, which suggests that Catherine wanted to distract Voltaire from her recent partition of Poland. Both Catherine and Voltaire wrote to each other in generally approbatory tones. Voltaire's letters to Catherine have been described as \\"a catalogue of extravagant and unqualified compliments, and fulsome approbation of her policies.\\"Catherine II, Empress of Russia, Voltaire. Voltaire and Catherine the Great: Selected Correspondence, trans. A. Lentin (Cambridge: Oriental Research Partners, 1974), 11. He even addressed her as \\"my Catherine.\\" While Catherine also flattered Voltaire in her letters, she wrote in a more contrived manner, perhaps due to the fact that her secretary Pictet thoroughly revised the letters (unlike the letters she wrote to Frederick the Great) prior to sending them. The main difference between the two sets of letters seems to be that \\"[Catherine] compliments Voltaire, to tickle his vanity and play on his prejudices\\", while Voltaire's compliments \\"convey undertones of hero-worship.\\" Domestic affairs In their discussions of Russia's domestic affairs, Catherine only exchanged news with Voltaire that would cast Russia and her rule in a positive light. She sent him news that depicted Russia as an economically stable and prosperous country and to depict herself as the epitome of an enlightened despot. Catherine greatly exaggerated Russia's economic stability and greatly misinformed Voltaire on the subject. For instance, Catherine in the correspondence never mentioned the Pugachev rebellion of 1773‚Äì74. When Voltaire brought up the subject, Catherine brushed it off by simply saying that she had it under control. As a result, Voltaire never realized the significant economic hardship of Russia's peasant class that had triggered the revolt.Carolyn H. Wilberger, \\"Voltaire and Catherine the Great.\\" in Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century, ed. Theodore Besterman (Oxford: The Voltaire Foundation, 1976), 150. They often discussed legislation, as both strongly advocated for the absolute power of the law. Voltaire asked for information on Catherine's regulations, and Catherine sent Voltaire a copy of her Instructions, which he read twice. The subject of serfdom, in regard to which Voltaire advocated emancipation, also figured prominently in their correspondence. Although Voltaire sent Catherine advice on the subject, he never pushed his ideas, nor did he condemn Catherine for not taking more progressive action against the institution. Nevertheless, Voltaire made clear his stance regarding serfdom in his submission for an essay competition held by the Free Economic Society of St. Petersburg in 1767. For the subject topic of the contest, Catherine chose \\"the merits of private ownership of land by the peasants.\\" Voltaire's essay, to his disappointment, only received an honorable mention.Carolyn H. Wilberger, \\"Voltaire and Catherine the Great.\\" in Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century, ed. Theodore Besterman (Oxford: The Voltaire Foundation, 1976), 153. Foreign affairs The majority of Catherine and Voltaire's correspondence took place during the years 1769‚Äì1778, a period in which Catherine found herself largely involved with foreign affairs. Thus, much of their correspondence focuses on Russia's wars in Poland and Turkey and on the themes of religion and civilization.Carolyn H. Wilberger, \\"Voltaire and Catherine the Great.\\" in Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century, ed. Theodore Besterman (Oxford: The Voltaire Foundation, 1976), 160. When Catherine first invaded Poland, Voltaire believed, contrary to popular opinion, that she had done so based on religious tolerance. He believed that she wanted to restore the rights of the non-Catholic Polish minorities rather than to acquire Polish land. Voltaire was proven wrong in 1772, after Catherine's first partition of the country. However, he never condemned Catherine for deceiving him, but rather congratulated both her and the Poles on the outcome. Their discussions of Poland thus reveal what Peter Gay has called a \\"lack of accurate information, compounded by a deliberate refusal to learn the truth.\\"Carolyn H. Wilberger, \\"Voltaire and Catherine the Great.\\" in Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century, ed. Theodore Besterman (Oxford: The Voltaire Foundation, 1976), 163. The affair greatly damaged Voltaire's reputation in Europe. Another major topic of conversation was Russia's relations with Turkey. As a philosopher, Voltaire disagreed with war in general. However, in his letters he encourages Catherine to go to war with Turkey. Voltaire saw the Turks as fundamentally uncivilized, and thus Russia's expansion course as a crusade, not for religion, but in the name of enlightenment. He even suggested to Catherine that Russia, Prussia, and Austria unite to divide Turkey. Catherine, however, wanted to conquer Turkey for political and economic reasons. Namely, she wanted to expand Russia's borders to the Black Sea to obtain a base from which she could target Constantinople.  Education  A more conservative approach was taken by Mikhail Shcherbatov, a publicist and historian whose notion of liberty was influenced by the works of Rousseau. Shcherbatov delivered a scathing criticism of the existing social institutions, maintaining that mass education‚Äîrather than far-reaching political reforms and the abolition of serfdom‚Äîmay be more effective in improving the morals of Russian society. On a related note, Ivan Betskoy campaigned for the comprehensive reform of education which would result in the development of a \\"new breed of citizens\\". His proposals have been implemented in part, e.g., the Smolny Institute was inaugurated for noble maidens, in keeping with Fenelon's doctrine that girls' education was key to the moral regeneration of the corrupt modern society. Catherine II could be considered the founder of the Russian state university on land use planning, it was announced on May 25, 1779 (on May 14, Julian calendar) that the Surveying School should be opened. The school was named Konstantinovsky in honour of the Great Prince Konstantin Pavlovich, the grandson of Catherine II of Russia who was born in that year. The government and Catherine II of Russia herself patronized and supported the school from the date of its establishing emphasizing a significance of land management and special surveying education. Lack of land surveyors and state importance of land surveying initiated establishing of the school. The legislation of the day emphasized significance of land management: \\"Current surveying is a business, which is performed not only to the benefit and peace of every holder but the state business containing the Emperor glory and advantage of peace and quiet for all the State.\\" Catherine's friend Yekaterina Dashkova‚Äîsometimes viewed as a precursor of feminism‚Äîled the Russian Academy of Sciences for many years. In 1783, she instituted the Russian Academy, which she modeled after the French Academy. Seeking to promote knowledge and study of the Russian language, the Russian Academy prepared the first comprehensive dictionary of the Russian language. Even the monolith of the Russian Orthodox Church seemed to succumb to the influences of the Enlightenment. The teachings of Platon Levshin, Metropolitan of Moscow, underlined the need for tolerance and encouraged the advancement of ecclesiastical education. Arts Parasha Zhemchugova, a serf actress-turned-countess. Enlightenment ideas were popularized by the nascent Russian theatre. The first Russian theater group of this kind was established in Yaroslavl by Fyodor Volkov and Ivan Dmitrievsky during Elizaveta's reign. Aleksandr Sumarokov was responsible for the repertory of their theatre. During Catherine's reign the leading playwrights included Denis Fonvizin, who ridiculed the rusticity of provincial gentry and their thoughtless imitation of all things French; Vladislav Ozerov, who authored a great number of Neoclassical tragedies with touches of sentimentalism; and Yakov Knyazhnin, whose drama about a popular uprising against Rurik's rule was declared Jacobin and publicly burnt in 1791. Even Catherine's favourite poet, Gavrila Derzhavin‚Äîwho sought in his odes to combine amusement with instruction‚Äîwould see some of his poems banned from print during the last years of her reign. Opera Opera reached Russia in 1731, when Empress Anna invited the Italian opera troupe to show Calandro by Giovanni Alberto Ristori during the celebration of her coronation in Moscow. In 1735 another Italian opera troupe led by composer Francesco Araja was invited to work in St. Petersburg. Araja spent 25 years in Russia and wrote 14 operas for the Russian Court including Tsefal i Prokris (1755), the first opera written in Russian to the libretto by Alexander Sumarokov. Foreign composers like Johann Adolf Hasse, Hermann Raupach, Galuppi, Manfredini, Traetta, Paisiello, Sarti, Cimarosa and Martin y Soler, Ivan Kerzelli, Antoine Bullant, brought important contribution to the Russian opera, to the Italian libretti as well as Russian libretti. There were also extremely popular operas by the Belgian/French Andr√© Ernest Modeste Gr√©try that were widely performed, including in Kuskovo and Ostankino theatres, where they were given with participation of the famous serf-soprano Praskovya Zhemchugova at the private opera of Nikolai Sheremetev. Catherine II sent some domestic composers like Berezovsky and Bortniansky abroad to study art of music composition and later they produced some operas in Italian and French. And only at the beginning of the 1770s the first modest attempts of the composers of Russian origin to compose operas to the Russian librettos were made. Among these were successful one-act opera Anyuta (1772) to the text by Mikhail Popov, and opera Melnik ‚Äì koldun, obmanshchik i svat (The Miller who was a Wizard, a Cheat and a Match- maker) to the text by Alexander Ablesimov with music by Mikhail Sokolovsky (1779). The most important contribution in the opera genre were made by Vasily Pashkevich with his The Carriage Accident (Neschastye ot karety, 1779), The Miser to the text by Yakov Knyazhnin after Moli√®re (1782), and Fevey to the libretto by Catherine II (1786), as well as by Italian trained Yevstigney Fomin with his The Coachmen at the Relay Station (Yamshchiki na podstave, 1787), Orfey i Evridika, opera-melodrama to the text by Yakov Knyazhnin (1792), and The Americans (Amerikantsy, comic opera, 1800). Other music In 1746 the first public concert took place in Russia. This soon became a tradition. Concert life was dominated by foreign musicians before Russian virtuosos appeared in the 1780‚Äì1790s; these included the violinist Ivan Khandoshkin and singer Elizaveta Sandunova. The senator Grigory Teplov was also an amateur musician who printed in 1751 the collection of his songs entitled Idle Hours Away from Work. Publishing music business, sales of foreign sheet music, and music lovers' periodicals flourished from the 1770s onward. The overture and songs from Ivan Kerzelli's opera Derevenskiy vorozheya (The Village Wizard) were printed in Moscow 1778; they were the first opera fragments printed in Russia. Sales of musical instruments (like keyboards, guitars and harps) were also growing. Sacred music genres were transformed under the foreign influences. The Italian operatic composers such as Galuppi and Sarti were involved in producing liturgies for the church service. The genre of the choral concerto (the cycle of three‚Äìfour contrast movements) became traditional in liturgic music of Degtyaryov, Vedel, Bortnyansky, Berezovsky, Davydov, and Turchaninov.  Freemasonry  Some of the leading figures of the Russian Enlightenment are associated with Freemasonry and Martinism. In the early 1770s, Catherine the Great's secretary Ivan Yelagin succeeded in reorganizing Russian Freemasonry into a far-reaching system that united some 14 lodges and about 400 government officials. He secured English authorization of the first Russian Grand Lodge and became its Provincial Grand Master. Most Russian lodges were attracted to the Swedish Rite. In 1782, Ivan Schwarz, a philosophy professor from Moscow, represented Russia at the Wilhelmsbad conference where Russia was recognized as the 8th province of the Rite of Strict Observance. His friend Nikolay Novikov was in charge of the Moscow lodges. Spooked by the French Revolution, Catherine clamped down on Novikov and other Freemasons in the late 1780s. Her son Paul interdicted all Masonic assemblies in 1799. Novikov and his circle promoted \\"prosveshchenie\\" which combined religious piety, erudition, and commitment to the spread of learning. However it bore little similarity to the skeptical and critical spirit of the European Enlightenment.Colum Leckey, \\"What is Prosveshchenie? Nikolai Novikov's Historical Dictionary of Russian Writers Revisited.\\" Russian History 37.4 (2010): 360-377.  Aftermath  By 1796, when Emperor Paul succeeded his mother on the Russian throne, the Russian Enlightenment was very much on the wane. Although the new monarch was fiercely opposed to the French libertarian influences, he set free the radical writers imprisoned by his mother, including Novikov and Radishchev. Paul's family enjoyed recitals of didactic fables by Ivan Krylov, a fabulist whose journalistic activity had been denounced by his mother. The Informal Committee, instituted by Alexander I of Russia in 1801, may be viewed as the last attempt to implement the ideals of the Enlightenment in the Russian Empire. Mikhail Speransky proceeded to outline an ambitious program of political reform, but his chief propositions were not put into execution until the great reforms of Alexander II half a century later.

Inclining test procedures are specified by the International Maritime Organization and other international associations. The weight of a vessel can be readily determined by reading draughts and comparing with the known hydrostatic properties. The metacentric height (GM), which dominates stability, can be estimated from the design, but an accurate value must be determined by an inclining test. The inclining test is usually done inshore in calm weather, in still water, and free of mooring restraints to achieve accuracy. The GM position is determined by moving weights transversely to produce a known overturning moment in the range of 1-4 degrees if possible. Knowing the restoring properties (buoyancy) of the vessel from its dimensions and floating position and measuring the equilibrium angle of the weighted vessel, the GM can be calculated. As in a new ship test, the weight shifts have to be known and the angles of tilt measured. A series of weight (ballast) movements are used to obtain an average and variance for GM.

Marble, c. 480 BC. Acropolis Museum, Athens. The marble Kritios Boy or Kritian Boy belongs to the Early Classical period of ancient Greek sculpture.

The Kritios Boy is thus named because it is attributed, on slender evidence, to Kritios who worked together with Nesiotes (sculptors of Harmodius and Aristogeiton) or their school, from around 480 BC.

It is on display in the Acropolis Museum, Athens,Inv. no. 698. near the site where it was excavated. The torso was found in 1865 while excavating the foundation of the old museum at the Athenian Acropolis. The head of this statue was found twenty-three years later between the museum and the Acropolis south wall, in the latest stage of the rubble of destruction undergone in the Persian Wars. This fact, in conjunction with the analysis of its style, is essential to the dating of the statue.Jeffrey M. Hurwitt, \\"The Kritios Boy: Discovery, Reconstruction, and Date\\", in: American Journal of Archaeology 93 (1989), pp. 41-80.

Significance Whether or not Kritios was the innovator,Literary sources credit Pythagoras of Rhegium as the sculptor who \\"first gave rhythm and proportion to his statues,\\" as Kenneth Clark noted. with the Kritios Boy (ephebos) the Greek artist has mastered a complete understanding of how the different parts of the body act as a system. The statue moves away from the rigid and stiff pose of the Archaic style. Kritios Boy presents a more relaxed and naturalistic pose known as contrapposto. This stance forces a chain of anatomical events: as the pelvis is pushed diagonally upwards on the left side, the right buttock relaxes, the spine acquires an \\"S\\" curve, and the shoulder line dips on the left to counteract the action of the pelvis. Among classic Greek sculptures, the Kritios Boy expresses the \\"Canon of Polyclitus\\" and his pupils.Richter, Gisela M.A. (1966) Handbuch der griechischen Kunst. Berlin: K√∂ln-Berlin, p. 95.Boardman, John. Ed. (1993) The Oxford History of Classical Art. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 87-89. It set the rule for later sculptors like Praxiteles and Lysippos, whose contrapposto, or ponderation, is more emphasised than the \\"subtle equilibrium of outline and axis which is to be the basis of classical art\\" exhibited by the Kritios Boy's \\"delicate balance of movement\\" The Kritios Boy exhibits a number of other critical innovations that distinguish it from the Archaic Kouroi from the seventh and sixth century BC that paved its way. The Archaic style relied more on geometrical shapes to define the contours of the human body. The muscular and skeletal structure of Kritios Boy are depicted with unforced lifelike accuracy of flesh and bone, with the rib cage naturally expanded as if in the act of breathing, with a relaxed attitude and hips which are distinctly narrower. Sculptors had begun to break away from the rules of the Archaic style and follow representation that was closer to nature. As a final forebear of the classical period, the \\"smile\\" of Archaic statues has been completely replaced by the accurate rendering of the lips and the austere expression that characterized the transitional Severe style. It was created in same era as the Blond Kouros's Head of the Acropolis and the group of the \\"Tyrannicides\\" Harmodius and Aristogeiton. A good example for comparison is the marble statue of an ephebos in the museum in Agrigento.

Human moral actions form the basis of the transmigration of the soul ('). The soul is constrained to a cycle of rebirth, trapped within the temporal world ('), until it finally achieves liberation ('). Liberation is achieved by following a path of purification. Jains believe that karma is a physical substance that is everywhere in the universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul by the actions of that soul. Karma particles are attracted when we do, think, or say things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul‚Äîobscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (le≈õyƒÅ). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence‚Äîlike heavens or hells, or as humans or animals. Jains cite inequalities, sufferings, and pain as evidence for the existence of karma. Various types of karma are classified according to their effects on the potency of the soul. The Jain theory seeks to explain the karmic process by specifying the various causes of karmic influx (ƒÅsrava) and bondage (bandha), placing equal emphasis on deeds themselves, and the intentions behind those deeds. The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions, and eliminates any reliance on some supposed existence of divine grace or retribution. The Jain doctrine also holds that it is possible for us to both modify our karma, and to obtain release from it, through the austerities and purity of conduct.  Philosophical overview  According to Jains, all souls are intrinsically pure in their inherent and ideal state, possessing the qualities of infinite knowledge, infinite perception, infinite bliss and infinite energy. However, in contemporary experience, these qualities are found to be defiled and obstructed, on account of the association of these souls with karma. The soul has been associated with karma in this way throughout an eternity of beginning-less time. This bondage of the soul is explained in the Jain texts by analogy with gold ore, which‚Äîin its natural state‚Äîis always found unrefined of admixture with impurities. Similarly, the ideally pure state of the soul has always been overlaid with the impurities of karma. This analogy with gold ore is also taken one step further: the purification of the soul can be achieved if the proper methods of refining are applied. Over the centuries, Jain monks have developed a large and sophisticated corpus of literature describing the nature of the soul, various aspects of the working of karma, and the ways and means of attaining '. Tirthankara-nama-karma is a special type of karma, bondage of which raises a soul to the supreme status of a tirthankara.  Material theory  Jainism speaks of karmic \\"dirt\\", as karma is thought to be manifest as very subtle and sensually imperceptible particles pervading the entire universe. They are so small that one space-point‚Äîthe smallest possible extent of space‚Äîcontains an infinite number of karmic particles (or quantity of karmic dirt). It is these karmic particles that adhere to the soul and affect its natural potency. This material karma is called dravya karma; and the resultant emotions‚Äîpleasure, pain, love, hatred, and so on‚Äîexperienced by the soul are called bhava karma, psychic karma. The relationship between the material and psychic karma is that of cause and effect. The material karma gives rise to the feelings and emotions in worldly souls,Jain philosophy categorises the souls jivas into two categories: worldly souls, who are unliberated; and liberated souls, who are free from all karma. which‚Äîin turn‚Äîgive rise to psychic karma, causing emotional modifications within the soul. These emotions, yet again, result in influx and bondage of fresh material karma. Jains hold that the karmic matter is actually an agent that enables the consciousness to act within the material context of this universe. They are the material carrier of a soul's desire to physically experience this world. When attracted to the consciousness, they are stored in an interactive karmic field called ', which emanates from the soul. Thus, karma is a subtle matter surrounding the consciousness of a soul. When these two components‚Äîconsciousness and ripened karma‚Äîinteract, the soul experiences life as known in the present material universe.  Self regulating mechanism  According to Indologist Robert J. Zydenbos, karma is a system of natural laws, where actions that carry moral significance are considered to cause certain consequences in the same way as physical actions. When one holds an apple and then lets it go, the apple will fall. There is no judge, and no moral judgment involved, since this is a mechanical consequence of the physical action. In the same manner, consequences occur naturally when one utters a lie, steals something, commits senseless violence or leads a life of debauchery. Rather than assume that these consequences‚Äîthe moral rewards and retributions‚Äîare a work of some divine judge, Jains believe that there is an innate moral order in the cosmos, self-regulating through the workings of the law of karma. Morality and ethics are important in Jainism not because of a God, but because a life led in agreement with moral and ethical principles (mahavrata) is considered beneficial: it leads to a decrease‚Äîand finally to the total loss of‚Äîkarma, which in turn leads to everlasting happiness. The Jain conception of karma takes away the responsibility for salvation from God and bestows it on man himself. In the words of the Jain scholar, J. L. Jaini:  Predominance of karma  According to Jainism, karmic consequences are unerringly certain and inescapable. No divine grace can save a person from experiencing them. Only the practice of austerities and self-control can modify or alleviate the consequences of karma. Even then, in some cases, there is no option but to accept karma with equanimity. The second-century Jain text, Bhagavatƒ´ ƒÄrƒÅdhanƒÅ (verse no. 1616) sums up the predominance of karma in Jain doctrine: This predominance of karma is a theme often explored by Jain ascetics in the literature they have produced, throughout all centuries. Paul Dundas notes that the ascetics often used cautionary tales to underline the full karmic implications of morally incorrect modes of life, or excessively intense emotional relationships. However, he notes that such narratives were often softened by concluding statements about the transforming effects of the protagonists' pious actions, and their eventual attainment of liberation. The biographies of legendary persons like Rama and Krishna, in the Jain versions of the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, \\"The first Jain version of the ' was written in about the fourth century CE in by .\\" see Dundas, Paul (2002): pp. 238‚Äì39. \\"The Jains seem at times to have employed the epic to engage in confrontation with the Hindus. In the sixteenth century, Jain writers in western India produced versions of the ' libelling who, according to another influential Hindu text, the ', had created a fordmaker-like figure who converted the demons to Jain mendicancy, thus enabling the gods to defeat them. Another target of these Jain ' was who ceases to be the pious Jain of early tradition and instead is portrayed as a devious and immoral schemer.\\" see Dundas, Paul (2002): p. 237. also have karma as one of the major themes. The major events, characters and circumstances are explained by reference to their past lives, with examples of specific actions of particular intensity in one life determining events in the next. Jain texts narrate how even MƒÅhavƒ´ra, one of the most popular propagators of Jainism and the 24th ' (ford-maker),The word ' is translated as ford-maker, but is also loosely translated as a prophet or a teacher. Fording means crossing or wading in the river. Hence, they are called ford-makers because they serve as ferrymen across the river of transmigration. see Grimes, John (1996) p. 320 had to bear the brunt of his previous karma before attaining kevala j√±ƒÅna (enlightenment). He attained it only after bearing twelve years of severe austerity with detachment. The ' speaks of how MƒÅhavƒ´ra bore his karma with complete equanimity, as follows:  Reincarnation and transmigration  Karma forms a central and fundamental part of Jain faith, being intricately connected to other of its philosophical concepts like transmigration, reincarnation, liberation, non-violence (ahi·πÉsƒÅ) and non-attachment, among others. Actions are seen to have consequences: some immediate, some delayed, even into future incarnations. So the doctrine of karma is not considered simply in relation to one life-time, but also in relation to both future incarnations and past lives. UttarƒÅdhyayana-s≈´tra 3.3‚Äì4 states: The text further states (32.7): There is no retribution, judgment or reward involved but a natural consequences of the choices in life made either knowingly or unknowingly. Hence, whatever suffering or pleasure that a soul may be experiencing in its present life is on account of choices that it has made in the past. As a result of this doctrine, Jainism attributes supreme importance to pure thinking and moral behavior. Four Gatis (states of existence) The soul travels to any one of the four states of existence after the death depending on its karmas The Jain texts postulate four gatis, that is states-of-existence or birth-categories, within which the soul transmigrates. The four gatis are: deva (demi-gods), manu·π£ya (humans), nƒÅraki (hell beings) and tirya√±ca (animals, plants and micro-organisms). The four gatis have four corresponding realms or habitation levels in the vertically tiered Jain universe: demi-gods occupy the higher levels where the heavens are situated; humans, plants and animals occupy the middle levels; and hellish beings occupy the lower levels where seven hells are situated. Single-sensed souls, however, called nigoda,The Jain hierarchy of life classifies living beings on the basis of the senses: five-sensed beings like humans and animals are at the top, and single sensed beings like microbes and plants are at the bottom. and element-bodied souls pervade all tiers of this universe. Nigodas are souls at the bottom end of the existential hierarchy. They are so tiny and undifferentiated, that they lack even individual bodies, living in colonies. According to Jain texts, this infinity of nigodas can also be found in plant tissues, root vegetables and animal bodies. Depending on its karma, a soul transmigrates and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies. The four main destinies are further divided into sub-categories and still smaller sub‚Äìsub categories. In all, Jain texts speak of a cycle of 8.4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves again and again as they cycle within samsara. In Jainism, God has no role to play in an individual's destiny; one's personal destiny is not seen as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, but rather as a result of its own personal karma. A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon, Bhagvati s≈´tra 8.9.9, links specific states of existence to specific karmas. Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to rebirth in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood leads to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion and humble character result in human birth; while austerities and the making and keeping of vows leads to rebirth in heaven. There are five types of bodies in the Jain thought: earthly (e.g. most humans, animals and plants), metamorphic (e.g. gods, hell beings, fine matter, some animals and a few humans who can morph because of their perfections), transference type (e.g. good and pure substances realized by ascetics), fiery (e.g. heat that transforms or digests food), and karmic (the substrate where the karmic particles reside and which make the soul ever changing). Jain philosophy further divides the earthly body by symmetry, number of sensory organs, vitalities (ayus), functional capabilities and whether one body hosts one soul or one body hosts many. Every living being has one to five senses, three balas (power of body, language and mind), respiration (inhalation and exhalation), and life-duration. All living beings, in every realm including the gods and hell beings, accrue and destroy eight types of karma according to the elaborate theories in Jain texts. Elaborate descriptions of the shape and function of the physical and metaphysical universe, and its constituents are also provided in the Jain texts.Shah, R.S. \\"Jaina Mathematics: Lore of Large Numbers\\". Bulletin of the Marathwada Mathematical Society 10.1 (2009): 43‚Äì61. All of these elaborate theories attempt to illustrate and consistently explain the Jain karma theory in a deeply moral framework, much like Buddhism and Hinduism but with significant differences in the details and assumptions. Lesya ‚Äì colouring of the soul The common representation of the mango tree and men analogy of the lesyas. According to the Jain theory of karma, the karmic matter imparts a colour (le≈õyƒÅ) to the soul, depending on the mental activities behind an action. The coloring of the soul is explained through the analogy of crystal, that acquires the color of the matter associated with it. In the same way, the soul also reflects the qualities of taste, smell and touch of associated karmic matter, although it is usually the colour that is referred to when discussing the le≈õyƒÅs. UttarƒÅdhyayana-s≈´tra 34.3 speaks of six main categories of le≈õyƒÅ represented by six colours: black, blue, grey, yellow, red and white. The black, blue and grey are inauspicious le≈õyƒÅ, leading to the soul being born into misfortunes. The yellow, red and white are auspicious le≈õyƒÅs, that lead to the soul being born into good fortune. UttarƒÅdhyayana-s≈´tra describes the mental disposition of persons having black and white le≈õyƒÅs: The Jain texts further illustrate the effects of le≈õyƒÅs on the mental dispositions of a soul, using an example of the reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruit and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and sparing the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six le≈õyƒÅs. At one extreme, the person with the black le≈õyƒÅ, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, the person with the white le≈õyƒÅ, having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.  Role of deeds and intent  The role of intent is one of the most important and definitive elements of the karma theory, in all its traditions. In Jainism, intent is important but not an essential precondition of sin or wrong conduct. Evil intent forms only one of the modes of committing sin. Any action committed, knowingly or unknowingly, has karmic repercussions. In certain philosophies, like Buddhism, a person is guilty of violence only if he had an intention to commit violence. On the other hand, according to Jains, if an act produces violence, then the person is guilty of it, whether or not he had an intention to commit it. John Koller explains the role of intent in Jainism with the example of a monk, who unknowingly offered poisoned food to his brethren. According to the Jain view, the monk is guilty of a violent act if the other monks die because they eat the poisoned food; but according to the Buddhist view he would not be guilty. The crucial difference between the two views is that the Buddhist view excuses the act, categorizing it as non-intentional, since he was not aware that the food was poisoned; whereas the Jain view holds the monk to have been responsible, due to his ignorance and carelessness. Jains argue that the monk's very ignorance and carelessness constitute an intent to do violence and hence entail his guilt. So the absence of intent does not absolve a person from the karmic consequences of guilt either, according to the Jain analysis. Intent is a function of ka·π£ƒÅya, which refers to negative emotions and negative qualities of mental (or deliberative) action. The presence of intent acts as an aggravating factor, increasing the vibrations of the soul, which results in the soul absorbing more karma. This is explained by TattvƒÅrthas≈´tra 6.7: \\"[The] intentional act produces a strong karmic bondage and [the] unintentional produces weak, shortlived karmic bondage.\\" Similarly, the physical act is also not a necessary condition for karma to bind to the soul: the existence of intent alone is sufficient. This is explained by Kundakunda (1st Century CE) in SamayasƒÅra 262‚Äì263: \\"The intent to kill, to steal, to be unchaste and to acquire property, whether these offences are actually carried or not, leads to bondage of evil karmas.\\" Jainism thus places an equal emphasis on the physical act as well as intent for binding of karmas.  Origins and Influence  Although the doctrine of karma is central to all Indian religions, it is difficult to say when and where in India the concept of karma originated. In Jainism, it is assumed its development took place in an era from which the literary documents are not available, since the basics of this doctrine were present and concluded even in the earliest documents of Jains. Acaranga Sutra and Sutrakritanga, contain a general outline of the doctrines of karma and reincarnation. The roots of this doctrine in Jainism might be in the teachings of Parsva, who is said to have lived about two hundred fifty years before Mahavira. The Jain conception of karma‚Äîas something material that encumbers the soul‚Äîhas an archaic nature which justifies the hypothesis that it goes back to 8th or 9th century BCE. The present form of the doctrine seems to be unchanged at least since the time of Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE) who is respected by both the sects. This is supported by the fact that both Svetambara and Digambara sects agree on the basic doctrine, giving indication that it reached in its present form before the schism took place. Bhadrabahu is usually seen as the last leader of united Jain sangh. Detailed codification of types of karma and their effects were attested by Umasvati who is regarded by both Digambara and Svetambara as one of theirs. Jain and Buddhist scholar Padmanabh Jaini observes: With regards to the influence of the theory of karma on development of various religious and social practices in ancient India, Dr. Padmanabh Jaini states:Padmanabh Jaini, Collected papers on Jaina Studies, Chapter 7, Pg 137 The Jain socio-religious practices like regular fasting, practicing severe austerities and penances, the ritual death of Sallekhana and rejection of God as the creator and operator of the universe can all be linked to the Jain theory of karma. Jaini notes that the disagreement over the karmic theory of transmigration resulted in the social distinction between the Jains and their Hindu neighbours. Thus one of the most important Hindu rituals, ≈õrƒÅddha was not only rejected but strongly criticized by the Jains as superstition. Certain authors have also noted the strong influence of the concept of karma on the Jain ethics, especially the ethics of non-violence. Once the doctrine of transmigration of souls came to include rebirth on earth in animal as well as human form, depending upon one's karmas, it is quite probable that, it created a humanitarian sentiment of kinship amongst all life forms and thus contributed to the notion of ' (non-violence).  Factors affecting the effects of Karma  The nature of experience of the effects of the karma depends on the following four factors: *Prakriti (nature or type of karma) ‚Äì According to Jain texts, there are eight main types of karma which categorized into the 'harming' and the 'non-harming'; each divided into four types. The harming karmas (ghƒÅtiyƒÅ karmas) directly affect the soul powers by impeding its perception, knowledge and energy, and also brings about delusion. These harming karmas are: dar≈õanƒÅvara·πáa (perception-obscuring karma), j√±ƒÅnavƒÅra·πáa (knowledge-obscuring karma), antarƒÅya (obstacle-creating karma) and mohanƒ´ya (deluding karma). The non-harming category (aghƒÅtiyƒÅ karmas) is responsible for the reborn soul's physical and mental circumstances, longevity, spiritual potential and experience of pleasant and unpleasant sensations. These non-harming karmas are: nƒÅma (body-determining karma), ƒÅyu (lifespan-determining karma), gotra (status-determining karma) and vedanƒ´ya (feeling-producing karma), respectively. Different types of karmas thus affect the soul in different ways as per their nature. *Sthiti (the duration of the karmic bond) ‚Äì The karmic bond remains latent and bound to the consciousness up to the time it is activated. Although latent karma does not affect the soul directly, its existence limits the spiritual growth of the soul. Jain texts provide the minimum and the maximum duration for which such karma is bound before it matures. *Anubhava (intensity of karmas) ‚Äì The degree of the experience of the karmas, that is, mild or intense, depends on the anubhava quality or the intensity of the bondage. It determines the power of karmas and its effect on the soul. Anubhava depends on the intensity of the passions at the time of binding the karmas. More intense the emotions‚Äîlike anger, greed etc.‚Äîat the time of binding the karma, the more intense will be its experience at the time of maturity. *Pradesha (The quantity of the karmas) ‚Äì It is the quantity of karmic matter that is received and gets activated at the time of experience. Both emotions and activity play a part in binding of karmas. Duration and intensity of the karmic bond are determined by emotions or \\"\\" and type and quantity of the karmas bound is depended on yoga or activity. The process of bondage and release The karmic process in Jainism is based on seven truths or fundamental principles (tattva) of Jainism which explain the human predicament. Out that the seven tattvas, the four‚Äîinflux (ƒÅsrava), bondage (bandha), stoppage (sa·πÉvara) and release (nirjarƒÅ)‚Äîpertain to the karmic process. Attraction and binding Representation of a soul undergoing reincarnation. The karmic bondage occurs as a result of the following two processes: ƒÅsrava and bandha. ƒÄsrava is the inflow of karma. The karmic influx occurs when the particles are attracted to the soul on account of yoga. Yoga is the vibrations of the soul due to activities of mind, speech and body. However, the yoga alone do not produce bondage. The karmas have effect only when they are bound to the consciousness. This binding of the karma to the consciousness is called bandha. Out of the many causes of bondage, emotions or passions are considered as the main cause of bondage. The karmas are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions. The passions like anger, pride, deceit and greed are called sticky (ka·π£ƒÅyas) because they act like glue in making karmic particles stick to the soul resulting in bandha. The karmic inflow on account of yoga driven by passions and emotions cause a long-term inflow of karma prolonging the cycle of reincarnations. On the other hand, the karmic inflows on account of actions that are not driven by passions and emotions have only a transient, short-lived karmic effect. Hence the ancient Jain texts talk of subduing these negative emotions:  Causes of attraction and bondage  The Jain theory of karma proposes that karma particles are attracted and then bound to the consciousness of souls by a combination of four factors pertaining to actions: instrumentality, process, modality and motivation. *The instrumentality of an action refers to whether the instrument of the action was: the body, as in physical actions; one's speech, as in speech acts; or the mind, as in thoughtful deliberation. *The process of an action refers to the temporal sequence in which it occurs: the decision to act, plans to facilitate the act, making preparations necessary for the act, and ultimately the carrying through of the act itself. *The modality of an action refers to different modes in which one can participate in an action, for example: being the one who carries out the act itself; being one who instigates another to perform the act; or being one who gives permission, approval or endorsement of an act. *The motivation for an action refers to the internal passions or negative emotions that prompt the act, including: anger, greed, pride, deceit and so on. All actions have the above four factor present in them. When different permutations of the sub-elements of the four factors are calculated, the Jain teachers speak of 108 ways in which the karmic matter can be attracted to the soul. Even giving silent assent or endorsement to acts of violence from far away has karmic consequences for the soul.Prasada, Ajit (1974) p.33 Hence, the scriptures advise carefulness in actions, awareness of the world, and purity in thoughts as means to avoid the burden of karma. According to the major Jain text, Tattvartha sutra: The causes of bandha or the karmic bondage‚Äîin the order they are required to be eliminated by a soul for spiritual progress‚Äîare: * MithyƒÅtva (Irrationality and a deluded world view) ‚Äì The deluded world view is the misunderstanding as to how this world really functions on account of one-sided perspectives, perverse viewpoints, pointless generalisations and ignorance. * Avirati (non-restraint or a vowless life) ‚Äì Avirati is the inability to refrain voluntarily from the evil actions, that harms oneself and others. The state of avirati can only be overcome by observing the minor vows of a layman. * PramƒÅda (carelessness and laxity of conduct) ‚Äì This third cause of bondage consists of absentmindedness, lack of enthusiasm towards acquiring merit and spiritual growth, and improper actions of mind, body and speech without any regard to oneself or others. * ' (passions or negative emotions) ‚Äì The four passions‚Äîanger, pride, deceit and greed‚Äîare the primary reason for the attachment of the karmas to the soul. They keep the soul immersed in the darkness of delusion leading to deluded conduct and unending cycles of reincarnations. * Yoga (activities of mind, speech and body) Each cause presupposes the existence of the next cause, but the next cause does not necessarily pre-suppose the existence of the previous cause. A soul is able to advance on the spiritual ladder called ', only when it is able to eliminate the above causes of bondage one by one. Fruition action and reaction: goodness sown is reaped as goodness. The consequences of karma are inevitable, though they may take some time to take effect. To explain this, a Jain monk, Ratnaprabhacharya says: The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions‚Äîlike proper time, place, and environment‚Äîto arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred. Jain texts distinguish between the effect of the fruition of karma on a right believer and a wrong believer: Modifications Although the Jains believe the karmic consequences as inevitable, Jain texts also hold that a soul has energy to transform and modify the effects of karma. Karma undergoes following modifications: *Udaya (maturity) ‚Äì It is the fruition of karmas as per its nature in the due course. *Udƒ´ra·πáa (premature operation) ‚Äì By this process, it is possible to make certain karmas operative before their predetermined time. *UdvartanƒÅ (augmentation) ‚Äì By this process, there is a subsequent increase in duration and intensity of the karmas due to additional negative emotions and feelings. *ApavartanƒÅ (diminution) ‚Äì In this case, there is subsequent decrease in duration and intensity of the karmas due to positive emotions and feelings. *' (transformation) ‚Äì It is the mutation or conversion of one sub-type of karmas into another sub-type. However, this does not occur between different types. For example, papa (bad karma) can be converted into punya (good karma) as both sub-types belong to the same type of karma. *Upa≈õamanƒÅ (state of subsidence) ‚Äì During this state the operation of karma does not occur. The karma becomes operative only when the duration of subsidence ceases. *Nidhatti (prevention) ‚Äì In this state, premature operation and transformation is not possible but augmentation and diminution of karmas is possible. *NikƒÅcanƒÅ (invariance) ‚Äì For some sub-types, no variations or modifications are possible‚Äîthe consequences are the same as were established at the time of bonding. The Jain karmic theory, thus speaks of great powers of soul to manipulate the karmas by its actions. Release Jain philosophy assert that emancipation is not possible as long as the soul is not released from bondage of karma. This is possible by samvara (stoppage of inflow of new karmas) and nirjarƒÅ (shedding of existing karmas through conscious efforts). Samvara is achieved through practice of: *Three guptis or three controls of mind, speech and body, *Five samitis or observing carefulness in movement, speaking, eating, placing objects and disposing refuse. *Ten dharmas or observation of good acts like ‚Äì forgiveness, humility, straightforwardness, contentment, truthfulness, self-control, penance, renunciation, non-attachment and continence. *Anuprekshas or meditation on the truths of this universe. *Pari·π£ahajaya, that is, a man on moral path must develop a perfectly patient and unperturbed attitude in the midst of trying and difficult circumstances. *CƒÅritra, that is, endeavour to remain in steady spiritual practices. NirjarƒÅ is possible through tapas, austerities and penances. Tapas can be either external or internal. Six forms of external tapas are‚Äîfasting, control of appetite, accepting food under certain conditions, renunciation of delicious food, sitting and sleeping in lonely place and renunciation of comforts. Six forms of internal tapas are‚Äîatonement, reverence, rendering of service to worthy ones, spiritual study, avoiding selfish feelings and meditation. Rationale Justice Tukol notes that the supreme importance of the doctrine of karma lies in providing a rational and satisfying explanation to the apparent unexplainable phenomenon of birth and death, of happiness and misery, of inequalities and of existence of different species of living beings. The S≈´trak·πõtƒÅ·πÖga, one of the oldest canons of Jainism, states: Jains thus cite inequalities, sufferings, and pain as evidence for the existence of karma. The theory of karma is able to explain day-to-day observable phenomena such as inequality between the rich and the poor, luck, differences in lifespan, and the ability to enjoy life despite being immoral. According to Jains, such inequalities and oddities that exist even from the time of birth can be attributed to the deeds of the past lives and thus provide evidence to existence of karmas:  Criticisms  The Jain theory of karma has been challenged from an early time by the Vedanta and branches of Hindu philosophy. In particular, Vedanta Hindus considered the Jain position on the supremacy and potency of karma, specifically its insistence on non-intervention by any Supreme Being in regard to the fate of souls, as nƒÅstika or atheistic. For example, in a commentary to the Brahma Sutras (III, 2, 38, and 41), Adi Sankara, argues that the original karmic actions themselves cannot bring about the proper results at some future time; neither can super sensuous, non- intelligent qualities like adrsta‚Äîan unseen force being the metaphysical link between work and its result‚Äîby themselves mediate the appropriate, justly deserved pleasure and pain. The fruits, according to him, then, must be administered through the action of a conscious agent, namely, a supreme being (Ishvara).For the Jain refutation of the theory of God as operator and dispenser of karma, see Jainism and non-creationism. Jainism's strong emphasis on the doctrine of karma and intense asceticism was also criticised by the Buddhists. Thus, the Sa·πÉyutta NikƒÅya narrates the story of Asibandhakaputta, a headman who was originally a disciple of MƒÅhavƒ´ra. He debates with the Buddha, telling him that, according to MƒÅhavƒ´ra (Niga·πá·π≠ha NƒÅtaputta), a man's fate or karma is decided by what he does habitually. The Buddha responds, considering this view to be inadequate, stating that even a habitual sinner spends more time \\"not doing the sin\\" and only some time actually \\"doing the sin.\\" In another Buddhist text Majjhima NikƒÅya, the Buddha criticizes Jain emphasis on the destruction of unobservable and unverifiable types of karma as a means to end suffering, rather than on eliminating evil mental states such as greed, hatred and delusion, which are observable and verifiable. In the UpƒÅlisutta dialogue of this Majjhima NikƒÅya text, Buddha contends with a Jain monk who asserts that bodily actions are the most criminal, in comparison to the actions of speech and mind. Buddha criticises this view, saying that the actions of mind are most criminal, and not the actions of speech or body. Buddha also criticises the Jain ascetic practice of various austerities, claiming that he, Buddha, is happier when not practising the austerities.In the 8th century Jain text A·π£·π≠akaprakara·πáam (11.1‚Äì8), Haribhadra refutes the Buddhist view that austerities and penances results in suffering and pain. According to him suffering is on account of past karmas and not due to penances. Even if penances result in some suffering and efforts, they should be undertaken as it is the only means of getting rid of the karma. He compares it to the efforts and pains undertaken by a businessman to earn profit, which makes him happy. In the same way the austerities and penances are blissful to an ascetic who desires emancipation. See Haribhadras≈´ri, Sinha, Ashok Kumar, & Jain, Sagarmal (2000) p. 47 While admitting the complexity and sophistication of the Jain doctrine, Padmanabh Jaini compares it with that of Hindu doctrine of rebirth and points out that the Jain seers are silent on the exact moment and mode of rebirth, that is, the re-entry of soul in womb after the death. The concept of nitya-nigoda, which states that there are certain categories of souls who have always been nigodas, is also criticized. According to Jainism, nigodas are lowest form of extremely microscopic beings having momentary life spans, living in colonies and pervading the entire universe. According to Jaini, the entire concept of nitya-nigoda undermines the concept of karma, as these beings clearly would not have had prior opportunity to perform any karmically meaningful actions. Karma is also criticised on the grounds that it leads to the dampening of spirits with men suffering the ills of life because the course of one's life is determined by karma. It is often maintained that the impression of karma as the accumulation of a mountain of bad deeds looming over our heads without any recourse leads to fatalism. However, as Paul Dundas puts it, the Jain theory of karma does not imply lack of free will or operation of total deterministic control over destinies. Furthermore, the doctrine of karma does not promote fatalism amongst its believers on account of belief in personal responsibility of actions and that austerities could expatiate the evil karmas and it was possible to attain salvation by emulating the life of the Jinas.

It is externally similar to wmii, but internally much simpler. dwm is written purely in C for performance and security in addition to simplicity, and lacks any configuration interface besides editing the source code. One of the project's guidelines is that the source code is intended to never exceed 2000 SLOC, and options meant to be user-configurable are all contained in a single header file.  Features  dwm supports multiple workspaces and, unlike ratpoison, allows moving and resizing windows with the mouse. Older versions of dwm displayed their stdin in a status bar, along the edge of the screen. Recent versions instead display the root window's name, which can be set by independent processes. This is often used to show information that would appear in the notification area of other desktop environments‚Äîa clock, system load info, laptop battery and network status, music player information and the like. This status line is often complemented with dmenu, a textual application launcher from the same developers as dwm. dwm uses a focus- follows-mouse model and lacks any window decoration other than a border to show focus. Since dwm's configurability amounts to patching the source code, many other options are possible.  dmenu  dmenu is a keyboard-driven menu utility developed as part of the dwm project. When invoked, usually by a user- configured key combination, dmenu displays a horizontal menu of its stdin stream at the top edge of the screen. This is usually used to pipe in a list of executable names from the user's $PATH, but dmenu can be used for any purpose where a menu is required. The user can start typing a program name, and dmenu will narrow the list to show only substring matches for what the user typed. The user can also use the arrow keys to navigate the menu. When a choice is made, dmenu sends the selected text to stdout, which is usually piped into a shell to launch the program. Command-line options can alter the font and colors of the menu, make the search case-insensitive, as well as switch the menu to a vertical orientation or place it at the bottom of the screen. By default, only X Font Server fonts are supported although a patch exists to enable TrueType fonts using Xft. dmenu is similar in function to application launchers such as Katapult or GNOME Do for Linux or LaunchBar or Quicksilver for Mac OS X in that it allows quick launching of programs from a graphical environment using the keyboard. In addition to dwm, dmenu is often used with other window managers like xmonad, or Openbox, and other software like the uzbl web browser.  Forks and patches  dwm has been an influential project; many other window managers are based on dwm's source code or inspired by it. An extensive list of forks and patches can be found at the official site.

Access is via a short hike from the end of a 4WD road. It is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. History Punta Gorda Lighthouse was built in 1911 and was first lit in 1912. After World War II, it was decided that given the remoteness of the station it was too costly to maintain. A lighted buoy was placed offshore, the fourth order Fresnel lens was removed, and the station was boarded up and deactivated in 1951. The keeper's house and all other station buildings were eventually demolished except the reinforced concrete light station building and the metal framework for the lantern room atop it and the reinforced concrete oil house were left standing. Historical Information from USCG web site: Punta Gorda originally consisted of upon which were situated three dwellings, a small two-story concrete lighthouse, concrete oil house, a wooden fog signal building, blacksmith/carpenter-shop, three storage sheds, and a barn. In 1951 all aids-to-navigation were discontinued, the buildings boarded up and personnel transferred. The property was transferred to the Bureau of Land Management. In the late 1960s \\"hippies\\" moved into the quarters and improved them. Local authorities evicted these people and the Bureau of Land Management burned all the buildings except the Lighthouse and oil house. Punta Gorda was and is a very difficult station to reach. Most of the years it was in operation access was via horse, and during good weather horse-drawn wagon. After the United States Coast Guard assumed command a rough road was constructed (that usually washed out) and a jeep was used for transportation. One Coast Guard career horse, named Old Bill, served the Punta Gorda Light Station as a saddle horse, pack horse, and buggy horse for thirty years until the station closed in 1951. The lighthouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The Fresnel lens and the flag staff pole were removed many years ago to the Humboldt Bay Maritime Museum located near Eureka, California.Bureau of Land Management-Punta Gorda Lighthouse webpage. accessed Feb.18, 2009 The Punta Gorda Light was known as the \\"Alcatraz of Lighthouses\\" because of its remote location and difficult access.

The hamon is the outline of the hardened zone (yakiba) which contains the cutting edge (ha). Blades made in this manner are known as differentially hardened, with a harder cutting edge than spine (mune) (for example: spine 40 HRC vs edge 58 HRC). This difference in hardness results from clay being applied on the blade (tsuchioki) prior to the cooling process (quenching). Less or no clay allows the edge to cool faster, making it harder but more brittle, while more clay allows the center (hira) and spine to cool slower, thus retaining its resilience.A History of Metallography By Cyril Stanley Smith -- MIT Press 1968 Page 40--57 The hamon outlines the transition between the region of harder martensitic steel at the blade's edge and the softer pearlitic steel at the center and back of the sword. This difference in hardness is the objective of the process; the appearance is purely a side effect. However, the aesthetic qualities of the hamon are quite valuable‚Äînot only as proof of the differential-hardening treatment but also in its artistic value‚Äîand the patterns can be quite complex. Many modern reproductions do not have natural hamon because they are thoroughly hardened monosteel; the appearance of a hamon is reproduced via various processes such as acid etching, sandblasting, or more crude ones such as wire brushing. Some modern reproductions with natural hamons are also subjected to acid etching to enhance their hamons' prominence. A true hamon can be easily discerned by the presence of a \\"nioi,\\" which is a bright, speckled line a few millimeters wide, following the length of the hamon. The nioi is typically best viewed at long angles, and cannot be faked with etching or other methods. When viewed through a magnifying lens, the nioi appears as a sparkly line, being made up of many bright martensite grains, which are surrounded by darker, softer pearlite. Origins According to legend, Amakuni Yasutsuna developed the process of differentially hardening the blades around the 8th century AD. The emperor was returning from battle with his soldiers when Yasutsuna noticed that half of the swords were broken: Although impossible to ascertain who actually invented the technique, surviving blades by Yasutsuna from around 749‚Äì811 AD suggest that at the very least Yasutsuna helped establish the tradition of differentially hardening the blades.

History USCG photo, August 7, 1924 The Roe Island Light was built on Suisun Bay across from Port Chicago, inland from the Golden Gate and five miles (8 km) east of Benicia. In the 1900s, a second dwelling similar to the lighthouse without the lantern were built adjacent to the lighthouse. During World War II, trains delivered ammunition to ships at the Port Chicago Navy Depot, which was from the Roe Island Lighthouse. On 17 July 1944, the Port Chicago disaster occurred, damaging the lighthouse. Two ships, Quinault Victory and E. A. Bryan, were being loaded with tons of munitions. At approximately 10:20 pm, there was an enormous explosion. More than 300 men, both ships, two Coast Guard vessels and much of the train were destroyed. With changes in the shipping waterways in the area the light, was no longer needed anymore so it was decommissioned in 1945 and sold. An 11 August 1944 Coast Guard report noted that the station: \\"consists of the light, with two keepers, with dwellings, outhouses, power house, water supply tanks, wharf, walkways, boat harbor and boatways. No fog signal is maintained. Electric current for the light and quarters is generated at the station. Water supply is from rain collected from the building roofs, augmented by supply pumped in from the tenders.\\" It was sold to a private family. The family used the station as a summer home until a fire destroyed it.

Although other sports are practised at the club, Almirante Brown is mostly known for its football team, which currently plays in the Primera B Metropolitana, the 3rd division of the Argentine football league system. The football stadium is located in the Isidro Casanova district of the same partido. Other activities hosted by the institution are women's field hockey, martial arts, roller skating and tennis. History The two foundations The club was founded on 1 January 1912 as \\"Club Atl√©tico Almirante Brown\\". The first uniform kit acquired by the club were the striped black and yellow worn by Uruguayan CURCC (predecessor of current club Pe√±arol), that were the only available in stores. On 21 March 1915 the club changed its name to \\"Almirante Brown Athletic Club\\" and one year later it affiliated to Amateur Football Association where the team took part of Tercera de Ascenso, the last division of Argentine football league system. It only lasted one season so the club would be inactive since 1919. In 1921, four dissident members of neighbor club Hurac√°n de San Justo met with some former members of old club Almirante Brown with the purpose of reestablishing the institution. It was finally set up on 17 January 1922 as \\"Centro Atl√©tico Almirante Brown\\", being named Segundo Boragno as president of the club. He managed Almirante Brown until his death on June 1930. First years The squad that won its first official title in 1956. Almirante Brown played football in several regional leagues, winning the first cup in 1926. In 1929 the team won the La Matanza Partido league (named \\"Copa Adri√°n Beccar Varela\\" honoring former president of the Association). In 1931 Almirante Brown acquired the right to participate in the Amateur Argentina de Football to Club Almafuerte (based in Parque Patricios, Buenos Aires), wearing the same name and colors of the \\"porte√±o\\" club. In 1932 and 1933 the club also took part of the championship. In 1934 the club was noticed that another institution of Adrogu√©, also named \\"Almirante Brown\\", had disaffiliated from the Association. In an assembly held short later, the club decided to return to tournaments using its original name and colours but Almirante Brown was not allowed to take part due to there was no place for new teams. Therefore, the club began a long period of inactivity that extended to 1942, when some young people from Club Juventud Unida promoted the re-opening of the club Almirante Brown. This was finally formalised in April 1942 with the merger of both institutions. Expansion Almirante Brown, 1965 Primera C champion. The club affiliated to the Association again, winning two championships and being designed as Buenos Aires Province representative to play the Argentine Amateur championship held in Ca√±ada de G√≥mez. During the decade of 1940 Almirante Brown also acquired a land to build its headquarters in San Justo. In 1956 the club affiliated to Argentine Football Association filling the vacant left by defunct Deportivo San Justo, merged to Almirante Brown. In 1956 Almirante made its debut at \\"Tercera de Ascenso\\", the fourth division of the league system (current Primera D), winning its first official title that same season. The roster was formed by Juan Gallino, √Åndres Bosco, Segundo Boragno, Claudio Iobbi, Pedro √Ångel Costa, Juan Carlos Zoppi, Oscar Villalba, Quirino Toledano, Julio C√©sar Berrutti, Onofre, Ju√°rez, Aramburu, Alejandro Harguinteguy, Ricardo Var√≠o, Juan Carlos Hern√°ndez and A.

In 1986 the Association made a restructuring of the lower divisions, creating the Primera B Nacional that became the second division. Almirante Brown did not qualify to play in the recently created league, remaining in Primera B Metropolitana that became the third division after the restructuring. The team was near to promote to Primera Divisi√≥n in 1991‚Äì92 season when it played the final with San Mart√≠n de Tucum√°n, which finally won the series promoting to the top division of Argentine football. In 1998 Almirante was relegated to Primera B Metropolitana, returning to the second division in July 2007, after defeating Estudiantes de Buenos Aires 1‚Äì0 at Racing Club stadium in Avellaneda. During the match, Almirante Brown supporters throw a bomb to the field, that caused player C√°ceres and Cubito lost consciousness. Immediately after that, a big struggle was started by Almirante Brown supporters, throwing seats and other objects to the other part of the attendance.\\"Graves incidentes en la final de la B Metropolitana\\", Clar√≠n, 2 June 2007 Players Current roster Honours *Primera B (2): 2006‚Äì07, 2009‚Äì10 *Primera C (1): 1965 *Primera D (1): 1956 References External links *Official website *Almirante Pasi√≥n Category:Football clubs in Buenos Aires Province Category:Association football clubs established in 1922 Category:La Matanza Partido Category:1922 establishments in Argentina Category:Sports clubs named after people ","title":"Club Almirante Brown"},{"id":"7108893","title":"Jaros≈Çaw Gowin"},{"id":"7108895","text":"The Sleeping Hermaphroditus is an ancient marble sculpture depicting Hermaphroditus life size. In 1620, Italian artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini sculpted the mattress upon which the statue now lies. The form is partly derived from ancient portrayals of Venus and other female nudes, and partly from contemporaneous feminised Hellenistic portrayals of Dionysus/Bacchus. It represents a subject that was much repeated in Hellenistic times and in ancient Rome, to judge from the number of versions that have survived. Discovered at Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome, the Sleeping Hermaphroditus was immediately claimed by Cardinal Scipione Borghese and became part of the Borghese Collection. The \\"Borghese Hermaphroditus\\" was later sold to the occupying French and was moved to The Louvre, where it is on display. The Sleeping Hermaphroditus has been described as a good early Imperial Roman copy of a bronze original by the later of the two Hellenistic sculptors named Polycles (working ca 155 BC);Robertson, A History of Greek Art, (1975), vol. I:551-52. the original bronze was mentioned in Pliny's Natural History.Pliny, Hist. Nat., XXXIV.19. Original Borghese copy Sleeping Hermaphroditus, The Louvre, Paris The ancient sculpture was discovered in the first decades of the seventeenth century‚Äîunearthed in the grounds of Santa Maria della Vittoria, near the Baths of Diocletian and within the bounds of the ancient Gardens of Sallust. The discovery was made either when the church foundations were being dug (in 1608) or when espaliers were being planted.According to two seventeenth-century accounts noted in Haskell and Penny 1981:234. The sculpture was presented to the connoisseur, Cardinal Scipione Borghese, who in return granted the order the services of his architect Giovanni Battista Soria and paid for the fa√ßade of the church, albeit sixteen years later. In his new Villa Borghese, a room called the Room of the Hermaphrodite was devoted to it. In 1620, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Scipione's prot√©g√©, was paid sixty scudi for making the buttoned mattress upon which the Hermaphroditus reclines, so strikingly realistic that visitors are inclined to give it a testing prod.Borghese accounts.Haskell and Penny, 1981:235. The sculpture was purchased in 1807 with many other pieces from the Borghese Collection, from principe Camillo Borghese, who had married Pauline Bonaparte, and was transferred to The Louvre, where it inspired Algernon Charles Swinburne's poem \\"Hermaphroditus\\" in 1863.Text of \\"Hermaphroditus\\" Image:Hermafrodita 1.JPG|Mus√©e du Louvre copy Image:BorgheseHermaphroditusLouvre-front.jpg|Front Image:Sleeping Hermaphroditus with Bernini Mattress.jpg|Back Image:Sleeping Hermaphroditus Louvre Ma231 face.jpg|Detail Image:Louvre - Sleeping Hermaphroditus 03.jpg|Top Ancient copies A second-century copy of the Sleeping Hermaphroditus was found in 1781, and has taken the original's place at the Galleria Borghese.

Biography   Early life  Kenneth Edward Untener was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1937, and was the seventh of nine children. His family lived on Belle Isle, an island in the Detroit River where his father worked. Untener attended the Sacred Heart Seminary in Detroit, followed by St. John's Seminary near Plymouth, Michigan. He was an active athlete, playing sports such as golf, ice hockey, and handball. It was while playing the last that Untener broke his right leg, only a year before his ordination. Due to complications caused by a genetic deformity, doctors amputated the leg below the knee, and Untener wore a prosthesis for the remainder of his life.  Ordination  Untener was ordained in 1963. After his ordination, he served in Detroit for a time, and then studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, earning a doctorate. He returned to the United States, taught for a period at Sacred Heart Seminary, and eventually became the rector of St. John's Seminary in 1977.  Bishop  In 1980, Untener was named the fourth Bishop of Saginaw. His consecration to the episcopacy immediately became embroiled in controversy, however, as area Catholics filed complaints with the Vatican about a recent workshop on sexuality Untener authorized at St. John's Seminary. Detractors of the workshop claimed it promoted lewdness and promiscuity. In the time leading up to Untener's consecration, he made two trips to the Vatican to defend himself and appeal to Pope John Paul II that he should become bishop. On the second trip, Detroit Cardinal John Dearden came with him and publicly gave his support. Untener was consecrated bishop on November 24, 1980, aged 43. Untener later stated of the ordeal, \\"Having experienced that right away freed me of the burden of trying to be held in favor.\\" Bishop Untener was roundly praised by his peers for his ability to manage his diocese, develop leadership skills in priests and laity, and delegate responsibilities. His approach allowed him the freedom to travel, teach, and give speeches regularly. Untener was frequently asked to speak to priests and ministers due to his reputation for a deep understanding of the scripture. Untener was perhaps best known for improving homilies by methods he promoted regarding preaching. In 2000, he created the first Little Black Book, which followed lectio divina to help people spend some quiet time with the Lord. He soon decided to create similar versions of the book for the seasons of Easter, The Little White Book, and Advent/Christmas, The Little Blue Book. The books are still produced each year based on his different writings. From the same publisher, there are also The Little Burgundy Books, based on the different Gospels of John, Luke, Mark, and Matthew, and \\"My Name is Ken\\", which documents the life and faith of Untener in his own words. Untener's creative talents were also expressed in the written and spoken word, some traveling around the world. He penned a homily for John Cardinal Dearden, Archbishop of Detroit, from which the popular poetic reflection, \\"We are prophets of a future not our own,\\" was taken. The cardinal delivered the homily at a Mass for Deceased Priests on October 25, 1979. It has since become associated with and commemorates the life of Archbishop Oscar Romero, having acquired the title \\"the Romero Prayer\\".Journey with Jesus: Poetry Selections, A Future Not Our Own, accessed 7 December 2018 Pope Francis quoted this reflection verbatim in his remarks to the Roman Curia on December 21, 2015. Sex abuse scandal In the early 1990s Untener appointed John Hammer, a priest who had admitted to molesting an altar boy in Ohio, as a parish priest at Mt. St. Joseph Parish in St. Louis, MI. Hammer had received treatment in Baltimore for several years. Before accepting Hammer, the bishop requested the opinion of two physicians about Hammer's fitness to return to ministry. When he received a positive report, Hammer was accepted but was partnered with a senior priest who was to observe his behavior. In 1999, Hammer also assumed the role of pastor of St. Mary's Catholic Church in Alma Michigan, while continuing as pastor of Mt. St. Joseph. As the national sex abuse crisis grew in 2002, Hammer's earlier victim came forward. Hammer was required to inform the parish of his background, and was removed from the churches and laicized.  Views  Equality Bishop Untener's career was marked by a consistent focus on egalitarianism in the church, ministry to the poor and participative liturgy. His liberal views often put him at odds with orthodox Catholics and with the Vatican. He was regarded as being sensitive to the viewpoints of liberal Catholics. His overall view was that one should keep an open mind, consider the logic of one's actions and how they affect the church, and reflect openly over controversial issues. He frequently derided the Vatican for avoiding debate on real issues that potentially harmed the entire church. Diversity Untener frequently observed that Jesus kept quite diverse company in his lifetime, including many people who were unwelcome in the synagogues of the time. Untener felt that modern Catholics should adopt this view in welcoming people into their own parishes. He was noted for his advocation of helping the poor, and his emphasis that needy people should be treated equally and not judged for their worthiness of help. He spoke out for women's rights in society and in the church, although never outright endorsing the ordination of women as priests. Birth control Some of the more controversial issues that Untener addressed were modern church attitudes toward birth control and abortion. He occasionally lamented that the church was moving toward \\"corporate severity\\" instead of a more accepting state of mind. He was an outspoken critic of the church's ban on artificial birth control. He collaborated on writing about abortion issues, and advocated for developing programs that openly addressed abortion issues faced by families. Some referred to his views as \\"ultra-liberal\\", while others argued that Untener simply liked to question things, even when doing so was difficult or controversial. Liturgy Untener also organized a series of preaching seminars for priests. At the 1993 National Conference of Bishops, Untener reportedly interrupted the proceedings by commenting on how many people felt bored during Mass. Untener told a reporter, \\"They were talking about the niceties of phrases ‚Äì debating whether \`prince' or \`ruler' was a better word to use in the lectionary.\\" Untener stood up and shouted, \\"The biggest problem is not whether we use \`prince' or \`ruler.' The biggest problem is the Mass is boring for most people.\\"Crumm, David. \\"Clergy struggle to cut bordeom from sermons.\\" Detroit Free Press (April 19, 1995) Untener encouraged priests to stick to one point in their homilies and to keep their talks at seven minutes or less. Poverty Untener's easygoing personality and free nature manifested themselves in many ways, often to comic effect. Upon his consecration, he sold the bishop's mansion and began a career-long practice of living for periods of time in the various rectories of his priests. He was known to have hosted a cherry stone spitting contest at the diocese every spring. Another example was a line he delivered during a greeting at the Saginaw Civic Center after his consecration: \\"Hello, I'm Ken, and I'll be your waiter.\\" Untener also was made an honorary member of the Saginaw Gears hockey team in the early 1980s and took to the ice in a Gears jersey but was unable to help the team win; he also played hockey regularly with friends for many years after becoming a bishop. Nearly three years after Untener's death, some of his reflections were collected in a book, The Practical Prophet: Pastoral Writings.  Death  After a period of illness, Bishop Untener died at the age of 66 of a form of leukemia on March 27, 2004.

History When Santa Barbara Lighthouse was established on December 1, 1856, it was typical of the other pioneer West Coast lights, with the tower rising through the center of the dwelling. The builder was George D. Nagle of San Francisco who received $8,000 for his efforts. The tower lantern was fitted with a fourth order lens and originally displayed a fixed red light, which in later years was changed to fixed white. * Historical Information by United States Coast Guard: Women lighthouse keepers were not uncommon in early American lighthouses. Santa Barbara is a premier example. When the lighthouse was officially established in 1856, Albert Johnson Williams was appointed as the initial keeper. After nine years of operating the facility he grew tired of his routine chores and handed over the duties to his wife. She proved so adept at keeping a good house that the government made it official on June 5, 1865, with the appointment receiving a great amount of publicity in the locality. Taking great pride in her work, Mrs. Julia F. Williams kept at her duties for more than 40 years during which time she was only away from the lighthouse on two nights. During her faithful vigil only one shipwreck of consequence was recorded, the cause of which was carelessness on the part of the skipper who allowed his vessel to drift on the rocks. Julia Williams was a descendant of a Maine family and she had come to California with her husband during the gold rush era. She raised three boys and two girls at the lighthouse. In 1905, her vigil finally ended when she fell from a couch and broke her hip. She was 81 years old when she was relieved by another woman, a Mrs. Jones. 2009 aerial photo On June 29, 1925, a severe earthquake jolted the area and the aging lighthouse was unable to stand against it. It was 6:45 a.m. and keeper Weeks was asleep at the time. Suddenly and rudely awakened, he rushed from the dwelling, then hurried back inside to rescue his mother, sister, and brother. When the cloud of dust had settled, little was left of the old structure. A temporary frame tower was erected until a new lighthouse could be built. The current light is on a bluff at , inside a fenced Coast Guard compound with housing and a playground. It is visible from Shoreline Drive and the La Mesa Park pedestrian bridge. Keepers * Albert J.

Like most areas of New England, Middlesex County is (and has been at all times since well before the 20th century) entirely divided into incorporated municipalities. There is no unincorporated territory. There are three types of municipalities in Connecticut: towns, boroughs and cities. As in the other New England states, towns are the basic unit of municipal government. Boroughs overlay towns and assume responsibility for some municipal services within their boundaries. Boroughs are not found in any of the other New England states, and are not very common in Connecticut today, although they were somewhat more numerous in the past. A number of boroughs have disincorporated over the years, choosing to revert to full town control. Cities also overlay towns. This is different from the other New England states, where cities are a different type of municipality equivalent to a town (this difference is related to cities having originally developed in Connecticut from the borough model). Most current cities are coextensive with their parent town, however, such that the entire municipality functions as a city. In practice, these cities are really no different from cities in the other New England states. It is also possible for a city in Connecticut to overlay part, but not all, of a town. There are currently only one or two examples, but it was a more common arrangement in the past. Many of today‚Äôs coextensive cities were non-coextensive at one time. As with boroughs, a number of non-coextensive cities have also disincorporated over the years, choosing to revert to full town control. The main tables below show municipalities at the town level. For any census, adding up the totals for each town should yield the county total. In cases where a community encompassed a coextensive city, the tables in the New England Historical U.S. Census Totals series mark the community as a city. In cases where a town included a non-coextensive city, the total shown below represents the entire town, including but not limited to the city. A separate section follows with population totals for boroughs and non-coextensive cities. For more information on the New England municipal system, see New England town.

The 1970 total for Middlesex County was originally reported as 114,816; and for the town of East Hampton, 4,474. The totals were later revised to those shown in the list above. 2000 Census The Census Bureau made a number of revisions to 2000 census totals subsequent to their initial release. The 2000 total for the city of Middletown was originally reported as 43,167; and for the town of East Hampton, 13,352. The totals were later revised to those shown in the list above. This was apparently done to correct assignment errors between these municipalities; the collective population of the two is the same using either set of figures, so the county total was not affected.

The Hong clan The Hong clan is the second most powerful clan in the fictional country of Saiunkoku.In the original Japanese series, the Hong clan's name is pronounced and written K≈ç, using the Chinese-based on'yomi reading of the kanji. In the North American Region 1 DVDs, Geneon changed the clan's name to \\"Hong,\\" the Mandarin Chinese reading of the same character, to avoid confusion with the other K≈ç clan. Funimation retained this name change when they picked up the series after Geneon's closure, for both re-releases and future releases of volumes in the series. The clan's specialties are growing tangerines and creating special \\"seven- colored\\" ink. Their clan seal bears the emblems of a paulownia, bamboo, phoenix, and kirin. Sh≈´rei Hong is the daughter and only child of Sh≈çka Hong. She is sixteen years old when the story begins. As a descendant of the direct line, she has the title hime, which means 'Princess' or 'Lady'. Despite the high social status of her family, Sh≈´rei grew up in relatively impoverished circumstances. Her father's job brought little income, and much of the wealth of their family home was given to the needy during the devastating war for the imperial succession eight years ago. Without domestic servants, Sh≈´rei became adept at household chores such as needlework, cooking and cleaning, traits unusual in a lady of her theoretical rank. She has also held a number of odd jobs to earn money, such as professional erhu player, accountant at K≈çch≈ç's brothel in the Red Light District, and teacher at the local temple. When she is taken to the imperial palace, she becomes the concubine of the Emperor, who only likes males, as the rumors say. Slowly, a relationship begins to form. Sh≈´rei is the first woman in the history of Saiunkoku to have taken and passed the Imperial Exams with the third highest score, allowing her to obtain the \\"Tanka\\" spot. Along with Eigetsu, she was appointed by the Emperor as the new governor of the Sa Province. Sh≈´rei later accepts a position as an official in the Censorate or Inspector in the capital. Seiran Si is a young man in his early twenties and is the sole remaining retainer in the personal household of Sh≈çka Hong, who took him in thirteen years ago. Since then, Seiran has repaid that kindness by protecting Sh≈çka's family, performing repairs on the house, and taking small outside jobs to earn money. He is a very skilled fighter and swordsman, and despite his amiable disposition, can be ruthless to those who endanger those he loves. He has known Sh≈´rei since her childhood and is very protective of her, but prefers to watch and help from the shadows. Seiran is later revealed to be , Ryuuki's second-eldest brother, who had been known as the \\"flower\\" of the royal princes due to his physical and intellectual superiority as well as for his kind heart. Ryuuki deeply admires and cares for him, recalling that Seien had been the only brother who had shown him kindness as a boy, and the possibility of Seien's return is one of the reasons why Ryuuki does not take his responsibilities as a king seriously. Because of Seien's qualities, his maternal relatives conspired to make him the next Emperor. The plot failed, resulting in Seien's exile along with his mother, , who was later killed by assassins sent by the other imperial concubines to kill them both. Left alone in the distant Sa province, he joined Satsujinzoku, a murderous band of thieves who nicknamed him \\"The Little Whirlwind\\". Ensei Ro joined the group as well, and the two destroyed the band from within. Afterward, Shouka found the young prince in the wilderness and took him in, giving him the new personal name 'Seiran', as well as the surname 'Shi' (Ëåà), which was homophonous with his original surname. Seiran has since embraced this new persona and does not discuss his past, although some characters become quietly aware of his former identity. Though he claims to be 21 years old, he is actually 26 years old at the start of the series. Sh≈çka Hong is Sh≈´rei's father, Seiran's adoptive father and the eldest son of the Hong clan. After declining the clan leadership, he was expelled from the main estates. He moved to the capital where his younger brother, Reishin, got him a respectable but low-paying job as the custodian of the Imperial Archives. After Seien was exiled from the palace, Ry≈´ki often visited Sh≈çka when he was young because Sh≈çka was one of the few people who was kind to him. Sh≈çka is highly admired by Reishin, his younger brother, as well as Kouyuu, Reishin's adoptive son. On the surface, Sh≈çka simply seems to be a gentle librarian who brews awful tea; his inability to do anything in the kitchen without causing major destruction to the house is a source of endless frustration for Sh≈´rei. Despite his mild-mannered exterior, Sh≈çka is also a deadly assassin known as The Black Wolf, though the latter identity is secret from everyone, including Sh≈´rei, except for Advisor Sho, Shusui, and Reishin. In the service of the previous Emperor, he once led the Wolves of the Wind, a group of expert assassins, but has since disbanded them. Sh≈çka first met his wife when sent to kill her, but fell in love with her instead; he was also assigned to secretly protect Seien in exile. Later in the novels, Sh≈çka later assumes his rightful place as the leader of the Hong clan and takes on the responsibilities that his brothers had undertaken in order to protect the Hong clan. Shokun Hy≈ç was the mother of Sh≈´rei, adoptive mother of Seiran, and wife of Sh≈çka. She was known as a legendary beauty with a kind heart to match. She taught Sh≈´rei how to make steamed buns, discovering Sh≈´rei was a much better cook than she was; how to pick tangerines from the trees, and how to behave like a lady. She also gave the name 'Seiran' to the boy she and Sh≈çka found lying in the snow when the family traveled to Kiy≈ç. The name meant 'Silent Orchid', and was given because the boy that they found never said a word and was presumed to be a mute. She grew very close to both Sh≈´rei and Seiran, and encouraged Seiran to smile all the time to make Sh≈´rei happy. Shokun is later revealed as the of the Hy≈ç family. She had the ability to cure any illness and many men sought her hand in marriage. Her beauty even mesmerized the leader of the Hy≈ç family, Ri≈ç, who locked her from the world. She was considered a threat by the previous Emperor and was targeted for assassination by a woman called the Black Wolf, who failed and died in the attempt. The Emperor appointed a new Black Wolf, nicknamed Kaito: Sh≈çka Hong. However, Sh≈çka fell madly in love with the Rose Princess during his first meeting with her, causing him to abandon his mission and carry her away. After some time and difficulty, she returned his feelings. Afterward, she lost her powers of healing but retained the power to make one wish come true, which she used to make Sh≈´rei healthier at the cost of her own life. Shokun is eventually revealed to be the Red Immortal, one of the Eight Sages who served the first emperor; her spell to make Sh≈´rei healthier is the result of sealing her spirit within her daughter. Though her spirit is dormant within Sh≈´rei's body, it is said that Sh≈´rei will lose her own personality and \\"die\\" when the Red Immortal's spirit inevitably awakens. K≈çy≈´ Ri holds the rank of Vice-Secretary of the Department of Civil Administration, serving beneath Reishin Hong, who is also his foster father. As the series begins, K≈çy≈´ is assigned directly to the Emperor, a position that infuriates him because the wandering Emperor never carries out his duties and can rarely even be found. After agreeing to be tutored by K≈çy≈´ and assuming a more active role in government, Ry≈´ki offers K≈çy≈´ an iris flower as sign of trust. K≈çy≈´ openly accepts the flower as a token of loyalty and his belief in Ry≈´ki as a worthy Emperor. Despite his reputation as a genius, obtaining the \\"Jougen\\" spot when he took the Imperial Exams, K≈çy≈´ is notorious for having no sense of direction, constantly getting lost in the Imperial Palace in as little as thirty steps, and unable to get anywhere without the assistance of others (though at one point, Sh≈´ei notes that he doesn't seem to get lost while drunk). The acclaim he has received for his accomplishments often draws unwanted attention, which has developed into an aversion to most women after receiving a number of unwanted marriage proposals. K≈çy≈´ has a close relationship with Sh≈´ei Ran, though he loudly denies being the latter's friend. He loses his temper with very little prodding (often from Sh≈´ei, who constantly eggs him on) and gets tongue-tied speaking in official functions with large crowds. K≈çy≈´ is dedicated to serving his foster father, though he often feels that Reishin had only adopted him on whim and he was unworthy of being given the Hong name. In the anime, Reishin is depicted as adopting K≈çy≈´ from the streets, apparently impressed by K≈çy≈´'s ability to run a lottery with various prizes. The novels illustrate a much darker past for K≈çy≈´, where he had been orphaned as a baby and adopted by a loving elderly couple, who named him \\"\\". However, the couple was killed by bandits and Kou had been forced to live as a slave before being abandoned as a sacrifice to stop a flood. Reishin found him at this point and saved him, telling the child that his reasons were so Kou could care for Yuri-hime, who had fallen ill. As Kou and Yuri recovered at the Hong manor, Yuri tricked him into believing the Hong manor was haunted so he would not escape. To further the deception, she arranged for the furniture to be rearranged all the time so that he would always become lost, which eventually resulted in K≈çy≈´ lacking any sense of direction. Reishin eventually formally adopted Kou, taking care to rename the child \\"K≈çy≈´ Ri\\" in hopes that K≈çy≈´ could live as he wanted without the responsibilities of Hong clan to burden him. In the 13th novel, K≈çy≈´ is imprisoned under accusation of abusing his powers as Vice Chamberlain of the Department of Civil Administration; because Reishin never did any work, K≈çy≈´ had often overstepped his bounds by doing Reishin's work for him. During his imprisonment, K≈çy≈´ falls ill from a spell cast upon him by the Hy≈ç clan. When his mother, Yuri- hime, arrives in the capital, she helps him overcome his past memories and how he had devoted his life to trying to please Reishin rather than living for himself and he recovers from his illness. K≈çy≈´ is eventually freed; though he loses his position as the Vice-Chamberlain, but he remains an official. Reishin Hong is in charge of the Department of Civil Administration, which makes him K≈çy≈´'s bureaucratic superior as well as adoptive father. He finished second in the Imperial Exams, earning the title of Bougen. He is a good friend of his fellow official Kijin Kou, many of whose strange masks he makes despite being one of the few people who can withstand the sight of Kijin's bare face. Kijin describes him as being crafty and coldhearted, but Reishin usually seems very cheerful, easy-going, and even childish. He often engages in devious and secretive behavior, especially regarding his family. He is the only member of the Hong clan who knows that Sh≈çka is The Black Wolf. After Sh≈çka left the main estates nearly fifteen years ago, Reishin became the head of the Hong clan, but most outsiders have been led to believe that the clan leadership belongs to Kur≈ç Hong, their youngest brother. Despite Sh≈çka's public estrangment from their clan, in private Reishin remains very respectful to his older brother, whom he has been trying to protect since learning Seiran's previous identity as the exiled prince Seien. Reishin is overprotective of Sh≈´rei, although he has gone to great lengths to keep her from learning about their kinship for fear that she might blame him for supplanting her father. He is reluctant to let her marry anyone else, and has even said that he wished he could marry her himself until Sh≈çka pointed out that Reishin is already married. He secretly sponsors Sh≈´rei to take the Official Exams; afterward, he is accused of manipulating the results and is sentenced to house arrest, outraging the Hong clan into a work stoppage that shuts down half of Saiunkoku. The charges are dropped after the arrest of the real criminal, who started the rumors and was involved in illegal activities. In the manga some of Reishin's hidden past was revealed, that to him his brother Sh≈çka and his niece Sh≈´rei mean everything to him in this world. The books mention that Reishin plays the biwa, as do his brothers. In the 13th novel, Reishin is finally exposed to Sh≈´rei as her uncle from her investigations on K≈çy≈´'s behalf; stripped from his position as the Chamberlain of the Department of Civil Administration, Reishin plans to return to Hong province. Yuri-hime is Reishin's wife and K≈çy≈´'s adoptive mother. Unlike her husband, Yuri is practical and straightforward in her manner, as well as kind and thoughtful; Sh≈çka attributes her influence as the reason why K≈çy≈´ was able to become a capable young man. She is also responsible for helping to raise Kur≈ç during his childhood and she is well-regarded in the Hong clan. Her age lies somewhere in the five-year gap between Sh≈çka and Reishin. Yuri's mother was , a celebrated beauty in the imperial capital and the paternal great-aunt of Sh≈çka, Reishin, and Kur≈ç. Unknown to most, Yuri is the younger half-sister of the previous Emperor, Senka Shi, thus she is given the title \\". As a result, she bears a strong resemblance to both Senka and Ry≈´ki, which confused Seiran when he first met her a long time ago in the Hong residence. Gyokukan eventually took Yuri-hime away to Hong province to avoid the traditional fate of the princesses of the Shi family, who were traditionally sent away to the Hy≈ç clan, and to strengthen the Hong family in the event that Yuri would be able to take the throne. To protect her daughter, Yuri was disguised for many years as a servant boy named . Gyokukan was later assassinated by Sh≈çka on his first mission as the Black Wolf, as Emperor Senka had recognized Gyokukan was a serious political threat to the Shi clan. While Yuri had been intended as Sh≈çka's bride, Sh≈çka broke off the engagement after assassinating Gyokukan, believing that Yuri had no interest in him anyway. During childhood, Reishin had known that Yuri was actually a girl and fell in love with her while they were both children. Despite treating her rudely, Reishin trusted her without question and secretly prevented Yuri's plans to meet Senka someday. When Reishin decided to leave Hong province to follow Sh≈çka and take the Imperial Exams, Yuri-hime was the only person he took with him. During this time, K≈çy≈´ was brought into their family to help care for Yuri when she became very ill. She and K≈çy≈´ formed a strong relationship and he hoped that she would become his mother while Yuri thought of him as her own child. When Kijin Kou discovered that Yuri didn't faint upon seeing his real face, he became interested in her and asked her on a date. Though she did not reciprocate his interest, Yuri accepted after Reishin persuaded her to, unaware that Reishin and Y≈´shun Tei were spying on them during the meeting. When Kur≈ç sent her a letter encouraging her to marry Reishin, the letter became blurred and Yuri mistook the message as \\"please find Reishin a bride.\\" After she joined the Kogarou to find an ideal wife for Reishin, Reishin wound up ransoming Yuri from Kogarou and registered her as his wife while she was only half-conscious. Shortly before she married Reishin, Yuri was able to meet her brother Senka when she slipped into the palace. Though she expected him to kill her, he instead requested that she stay in the Inner Palace to care for Ry≈´ki, which she was unable to respond to because Reishin had burst into the palace to take her home. Though K≈çy≈´ thought that Yuri was an ideal partner for Reishin, he worried that Yuri was unhappy with Reishin, who rarely showed what he liked or disliked. In response, Yuri said that she was happy and would never leave them. Reishin has told her that she is the only person for whom he will play the biwa, and that since they already had a son (K≈çy≈´), they needn't have more children. She often travels away from their home to perform Reishin's duties as head of the Hong clan; consequently, she does not appear in the story until the 13th novel, when the news of K≈çy≈´'s imprisonment makes her return to Kiyo and meet Sh≈´rei and Ensei. During this time, she reveals her identity to Sh≈´rei as her aunt when visiting K≈çy≈´ in jail. She plays biwa to K≈çy≈´, dissolving the trance cast by the Hy≈ç clan. After her husband and child are stripped from their positions, many officials from the Hong clan decide to withdraw in sympathy. While Reishin wants to return to Hong province, he is dismayed that Yuri-hime has decided to remain in Kiyou with her son. Kur≈ç Hong , the youngest brother of Sh≈çka and Reishin, acts as the proxy head of the Hong clan and many outsiders believe him to be the true leader. A man of tradition and family loyalty, Kur≈ç urged their father to pass over Sh≈çka (whom he viewed as useless) in favor of Reishin as the next clan leader. Despite looking down on Sh≈çka, Kur≈ç does not hesitate to avenge his brother's honour when Shokun's death stunned Sh≈çka too much to notice when his servants stole all of his valuables. The proxy head issued orders to find the thieves and show them the tortures of Hell and arranged for their severed ears and eyes were sent to their families to warn them against any such future behavior towards a member of the Hong family. His wife , son , and daughter all aid him with his duties in running the Hong province. Unbeknownst to Sh≈´rei, Kur≈ç comes to the capital to extend the full protection of the Hong clan when she embarks on the path to become an Imperial official. When Reishin is accused of manipulating the exam results on her behalf, Kur≈ç protests by ordering the Hong work stoppage that brings half of the country to a halt. Kur≈ç also intervenes on Sh≈´rei's behalf when she is appointed as the co- governor of Sa province; the travel pass for the journey bears the clan crest of Kijin Kou, as the minister who issues the pass, but in the special \\"seven- colored\\" ink that can only be made by the Hong clan and marks her as a person of importance to them. Despite his apparently rigid and formal attitude, he cares greatly for the well-being of his family; he loves both his brothers and recognizes K≈çy≈´ as his nephew despite the fact they have no blood relation. For the sake of the clan, Kur≈ç intends Sh≈´rei and K≈çy≈´ to marry one another to lead the clan in the future. Of the three brothers, he is known for his strong-will and kindness, possessing a broad mind and deep emotion. He respects his sister-in-law, Yuri-hime, who helped raise him and had considered that Kur≈ç would have been more suitable to the life of an imperial administrator rather than Reishin because of his diligence and ability to work without being swayed by emotion. The Shi clan The imperial clan of Saiunkoku. Ry≈´ki Shi is the reigning emperor of Saiunkoku, Ry≈´ki Shi is nineteen years old when the story begins. As the youngest of the previous Emperor's six sons, each from a different mother, he had been an unlikely candidate to ascend to the throne. In childhood, Ry≈´ki was badly treated by his mother and most of his half-brothers, who would beat him and lock him in a storage house for days in a row. Second Prince Seien was the only member of the family who showed kindness to him. Ry≈´ki often took refuge in the garden or the imperial archives; in the latter location, he first encountered Sh≈çka Hong, who tutored the young prince and encouraged War General Sou-Taifu to teach him swordsmanship. Ry≈´ki ultimately rose to the throne due to his father's dying wish, after Seien was exiled for treason and the other four princes killed each other over the succession. Secretly hoping for many years that Seien would return and take his place as Emperor, Ry≈´ki play-acted as a stupid Emperor and avoided any involvement in politics or government, wandering the palace for hours so no one would be able to find him. He even spread rumours that he preferred the company of men to fuel speculation he could not produce an heir. His avoidance of responsibility comes to an end when he meets Sh≈´rei, who tells him of her dreams of making a better life for the nation's people. Charmed by her earnest and nurturing personality, he decides to undertake the task of becoming a respectable Emperor. Ry≈´ki's devotion to Sh≈´rei reveals a capacity for subterfuge and cunning that may have helped him survive the fight for the succession. He initially pretended to be ignorant so that he could study along with Sh≈´rei. Although he has an extreme fear of darkness and solitude because of his childhood experiences, he uses that fear as an excuse to sleep in her room at the palace. When someone tries to poison Sh≈´rei, Ry≈´ki conceals the plot from her and even takes the poison in her place, as part of his plan to identify the culprit. After she returns home, he passes a law allowing women to take the official exams, which brings Sh≈´rei back to the palace and enables her to pursue her dreams. Ry≈´ki's romantic pursuit of Sh≈´rei has been complicated by his lack of experience in courting women, as well as Sh≈´rei's initial belief that he was homosexual and therefore more interested in Seiran. Even after discovering Seiran's true identity, Ry≈´ki harbors some jealousy that Seiran spends more time with Sh≈´rei and is a closer confidant of hers. After she leaves the palace, Ry≈´ki sends her many absurd gifts such as boiled eggs, blocks of ice, and even a straw voodoo doll. Before sending Sh≈´rei to Sa province as co-governor, Ry≈´ki privately tells her that she is the only woman he wants to marry. Ry≈´ki eventually tells Sh≈´rei that he cannot wait for her forever because part of his responsibilities as the Emperor requires him to marry. As a result, he extracts a promise from her that he can convince her to marry before a specified time, she will become his consort. After years of convincing Sh≈´rei, he finally succeeded and Sh≈´rei finally accepted Ry≈´ki's marriage proposal. Sh≈´rei eventually dies soon after she gives birth to her and Ry≈´ki's daughter. Senka Shi is the previous Emperor of Saiunkoku, and father to Ry≈´ki, Seiran, and the other four princes. During his lifetime, he loved only one woman but was unable to marry her. For political reasons, he ended up with six simultaneous concubines, each of whom bore him a son but whom he never visited again. The Sixth Consort was especially bitter about this abandonment and took out her anger on her son, Ry≈´ki. Senka fell sick in his youth, causing chaos in the royal court, and died almost a decade later. During his reign, he used the Wolves of the Wind to assassinate some of the lesser noble clans for their misdeeds, but allowed the families of the Eight Colored Clans to remain unpunished for much worse crimes. He also came up with the Official Exam system to minimize the nobles' political influence and admit other social classes to participate in the government. For that reason, he was deeply disliked by the survivors of the minor noble families, but also highly respected and feared. Three men accompanied Senka from the start of his coronation: Yosei Sho-Taishi (Advisor Sho), Sou-Taifu, and Enjun Sa-Taiho, all of whom bore the title of 'Choutei Sanshi' (three royal advisors) and later serve Ry≈´ki as his designated successor. The novels reveal that Senka died from protecting his second son, Seien, from a deadly curse sent by the Hy≈ç clan and Lady Suzuran. Before his illness, he entrusted both Ry≈´ki and Seien to Sh≈çka's protection. The Four Shi Princes Sons of Senka, the previous Emperor of Saiunkoku. They were born from four different mothers and competed fiercely against each other, agreeing only in wanting to eliminate Seien (the most talented of all six princes) and bully Ry≈´ki (though they didn't dare touch him whenever Seien was around). After Seien's exile and their father's grave illness, the brothers' fight for the throne caused civil war in Saiunkoku, ending only with Advisor Sho's intervention. The four princes were executed and some of their followers were exiled. Ironically, it was their bullied youngest brother, Ry≈´ki, who survived them all and was crowned as Emperor. The Ran clan The most powerful clan in Saiunkoku, directly below that of the royal family. Their clan seal is described as \\"Twin Dragon Lotus Spring\\" (ÂèåÈæçËìÆÊ≥â). The specialty of the clan is producing salt from the water margins of Ran province. The Shiba are their main clan of retainers. Sh≈´ei Ran is the fourth of the five sons of the Ran family and the General of the Shaorin army. He has legendary fighting skills thanks to his training by the Shiba clan, retainers of the Ran clan who excel in swordsmanship; the only opponents who can beat him at full strength are Koku-Daishogun and Haku- Daishogun. He recognizes Seiran's past identity from his sword fighting techniques, and the novels call him and Seiran the greatest military officials of Ry≈´ki's reign as Emperor. Near the beginning of Ry≈´ki's reign, Sh≈´ei briefly worked as a civil official, but was disappointed by how the new Emperor wasn't interested in politics and kept disappearing. Switching from the civil service to the military, Sh≈´ei joined the Left Uringun army and rose to the position of Shogun. Usually calm himself, Sh≈´ei likes to tease others, and claims to be K≈çy≈´ Ri's best friend though K≈çy≈´ keeps denying it. Sh≈´ei and K≈çy≈´ met during the Imperial Exams, in which Sh≈´ei took the second highest honor as Bougen. The two men become reacquainted after being assigned by his superior (Koku-Daishogun) as the personal guard and advisor respectively to Ry≈´ki, who disappeared and left Sh≈´ei and K≈çy≈´ in the library for a month of boredom. Sh≈´ei enjoys provoking K≈çy≈´, usually by mentioning the latter's lack of direction and his aversion to women. Unlike K≈çy≈´, Sh≈´ei enjoys being a popular ladies' man, often visiting the courtesan Koch≈ç. However, Sh≈´ei's womanizing habits are mainly to attract the attention of Shusui, who finds his behavior irritating and likens it him to treating the Imperial Harem like the Red Light District. Unknown to Shusui, Sh≈´ei had fallen in love with her during their first meeting after she had helped him. Sh≈´ei is also a frequent visitor at Sh≈´rei's house and he often pays for the ingredients every time he dines there, resulting in Seiran calling him \\"saifu #1\\" (wallet #1). In the novel and drama CD, Sh≈´ei's brother(s) Setsuna Ran sent him to Kiyou as a child to assist one of the princes (later identified as Prince Seien). He encountered the young prince under attack in an alley and tried to help him, but Sh≈´ei's sword fighting skills weren't strong enough to defeat the assassins, and Seien told him that he was weak and useless. Seien even defeated Sh≈´ei in a sword battle in front of Setsuna Ran and Emperor Senka. Humiliated, Sh≈´ei retreated back to Ran province and trained hard with his childhood best friend Jin Shiba. However, by the time Sh≈´ei returned to the capital, the prince who mocked him had been banished for treason; his elder brothers ordered him to track down Prince Seien's whereabouts, but he was unable to do so. Along with K≈çy≈´, Sh≈´ei receives and accepts a flower (a purple iris which he later engraves on his sword) from Ry≈´ki, a symbol of steadfast trust that establishes the young emperor's reign with the support of the top two rising officials of the palace. Over time, Sh≈´ei's loyalties become increasingly torn between the emperor and the Ran clan, causing him to return the iris sword to Ry≈´ki and retire to Ran province. After being banished by the Ran clan, he returns to Ry≈´ki, convinced that the Emperor has accepted his responsibilities and wants Sh≈´ei's support for his own merits, not just for his family connections. Ry≈´ren Ran is the youngest of the five Ran brothers, though he has been marked as the genius of their generation by the name \\"Ry≈´ren\\", which he received at age four and is only bestowed by the clan on members of great talent. His genius is matched only by his eccentricity; as such, what he sees is different from what other people see and he is highly perceptive. However, he does not appear to think highly of very many people, including his brother Sh≈´ei, whom he nicknames \\"Silly Older Brother #4\\". The only person who can cope with his behavior is Sh≈´rei, whom he promptly dubs his \\"Soul Friend #1\\". Eigetsu becomes his \\"Soul Friend #2\\", and Yogetsu is eventually counted as \\"Soul Friend #2.5\\". Ry≈´ren is eighteen years old when the story begins. A lover of art and nature, Ry≈´ren is also highly skilled in martial arts. He plays the bamboo flute in a cacophonic style at all hours of day and night that can alter people's mental health and cause birds to fall from the sky. Ironically, Ry≈´ren is actually very good at playing other musical instruments, so it surprised his brothers that he chose to play the flute instead. He also favors strange, flashy clothing that may include vegetables as fashion accessories, and often vexes Sh≈´rei by asking her to cook random food items at whim and by offering her a position as his personal cook. Ry≈´ren earned the nickname while wandering the countryside and playing cards, which his family allowed on the condition that Ry≈´ren would take one of the top three places in the Official Exams. When he comes to the Imperial capital just before the exams, his dorm becomes known as the \\"Cursed 13th Building\\" because he would play his flute instead of studying, which drove the other examinees insane. During the exams, seven officials resigned from the Examination Board after having incomprehensible conversations with him. Ry≈´ren takes the Official Exams with Sh≈´rei and Eigetsu and passes with the second highest score, taking the \\"Bougen\\" spot, but then skips out on the Shinshi Ceremony that inducts the examinees as new officials. Claiming that the wind called to him to start a new voyage, he resumed wandering because he had fulfilled his promise to excel in the exams. When Ry≈´ren wanders back to the capital, Ry≈´ki gives him the important task of delivering the governor's seal to Sh≈´rei and Eigetsu in Sa province. Sh≈´rei tells Ry≈´ren to stay clear of their dangerous political situation, but Ry≈´ren says that the danger is why he wanted to stay involved, and that his \\"Soul Friends\\" are the only people who he'll let take advantage of him. Though Ry≈´ren claims to have no interest in becoming an Imperial official or the head of the Ran clan, Kur≈ç Hong seriously weighs a proposal from the Ran clan to marry Ry≈´ren to Sh≈´rei. Later in the series, Ry≈´ren is revealed to be the Blue Immortal, one of the Eight Sages who served the first emperor of Saiunkoku. Setsuna Ran is the collective name of the three eldest Ran brothers, who are triplets acting as a single entity to lead the Ran clan. Their individual names are , , and . Only the oldest triplet, Yuki, is married; although his wife can recognize him, even she can't tell the other two apart. Ry≈´ki refers to them as the \\"sleeping dragons\\". In Saiunkoku, multiple births were usually seen as bad luck, causing such infants to be killed at birth, but their father spared their lives and raised them to become indistinguishable from one another. They were taught by Sh≈çka Hong in their childhood and grew close to him, but they still don't get along with Reishin. Fourteen years before the story begins, the triplets lived in the capital and served as a government official (in their collective identity of \\"Setsuna Ran\\"). After Emperor Senka became ill and the succession dispute fell into chaos, the triplets returned to their home and never returned. When their youngest brother was given the name Ry≈´ren at the age of four, the triplets took it upon themselves to let him grow without the influence of other clans. They assumed the leadership of the Ran clan, causing a stir in the country because for the first time more than one person was appointed as head of one of the Eight Honorable Clans. They sent Sh≈´ei to the capital as a young boy, and later allowed Ry≈´ren to wander across the country on the condition that he would take one of the top three places in the Imperial Exams. At the end of season 2, they challenge Sh≈´ei to identify them individually, with the condition that if he succeeds, he will be disowned from the clan. When Sh≈´ei succeeds, Setsuna banishes him from the clan, allowing Sh≈´ei to return to the emperor's side. Gyokuka Ran is the wife of Yuki Ran. A woman with a very cheerful and rational mindset, she also loves the outdoors and is a great cook. Gyokuka originally came to the Ran household as a potential concubine for the previous head of the Ran clan, and was excited by the prospect of becoming stepmother of the five Ran brothers. Although not a legendary beauty, she charmed Sh≈´ei, though she was oblivious to his affection for her. Instead, Gyokuka fell in love with Yuki, despite his very cold and cynical attitude. Her marriage to the eldest triplet devastated Sh≈´ei, causing him to flee from Ran province. Jy≈´san-hime Ran is the half-sister of the five Ran brothers. She was raised by her mother's family, the Shiba clan, who trained her as both a fighter and as a princess. The literal meaning of her name is \\"Thirteenth Princess\\", although she also had the childhood nickname \\"\\". Setsuna Ran sends Jy≈´san-hime to the imperial capital as a potential bride for either Ry≈´ki or Seiran. Because she looks very similar to Sh≈´rei, the two women exchange places to avert an assassination plot from a rogue member of the Shiba clan. After Shusui resigns from the palace, Jy≈´san-hime succeeds her as chief lady-in-waiting and is likely to become Ry≈´ki's consort if Sh≈´rei continues to reject his marriage proposal. The Ko clan Kijin Ko is the Chief Minister of the Department of Treasury and Taxation. His name \\"\\" is actually a nickname and very few people know his original personal name, . Many people consider him mysterious and eccentric, especially because of his unusual appearance. He leaves his hair loosely flowing instead of binding it up according to custom, and is almost never seen without one of the masks from his wide collection. These masks usually conceal his entire face, although they have a lower panel that can open to uncover his mouth when he eats or drinks in public. Many of the masks were made by Reishin Hong, who is one of his few close friends and with whom he often enjoys meaningless arguments. In his official capacity, Kijin tends to be very strict, but he is gracious to Sh≈´rei when she begins to work for him. Although she is disguised as a man, he already knows that she is Reishin's niece but does not identify her to the rest of his department, and he comforts her when she is upset by a violent thunderstorm. When she falls ill, he brings flowers to her (camellias in the anime, orchids in the novel). He also teases Reishin into a rage by claiming he is thinking about marrying her. Although his masks are widely assumed to conceal a deformed or hideous appearance, in fact they conceal a face of such dazzling beauty that it can drive people insane. The masks also muffle the true sound of his voice, which is as silky and beautiful as his hair. When he took the imperial examinations as a young man, his otherworldly beauty caused the exam for that year to go down in legend as \\"The Nightmare Exam\\" by mesmerizing everyone else in the hall so much that thirty officials had to be sacked and only two other candidates, Reishin and Yuushun, passed the exams at all; he won third place, receiving the title of Tanka. After proposing to the woman he loved, he received the rejection message \\"I can't stand beside someone with a face like yours.\\" However, the message had really been sent by Reishin, who loved the same woman and eventually married her. On Reishin's wedding night, Houju changed his name to Kijin (which everyone else already called him, as a nickname meaning \\"weirdo\\") and began to wear masks, which he has continued to do by official sanction. During Reishin Hong's trial for malfeasance, Kijin removes his mask in front of the court to confront a corrupt official, who nearly loses his mind as a result, while other officials are warned to look away; those who forgot to plug their ears wound up fainting or going into hysterics. The Heki Clan A clan famed for their skills in art, the Heki clan and their retainers generally keep away from politics and are known to be very poor at political bargaining. Instead, they focus their efforts on monopolitizing positions in arts and ceremonies. Hakumei Heki is a young man who passes fourth in the Official Examinations in the same year as Eigetsu and Sh≈´rei and helps them both during their harsh training. He admires K≈çy≈´ and claims proudly that he even wants to be exactly like him, unaware that his idol has a hair-trigger temper and is unable to find his way over even short distances. Hakumei helped Sh≈´rei identify the forgeries during the counterfeiting incident. He is one of the few members of the Heki clan in politics and is assigned a post in the Department of Civil Affairs and Administration. Karin Heki is the elder sister of Hakumei and mother of Banri Heki. While she is the best artist during Ry≈´ki's reign, she has been forced by her clan to work under the male alias due to the belief that female artists do not receive the same respect or acclaim as their male counterparts. According to Hakumei, she is highly protected by the Heki clan as she is the most likely candidate to become the next clan leader. While she is very beautiful, she actually treats most men rudely and tends to be rather violent. Later in the novels, she agrees to remake the broken mirror in the Hyou Clan's temple, despite rumours that those who finish the mirror will die. Jun ≈åy≈ç is the husband of Karin Heki and Banri's father. As one of the few members of the Heki clan involved in politics, ≈åy≈ç is the undersecretary of the Department of Imperial Labour in the government and is later appointed the governor of the Heki province. In contrast to his wife, he is a friendly person and quick to judge. He is later revealed to be the Sage of Heki, the Green Immortal of the Eight Sages who served the first emperor. Banri Heki is Karin's son and Hakumei's nephew. During Shuurei's investigation into counterfeiting, it is revealed that Banri was tricked into making forgeries of paintings and carving counterfeit coins. The Sa clan Enjun Sa is one of the three Grand Officials of the Palace, holding the title of Taiho. Sa-Taiho has held a long history of frustrated ambition, especially since the Sa clan has the least respect among the Eight Colored Clans. He never manages to surpass Advisor Sho, his longtime friend and fellow Grand Official. Most of Enjun's family lives in Sa province, including his wife and granddaughter. Enjun maintains a small household for himself in the imperial capital. After the orphaned young girl K≈çrin collapsed in front of his residence eight years ago, he took her in and found her a position in the palace as a lady-in-waiting. Enjun offers his granddaughter, Shunki, as a prospective bride for Ry≈´ki; when she is rejected, Enjun plots to overthrow Ry≈´ki and replace him with Seiran as a puppet emperor, knowing Seiran is really the exiled Imperial Prince Seien. Unfortunately, Seiran is unwilling to cooperate, leading to a confrontation in which Seiran fatally wounds Enjun with a thrown dagger just before being knocked unconscious. Enjun's dying moments are tended by Advisor Sho, who discovered the conspiracy. Advisor Sho becomes guardian of Enjun's ashes and seals his friend Enjun's spirit inside the Sa clan signet. Enjun's actions are eventually revealed as a deliberate campaign to destroy the corrupt and power-hungry members of his own family, whose in-fighting killed his only son nine years ago. His treason further undermines the prestige and power of the Sa clan, and also encourages the emperor to move against its seat of power in Sa province. K≈çrin is introduced as Sh≈´rei's young lady-in-waiting at the palace. K≈çrin retains a deep loyalty to her adoptive father, Enjun Sa. After Ry≈´ki rejects Enjun's granddaughter as an imperial consort while apparently favoring Sh≈´rei, K≈çrin tries to poison both Sh≈´rei to avenge the insult to the Sa clan and herself for the sake of protecting Enjun. Upon Enjun's death, she is sent to live with his widow Eiki in Sa province. She returns to the capital with Ensei to deliver information about the developing crisis there. While traveling back to Sa province with Ensei, Seiran, and the two newly appointed co-governors Eigetsu and Sh≈´rei, K≈çrin is mistaken for Sh≈´rei and thus kidnapped and imprisoned with Eigetsu. When her captors Meisho and S≈çjun start to doubt her identity, she convinces them that she is indeed Sh≈´rei by accepting their challenge to re-write the poem which made the poet Mei Senshi famous. K≈çrin and Eigetsu later escape to Kinka with the help of S≈çjun's youngest brother, Kokujun. Reunited with Ensei, Seiran, and Sh≈´rei in Kinka, K≈çrin shows some signs of romantic feelings for Eigetsu, although her manner towards him is a mixture of concern, annoyance, and often exasperation, exacerbated by Y≈çgetsu. When Eigetsu's bond to Y≈çgetsu weakens, he leaves K≈çrin by telling her that he loves her and finally kisses her. They reunite after Y≈çgetsu voluntarily enters a state of hibernation in order for Eigetsu to be with her. After that, she decides to stay in Sa province serving Eigetsu. Eiki Hy≈ç is Enjun's wife, who remained in Sa province to act on his behalf as clan head while he carried out his duties as Taiho in the imperial capital. Much of their long marriage was spent separated in this fashion. After Enjun's death, his ambitious younger brother Chuusho imprisons her and Shunki. Eiki was born to the Hy≈ç clan, the mysterious shadow lineage of Saiunkoku. As such, she would not have normally married outside her family, but she fell in love with Enjun and pursued him until he gave in. She retained some of the supernatural powers of the Hy≈ç women, such as the precognition which turned her against Advisor Sho because she always knew that he would be involved in Enjun's death. She also sealed off the powers and voice of their granddaughter Shunki during the girl's childhood. Shunki Sa is the granddaughter of Enjun. Her father and mother were murdered nine years ago by her cousin, Sakujun Sa, though that fact is unknown to her. Her ability to speak was sealed by her grandmother, Eiki, when she was a child, and so she communicates primarily through writing. Because she is of the main Sa line of descent through Enjun, she is a threat to Ch≈´sh≈ç and other branch family members during their power struggle. For her own protection, she is hidden away and watched over by Sh≈çrin and Y≈çshun, under orders from Ensei Rou. Later, she uses her strange power to rescue Kokujun together with Sh≈´rei. When Kokujun accepts the burden of leading the Sa clan, she vows to be always by his side. Ch≈´sh≈ç Sa is Enjun's ambitious younger brother. After Enjun's death, Chuusho seizes power in Sa province by imprisoning Eiki and the acting imperial governor. Disregarding the cost and chaos involved, he orders a search for the seals of the previous governor and orders the Satsujinzoku to intercept the new co-governors, Sh≈´rei Hong and Eigetsu Tou. He plans to force the Hong clan into an alliance by marrying Sh≈´rei to one of his grandsons, whom he views as pawns for his ambition. S≈çjun Sa is the eldest grandson of Ch≈´sh≈ç and matches him in blind ambition. He works with the Satsujinzoku to kidnap Eigetsu Tou and K≈çrin, whom they had mistaken for Sh≈´rei. Believing that the group is under his grandfather's control, he attempts to shift their allegiance of their leader, Meish≈ç, and gain their support for himself. S≈çjun is eventually killed by Sakujun, his next youngest brother, although he blames their third brother Kokujun for it. Sakujun Sa , known also under the alias , is Ch≈´sh≈ç's second grandson, who finds the world very boring and seeks to amuse himself without regard for morals. Due to his childlike attitude, he reminds Sh≈´rei of Ry≈´ki. To relieve his boredom, Sakujun became involved with the Murderous Blades, when he was a teenager. During this time, he found and recognized the young Prince Seien collapsed in the snow and brought him into the gang. Some years later, when his Great-Uncle Enjun Sa tried to rein in Sakujun's behavior from a distance, Sakujun retaliated by assassinating Enjun's son and daughter- in-law, the parents of Shunki. When his grandfather Ch≈´sh≈ç orders him to marry Sh≈´rei for political gain, Sakujun has the Murderous Blades massacre the Rin household, assuming the identity of Senya Rin and personally escorting Sh≈´rei to Kinka. Although he is twelve years older than Sh≈´rei, he becomes sufficiently intrigued by her to attempt to seduce her. He arranges the murder of his older brother, S≈çjun, in order to manoeuvre himself to become the strongest candidate for leadership of the Sa Clan and thus the natural choice for a strategic marriage to Sh≈´rei. To his surprise, he finds himself falling in love with Sh≈´rei, who refuses to return his affections. Sakujun eventually allows Sh≈´rei to poison him without her knowledge to test whether she loves him or not. He is later assumed to be dead, although his body is never found. In the second series, he makes a dreamlike appearance to one of the characters, presumably as a spirit. Kokujun Sa is the youngest of the three brothers, whose kindness is regarded as a weakness by his family. He reminds Lady Eiki and Sakujun of a young Enjun. Kokujun is fond of his cousin Shunki, and he releases Seiran and Ensei from confinement so they can rescue her. However, Ensei lectures him harshly for letting others risk their lives, encouraging Kokujun to take action himself. As a result, Kokujun safely brings Eigetsu and K≈çrin to Kinka, concealing his knowledge that K≈çrin is not really the female co-governor. When the ring of the Sa clan is recovered, Kokujun takes on the leadership of the Sa clan with Shunki's support. He is close friends with Ry≈´ren Ran, who is the same age as Kokujin, and admires Ry≈´ren greatly. The Hy≈çu clan Although not one of the fabled Eight Colored Clans of Saiunkoku, the Hy≈çu clan nevertheless holds an important position. It was founded by the first Emperor's sister, , and the daughters of the imperial Shi clan are still routinely sent to them to be trained as priestesses or married. Otherwise, the Hy≈çu clan almost never marries outside itself although there have been a few rare exceptions such as Eiki Hy≈çu, who chose to marry Enjun Sa. Many members of the Hy≈çu clan have supernatural powers, especially the women. Their founder sealed off 108 spirits into a mirror by playing the erhu; after Sh≈çka Hong frees the spirits by deliberately shattering the mirror, Shusui is able to pacify them by playing the erhu herself. Hy≈çu Ri≈çu, Sr. is the head of the Hy≈çu clan, despite the fact that the role is normally held by a woman. He maintains a youthful appearance, despite being about eighty years old. Ri≈çu is particularly obsessed with Shokun, believing that Sh≈çka had stolen the Rose Princess and Shusui from him, and is eager to meet Sh≈´rei because she looks like his lost Bara-hime. He also tries to get Shurei because Shokun is inside of her. Hy≈çu Ri≈çu, Jr. is the son of Ri≈çu the Elder, bearing exactly the same name as his father. Ri≈çu currently works in Kiy≈ç as the Head of Sentosh≈ç (Department of the Cave of Immortals) and Ry≈´ki often confides his feelings for Sh≈´rei to him. In spite of his youth, Ri≈çu Jr. is a very mature, albeit mysterious, individual from the Hy≈çu clan. He deeply appreciates the love and care that Sh≈´rei shows him and, when Ren dies, he reflects upon how Sh≈´rei's kindness allowed him to experience the things that Ren wanted for him. First seen during the plague in Sa province, he follows his father's orders and goes on missions for him. He later takes Sh≈´rei to the Hy≈çu Clan and is seen trying to impede the locust plague from happening. Aware that Sh≈´rei has little time left before the Red Immortal awakens within her, Ri≈çu tries to help her by bringing her to the Hy≈çu Clan, an action that extends Sh≈´rei's existence in the world a while longer. Ruka Hy≈çu is the older sister of the elder Ri≈ç, as well as the leader of the psychics in the Hy≈çu clan. She shares her brother's obsession with the Rose Princess to the extent that she even wants to take over Sh≈´rei's body so her brother will finally look at her in that way. Unlike her brother, her physical appearance reflects her true age, although in the anime she projects the apparition of a younger woman when speaking to others. Her son Ren is the real mastermind of Jyasenky≈ç, which started the problems in Sa province during Sh≈´rei and Eigetsu's time as governors. Shusui Hy≈çu is Sh≈´rei's main lady-in-waiting during her time as an imperial concubine. Her beauty is said by Ry≈´ki to be comparable only to Koch≈ç, the famous courtesan in the Red Light District. She loves the smell of sandalwood and had kept a fan made of sandalwood as a prized possession, though the fan is later given to Sh≈´ei. Shusui is deeply attached to Sh≈çka, although he doesn't return her feelings, and is the only person who says that his tea is delicious. She is terrible at embroidery, which Ry≈´ki likes to tease her about; when she attempts to make a sunflower-like floral pattern, Sh≈çka mistakes it for a lion. Shusui appears kind and caring to Sh≈´rei and Ry≈´ki, although Ry≈´ren is suspicious of her swift agility in dealing with K≈çrin's clumsiness. It is later revealed that Shusui comes from the Hy≈çu clan and she is to succeed Ruka as the leader of the psychics. When Sh≈çka took Shokun away from the clan, he also brought Shusui, whom he brought into his care and sent to the palace. While Sa-Taih≈ç believes that she is an assassin loyal to him, Shusui is actually a double agent under the orders of Advisor Sho, known as the Black Wolf and leader of an order of assassins known Wolves of the Wind which is loyal to the Emperor. In the second season of the anime, Shusui starts to hear sounds in her head; afraid that she is falling back into the control of the Hy≈çu clan, she attempts suicide. When she passes out in Sh≈´ei's arms, she breaks his heart by calling out Sh≈çka's name instead. He later uses Sh≈çka's name to snap her out of a hypnotic trance. Afterward, she insists on remaining in Ran province to face the Hy≈çu clan, leaving her position as head lady-in-waiting of the Imperial Harem. She is deemed officially missing (though the Emperor knows where she is) and her position has been filled by Jyuusan-hime. In the 16th novel, Shusui is trapped in the \\"prison of time\\" and was later rescued by Sh≈´ei. Hien-hime is the mother of Ri≈ç the Younger, who has the strong resemblance to his mother. She is later revealed to be , the only daughter of Ki Ou, the chancellor to the emperor. Her body has been used as a vessel by Ruka, who had done so in order to extend Hien's life when she was dying shortly after giving birth. When Ruka finally dies, Hien uses the rest of her life to help Sh≈´rei, whose life has shortened as a result of her mother's spell wearing off outside of the imperial capital. Inhabitants and officials of the Imperial capital, Kiy≈ç Y≈´shun Tei is a mild-mannered man in his late thirties who walks with a cane. Despite his gentle exterior, Y≈´shun is considered to be dangerous and very powerful. Y≈´shun is an effective politician who can accurately predict the current situation, and can be so persuasive in debate that the Merchant Alliance was reluctant to even enter negotiations with him. Initially appearing as one of Sh≈´rei and Eigetsu's assistant officials in Sa Province, Ry≈´ki promotes Y≈´shun to Prime Minister, giving him a feathered fan as a sign of office. Y≈´shun's political actions disturb the noble families enough to potentially endanger his life; despite his protests that he does not need protection, Seiran is assigned as his personal guard. Y≈´shun is a very good friend of Kijin and Reishin, who both took the official exams with him. In the trio, he is older by a few years. He passed first in the Exams (with the title Jogen), with Reishin passing second (Bogen) and Kijin third (Tanka). A side story of the manga shows that he first met Sh≈´rei during her childhood, when she gave him some of her homemade buns. In the anime, Ryou Anjuu says that Y≈´shun is from a very noble family that even surpasses the power of both the Ran and Hong clans. During Ensei's term as governor of Sa province, Y≈´shun serves as his assistant. When Ensei resigns the position and leaves, Y≈´shun remains there as the temporary governor, performing his duties while voluntarily being imprisoned in a tower to protect him from the Sa clan. Y≈´shun loses his official status and is left in a dangerous position when Sh≈´rei and Eigetsu are appointed as co-governors of Sa province, but Ensei assures them that Y≈´shun will be entirely safe, even from Sakujun Sa. Y≈´shun first appears as an official sent from Koren to help Sh≈´rei and Eigetsu, who had just arrived in Kinka. Under the alias of Official , he readily gives advice to the young co-governors. Only Ensei knows his identity, and the two men work closely together to support Sh≈´rei and Eigetsu. Y≈´shun orders the military forces throughout the province to quell the riots instigated by Chuusho Sa, and to capture the corrupt members of the Sa clan. When Sh≈´rei and Eigetsu find out that \\"his\\" tower has burned down, he reveals his real identity as Y≈´shun Tei and says that he was rescued by Ensei's master, who extracted him from the locked tower and left him on the streets of Kinka, where he revived the next day. In the novels, he was in love with Rin Sai, Sho Sai's twin sister, even before Rin proposed to him, but he never thought that he had a chance because of the age gap. He kept rejecting her proposal year after year because he didn't want her to get involved in the Sa conflict. This made him very depressed, and also caused much drama for Ensei and Sai Sho. When Sa province is finally under control, he accepts Rin's proposal in the Autumn Festival and they are married. They are referred to as newlyweds in episode 38 of the first season anime. Yosei Sh≈ç is one of the three Grand Officials of the Palace and holds the rank of '. Generally referred to as \\"Advisor Sho\\" or his title, \\"\\", he is close friends with his fellow Grand Officials, Sa-Taiho and Sou-Taifu, all of whom also served Ry≈´ki's father, the previous Emperor. Advisor Sho does not serve the country for its own sake. He is only loyal to a worthy Emperor, whose life he will do his best to protect. During the battle for the imperial succession eight years ago, he refused to support any one of the battling princes, and since then he has done the bare minimum to ensure the country's survival while waiting for a worthy ruler to appear. When he realises that Ry≈´ki has the right potential, he makes sure that no one threatens Ry≈´ki's place on the throne. He persuades Sh≈´rei to come to the palace as a temporary Imperial consort, which motivates Ry≈´ki to become worthy and exposes Enjun Sa-Taiho's assassination plot. Although saddened by Enjun's death, he considers it necessary. Advisor Sho also controls the Black Wolf and the Wolves of the Wind, but after he endangers the lives of Sh≈´rei and Seiran, Sh≈çka stops obeying his orders and vows to kill him someday. When comforting the last moments of his friend Enjun, Advisor Sho takes on the supernatural appearance of a young man surrounded by a white aura. Later, he is able to summon Enjun's spirit. In fact, he is the Sage of Shi, the Purple Immortal of the Eight Sages who served the first Emperor. Shungai S≈ç is one of the three Grand Officials of the Palace, holding the rank of ', and is known as a famous war hero. He is a peerless warrior and served the previous Emperor with great devotion. A great friend to Advisor Sho, Shungai has taught swordsmanship to both Ry≈´ki and Seien. He knows of the actual existence of the Eight Sages, and is often aware of Advisor Sho's plans. Koch≈ç is the beautiful mistress of Kougaro, the most prestigious pleasure house in the red-light district. She is fond of Sh≈´rei, who worked as her accountant for many years. Not only is she one of the most sought-after courtesans, she is also the underground boss in charge of the region. She bestows Sh≈´rei with a makeup set, with the lesson to use it for strength and support. Dr. T≈ç  is an elderly physician who works in the Imperial Palace. At one point he is seen treating Ry≈´ki. When Sh≈´rei asks the Palace's doctors to help treat the plague in Sa province, Dr. T≈ç convinces the other doctors to join Sh≈´rei's cause and learn surgery. Suou Shin is an official working for the Inspector General. From the middle-high class, he proposes to Sh≈´rei under his father's orders despite his lack of personal interest in her. When he first appears, he bears many tanuki-themed accessories including a golden statue, causing Seiran to nickname him \\"\\". He is prone to thoughtlessly saying whatever is on his mind and regarded as a fool, despite being highly perceptive and critical. Because he does not like putting effort into anything, Suoh is both intrigued and annoyed by Sh≈´rei's continual determination to do her best. However, Tan-tan can clearly perceive a situation's complete context or a person's true character, and he tries to lessen Sh≈´rei's naivet√© by showing her the evils of the world. Seiran considers Tan-tan to be a practical influence on Sh≈´rei and is unusually willing to engage him in conversation. Nevertheless, Seiran also likes to pelt Suou with bamboo shoots and make him pay for random purchases, calling him \\"saifu #2\\" (wallet #2). Suou is notably one of the few people who are neither blinded by admiration or love for Sh≈´rei, nor heavily connected to politics, thus he is able to see situations more objectively than others at times. Tan- tan is roped into the counterfeit paintings investigation by Sh≈´rei and ends up arresting his father, who was used in a larger plot. He saves Sh≈´rei from being fired when Seiga Riku steals her research proposal. Since then, Tan-tan has followed Sh≈´rei and re-entered the Inspector General as her assistant. Though he is not as intelligent as Sh≈´rei or Seiga, he is ironically the first of the three to be promoted and later enjoys great fame as one of the most successful officials in the censorate. Seiga Riku is the undersecretary of Censorate, known as the \\"Official Killer\\" for his ruthless persecution of officials. He first appears during Sh≈´rei and Su≈ç's investigation of counterfeit currency and artwork, posing as an official looking for a position in order to join Sh≈´rei and Su≈ç's investigation. In truth, he was actually sent to monitor and report on Sh≈´rei's actions. Seiga is an ambitious and cynical man who does not think highly of Sh≈´rei, particularly because of her idealistic outlook towards working for the government, and he often harasses her. A promising and confident official, he is known for his willingness to sacrifice others to achieve his goals, much to Sh≈´rei's displeasure. However, Sh≈´rei looks to him as a senior during her time as a censorate official and regards him as a rival in hopes of winning his approval through her own efforts, a relationship that Seiga reluctantly reciprocates. Seiga is later responsible for dealing with accusations that lead to Reishin and K≈çy≈´ losing their positions in the Department of Civil Administration. Kouki Ki is the head of the Governmental Inspection Department, which serves as the Censorate for the government. He is a senior official in the government, having entered the government because of his lineage rather than through the imperial examinations. Kouki is also a survivor of the Ki family, a minor noble family that was wiped out during Emperor Senka's purge. Ruthlessly strict, he considers Sh≈´rei a complete idiot because of her na√Øvet√© and forces her to reflect on her idealist approach to government, which helps her better navigate through muddy court politics. He does not hesitate to get rid of people who fail to meet his standards and it is said that while the officials in the censorate possess a low rank, they are highly respected for enduring the difficult work that Kouki forces them through. Shuu You is a senior official and an investigator in the Department of Civil Administration, therefore one of Reishin's subordinates. Due to the nature of his work, he often needs to go undercover and is skilled at disguising himself. He does not defer to any superiors who have not earned his respect, thus he is highly confrontational with Reishin, who is capable but unwilling to work and use his talents for the greater good. Though he had hope for K≈çy≈´ and became his mentor when K≈çy≈´ began as an official, Shou You became disillusioned when it became clear that K≈çy≈´ ended up limiting himself to working for Reishin. As a result, he does not hesitate to persecute K≈çy≈´ when he does not fulfill the duty of an official, despite being personally fond of K≈çy≈´. Yuuri Kei is the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Finance, having worked under Kijin Ko for a long time. He knows Kijin's true name and is one of the few who knows what he looks like. He is also a contemporary of Reishin and Yuushun, and failed the examination to become an official during the year that Kijin had taken the exam, though Yuuri eventually got used to seeing Kijin's face and managed to pass the exam the next year. Ki Ou is the chief secretary of the Department of Royal Commandment Affairs, known for often criticises Ry≈´ki's policies. Unlike officials who entered government service through the imperial examinations, Ki Ou obtained his position through his lineage. His lectures to the emperor on what it means to be a ruler tend to be both gentle and scathing. Unknown to Ry≈´ki, Ki Ou is a survivor of a purge ordered by Emperor Senka to eliminate all blood related descendants of Saiunkoku's first emperor, Gen S≈ç, and has also taken in other survivors of the purge. As a result, he is a candidate for the throne and wants to dispose Ry≈´ki for a more capable ruler. Anju Ryo is the vice-secretary of department of Royal Commandment Affairs. He is a childhood friend of K≈çki Ki and also became an official through his noble lineage rather than through the examinations. Though he numbers among the officials who would prefer to see Ki Ou on the throne, he tends to remain neutral between officials who gained their positions through their lineage and those who became officials through the imperial examinations. Anju's origins are unknown, save that he was adopted by a noble family that was later exterminated under Emperor Senka's purge. Unbeknownst to Sh≈´rei, she actually met him when she was ten-years-old and working at the Kogarou, where Koch≈ç had taken him as a lover. Thus, Anju expresses great interest towards Sh≈´rei, sometimes giving her pieces of vital information. His favourite fruit is the peach, though K≈çki warns Sh≈´rei against accepting peaches as gifts from Anju because they supposedly bring disaster. Sa Province inhabitants and officials Ensei R≈ç  makes his first appearance as a half-starved man lying in front of Sh≈´rei's estate. Seiran somewhat dislikes him because of their shared past in the Satsujinzoku gang in Sa province, when Ensei earned the nickname of \\"Little rascal King\\" for his prowess in using a pole or staff as a weapon, although Ensei's true specialty is close-range unarmed combat. He has a cross-shaped scar under his left eye and initially sports a bushy beard which irritates Sh≈´rei and makes many people describe him as a bear, which finally convinces him to shave it off and remain clean-shaven. Ensei was formerly the governor of Sa province. Before his term, officials in Sa province were often assassinated or bribed, reducing the quality of candidates willing to accept those positions. In an unprecedented move, Enjun Sa-Taiho announced that whoever could turn the tables on an assassin would be made provincial governor. Ensei was appointed as temporary governor at age 17 and was able to competently foil assassination attempts as well as maintain order. The death of Enjun, Ensei's primary political backer, reduces the acceptance of Ensei as the legitimate governor. To ward off political upheaval, Ensei leaves to determine the new Emperor's political personality and to request a new governor to replace him. On his journey, he is targeted by thieves and assassins because of the high bounty placed on his head by the Sa family. After Sh≈´rei's term as governor of Sa province is suspended, Ensei continues to help her out because he admires her, though he does not intend to let Sh≈´rei know about his feelings towards her. Eigetsu/Y≈çgetsu T≈ç is a shy, intelligent thirteen-year-old boy. He was born in Seika village, Koku province, but the rest of the village was wiped out by plague; he was raised by a doctor, Doshu, who found him as a child on the brink of death. After Eigetsu passed the Provincial Exams at the age of twelve, their entire community contributed money to send him to take the Imperial Exams. He turns up in Kougaro, Koch≈ç's pleasure house, with no memory of how he got there and without his valuable Exam Token. Eigetsu does not like to consume alcohol or even smell it, because it literally turns him into another person: , who is brash, arrogant, and an excellent fighter. In contrast to Eigetsu's gentle manner and academic inclinations, Y≈çgetsu's intelligence leans towards being calculating and strategic. When Eigetsu first arrives in the capital, Yougetsu takes over; after winning a drinking contest in the Red Light District, he beats up three gang members, steals their money, and spends most of it on premium sake. Although he often refers to Eigetsu as a dim-witted fool, he also looks out for him. Thinking that Eigetsu might lose the Exam Token in all the commotion, he gives it for safekeeping to the sake merchant and tells him to deliver it with the expensive sake to the best brothel in the city. Before passing out, Yougetsu also tells Sh≈´ei Ran to take him to the same destination, which is how Eigetsu ended up in Kogaro. During the examinations, Eigetsu befriends Sh≈´rei and becomes the youngest person in history to win the position of Jougen (top score for the year), beating the previous record set by K≈çy≈´ Ri. Initially, he is deluged by proposals by ambitious officials who want him to marry their daughters, but he refuses them all and they turn against him as he starts his career, assigning him petty duties like shining their shoes and then \\"accidentally\\" kicking him. When Ry≈´ki appoints him and Sh≈´rei as the new governors of Sa province, Eigetsu is again the youngest person to ever win that position, as well as one of the first set of co-governors to share such an office. When they enter the province, Eigetsu is captured by the Satsujinzoku along with K≈çrin, who is pretending to be Sh≈´rei. Eventually they are saved by Seiran, Ensei, and Ry≈´ren (as well as Yogetsu) and finally reunite with Sh≈´rei in the provincial capital. The anime's second season reveals that Yougetsu is actually another one of the Eight Sages, Byakuya (the Sage of Haku, the White Immortal). When Doshuu found Eigetsu, Yougetsu saved the child's life by strengthening his dying soul and granting him twenty more years of life, but after that, Eigetsu himself would die and Yougetsu would live on in his body. Later, Dosh≈´ became gravely ill, so that Eigetsu willingly surrendered ten of those years to Yougetsu in order to extend his foster-father's life. When Eigetsu has only one month left to live, Sa province is plagued by an epidemic which he recognizes as the same disease that wiped out his native village. He tells K≈çrin about his imminent fate and confessed his feelings to her, then sets out by himself to the affected area in the hope of directly helping some people before his death. But when Eigetsu's life is due to end, Yougetsu decides to go into a deep sleep to let Eigetsu keep living. Though Eigetsu has a great part in handling the unrest in Sa province, his actions are considered reckless by the central government. He is demoted and is made the assistant to Y≈´ Kai, the new governor of Sa province and the former governor of Koku province. But instead of a punishment, this is like promising him a prosperous future as an official in years to come. Y≈´ Kai is the Governor of Koku province and a renowned ladies' man. He is said to be the oldest man to ever hold the position of governor in Saiunkoku. He asked the previous Emperor to appoint him as the governors of both Koku and Sa provinces, but was refused because of his old age. Kai was the guardian of Eigetsu when he applied for the ministerial exams, and passed Shin Ka's medical documents on to Sh≈´rei. When Sh≈´rei and Eigetsu are appointed as the co-governors of Sa province, they ask Kai to succeed them as governor in the event of their deaths. When they are dismissed from those positions, he does succeed them and gives up Koku province to govern Sa province and become Eigetsu's mentor. Meish≈ç is the leader of the Satsujinzoku, the Killing-Blade Outlaws, which is supported by Sakujun Sa. He takes advantage of the instability of Sa Province and gains control of certain major cities, working with Ch≈´sh≈ç Sa and the Sa clan. Though he works with them, Meish≈ç conceals Sakujun's involvement, allowing S≈çjun to believe that the Satsujinzoku answers to Ch≈´sh≈ç. Meish≈ç has a past with both Seiran and Ensei, but does not know that both of them were involved in wiping out the Satsujinzoku over a decade ago. In the end, he loses his life to Seiran in battle. Sh≈çrin and Y≈çshun (Sh≈çrin) (Y≈çshun) is the leader of a group in Sa province called the Condors. He and his younger brother are entrusted by Ensei to look after Shunki. Their father incurred a great debt of gratitude from Sh≈çka Hong in their past. Though only thirteen, Sh≈çrin is quite skilled as a tracker, with acrobatic skills and good endurance. At Shunki's request, he takes her to Kinka in order to help Kokujun. Sh≈ç Sai is the head of the merchant guild in Kinka, second largest city in Sa province. He decides to help the new governors of Sa, Sh≈´rei and Eigetsu, in exchange for peace within the province. He is the younger twin of Rin Sai. Though his father is the head of the military of Kinka, he and his sister opt for the merchant life instead. He repeatedly promotes the idea of using eight-tenths of his power to help, saving two- tenths for emergencies. Shin Sai is the military commander of the city of Kinka in Sa Province, though he is mistaken by Sh≈´rei for the head of the merchant guild when they first meet. He is the father of the twins Sho and Rin Sai, and was angered when the two chose to pursue the merchant's path. Rin Sai is Sho's twin sister, and renowned as the \\"manliest woman in Sa province.\\" When first encountered, she is the head of the Merchant Guild in Koren. After her term of guild leadership expires, she becomes an inventor. When Sh≈´rei calls doctors to treat the disease in Sa province, Rin designs a smooth knife suited to surgical operations; Rin later designs a centrifuge- like device to separate out sand from adulterated salt. She fell in love with Y≈´shun Tei when he was still Ensei's assistant and repeatedly proposed to Y≈´shun on the Autumn Festival (an event similar to Valentine's Day, when girls give handmade gifts to someone they like). For years, Y≈´shun had always rejected her. When the Sa conflict ends, Rin announces her last attempt to propose to Y≈´shun: if he rejected her again, she would give up and wish for his happiness when he returned to Shi province. When Rin approaches Y≈´shun, he seems to be asleep, so Rin just gives her gift, wishes for his happiness. However, when she turns to leave, Y≈´shun suddenly grabs her wrist. They are described as newlyweds when they go to Shi province for the New Year's celebrations. Miscellaneous D≈çshu is a kind doctor who found and saved Eigetsu in Koku Province, later becoming his adopted father and mentor. His real name is , revealed in episode 6 of the second season. It was thanks to his previous research that the epidemic in season 2 was solved. He treated both Eigetsu and Yougetsu as his beloved children, even though Yogetsu was much older than Ka Shin and therefore very irritated by this. He taught Eigetsu to smile and live life to the fullest, and also passed on his medical knowledge to Sh≈´rei before he died. Dr. Y≈ç is a doctor who took care of Sh≈´rei when she was young and sickly. While he lives outside the capital, his medical expertise is renowned and his old friend Advisor Sho calls him to the capital to consult about the plague in Sa province. Dr. Y≈ç teaches the imperial doctors how to surgically remove the worms that cause the disease. Later, he is revealed as another of the Eight Sages (the Sage of Ko, Yellow Immortal). Like Advisor Sho, he looks much younger in his sage form. Jin Shiba , known also as , is a prisoner on death row for patricide and is Jyusan-hime's ex-fianc√©. Jin is one of the many assassins sent after her and Sh≈´rei Hong after he was released from prison and being pardoned by the three oldest Ran brothers. He is from the Shiba clan, a subsidiary clan of the Ran clan. He was a childhood friend of Sh≈´ei Ran and Jy≈´san-hime Ran and the one who gave Jy≈´san-hime the nickname \\"Hotaru\\". He met Jy≈´san-hime when he was eleven years old, shortly after Jy≈´san-hime's mother was murdered by his own father. Jin had been sent to the house to kill her but could not bring himself to do so. Jy≈´san-hime, who had been three years old, sat by her mother's corpse and stared at Jin for three days and nights. When she finally told him to come closer to her, he cut out his eye and gave it to her as a symbol of trust. After the incident in Ran Province, he winds up wandering the countryside with Shusui.

It was directed by Stephen Williams and written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. It first aired on ABC in the United States on October 25, 2006. The character of Sawyer (Josh Holloway) is featured in the episode's flashbacks; on the island, his rebellious attitude causes Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) and the Others to conjure a plan to keep him in check. \\"Every Man for Himself\\" was intended to show how Ben was a character that could manipulate even the best confidence man on the island, and if Sawyer could care for another person, as Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) is making her attempts to escape captivity. When the episode first aired, it was watched by 17.09 million American viewers. Reviews were polarized; some critics praised the writing and the cliffhanger ending, while others deemed the episode repetitive and the \\"outright stinker\\" of season 3's early episodes. Plot Flashbacks Sawyer is in prison, trying to befriend Munson (Ian Gomez), a man who has hidden ten million dollars. He warns Munson that the warden (Bill Duke) is trying to con him out of his money. Eventually, Munson, worried that his wife will find where he has hidden the money, enlists Sawyer's help in moving the stash. Sawyer then reveals this information to the warden in exchange for a reduced sentence and a part of the money, which he puts in a bank account for Clementine Phillips, a baby that previous con victim Cassidy Phillips (Kim Dickens) has told him is his daughter. The warden sarcastically congratulates Sawyer on lying and cheating his way out of prison. At Hydra Island As Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Sawyer watch, the Others carry a critically injured Colleen (Paula Malcomson), who was shot by Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) the night before. Sawyer realizes that the injury was inflicted by someone back at camp, and then devises a plan to break out from the cage; he intends to electrocute an off-guard Danny Pickett (Michael Bowen) using a puddle he created outside his cage. However, Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) overhears him via surveillance and switches off the electricity prior to visiting him. When Sawyer attempts to carry out his plan, Ben knocks him unconscious and has him carried into the Hydra station. Sawyer wakes up to find himself strapped to a table, where Ben, Tom (M. C. Gainey) and two other Others watch over him. Sawyer is gagged before having a large hypodermic needle inserted into his chest. When Sawyer awakens, Ben and Tom come in, Tom carrying a rabbit in a cage; he shakes the cage vigorously, causing the rabbit to suddenly collapse, presumably dead. Ben informs Sawyer that they fitted him, like the rabbit, with a modified pacemaker; should his heart rate reach 140, his heart would explode. Ben threatens to implant one in Kate if Sawyer should tell her of his ordeal. Meanwhile, Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) begs Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) to help operate on Colleen. Upon arriving at the operating theatre, Jack notices some x-rays, but Juliet informs him that they are not Colleen's. During the surgery, Jack tries to save Colleen, but she eventually dies. Later, Jack informs Juliet that there was nothing they could do with Colleen, and then asks about the x-rays, which Jack knows belong to a 40-year- old man with a very large spinal tumor, and asks whom he is there to save. Danny, aware that the Oceanic Flight 815 survivors are responsible, takes his anger out on Sawyer by violently beating him; Sawyer refrains from fighting back. Kate pleads with him to stop; Danny ceases only after Kate admits to loving Sawyer. Afterwards, Kate notices a gap in her cage, and manages to climb through. She tries to free Sawyer, but he bitterly refuses, remembering Karl's escape and bloody capture. Kate returns to her cage, insisting that she would not abandon him, and tells Sawyer that she lied about loving him so that Danny would stop. The next day, Ben takes Sawyer for a walk to high ground. Sawyer learns that he has no pacemaker; it was merely a con to prevent Sawyer from leaving, and Ben shows him the same rabbit from the day before, which had been merely sedated. Ben reveals to Sawyer that they are on a completely different island approximately twice the size of Alcatraz that overlooks the main island; escape is impossible. Upon asking why he was conned, Ben tells Sawyer that in order to gain a con artist's respect, they must be conned themselves. At the beach Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) offers to fix Claire Littleton's (Emilie de Ravin) roof, but takes it back after Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) offers to do this himself. Desmond then uses one of Paulo's (Rodrigo Santoro) golf clubs to build a lightning rod next to Claire's hut. As a storm brews, waking up Aaron, then lightning strikes the golf club instead of Claire's hut, Charlie looks on in amazement, as, again, Desmond seemed to have had a glimpse of the future. Production Leading up to the episode's broadcast, showrunner Damon Lindelof asked in an interview, \\"Until now, Sawyer's been the No. 1 con man on the island. What happens when he meets his match?\\" Fellow showrunner Carlton Cuse added \\"Is he willing to put himself out there emotionally for another human being?\\". Evangeline Lilly described the scene where Kate declines to escape as a major moment to the character, saying that \\"due to this hillbilly she's capable of returning to her cage.\\" Josh Holloway agreed, declaring that the episode revealed to Sawyer that \\"not everyone is evil\\". The flashbacks were shot in an actual penitentiary, the Halawa Correctional Facility, which had been previously used for the prison where Desmond was incarcerated in \\"Live Together, Die Alone\\". While some of the interns were portrayed by extras with soy ink tattoos, bikers with actual body paint were also used. Referring to the scene in which Ben seemingly fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Michael Emerson comments > Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. > He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like > everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in > a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day > if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of > science.Weightman, Stuart (January 2007). Actor Michael Emerson ‚Äì It's a > Small World, TV Zone Special 74. pp. 92‚Äì97. Retrieved on November 13, 2008. He also described the events as a demonstration that \\"Ben has more cards than you think; ... he's a step or two ahead, one layer or two deeper than anyone else who is playing the game\\". The rabbit was a reference to Stephen King's On Writing, where King uses a rabbit in a cage with the number 8 written on its back as an example for the connection between reader and writer. Emerson said that part of the appeal of the scene was that \\"bunnies look so innocent, and the audience feels so tenderly about them you can feel nothing but beastly being mean to them\\". But Emerson added the rabbit in the scene had problems reacting to his attempts to scare him - \\"it was unfazed, it barely blinked\\". When asked in an interview whether she got sick of shooting on the Hydra holding cell set, Elizabeth Mitchell responded > I guess so. It was creepy because it was supposed to be underwater, so it > was a little bit dingy but kind of great at the same time ... what I will > miss is just being one on one with another actor. And then also one on two > obviously when it was Michael [Emerson] because the three of us, it was > almost like being on stage. We were able to really work off of each other > and I thought you don't usually get that in a TV show. Reception This episode attracted 17.087 million American viewers, standing as the seventh most watched program of the week. IGN's Chris Carabott said that \\"now that Lost has finally wrapped up most of the loose ends from season two, the episode can shift focus to this season's mysteries.\\" He also felt the episode \\"offers a healthy mix of plot and character development with a fair share of revelations thrown in for good measure.\\" Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly declared herself \\"sold on the adrenaline-rush direction the show has taken\\", with praise to the flashbacks and the cliffhanger involving the reveal of the second island. Lost critic Andrew Dignan described \\"Every Man for Himself\\" as \\"quite the exhilarating episode, packing in enough thrills to make the 42-minutes fly by\\" in Slant Magazine. Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it considered \\"watching the con man get conned was brutally satisfying\\", saying that Sawyer \\"[ran] the whole gamut of emotions\\", and felt Colleen's death and the reveal of Ben's tumor \\"were good things, as people were already impatient by the glacial-like pace of Season 3.\\" Writing for AOL TV, Jonathan Toomey considered \\"Every Man for Himself\\" as \\"an interesting episode\\" which set up many new elements, and while Toomey called the flashback \\"a little dry and 100% predictable\\", he liked how it related to the other events in the story \\"right up to the title\\". Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com praised the episode for returning to the mythology, as he considered the previous episode lacked \\"the slack-jawed wonder I'm so accustomed to experiencing with this show\\".Slocum, Mac, (October 26, 2006) \\"Key Points from \\"Every Man for Himself\\": Lost Blog\\", FilmFodder.com. Retrieved on September 10, 2011. Daniel MacEachern of Television Without Pity gave the episode a grade of B-. IGN ranked \\"Every Man for Himself\\" 70th out of all episodes of Lost, saying that it \\"offered plenty of food for thought.\\" On the other hand, a similar list by Los Angeles Times ranked the episode as the tenth worst of the series, describing it as the \\"only outright stinker\\" of early season 3. Alan Sepinwall heavily criticized the episode for the repetitive and uninteresting storyline with the Others, though he praised Emerson's performance as Ben. Michael Emerson and Josh Holloway submitted this episode for consideration on their own behalf respectively in the category of \\"Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series\\" at the 2007 Emmy Awards, but neither was nominated.Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, (July 19, 2007) \\"Primetime Emmy Awards Complete Nominations List\\".

He was also the petitioner in a U.S. Supreme Court case that set a major precedent for perjury prosecutions when it overturned his conviction.  Biography  Bronston was born in Kishinev, Bessarabia, Russian Empire (present day Moldova) and educated at the Sorbonne. He worked for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's French unit in Paris before setting up as an independent film producer by the 1940s. Early films Bronston produced two films for Columbia Pictures The Adventures of Martin Eden (1942) and City Without Men (1943). His first film for his new production company, Samuel Bronston Productions, was Jack London, (1943) for United Artists followed by City Without Men (1943), and Jack London (1943). He was to produce A Walk in the Sun, but when United Artists ceased funding of the film so as not to compete with The Story of G.I. Joe, the property was taken over by Lewis Milestone with the film released by 20th Century Fox pp. 16-17 Rubin, Steven Jay Combat Films: American Realism, 1945-2010, 2d ed. McFarland, 25 Jul 2011. Bronston later successfully won a settlement for a percentage of rights to the film. Epics He was a pioneer in the practice of locating epic-scale productions in Spain to reduce the massive costs involved and using frozen funds. He had success with his series of epic films: John Paul Jones (1959), King of Kings (1961), El Cid (1961), 55 Days at Peking (1963) and The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964). In 1962, he was awarded a Special Merit Golden Globe Award for El Cid that inspired him to help build gigantic studios in Las Rozas near Madrid. Bronston frequently worked with a regular team of creative artists: the director Anthony Mann, the screenwriters Philip Yordan and Jesse Lasky Jr., the composer Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa, the co-producers Jaime Prades, Alan Brown and Micha≈Ç Waszy≈Ñski, the cinematographer Robert Krasker and film editor Robert Lawrence. He also favoured Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren as his leading actors.  Accusations of corruption and last years  The cost of the construction of the film studios and the box-office failure of his last epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire combined to leave Bronston in financial difficulties and, in 1964, he had to stop all business activities. Samuel Bronston Productions filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 5, 1964 stating he owed a debt of $5,647,758 to his creditor Pierre S. du Pont. His company declared bankruptcy in June of that year. A petition in August 1964 stated Bronston Distributors, Inc. (a separate company) owed Paramount $6,750,000 and Pierre S. Du Point $323,191. Two years later, he was asked under oath by a lawyer for one of his creditors a series of questions about the many bank accounts the company had had in Europe. One of them concerned whether he had had an account in Switzerland. \\"The company had an account in Z√ºrich for six months\\", he replied, and answered all other questions concerning Swiss bank accounts in the negative. Later, it was discovered that he had indeed had a very active personal bank account in Geneva during the years he had been producing films in Europe. He was convicted of perjury by federal prosecutors who argued that his answer, while truthful in and of itself, was intended to mislead or evade. After the appeals court upheld the conviction, Bronston v. United States reached the Supreme Court, which overturned the conviction on January 10, 1973. Its ruling, that literally truthful yet technically misleading answers cannot be prosecuted as perjury, has formed an important part of jurisprudence on the matter ever since, even being invoked by President Bill Clinton's attorneys when he was charged with perjury during his impeachment. The bankruptcy and criminal prosecution devastated his film career. He had completed the 1964 Circus World with John Wayne just before the bankruptcy, and after that he made only three films: Savage Pampas (1966), filmed in Spain with Robert Taylor; Dr. Coppelius (1966); and Fort Saganne (1984), a French film with G√©rard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve. A planned epic on the life of Isabella of Spain never materialized. Bronston died in 1994 of pneumonia secondary to Alzheimer's disease at Mercy Hospital in Sacramento, California. He is buried in Las Rozas, Madrid, Spain. He was survived by five children: Dr William Bronston, Irene Bronston, Andrea Bronston, Philip Bronston and Kira Bronston.

He was one of the six officers of the latter expedition, and was an artillery expert with the rank of lieutenant. The Voulet-Chanoine Mission was commanded by the captains Paul Voulet and Julien Chanoine, entrusted in 1898 by the government with the mission to explore and conquer the territories between the Niger River and Lake Chad, with the ultimate goal to unify, Jointly with other two similar expeditions, all French territories in West Africa. The brutalities and massacres committed by the expedition after leaving Senegal brought the authorities to replace Voulet and Chanoine with Lieutenant Colonel Klobb; the latter was killed close to Zinder by Voulet on 14 July 1899, and shortly after Voulet and Chanoine were killed by their troops, that recognized as commander Joalland, who was promoted to the rank of Captain. Joalland left Zinder on 3 October, reaching, with 170 riflemen, Lake Chad; hearing later that the Foureau-Lamy Mission, advancing from the Sahara, was close, he went up the east side of the lake, and met it on February. The two joint missions, under the command of Major Lamy of the Saharian Mission, now returned south to Joalland's base camp on the right bank of the Chari River. On 21 April 1900 Joalland and Lamy encountered the Gentil Mission, that had been proceeding from the Congo River. The following day all the French forces united clashed with the greatest ruler in the region, Rabih az-Zubayr; the French triumphed, guaranteeing the conquest of the Chad Basin. Before the end of the year, Joalland returned with his men back home, after having successfully completed the mission. In 1927 Joalland was given the honorary title of commander of the L√©gion d'honneur, the premier distinction in France. Two years later he was nominated Brigadier General of colonial troops.

Cayton Sr. was the publisher of the newspapers The Seattle Republican (1894-1913) and Cayton's Weekly (1916-1921). Horace Roscoe Cayton Sr. (1859‚Äì1940) was an American journalist and political activist. The son of a slave and a white plantation owner's daughter, Cayton went to Seattle, Washington, in the early 1890s, launching his own newspaper, the Seattle Republican, in 1894. The paper was the longest-lived of seven African-American newspapers appearing in Seattle between 1891 and 1901, terminating only in 1913. A second publishing venture was launched by Cayton in 1916, with the launch of the eponymous Cayton's Weekly. Unlike its predecessor, this four- page tabloid was focused upon national and local news of interest to a black readership. Falling into financial difficulties in 1921, Cayton's Weekly briefly altered its production cycle to become Cayton's Monthly before folding completely. Biography Early years Horace was born in 1859 on a plantation in Mississippi. After Emancipation, he and his family moved to a farm near Port Gibson, Mississippi. He graduated from Alcorn College (now Alcorn State University) and was attending that institution in 1872. Newspaper publisher Cayton's second publication was the four page Cayton's Weekly, produced from 1916 until 1921. He headed west, convinced that his education and will to succeed would help him reach his real potential, and ended up in Seattle where he worked as a political reporter for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Horace found employment at the Seattle Standard, the city‚Äôs first newspaper for African Americans, working at that paper until Its failure in 1893. The following year, Cayton launched a newspaper of his own, the Seattle Republican, with its first issue seeing print in May 1894. The paper sought to appeal to both white and black readers, achieving some limited success in this regard, although the readership of the paper was modest, never exceeding about 2,000.\\"About the Seattle Republican (19??-1915).\\" Chronicling America, Library of Congress, www.hroniclingamerica.loc.gov/ By 1896, Cayton married Susie Revels, a young woman he had met in college. Ms. Revels was the daughter of Senator Hiram Rhodes Revels, a Reconstruction-era Republican from the state of Mississippi remembered as the first African-American elected to the United States Senate. After the couple's marriage, Susie Revels Cayton would become associate editor of the Seattle Republican. Cayton's Republican criticized the corruption of the Yukon Gold Rush-era administration of mayor Thomas J. Humes and, in particular, his police chief William L. Meredith, who proceeded to have Cayton arrested for criminal libel. He was acquitted. The resulting controversy was a factor in escalating scandal that led Meredith to resign and to attempt to gun down another of his accusers, John Considine. Considine ultimately shot Meredith in self-defense. The Republican Party attracted many black people and Horace was able to win an important position in the party. He was a recurrent delegate to the county and state nominating conventions, secretary of the party‚Äôs King County convention in 1902, and for many years a member of the Republican State Central Committee. In Seattle, between 1900 and 1910, the number of blacks had risen by almost 2,000 people causing white prejudice to grow. Politically Horace lost power and after 1910 he never sat on the Republican State Central Committee or attended a Republican convention again. Horace became a victim of Seattle‚Äôs changing racial and political pattern. On May 2, 1913, the Seattle Republican ceased operations after Horace lost a court case where he sued a restaurant for telling him not to return after they had served him.Oakland Tribune, (Oakland, California) 04 May 1913, Sun ‚Ä¢ Page 23 He continued his career in publishing and issued Cayton‚Äôs Weekly from 1916 followed by \\"Cayton's Monthly\\" until 1921 when he retired. Later years He sold his home on Capitol Hill and moved to an apartment house, which he owned and produced income. They lost two houses and the apartment building during the depression, but continued to live in the house paying $10 per month rent. Susie Cayton in manuscript collection 031, the Washington Pioneer Project, Washington State Library. Horace and his wife entered into activities of the ever-growing black community. They participated in many social and civic events. He continued his affiliation with the Republican Party through membership in the King County Colored Republican Club. Death and legacy Horace died in 1940 and was followed by Susie in 1943. Horace's son Horace R. Cayton Jr. (1903‚Äì1970) became an educator, researcher, government official, newspaper columnist, and famous sociologist, notable for his anthropological work Black Metropolis, which he co-authored with St. Clair Drake. Lisa S. Weitzman says on Answers.com: \\"With the purpose of educating white America, the book further exposed and explained African American conduct, personality, and culture which emerged from the conditions imposed by the white world. Ultimately, Cayton and Drake concluded their book with a call for the government to work more aggressively to help African Americans achieve equality. Like his father, Cayton expressed an ongoing concern for racial equality and civil rights, a theme to which he repeatedly returned in his regular column for the Pittsburgh Courier.\\"Lisa S. Weitzman, \\"Horace Cayton\\", Answers.com at www.answers.com Another son, Revels Cayton, became a labor leader and deputy mayor of San Francisco. Daughter Madge Cayton, like her brother Horace, earned a degree from the University of Washington, in her case a business degree. Another daughter, Lillie Cayton, was a social activist in Seattle and later in San Diego, California. References Other sources consulted * Horace Cayton, Jr. Long Old Road: An Autobiography.

The anchor paper provides an example to the person reviewing or grading the assignment of a well-written response to the essay prompt. Sometimes examiners prepare a range of anchor papers, to provide examples of responses at different levels of merit.  Purpose of Anchor Papers  Anchor papers are frequently used in standards based assessment, authentic assessment and holistic grading, where essay prompts are more common. They are especially used when grading essay responses on a mass scale, such as by graders working for the College Board.College Board Typically, any particular grading project only employs a few anchor papers. Educators have commented that matching the diversity of responses against one or two papers is often difficult, resulting in inconsistencies among graders working on the same project. A report by experts from Arizona State University stated that guidelines for scoring are adopted for quality assessment of writing samples meant for the preparation of performance evaluation. Anchor papers stand for scoring points defined in the directions. At Tennessee, the State‚Äôs education department formulated writing policies for (2017-2018) coring student responses from the writing section of the TN Ready Assessment. The Department provided guidelines, so educators can train students for the Assessment‚Äôs writing category even if these policies were not prepared for use as instructional resources.

It is a non-profit project started at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School that grew out of an international bloggers' meeting held in December 2004. The organization was founded by Ethan Zuckerman and Rebecca MacKinnon. In 2008, it became an independent non-profit incorporated in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Objectives When Global Voices was formed, Its objectives were: first, to enable and empower a community of \\"bridge bloggers\\" who \\"can make a bridge between two languages, or two cultures.\\" Second to develop tools and resources to make achieving the first objective more effective. It has maintained a working relationship with mainstream media. Reuters, for example, gave Global Voices unrestricted grants from 2006 to 2008. For its contribution to innovation in journalism, Global Voices was granted the 2006 Knight-Batten Grand Prize. Global Voices was also recognized in 2009 with the University of Denver's Anvil of Freedom award for contributions to journalism and democracy. The organization now states its goals as to: *\\"Call attention to the most interesting conversations and perspectives emerging from citizens‚Äô media around the world by linking to text, photos, podcasts, video and other forms of grassroots citizens‚Äô media.\\" *\\"Facilitate the emergence of new citizens‚Äô voices through training, online tutorials, and publicizing the ways in which open-source and free tools can be used safely by people around the world\\". *\\"Advocate for freedom of expression ... and protect the rights of citizen journalists\\". Global Voices has a team of regional editors that aggregates and selects conversations from a variety of blogospheres, with a particular focus on non-Western and underrepresented voices. Contributors are volunteers. Projects Several projects have grown to become successful websites of their own with distinct communities. Global Voices Advocacy Global Voices Advox (formerly Advocacy) is an international network of bloggers and activists who fight for online free speech and track threats against \\"netizens\\". Advox were among the first to recognize arrests and killings of bloggers (starting in 2007) and were instrumental in helping to shift the focus of international media rights organizations to include online writers. Rising Voices Rising Voices seeks to empower under-represented communities to make their voices heard online by providing micro-grants to new projects; developing a series of participatory media tutorials; and cultivating a network of passionate citizen media activists. The first round of micro-grants were awarded in 2007 following a grant from Knight News Challenge Award. Global Voices Lingua Volunteers who wished to translate Global Voiced content from English into other languages formed Project Lingua in 2007. Since then, translation has become central to Global Voices. There are tens of translation sites existing in Lingua. RuNet Echo RuNet Echo‚Äôs main purpose is to expand and deepen understanding of the Russian Internet (RuNet) and related online communities. Past projects Technology for Transparency Network The Technology for Transparency Network was a participatory research and mapping project to gain a better understanding of the current state of online technology projects that increase transparency, government accountability, and civic engagement in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia, China, and Central & Eastern Europe. The project is co-funded by Open Society Institute's Information Program and Omidyar Network's Media, Markets & Transparency initiative, and aims to inform both programs' future investments toward transparency, accountability, and civic engagement technology projects. Voices without Votes During the United States presidential election of 2008 Global Voices was commissioned by Reuters to create a website, Voices without Votes, to track global online conversation about US politics and foreign policy. Amira al Hussaini was editor of the website, and Global Voices authors and editors all contributed in the 8 months leading up to Barack Obama's inauguration in January 2009. The Witness Hub From 2006-2007, Global Voices and human rights video organization WITNESS collaborated on a pilot project to monitor human rights citizen videos from around the world. The effort was led by Sameer Padania, and won Best New Media Project at the One World Media Awards in 2007. WITNESS developed The Hub as central part of their own website in 2008, launching a community forum where people can upload human rights videos themselves. The Hub was itself archived in 2010, and in collaboration with YouTube and social media curation site Storyful, Witness launched a YouTube Human Rights Channel in May 2012.

The weight is two and a quarter ounces with the propeller and large fuel tank, but without fuel. The same Cox Golden Bee 0.049 assembled. The left rotating propeller and horizontal cylinder contribute to keeping the control lines tight. A model engine is a small internal combustion engine typically used to power a radio-controlled aircraft, radio-controlled car, radio-controlled boat, free flight, control line aircraft, or ground-running tether car model. Because of the square-cube law, the behaviour of many engines does not always scale up or down at the same rate as the machine's size; usually at best causing a dramatic loss of power or efficiency, and at worst causing them not to work at all. Methanol and nitromethane are common fuels. Overview The fully functional, albeit small, engines vary from the most common single-cylinder two-stroke to the exotic single and multiple- cylinder four-stroke, the latter taking shape in boxer, v-twin, inline and radial form, a few Wankel engine designs are also used. Most model engines run on a blend of methanol, nitromethane, and lubricant (either castor or synthetic oil). Two-stroke model engines, most often designed since 1970 with Schnuerle porting for best performance, range in typical size from .12 cubic inches (2 cubic centimeters) to 1.2 ci (19.6 cc) and generate between .5 horsepower (370 watts) to 5 hp (3.7 kW), can get as small as .010 ci (.16 cc) and as large as 3-4 ci (49‚Äì66 cc). Four-stroke model engines have been made in sizes as small as 0.20 in3 (3.3 cc) for the smallest single-cylinder models, all the way up to 3.05 in3 (50 cc) for the largest size for single-cylinder units, with twin- and multi-cylinder engines on the market being as small as 10 cc for opposed-cylinder twins, while going somewhat larger in size than 50 cc, and even upwards to well above 200 cc for some model radial engines. While the methanol and nitromethane blended \\"glow fuel\\" engines are the most common, many larger (especially above 15 cc/0.90 ci displacement) model engines, both two-stroke and a growing number of four-stroke examples are spark ignition, and are primarily fueled with gasoline ‚Äî with some examples of both two and four-stroke glow plug-designed methanol aeromodeling engines capable, with aftermarket upgrades, to having battery-powered, electronically controlled spark ignition systems replacing the glow plugs normally used. Model engines refitted in such a manner often run more efficiently on methanol-based glow plug engine fuels, often with the ability to exclude the use of nitromethane altogether in their fuel formulas. This article concerns itself with the methanol engines; gasoline-powered model engines are similar to those built for use in string trimmers, chainsaws, and other yard equipment, unless they happen to be purpose-built for aeromodeling use, being especially true for four-stroke gasoline-fueled model engines. Such engines usually use a fuel that contains a small percentage of motor oil as a two-stroke engine uses for lubrication purposes, as most model four-stroke engines ‚Äî be they glow plug or spark ignition ‚Äî have no built-in reservoir for motor oil in their crankcase or engine block design. The majority of model engines have used, and continue to use, the two-stroke cycle principle to avoid needing valves in the combustion chamber, but a growing number of model engines use the four-stroke cycle design instead. Both reed valve and rotary valve-type two-strokes are common, with four-stroke model engines using either conventional poppet valve, and rotary valve formats for induction and exhaust. The engine shown to the right has its carburetor in the center of the zinc alloy casting to the left. (It uses a flow restriction, like the choke on an old car engine, because the venturi effect is not effective on such a small scale.) The valve reed, cross shaped above its retainer spring, is still beryllium copper alloy, in this old engine. The glow plug is built into the cylinder head. Large production volume makes it possible to use a machined cylinder and an extruded crank case (cut away by hand in the example shown). These Cox Bee reed valve engines are notable for their low cost and ability to survive crashes. The components of the engine shown come from several different engines. Comparison of engines Images of a glowplug engine and a \\"diesel\\" engine are shown below for comparison. The most obvious external difference is seen on top of the cylinder head. The glowplug engine's glow plug has a pinlike terminal for its center contact, which is an electrical connector for the glowplug. The \\"diesel\\" engine has a T-bar which is used for adjusting the compression. The cylindrical object behind the glowplug engine is an exhaust silencer or muffler. File:Taipan 2.5cc 1968 Glowplug model aeroplane engine.jpg|Glowplug engine File:Miniature two-stroke diesel engine 1960.JPG|Diesel engine Glowplug engines Glow plugs are used for starting as well as continuing the power cycle. The glow plug consists of a durable, mostly platinum, helically wound wire filament, within a cylindrical pocket in the plug body, exposed to the combustion chamber. A small direct current voltage (around 1.5 volts) is applied to the glow plug, the engine is then started, and the voltage is removed. The burning of the fuel/air mixture in a glow-plug model engine, which requires methanol for the glow plug to work in the first place, and sometimes with the use of nitromethane for greater power output and steadier idle, occurs due to the catalytic reaction of the methanol vapor to the presence of the platinum in the filament, thus causing the ignition. This keeps the plug's filament glowing hot, and allows it to ignite the next charge. Since the ignition timing is not controlled electrically, as in a spark ignition engine or by fuel injection, as in an ordinary diesel, it must be adjusted by the richness of the mixture, the ratio of nitromethane to methanol, the compression ratio, the cooling of the cylinder head, the type of glow plug, etc. A richer mixture will tend to cool the filament and so retard ignition, slowing the engine, and a rich mixture also eases starting. After starting the engine can easily be leaned (by adjusting a needle valve in the spraybar) to obtain maximum power. Glowplug engines are also known as nitro engines. Nitro engines require a 1.5 volt ignitor to light the glow plug in the heat sink. Once primed, pulling the starter with the ignitor in will start the engine. Diesel engines Diesel engines are an alternative to methanol glow plug engines. These \\"diesels\\" run on a mixture of kerosene, ether, castor oil or vegetable oil, and Amsoil cetane or amyl nitrate booster. Despite their name, their use of compression ignition, and the use of a kerosene fuel that is similar to diesel, model diesels share very little with full-size diesel engines. Full-size diesel engines, such as those found in a truck, are fuel injected and either two-stroke or four-stroke. They use compression ignition to ignite the mixture: the compression within the cylinder heats the inlet charge sufficiently to cause ignition, without requiring an applied ignition source. A fundamental feature of such engines, unlike petrol (gasoline) engines, is that they draw in air alone and the fuel is only mixed by being injected into the combustion chamber separately. Model diesel engines are instead a carbureted two-stroke using the crankcase for compression. The carburetor supplies a mixture of fuel and air into the engine, with the proportions kept fairly constant and their total volume throttled to control the engine power. Apart from sharing the diesel's use of compression ignition, their construction has more in common with a small two-stroke motorcycle or lawnmower engine. In addition to this, model diesels have variable compression ratios. This variable compression is achieved by a \\"contra-piston,\\" at the top of the cylinder, which can be adjusted by a screwed \\"T-bar\\". The swept volume of the engine remains the same, but as the volume of the combustion chamber at top dead centre is changed by adjusting the contra-piston, the compression ratio (swept volume + combustion chamber / combustion chamber) changes accordingly. Model diesels are found to produce more torque than glow engines of the same displacement, and are thought to get better fuel efficiency, because the same power is produced at a lower rpm, and in a smaller displacement engine. However, the specific power may not be significantly superior to a glow engine, due to the heavier construction needed to assure that the engine can withstand the much higher compression ratio, sometimes reaching 30:1. Diesels also run significantly quieter, due to the more rapid combustion, unlike two-stroke glow engines, in which combustion may still be occurring when the exhaust ports are uncovered, causing a significant amount of noise. Recent developments in model engineering have produced true diesel model engines, with a traditional injector and injector pump, and these engines operate in the same way as a large diesel engine.

Historical contributions  Throughout the years, Brei's research has prompted corrections and modifications to The Baseball Encyclopedia, the International League Record Book, the Rochester Red Wings media guide, and the Continental Basketball Association Record Book. He has contributed to the Pro Football Encyclopedia, the PGA Tour Media Guide, the Archives of the Giamatti Research Center at the National Baseball Hall of Fame, the Association for Professional Basketball Research, the American Soccer History Archives, the Canadian Football League Record Book, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, the Rochester Public Library, and the Rochester Museum and Science Center among others. \\"He digs deep for sports nuggets and enjoys sharing them with the media and public,\\" writes Bob Matthews, sports columnist for the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. \\"It is a labor of love and he does it very well.\\" He recently contributed to Green Cathedrals: The Ultimate Celebration of all Major League and Negro League Ballparks by Philip J. Lowry (Walker & Co., 2006)  Recent historical research and discoveries  New York Black Yankees: In 2005, while working on a project documenting the histories of professional sports franchises in Rochester, NY, Brei discovered that the New York Black Yankees of the Negro National League had moved to Rochester for their final season (1948), a fact that had been erroneously omitted from every reference material for the ensuing 57 years. Brei's discovery and supporting evidence prompted the editors of The Baseball Encyclopedia to modify its 2006 edition to finally give Rochester its due as the last home to the fabled franchise. (See article link below: \\"Gem of Local Baseball History Found\\") Rochester's 25,000th game: Brei made the headlines again in June, 2006 when he released his study on Rochester's pro sports franchises, revealing the fact that collectively Rochester's professional sports teams (dating back to 1877) were approaching the 25,000-game milestone. That historic game was played on June 16, 2006 when the hometown Red Wings hosted the Indianapolis Indians at Rochester's Frontier Field. (See article link below: \\"Rochester nears 25,000th pro sports event\\") Rochester Colonels: In the summer of 2005, Brei provided documentation to convince the Continental Basketball Association to officially recognize the brief existence of the long-forgotten Rochester Colonels. The Colonels had been a member of the league (then known as the EPBL) in 1958, but folded after playing in just 8 games. Shortly after the team's collapse, league governors decided to wipe the Colonels from the standings without note, and the franchise went 48 years without being included in the permanent record. Despite their short existence, the Colonels featured two future Basketball Hall-of-Famers, Arnie Risen and Hubie Brown. Forty years later, the team had gone largely forgotten, even by the most knowledgeable basketball experts and local sports fans. Through Brei's efforts in 2005, the Colonels were reinstated into the 2005-06 CBA Record Book. Brei also was able to procure formal recognition of the Colonels by the Association for Professional Basketball Research and the archives of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.  Monroe County Proclamation  On May 9, 2006, Brei received a Proclamation from the Monroe County (NY) Legislature for his \\"professional and personal dedication to his community and for his hard work and dedication as an accomplished sports historian.\\" He currently resides in Fairport, New York.

In the United States, Pike is the 1138th most common surname (based on the 1990 census). In England and Wales, it is the 513th most common surname (based on a Sept 2002 database of the Office for National Statistics). In Newfoundland, Pike is especially common, ranking 22nd among all surnames there (based on the 1955 voters list, as reported by E.R. Seary in \\"Family Names of the Island of Newfoundland\\"). At the time of the British Census of 1881, its relative frequency was highest in Wiltshire (7.3 times the British average), followed by Dorset, Devon, Somerset, Berkshire, Hampshire, Nottinghamshire, Gloucestershire, the Channel Islands and Surrey. Retrieved 20 January 2014 The surname has many variations such as Pikes, Pykes, McPike, Picke, Pique along with Speight. Derivation The origins of the name are not entirely clear. Individuals may have adopted the surname based on physical attributes resembling Pike (the fish), an association with Pike (the weapon), or a turnpike (one of the early meanings of which was a turning pike, a horizontal timber that was mounted so as to be able to spin or turn (such turnpikes apparently served as barriers to prevent horses from accessing footpaths, and in other instances to block passage until a toll had been paid). It has also been speculated that the name Pike might be derived in some instances from the word \\"peak\\", such as when somebody resided at the peak of a hill (note, for instance, the usage of the word \\"pike\\" in the name of Scafell Pike, England's highest mountain).

More than 50 different international and national trade unions are represented in CBTU and there are 50 chapters in the United States of America and one in Ontario, Canada. CBTU was started in September 1972 when more than 1,200 black union officials and rank and file members from 37 national unions met on September 23‚Äì24 at the LaSalle Hotel in Chicago, Illinois to discuss the role of black trade unionists in the labor movement. At the time, it was the largest single gathering of black unionists in the history of the American labor movement. Five black labor leaders (William Lucy, Nelson Edwards, William Simons, Charles Hayes and Cleveland Robinson) called the new organization the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists. They believed AFL-CIO President George Meany had been ignoring the voice of black trade unionists. They also believed that the AFL-CIO might attempt to declare its neutrality in the forthcoming U.S. presidential campaign in which President Richard Nixon was seeking re- election. The members of the CBTU thought that the re-election of Richard Nixon would continue hurtful policies to laborers such as unemployment, inflated prices, frozen wages, and appointing judges to the U.S. Supreme Court who did not consider the rights of minorities, workers, and the poor. Between 35 and 40 percent of the delegates who attended the first meeting were black women. Five of them served on the first executive committee of the CBTU. The CBTU executive council subsequently organized the National Women's Committee, which now holds conferences and workshops. The CBTU held its first convention in Washington, D.C. in May 1973. There was opposition to the new labor organization. Bayard Rustin claimed that the CPTU was redundant because black trade unionists had already assumed leadership roles in their own unions and communities. Since its founding, CBTU has been involved in a number of causes including the rights of women workers, promoting black leadership, and bringing attention to human rights issues. In 1974, it was the first labor organization in the United States to pass resolutions for the economic boycott of South Africa in response to its policies of apartheid. CBTU has also passed resolutions highlighting political and human rights issues in Namibia and Zimbabwe. In 2013, William Lucy left the presidency after 40 years of service to the organization. Terrence (Terry) L. Melvin was elected and became the second president of the CBTU. Resources *\\"Black Unionists Warn: Don't 'Restructure' Us Out.\\" Black Commentator. February 3, 2005.

Brothers Troman and Willie Eason introduced lap steel guitar to worship services in place of the traditional organ.\\"Sacred Steel: The Steel Guitar in the Gospel Blues Tradition\\" from About.com This new instrument was met with great enthusiasm and taken up by others including the Bishop J.R. Lockley. The three toured together and later Willie put the new style down on record, recording a total of eighteen sides in the 1940s and 50s. Since then, Sacred Steel has grown and flourished within the Keith and Jewell Dominions in churches in at least 22 states, including Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina and Tennessee. The most famous practitioner is Robert Randolph of the Robert Randolph and the Family Band. Randolph, the son of a deacon and a minister, took up pedal steel guitar at 17. Just seven years later, he went on to become one of the most original and talented practitioners of the Sacred Steel form.Wharton, Ned (2001) npr.org, Heavenly 'Sacred Steel': The House of God's Little-Known Sound Goes Mainstream. Willie Eason's nephew Aubrey Ghent had also become a celebrated steel guitarist, preserving the sacred steel tradition and bringing it to a wider audience. Ghent's father, Henry Nelson, was also schooled by Eason and played sacred steel for over 50 years, sharing the stage with Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Mahalia Jackson. Unlike Robert Randolph and the Family Band who have crossed over to doing more secular music, Aubrey Ghent has stayed closer to the gospel roots of tradition, as have many of the steel guitarists of the Jewell Dominion.

History Hades were formed in Bergen, Norway in 1992 by former Immortal guitarist J√∏rn Inge Tunsberg and ex-Dark drummer Remi Andersen; they were later joined by Janto Garmanslund on bass and second guitarist Wilhelm Nagel. Their first demo, Alone Walkyng, was recorded in June 1993 at Grieghallen and produced by Pytten; this demo was later to be re-released on CD through the Italian label Wounded Love in 1996. In 1993, Tunsberg was convicted, along with fellow black metal musician Varg Vikernes (of Burzum), for the burning of a Norwegian church in √Ösane, which led to a prison sentence. Following the release of the demo, the band signed with Full Moon Productions and recorded their first album, ...Again Shall Be, again at Grieghallen, in June/July 1994. Around this time, they replaced Nagel with Stig Hagenes on second guitar. Hades recorded their second album Dawn of the Dying Sun at Grieghallen in 1996, which was released through Full Moon in 1997. The band supported the release of this album with extensive touring throughout Europe, as well as in Mexico and the US. In 1998 the band was forced to change their name from Hades to Hades Almighty, following complaints from an American act already with a prior claim to the name. Following the name-change, the band began working on their next album, as well as playing at the Wacken Open Air festival. In September 1998 the band released entered Prolog Studios (Dortmund, Germany) to record Millenium Nocturne, released under license from Nuclear Blast through Hammerheart. They toured Europe to support of the album with Immortal and Benediction, and a separate spate of gigs in the Benelux region with Mayhem and Primordial.

He was also a member of Durham County Council from 1947 to 1956. He was first elected to the House of Commons in a by-election in February 1956, following the death of the sitting MP, Labour's William Whiteley. He held the seat at the next six general elections, before stepping down from Parliament at the 1979 general election. In 1973, he and fellow Labour MP Tom Urwin were awarded costs and damages after being libelled by The Journal newspaper.

In addition, he received two life sentences. The crimes and arrest Schwab was released from prison on March 4, 1991, after serving three years of an eight-year sentence for the aggravated rape of a 13-year-old boy committed in 1987. The rest of his sentence was commuted and he was placed on 15 years of probation. A month later, Cocoa resident Junny Rios-Martinez, Jr. went missing. Schwab had seen Junny's picture in the March 21, 1991 edition of Florida Today. He became friendly with the boy and his family, introducing himself as an associate of Malcom Denemark from that newspaper. After getting to know Junny, Schwab exploited his interest in surfing by saying he had left Florida Today for a job at a surfing magazine. On April 18, 1991, Junny was spotted getting into a U-Haul truck. On April 20, 1991, Schwab called his aunt in Ohio, claiming a man named \\"Donald\\" forced him to kidnap and rape Junny, under threat of killing Junny's mother, Vicki. The next day, police tapped a phone call with Schwab's aunt's permission, and determined Schwab's location. Schwab was arrested, and led police to Junny's dead body, found in Canaveral Groves, a rural area of Brevard County, Florida in a footlocker that was \\"nearly shut\\" covered in palm fronds, debris, and wrapped in rope. Trial On May 15, 1991, Schwab appeared in a state court in Brevard County, pleading not guilty to charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping a child under age 13 and sexual assault of a child under age 13. Prosecutors sought the death penalty. Schwab waived his right to a jury trial, and was convicted on May 22, 1992. At trial, witnesses had testified that Schwab was raped at gunpoint by a friend's father as a child. On July 1, 1992, he was sentenced to death for the murder, and given two life sentences for the kidnapping and sexual battery of a child under the age of 13. In addition, his probation was revoked on the previous rape conviction, and he was re-sentenced to an additional life sentence, giving him a total of three life sentences. The case led to the passage of the Junny Rios-Martinez, Jr., Act of 1992, which prohibited those convicted of sexual battery from receiving early release in the state of Florida. In prison Schwab's Florida Department of Corrections prisoner number was 111129. After his sentence, he was housed at Florida State Prison in Starke, Florida. Stays of execution On December 15, 2006, Governor Jeb Bush suspended all pending executions until further notice after the execution of √Ångel Nieves D√≠az had taken much longer than usual. This ban was lifted when the new Governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, signed Schwab's death warrant on July 18, 2007. Schwab was then transferred to Florida State Prison. He was scheduled for execution by means of lethal injection on November 15, 2007 at 6:00 p.m. EST. However, federal judge Anne C. Conway granted a stay of execution on November 14. On November 15, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the execution could proceed, but the United States Supreme Court blocked the execution later that same day pending a Kentucky case that challenged the three-drug combination used for lethal injection in both Florida and Kentucky. The Supreme Court upheld Kentucky's death penalty on April 16, 2008, by a vote of 7 to 2. Crist signed a new death warrant for Schwab the next day, without a date for execution. On May 19, the Supreme Court specifically denied Schwab's appeal, permitting Crist to reschedule the execution.High court: Florida execution can proceed - 05/19/2008 - MiamiHerald.com Schwab's final appeal to the Florida Supreme Court was denied because similar claims had already been declined by the Supreme Court.Florida Supreme Court denies child killer's last-minute execution appeal - 06/27/2008 - OrlandoSentinel.com Death Schwab was executed by lethal injection on July 1, 2008 and pronounced dead at 6:15 pm.

It is based on Non Sum Qualis Eram Bonae sub Regno Cynarae, a similarly ironic poem by the English Decadent poet Ernest Dowson (1867‚Äì1900), which has the refrain 'I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion,' and which was probably inspired by Dowson's lifelong friend Adelaide Foltinowicz, who never returned his devotion.Ernest Dowson British poet Britannica.com The phrase \\"faithful in my fashion\\" entered the language before the song was written, and was the title of a 1946 Hollywood film. The singer protests that she is always faithful to her main love in her own way, despite seeing, and accepting gifts from, wealthy men. The strong ironic innuendo is that she trades sexual favours for gifts. The song is full of wordplay, such as the spoonerism \\"If the Harris pat means a Paris hat ...\\" The song is sung in the second half of the show by Lois (Bianca) to her love interest, Bill (Lucentio), who has become frustrated with Lois' penchant for older wealthy men. Broadway actress and singer Lisa Kirk, who originated the role of Lois/Bianca, introduced the song in the second act of the original (1948) production. It was performed in the 1953 film version by Ann Miller and Tommy Rall. Other versions The song has been notably sung by Ella Fitzgerald, Eartha Kitt, Blossom Dearie, Jo Stafford, Peggy Lee (with George Shearing), Della Reese on her Della Della Cha-Cha-Cha album (1961), and by Julie London in 1961 (on the LP album (Liberty Records LST-7192) Whatever Julie Wants) Cultural references Porter wondered whether Clark Gable would object to his name being used in the song, in which it is implied that Gable is one of Lois's lovers (\\"Mister Gable, I mean Clark / Wants me on his boat to park\\"). Gable was delighted upon hearing the song, along with his name's being mentioned in the lyric. In some versions of the lyrics, there are references to the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston and Mack the Knife from the Threepenny Opera. In the Beatles' \\"I'm Happy Just to Dance with You,\\" the melody of the line \\"'cause there's really nothing else I'd rather do\\" closely matches that of the eponymous line \\"always true to you, darling, in my fashion.\\" In an apparent allusion to Porter's song, Morrissey's \\"Speedway\\", from the 1994 album Vauxhall & I, includes the lines \\"In my own strange way, I've always been true to you / In my own sick way, I'll always stay true to you\\".

It is linked to the New Italian Socialist Party. Before Benito Mussolini banned opposition newspapers in 1926, Critica Sociale was a prominent supporter of the original Italian Socialist Party (PSI), which included a spectrum of views from socialism to Marxism. History From republicanism to Socialism Arcangelo Ghisleri founded a republican political journal called Cuore e Critica in the late 19th century. A former employee, Filippo Turati, succeeded Ghisleri on 15 January 1891 and renamed it Critica Sociale. On 1 January 1893 it moved its political stance, towards socialism. It backed the founding of the PSI at the party's Genoa Conference and changed its masthead to read: \\"Weekly review of social, political and literary studies of scientific Socialism\\". It became the most influential Marxist review in Italy from 1891 to 1898, tackling all the serious public problems of 1890s Italy: banking scandals, repression of the Fasci Siciliani unrest, the colonial war in Africa, and food riots. It featured writing by the most influential socialist thinkers in Italy and abroad, including Enrico Ferri, Lelio Basso, Paul Lafargue, Ivanoe Bonomi, Antonio Graziadei, Antonio Labriola and many others. From 1 May 1898 to 1 July 1899, it was seized by the government and its editor was briefly imprisoned. In 1901 the journal restarted, as Turati, its editors, and the PSI were entering parliament with the support of Giovanni Giolitti's powerful Liberal Party. In this phase the review became the expression of the reformist tendency inside of the PSI. From 1902 to 1913 the review was involved in the debate over anti-clerical school reform; discussing the role teachers, their organisation, school building and hygiene, while opposing government budgets that favoured the Ministry of War over the needs of public education. Critica Sociale adopted, in discussing literature, a positivist and Marxist critical methodology and, convinced of the importance of literature, education and libraries, printed the sociological writing of Pietro Gori beside the poetry of Ada Negri and serialized novels by Italo Svevo. Even if seen as lagging the ideological-literary fashions of the age, Critica Sociale tried to inform its readers on new tendencies, giving judgments and appraisals filtered through its socialist outlook. Showing little acceptance of the then popular ideas of Nietzsche and d'Annunzio, Critica Sociale editors were instead convinced that intellectuals must open themselves up to and promote new modern ideas while inculcating culture with 'scientific' truth and the requirements of a life led for the benefit of society. World War I and opposition to Fascism When Italy entered the First World War in May 1915, Critica Sociale did not lose its neutrality nor did it lose its reformist ideals when faced with the Bolshevik Revolution in October 1917. While not denying the legitimacy of Vladimir Lenin's revolutionary method, Critica Sociale editors argued it was inapplicable to the Italian situation. But from 1917, the positions of the two wings the PSI became intractable. At the Livorno Conference of January 1921, the nascent Marxist-Leninist wing led by Amadeo Bordiga left the PSI to become the Italian Communist Party. Critica Sociale continued to support the reformist Unitary Socialist Party. Benito Mussolini's rise to power was a second blow to Critica Sociale. Press censorship and seizures by the government led to irregular publication. Deprived of resources, writers such as Turati, Anna Kulischov, Giacomo Matteotti, Claudio Treves, and Carlo Rosselli continued to defend the democratic order which was being swept away by the Fascists, and total censorship loomed. Its last political article was published the day after the murder of Giacomo Matteotti on 10 June 1924, an act which Mussolini used to take absolute power in Italy. Thereafter the editors sheltered behind inoffensive cultural and doctrinale essays. The next year the Fascist government pronounced a blanket ban on opposition press; the last issue was dated 16 September - 15 October 1926. Revival after World War II Following the fall of the Fascist regime in 1946, it was reestablished, and has remained in print under a succession of editors-in- chief: Ugoberto Alfassio Grimaldi, Umberto Giovine and Carlo Tognoli (with Paolo Brera as deputy editor). It is currently the official publication of the New Italian Socialist Party, a minor social-democratic political party. In recent years it has paid particular attention to the reinvention of British centre-left politics under New Labour, and has published articles by both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

Built to guide vessels away from the notoriously dangerous and rough coastline and to let them know proximity of the nearby bay and entrance, the lighthouse was one of the first to be automated. The lighthouse tower portion is now located at the Woodley Island Marina within the City of Eureka. History Table Bluff Lighthouse was built in 1892. A fixed, fourth-order Fresnel lens was removed from the Humboldt Harbor Light and installed in the tower at Table Bluff in late October 1892. In 1911, the fixed Fresnel lens was replaced with a revolving one. A modern optic was installed in the tower, and the Fresnel lens was shipped to San Diego to be displayed in the Old Point Loma Light. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1975. The Humboldt Harbor Light located on the north spit of the Humboldt Bay Bar entrance had for many years been criticized as being too low. In 1892 the Lighthouse Service constructed a light station on Table Bluff, a promontory south of Humboldt Bay, but within-view of the bay. The original station consisted of a duplex Victorian quarters, fog-signal building, and a keepers quarters with light tower attached. The quarters were redwood Italianette-stick Victorian, and the keepers quarters/ light tower were almost exactly the same as San Luis Obispo Light. There were also two wash houses, an oil house and a carpenter shop. In 1906 the Navy established a radio station on the property and during World War II the station was expanded to include lodging for mounted beach patrols, a coastal lookout post, and a radio compass station. During the war and immediately afterwards most of the original buildings were razed along with some of the newer structures. The quarters portion of the lighthouse was razed leaving only the tower. This and the fog signal building were all that remained of the original buildings. USCG photo shows lighthouse complex. Note lighthouse on lower left corner of photo. Circa 1951 In 1953 the rotating 4th order lens was removed and a fixed 3¬Ω order lens installed. The 4th order optic was shipped to the Point Loma Light in San Diego which is operated as a museum by the National Park Service. The fog signal was discontinued the same year and the station automated. In 1975 the light was discontinued and the property transferred to GSA and sold. The 2¬Ω order lens was shipped to the Smithsonian. The lighthouse tower was cut in two and moved to Woodley Island Marina in Eureka () in 1987. The lens in it now is not the original.

In the 16th century, Croats fleeing from the Ottomans in the south settled in the village. Until 1947, ƒåunovo, along with Jarovce and Rusovce, was part of Hungary and was annexed that year with the two others to Czechoslovakia, to enable construction of the Port of Bratislava. It became an official part of Bratislava on January 1, 1972. Some of the inhabitants still use the Croatian language and preserve folk traditions.  Tourism  In 2000, a new art museum called Danubiana was opened. Dunajsk√© luhy Protected Landscape Area comprises some parts of the borough.

The village consists of a central point and several outlying hamlets: Buttons Green, Colchester Green, Cross Green, Great Green, Oldhall Green, Smithwood Green and Windsor Green. Surrounded mostly by fields used for farming, and with few roads, its population was 839 in 2001, increasing to 868 at the 2011 Census. The village previously had a railway station on the Long Melford-Bury St Edmunds branch line, but it was closed in 1961 as part of the Beeching Axe. Its football team, Cockfield United play in the Suffolk and Ipswich Football League.  History  The present village has been inhabited for well over 2000 years. The finding of a sword (now in the Moyse Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds) is evidence of Bronze Age settlement, and a number of findings indicate ancient defensive ditches, known as The Warbanks. The village's present name is derived from \\"Cochan-feld\\" probably indicating a site established by a person named Cochan. The village appeared in the Domesday Book of 1086 under the name of \\"Cothefelda\\" and is listed as a prosperous manor whose wealth had grown since the Norman Conquest. During the Middle Ages, the village became \\"Cokefield\\" and finally \\"Cockfield\\". Cockfield became a centre a Puritanism during the 17th century. During the 19th century the parish was one of the largest and wealthiest in Suffolk and the seat of a number of prestigious rectors.  St Peter's Church  A landmark visible for a distance across the neighbouring countryside, the church of St Peter's is one of the finest of Suffolk's many village churches, with the present building mostly dating from the 14th and 15th centuries. The church's size is unusual for such a rural location, but this becomes less surprising when one considers its location between the three great medieval merchant towns of Bury St Edmunds, Lavenham, and Sudbury. There is no record of a church in the Domesday Book although a village of Cockfield's size would almost certainly have had one. The first surviving record of the parish's ecclesiastical history dates from 1190 when William de Cullum was installed as the first rector, although there is no existing record of the site prior to the building of the present church in the 14th century. The church fell under the patronage of the Abbot of St Edmundsbury until the Reformation when the Spring family, wealthy Lavenham clothiers and noblemen, took over, resulting in a close link with the region's strong wool trade. From 1708 the patronage fell to St John's College, Cambridge who appointed a number of distinguished Fellows of the College. Rectors of St Peter's have included John Knewstub the Presbyterian, William Ludlam the mathematician, and Churchill Babington the archaeologist and botanist. The church's sizeable square flint tower dates from the 14th century and is buttressed almost to the top. The tower was nearly destroyed by a storm during the winter of 1774-5 and on August 2, 1775, after repairs were nearly completed, an apparent lightning strike resulted in a fire that damaged it once again. The mathematician William Ludlam, rector from 1767, installed an astronomical observatory on the tower whose filled in windows can still be seen.  The village school  In the same road as the church is the village school, serving the village and surrounding communities. Children from the ages of four to nine attend the school.

It is north of Eureka, California, built in 1871. History The low, square, brick tower, painted white, was built in 1871. The light is only above ground, but the headland on which it stands gives it an elevation of above the sea. Despite the great height above the sea, heavy seas have been known to reach it. In 1914, the keeper made the following report: :\\"At 4:40 p. m. I observed a sea of unusual height. When it struck the bluff the jar was very heavy. The lens immediately stopped revolving. The sea shot up the face of the bluff and over it, until the solid sea seemed to me to be on a level with where I stood in the lantern. The sea itself fell over onto the top of the bluff and struck the tower about on a level with the balcony. The whole point between the tower and the bluff was buried in water.\\" The wave he described was the highest recorded wave on the coast. After the sea struck the lighthouse and extinguished the light, service was restored in four hours by Lightkeeper F.L. Harrington, the keeper from 1888 to 1916. Buildings and structures The historic Bell House, the current location of the fog signal The station originally consisted of the small two-story light tower, a single Victorian residence, and a small barn. In 1898, a bell house was constructed, and a bell was added that was operated by weights. A second keeper was assigned at that time, and the quarters were expanded to accommodate two families. In 1947, the fog signal changed to an air horn. In 1949, the Trinidad Civic Club constructed a facsimile of the tower in a park overlooking the harbor and installed the original lens in its structure as a memorial to those lost or buried at sea. The 4,000-pound bell is displayed alongside the tower. In the late 1960s, the Coast Guard razed the original dwelling and barn and constructed the present triplex. The fog signal was discontinued when the station was automated in 1974. However, the complaints from the citizens of Trinidad Head were so vocal that the Coast Guard was forced to install the present ELG 300, operated by a fog detector. The new fog signal is operated in the original bell house. The original tower remains essentially unchanged. Head keepers * Jeremiah Kiler (1871 ‚Äì 1888) * William A. Henderson (1888) * Frederick L.

It was the last port to fall to the Union Army (Feb. 1865), completing its blockade of the Atlantic coast. Importance Wilmington, located 30 miles upstream from the mouth of the Cape Fear River (which flows into the Atlantic Ocean), was among the Confederacy's more important cities. It ranked 13th in size in the CSA (although only 100th in the pre-war United States) with a population of 9,553 according to the 1860 census, making it nearly the same size as Atlanta, Georgia, at the time. Wilmington was one of the most important points of entry for supplies for the entire Confederate States. Its port traded cotton and tobacco in exchange for foreign goods, such as munitions, clothing and foodstuffs. These cargoes were transferred to railroad cars and sent from the city throughout the Confederacy. This nourished both the southern states in general and specifically General Robert E. Lee's forces in Virginia. The trade was based on steamer ships of British smugglers. These vessels were called blockade runners because they had to avoid the Union's imposed maritime barricade. The blockade runners operated indirectly from British colonies-such as Bermuda, the Bahamas, or Nova Scotia. Along with vital supplies, the blockade runners brought foreign crews, who poured money into the local economy through bars, taverns, hotels, shops, and merchants. The town soon took on an international flavor not seen before the war. In the summer of 1862, sailors arrived who were infected with yellow fever, which was endemic in the Caribbean. An epidemic soon paralyzed the once-thriving waterfront, as well as much of the city. Nearly 1,000 people contracted the disease, and more than 300 died before the illness had run its course and activity resumed. After the fall of Norfolk, Virginia in May 1862, Wilmington's importance increased. It became the main Confederate port on the Atlantic Ocean. Along the Atlantic seashore, Wilmington's defenses were so sturdy that they were only surpassed by Charleston's fortifications in South Carolina. Wilmington resisted Federal occupation for a long time, mainly due to Fort Fisher. Blockade running became an organized industry. The Crenshaw Company organized shipments of cotton from the interior of the Confederacy to Wilmington for smuggling through the blockade to England. Admiral Porter's boats removing torpedoes and buoying the channel in Cape Fear River, March 1865 Wilmington was not captured by Union forces until February 22, 1865, approximately one month after the fall of Fort Fisher. The Battle of Wilmington consisted of a series of three small engagements near the Cape Fear River that led to the abandonment of the city by the Confederate forces under General Braxton Bragg. Before leaving, Bragg ordered the large quantities of bales of cotton and tobacco burned to prevent their falling into Union hands. Maj. Gen. Jacob D. Cox led the first Federal troops into Wilmington, and his forces occupied the city for the rest of the war. As almost all the military action was at some distance from the city, a number of antebellum homes and other buildings have survived in downtown Wilmington.

He is currently the assistant head coach and special teams coordinator for the Cincinnati Bengals and has worked within the organization since Career Simmons has been the Cincinnati Bengals (National Football League) special teams coach since 2003. Under his tutelage, in the 2005 season, the Cincinnati Bengals got record-breaking performances from their kicking specialists and kickoff returner, plus Top-10 work from the kickoff return and kickoff coverage teams. Simmons‚Äôs biggest individual success story has been placekicker Shayne Graham. Simmons faced a challenge in 2003, when Graham joined the Bengals on waivers just a week before the regular-season opener and was moved into the No. 1 job. But Simmons has helped guide Graham to three of the finest kicking seasons in Bengals history. In 2005, Graham became the first Bengals kicker to make the Pro Bowl. He broke his own team record with 131 points; broke a record (he previously had shared) by making 14 straight field goals (streak is still active entering 2006); and he qualified as the most accurate FG kicker in club history (87.5 percent). Second-year punter Kyle Larson, originally a Bengals college free agent signee under Simmons, averaged 43.2 yards per kick in 2005. It was the club‚Äôs best average since 1998, and the punt team‚Äôs 35.6-yard net average was also the Bengals‚Äô best since 1998. Larson set a team record with a 75-yard punt at Jacksonville, breaking the previous mark of 73 by Brad Costello. Rookie kickoff returner Tab Perry set Bengals season records for total returns (64) and KOR yards (1562) in 2005. He was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance Dec. 4 at Pittsburgh, which included a 94-yard KOR. The 2005 Bengals finished ninth in the NFL in team KOR average (23.6) and finished seventh in kickoff coverage (21.0). In 2003, Simmons‚Äôs first Bengals season, his return and coverage units provided a major boost in the punting game. Cincinnati finished 12th in punt return average and 11th in opponents punt return average, following a 2002 season in which the team had finished 31st in returns and 32nd in coverage. In 2004, Bengals coverage and return teams ranked in the NFL‚Äôs top half in three of four areas, topped by a fifth-ranked kickoff coverage team allowing 19.7 yards per return. Simmons began his NFL coaching career in 1998 on the same Baltimore Ravens staff as Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis. Simmons was assistant special teams coach and assistant strength and conditioning coach for the Ravens in 1998, and he held that same role for the Carolina Panthers from 1999‚Äì2002. A former college punter himself, Simmons played an integral role at Carolina in the continued development of Todd Sauerbrun as one of the NFL‚Äôs top punters. Carolina ranked fourth in the NFL in 2002 in net punting average (37.5), and the Panthers special units led the league in kickoff coverage with only 18.5 yards allowed per return. College Simmons excelled while punting for the University of Kansas (KU) from 1993‚Äì95, earning All-Big Eight honors his final year. As a senior, he helped the Jayhawks to a Top-10 national ranking and to an Aloha Bowl victory over UCLA. Also as a senior at KU, he won honors as an Academic All-American. Prior to playing for KU, Simmons was a punter and QB for Dodge City Community College. In 1992 at Dodge City, he led the nation‚Äôs junior colleges in punting and was a first-team NJCAA All-American. Simmons began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at the University of Kansas in 1996. He moved to the University of Minnesota in 1997 before joining the NFL with the Baltimore Ravens in 1998. Personal life Simmons graduated from Elkhart High School in 1991.

History  This station was opened on 1 August 1873 by the Callander and Oban Railway. It was the first railway station in Crianlarich. The station was originally laid out with two platforms, one on either side of a crossing loop. There were sidings on the south side of the station. After the West Highland Railway opened in 1894, Crianlarich could boast two railway stations. The West Highland Railway crossed over the Callander and Oban Railway by means of a viaduct located a short distance west of the Lower station. The West Highland Railway's Crianlarich station was (and still is) located a short distance south of this viaduct. On 15 November 1921, the loop and one of the platforms at Crianlarich Lower were taken out of use. The platform on the south side was retained, it being located on the same side of the railway as the village. Following nationalisation of the railways in 1948, both stations at Crianlarich came under the ownership of British Rail. It was not until 1953 that the suffixes \\"Upper\\" and \\"Lower\\" were added to the station names.  Signalling  Crianlarich signal box, which replaced the original box on 18 March 1890, was located on the Down platform. It had 14 levers. The signal box closed on 15 November 1921 when the crossing loop was removed. The sidings were retained, access to them being controlled from a ground frame released by the single line tablet.  Closure  A timber train in the 1980s Crianlarich Lower station was closed to passengers on 28 September 1965 following a landslide in Glen Ogle, however the site was used as a timber terminal for several years afterwards. The site of the station is now occupied by the Crianlarich Community Centre.  Crianlarich Junction  Crianlarich Junction was situated half a mile west of Crianlarich Lower station. Opened on 20 December 1897, the junction was located at one end of a short link line that ran to station on the West Highland Railway. There were two signal boxes: \\"Crianlarich Junction East\\" (32 levers) and \\"Crianlarich Junction West\\" (18 levers). Following closure of the line east from Crianlarich Lower, the line between there and Crianlarich Junction was retained as a siding, with the link line becoming the main line for trains to and from Oban.

It occupies a site of about 8 ha (19 acres) surrounded by woodland near the Royal Museum of Central Africa in the town of Tervuren, Flemish Brabant, east of Brussels. It has over 1350 students aged 1‚Äì18 years from approximately 70 nationalities. BSB consists of two schools: Primary (age 1‚Äì11) and Secondary (age 11‚Äì18). BSB follows an English elementary school curriculum, and offers a bilingual English/French programme. Teachers are recruited among English and French native speakers. It offers programmes for pupils aged 4‚Äì14 in a 50/50 timetable covering both languages. In 2016, BSB opened the Jacques Rogge Sports Centre on campus. The new Sports Centre includes: a 25m swimming pool, gymnastics arena, dance studio, fitness suite and multi-purpose sports hall. History The British School of Brussels was founded on 5 December 1969 by a group of businessmen led by Sir Dick Pantlin CBE, just as the UK was preparing to join the European Union. Pantlin went on to become the chairman of the board of Trustees and Honorary President of the school with Leslie Firman, the group's secretary. The school was also co-founded by Mike Goodman. The school's houses are named after them; Pantlin, Firman and Goodman. For its first few months it occupied temporary premises in the Rue de la Loi in Brussels. The School first opened on 15 September 1970 with 213 pupils aged 5‚Äì13 and 16 teaching staff including the first headmaster, Alan Humphries. On 9 December 1970, the Duke of Edinburgh officially opened the first building on the campus, then called Building 1. In 2004 all buildings were renamed after famous Belgian people or fictional characters such as Victor Horta and Tintin. Primary The Primary School curriculum is open for ages 1‚Äì11. The Primary School has dedicated facilities for each age group: Early Childhood Centre (ages 1‚Äì3), Lower Primary (age 3-7) and Upper Primary (age 7-11). Each part of the Primary School has its own school building and playground. Secondary At age 16, all students take either nine or ten GCSEs. Post-16, students are given the option to study for English A Levels, the International Baccalaureate Diploma or Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC) vocational courses in Applied Science, Business, Hospitality and Sport.

Built in 1874‚Äì76, it was funded primarily with gifts from Joseph Battell and others of his family. Succeeding two previous chapel buildings on Yale's Old Campus, it provided space for daily chapel services, which were mandatory for Yale College students until 1926. Together with Durfee Hall and Farnam Hall, the chapel was part of a program begun in the 1870s to build up the perimeter of Old Campus and separate it from the rest of the city. These three buildings, all by the same architect, were among the first at Yale to be named for donors rather than function, location, or legislative funding. Battell Chapel is one of the locations on the Connecticut Freedom Trail. Construction The building is a masonry structure of New Jersey brownstone, and decorative elements are made of blue Ohio sandstone. A flat coffered ceiling that covers the auditorium is constructed of wooden beams and painted blue with gold leaf. Interior wood paneling and pews are solid oak. Iconography and ornament Battell Chapel altar Seneca, by Maitland Armstrong, commemorating Thomas Anthony Thacher On the chapel's upper pier walls appear the symbols of the Greek Cross and the Shield of the Trinity, emphasizing Yale's conservative Trinitarianist Congregational religious heritage. The Battell Chapel clock, with chimes consisting of five large bells that rang at each quarter hour, was at one time the clock to which others at Yale was synchronized; however, the chimes have been silent for years. The organ was the gift of Joseph Battell's sister, Irene Battell Larned. The Apse Memorial Windows were designed by the architect Russell Sturgis and installed by Slack, Booth & Co. of Orange, New Jersey in 1876. At the top of the center window appears the name of an early benefactor of Yale University, Elihu Yale, and around his name are the names of the first nine presidents of Yale College. Stained-glass windows flanking the nave commemorate benefactors and professors of Yale, many of whom were theologians. These include George Berkeley, Jonathan Edwards, Benjamin Silliman, James Luce Kingsley, Chauncey A. Goodrich, Nathaniel W. Taylor, Eleazar Thompson Fitch, Denison Olmstead, Edward C. Herrick, William A. Larned, Anthony D. Stanley, and James Hadley. Current use In the twenty-first century, Battell Chapel is the setting for the Sunday services of the University Church in Yale University, conducted by a Yale Chaplain. The chapel also serves as a concert hall and is the main performance venue for the Greater New Haven Youth Ensembles of Neighborhood Music School: The Greater New Haven Youth Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra, and Concert Orchestra as well as the Greater New Haven Symphonic Wind Ensemble and Concert Band.

It shares its name with the small river that runs through it, a tributary of the Seine. Its inhabitants are called the Orgevalais. Orgeval Orgeval is served by 3 carriers and 9 lines. The train station of St Quentin en Yvelines is the main station used by RER train lines 1 and 22 to travel to the city of Paris. Bus lines with day and night schedules are Line 20, Line 22, Line 50 terminating at Poissy, and Line 55. The Transdev Ile-de-France LINE 14 is also fully operational since upgrades completed to the Paris metro system. History Orgeval's location has been inhabited since the Prehistory, where tools made from flint dating from the Neolithic times were found. It is said that a water source was used by the Gallo-Romans for its therapeutic virtues. This source was actually rediscovered in 1708 by the abbey's doctor, but its use was stopped in 1850. Orgeval's first real mention in history came from the building of Abbaye Notre Dame d'Abbecourt in 1180 by Gasce of Poissy, suzerain of Orgeval. This abbey which descended from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chartres was destroyed at the beginning of the 19th Century. Nowadays, Orgeval possesses a church with a Romanesque architecture from the 11th century. The church is composed of a spire and an octagonal tower. The church nave dates back to the 16th century.

An Unedited Sermon of H√©linand for the Purification, Paris, B.N., ms. lat. 14591.\\" In: Sacris Erudiri 32 (1991), pp. 291-308)) was a medieval poet, chronicler, and ecclesiastical writer.  Biography  He was born of Flemish parents at Pronleroy in Oise in France c. 1150; his date of death is said to be 3 February 1223, or 1229, or 1237. His talents as a minstrel won the favor of King Philip Augustus, and for some time he freely indulged in the pleasures of the world, after which he became a Cistercian monk at the monastery of Froidmont in the Diocese of Beauvais about the year 1190. From being a self- indulgent man of the world he became a model of piety and mortification in the monastery. Whatever time was not consumed in monastic exercises he devoted to ecclesiastical studies and, after his ordination to the priesthood, to preaching and writing. The Church of Beauvais honors him as a saint and celebrates his feast day on 3 February. H√©linand of Froidmont is sometimes confused with the Cistercian H√©linand of Perseigne, the author of a commentary on the Apocalypse and glosses on the Book of Exodus, although there are no arguments for this identification.See Voorbij (below)  Works   Chronicon  H√©linand is most remembered for his Chronicon, a world-chronicle in Latin containing forty-nine books (of which only less than half have survived), which he compiled from 1211 to 1223. Helinand incorporated several of his treatises and letters into his Chronicon. These include moral treatises such as De cognitione sui, and De bono regimine principis, twenty-eight sermons on various Church festivals; one epistle entitled De reparatione lapsi, in which he exhorts a renegade monk to return to his monastery. The Chronicon itself is largely a compilation of texts taken from a wide range of sources. Vincent of Beauvais on his turn based his Speculum Historiale, which provided a history of the world down to his time, on the Chronicon of Helinand. Surviving parts of the Chronicon include Books 1-18, covering the period from the creation to the death of Alexander the Great; fragments from Books 19-44, surviving as copies in the Speculum Maius of Vincent of Beauvais; the text of books 45-49, which deal with the period from 634 to 1204. Books 45-49 of the Chronicon serve as a source for the chronicle by the Cistercian monk Aubri de Trois-Fontaines (Alberic of Trois-Fontaines) (c. 1241). According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"his chronicle is not sufficiently critical to be of much historical value.\\" Yet it would be unfair to call Helinand an uncritical writer - or rather, compiler - of history, as from time to time he interrupts the narrative to alert the reader where his sources diverge from each other, often trying to harmonize them in much the same fashion as a scholastic treatise. The structure of the Chronicon is mainly chronological, although Helinand frequently digresses from the historical account to comment on Scripture, include a treatise against astrology, write about saints and their legends, examine the animal world, or incorporate material from Latin literature or vernacular traditions. He is frequently quoted as a medieval authority on the meaning of the word \\"graal,\\" i.e. the Holy Grail. In this sense, the Chronicon's value is not based on its existence as a work on history. He is cited, for example, as a source of the description of the flight of Eilmer of Malmesbury.  Lesser works  Helinand wrote a work in Old French called Les Vers de la Mort (\\"Verses of Death\\") shortly after entering the monastery, between 1194 and 1197. In fifty stanzas, Helinand asks Death to call upon his best friends and exhort them to abandon the world. Each stanza contains twelve octosyllabic lines; the rhyme scheme is aab aab bba bba. This form was imitated by later poets and is called by critics the \\"helinandian stanza.\\" In this poem, Death appears as a ubiquitous and hyperactive agent. Helinand does not use macabre elements, except in the title, which puns on the homonymy between \\"vers\\" (worms) and \\"vers\\" (verses). His lyrical sermon uses various tropes such as anaphora, metaphor, and adnomination to great effect. Throughout this unique testimony of his poetic talent as a trouv√®re, Helinand appears as a precursor of Villon, Chastelain , and other French poets of the 15th century. As a well-known preacher, he wrote more than sixty Latin sermons. His sermons, written in a neat Latin style, give evidence of a remarkable acquaintance with the pagan poets as well as with the Fathers of the Church. A Martyrium of Saints Gereon, Victor, Cassius, and Florentius, martyrs of the Theban Legion used to be attributed to Helinand, but it is unclear whether he is the true author.See Voorbij (below). Smits (1983) observes that the text was already in circulation before the 12th century and that the attribution must hence be false. See: E.R.

It was previously known as George's Street (after George III) until it was renamed after Daniel O'Connell. The street runs in parallel to the River Shannon and forms part of an overall thoroughfare, along with Rutland Street and Patrick Street, that bisects Limerick City Centre in a north east to south west direction. The street is about a mile in length, starting at the Arthurs Quay / Denmark Street junction and ending at The Crescent. A monument to Daniel O'Connell stands at the centre of The Crescent overlooking O'Connell Street. The street is noted for its Georgian architectural heritage. Retail & Services The Belltable Arts Centre, 69 O'Connell Street Retail outlets on O'Connell Street include Brown Thomas, Debenhams and Penneys, while O'Mahony's have a large bookstore there founded in 1902. The George Hotel is also located on the street, which also acts as a regional financial services centre with a number of large retail banking operations, including Bank of Ireland, AIB, Ulster Bank and KBC Bank. A study carried out by the CBRE Ireland Research Team in 2012 found that 16% of retail units on O'Connell Street were vacant,16% of shops vacant on Limerick‚Äôs main thoroughfare - Local Business - Limerick Leader making it the worst performing main city thoroughfare in Ireland in retail terms. The results also reflected poorly on the quality of retail offered on O'Connell Street with Limerick having the greatest proportion of fast food restaurants on its main street, at 21%, followed by footwear at 13%, and jewellery stores at 5%; this was in stark contrast to other Irish cities and towns where women's fashionwear occupies the core retail slots on the main streets and also offer a more mixed fashion offering. The Belltable Arts Centre, located at 69 O'Connell Street, is a multi- disciplinary venue which houses a 250-seat theatre/cinema, a 50-seat balcony studio (for occasional poetry and smaller performances), a visual arts gallery (hosting up to 12 exhibitions a year) and a basement restaurant. It hosts the Unfringed Festival, which is Limerick's only performance festival in spring.Belltable Arts Centre History 250px O'Connell Street dates from the late 18th to early 19th century as part of Edmund Sexton Pery's plan for the development of a new city on lands he owned to the south of the existing medieval city. In 1765, he commissioned the engineer Davis Ducart to design a town plan on those lands which have since become known as Newtown Pery. The centrepiece of this development was O'Connell Street. The street along with the rest of Newtown Pery was built to Georgian design and is part of Limerick's Georgian Quarter. The street prospered from the time of its construction and quickly attracted the city's wealthier residents who then resided in the Englishtown area of medieval Limerick. The cramped and lofty Dutch styled dwellings of Englishtown and Irishtown were no match for the new, grand and spacious housing & thoroughfares of Newtown Pery. Although the street functioned as the main retail & commercial district of the city, this was (and remains today) primarily focused on the northern end of the street. The southern end of the street, in contrast, was more residential in character with the barrier being located about midway on the street (from the Cecil Street junction). Today, most of the residential townhouses on the street are now occupied by offices. 250px From the 1950s onwards due to accidental damage from fire, neglect and poor planning by the city authorities a lot of the Georgian heritage has been lost on the northern end of the street around the retail core and has had an overall negative impact on the appearance of the street. Notable architectural losses include the fa√ßades of Cannock's Department store and its landmark clock tower (now Penneys), Todd's Department Store (now Brown Thomas) and Cruises Hotel (now Cruises Street) amongst many more. Nevertheless, some of the finest examples Georgian townhouse architecture in Ireland still survives on the southern end and along the Crescent area of the street. For a time the O'Connell Street & William Street/Sarsfield Street junction was historically an important crossroads junction in the west of Ireland with four national primary routes converging at the one place. The N7 from Dublin and the east, the N18 from Galway and the north, the N20 from Cork & Kerry and the south west and the N24 from Waterford and the south east all converged at the one place. Most of O'Connell Street was part of the N20 prior to the opening of the Limerick Southern Ring Road in 2004. It now forms part of the R527 regional road. Irish Civil War O'Connell Street was the location of the main incidents of the Irish Civil War in Limerick. The anti - treaty forces largely held four military barracks and most of the town while the Free state forces in the city held Cruises Hotel on O'Connell Street (along with Customs House, the Jail, the Courthouse, William Street RIC Barracks which were all located nearby). During this time Limerick saw much street fighting between the opposing forces which lasted three days. The fighting resulted in 15 deaths, seven of whom were civilians and eight Free State soldiers. Another 87 were wounded. (See: Irish Free State offensive) Todd's Fire On 25 August 1959, Limerick's best known department store was the scene of the city's largest and most destructive fire. Todd's which occupied a large city block fronting onto O'Connell Street (now occupied by Brown Thomas) and William Street went on fire following an electrical fault. At 11 a.m. smoke was noticed coming from the William Street side of the store and by 12.30 the whole block became a blazing inferno. The fire spread and destroyed the stores adjoining Todd's including at the time Burtons, Liptons, Goodwins and Cesars which were completely gutted. A new store was built in place of the old store which was held by some to be a less attractive design, and which completely altered the appearance of the street. Cruises Street development In the early 1990s one of Limerick's main landmarks - Cruises Hotel was demolished to make way for a new pedestrian street 'Cruises Street' at the northern end of O'Connell Street. The street was constructed to bring high end retailers to the city centre. Events Crowds on O'Connell Street watching rugby on a large screen * On 20 May 2006, O'Connell Street was closed so that 50,000 could crowd the street to watch the Heineken Cup Final, Munster vs. Biarritz on a massive screen. * On 24 May 2008, the street was closed again so that crowds could watch the Heineken Cup Final between Munster and Toulouse on a massive screen. * The Munster Rugby homecoming ceremony was also held on O'Connell Street on both occasions. * In September 1998 thousands gathered in O'Connell Street for a speech given by the then President of the United States, Bill Clinton. * In May 1964, thousands lined O'Connell Street as senator Ted Kennedy gave a speech from Cruises Hotel. The visit came just 5 months after the assassination of his brother John F. Kennedy who had also visited Limerick in 1963.Limerick remembers Senator Ted Kennedy RIP - Leader Local - Limerick LeaderTED KENNEDY IN IRELAND - British Path√© * The annual St. Patrick's Day parade takes place on O'Connell Street every year on the 17 March as well as the annual Limerick International Marching Band Competition which takes place on the weekend nearest to St. Patrick's Day. Present O'Connell Street, along with much of Limerick city centre, is in decline and has been for some time. Some of the reasons for this are: * the depopulation of the city centre from the 1950s onwards * the movement of industry and State services from city centre areas to suburban areas, and lack of replacement * what some hold to be a disastrous retail strategy by the local authorities (Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council), that saw (in some cases) the construction of large shopping centres in suburban areas, now more accessible by car to the general public with a better selection of shops, and in direct competition with City Centre traders. * upward-only rent reviews, the economic collapse of 2008 onwards coupled with the reduction of footfall on the street, and an unemployment rate in the city of 28.6% (CSO figures released in 2012), that resulted in the closure of many of the stores on O'Connell Street which accelerated the decline from 2008 onwards * high vacancy rates on streets leading to O'Connell Street with little or no retail offering or business activity on Rutland Street, Patrick Street (The Opera Centre) or Sarsfield Street.

It was founded in 1934. It is headquartered at the 12th century Ch√¢teau of Clos de Vougeot in the C√¥te d'Or region of France. It maintains chapters worldwide, called Sous-Commanderies, but because of its Gallic origins, its name and many of its ceremonial titles are always maintained in French. History The Confr√©rie, as it exists today, was founded in 1934. Its origins come from the earlier Order of the Free Drinkers of Burgundy. The initial idea was to reinvigorate the wine industry in the region during the economic turmoil of the mid-century. The first Chapitre was held on 16 November 1934 in the Caveau Nuiton cellar in Nuits-Saint- Georges.The Confr√©rie Organization, the History and Traditions, Tastevincanada.comEric Grundhauser, A Look At Mr. Wonderful‚Äôs Secret Society for Wine Snobs, Atlasobscura.com, 9 February 2016 The American branch was created on 27 March 1940 in New York by Jules Bohy (Washington DC opened in 1946).Valerie Cruice, Fraternity gathers for love of wine, Nytimes.com, 8 June 1986 In 1944, the founders of the Confr√©rie bought the Ch√¢teau of Clos de Vougeot, made it its headquarters, and started a long renovation process.  Organization  The Confr√©rie is governed by a Grand Conseil of Chevaliers. Its president is called the Grand-ma√Ætre and its secretary is called the Grand Conn√©table (Louis-Marc Chevignard). In the USA, the organization delegates authority to a Grand pilier, who is also assisted by a Grand conn√©table. Candidates for membership are approved by the Grand pilier or Grand conn√©table, and are confirmed by the Grand Conseil. New members are knighted with a petrified grapevine root from Burgundy. Members are hierarchically ranked (in descending order) as Grand officier, Officier-commandeur, Commandeur, and Chevalier. The Confr√©rie counts among its membership businessmen, luminaries, and celebrities, including politicians and military leaders, diplomats, executives, scholars, athletes, musicians, and artists. During initiation ceremonies, members wear ornate robes similar to the academic gowns worn by Doctors of Theology in sixteenth-century France. During the knight induction process, the following sentence is pronounced : (Through Noah, father of vines, Bacchus, god of wine, Saint-Vincent, patron of winemakers, We make you Knight of Tastevin).Juliet Cullinan, Queen of the Tastevin, Julietcullinan.co.za, 21 May 2018 The primary aims of the organisation are \\"to hold in high regard and promote Burgundian produce, particularly her great wines and regional cuisine. To maintain and revive the festivities, customs and traditions of Burgundian folklore,\\" and \\"to encourage people from all over the world to visit Burgundy.\\"Confr√©rie des Chevaliers du Tastevin, booklet (June 1959). In 2016, the membership was around 12,000 worldwide (2,300 in the USA alone). The confr√©rie accepts men and women. There are 33 Chapitres in the USA.  Activities  A membership certificate for the Confr√©rie des Chevaliers du Tastevin The organization's activities are generally scheduled around elaborate chapter dinners and other culinary events, at which Burgundian wines are served (although sometimes other quality French wines are sampled). At these events, it is customary for members to comment in detail about the history and characteristics of each wine or dish that is served, in order to promote \\"viticultural and gastronomic education\\". Each Chapitre collects and stores its own wine, with one member assigned to the cellar. The most important annual event of the Confr√©rie is the tasting of Burgundy wines, called \\"Tastevinage\\", at the Ch√¢teau de Vougeot, where those deemed worthy by a jury of tasters are awarded the title of \\"Tastevin√©\\" and are permitted to use a special label on their bottles.

Overview In the field of computer science a conceptual model aims to express the meaning of terms and concepts used by domain experts to discuss the problem, and to find the correct relationships between different concepts. The conceptual model is explicitly chosen to be independent of design or implementation concerns, for example, concurrency or data storage. Conceptual modeling in computer science should not be confused with other modeling disciplines within the broader field of conceptual models such as data modelling, logical modelling and physical modelling. The conceptual model attempts to clarify the meaning of various, usually ambiguous terms, and ensure that confusion caused by different interpretations of the terms and concepts cannot occur. Such differing interpretations could easily cause confusion amongst stakeholders, especially those responsible for designing and implementing a solution, where the conceptual model provides a key artifact of business understanding and clarity. Once the domain concepts have been modeled, the model becomes a stable basis for subsequent development of applications in the domain. The concepts of the conceptual model can be mapped into physical design or implementation constructs using either manual or automated code generation approaches. The realization of conceptual models of many domains can be combined to a coherent platform. A conceptual model can be described using various notations, such as UML, ORM or OMT for object modelling, ITE, or IDEF1X for Entity Relationship Modelling. In UML notation, the conceptual model is often described with a class diagram in which classes represent concepts, associations represent relationships between concepts and role types of an association represent role types taken by instances of the modelled concepts in various situations. In ER notation, the conceptual model is described with an ER Diagram in which entities represent concepts, cardinality and optionality represent relationships between concepts. Regardless of the notation used, it is important not to compromise the richness and clarity of the business meaning depicted in the conceptual model by expressing it directly in a form influenced by design or implementation concerns. This is often used for defining different processes in a particular company or institute.

It served the village of Grimsargh in Lancashire, England. When the line first opened in 1840, wagons carrying quarried stone ran downhill from Longridge to Preston and were hauled in the other direction by horses.Till, pp.88-89 There were rudimentary passenger facilities at Grimsargh -- the nearby Plough Hotel was used as a booking office. It was not until 1870 that a proper station building was constructed, when the line was run jointly by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the London and North Western Railway.Suggitt, p.51 In 1889, the privately run Whittingham Hospital Railway was opened to a second Grimsargh Station which was diagonally opposite the level crossing from the main station. This station had a run-around loop and a connection with the Longridge line facing in the direction of Longridge. Two sidings were also provided. On a single short platform, the station building comprised an open fronted shed of brick and wood with an overall roof and canopy.

They continue to produce videos and are in the process of archiving their extensive collection of early videos and high resolution videos, many of which can be viewed on their Soundings of the Planet YouTube Channel. In 1979, Dean and Dudley Evenson, founded the independent record company Soundings of the Planet in Tucson, Arizona. Over the years he has collaborated with many world class artists as a producer and musician, including Li Xiangting, master of the guqin (Chinese 7-string zither), Sergey Kuryokhin, Russian avant-garde composer and Native American elder Cha-das-ska-dum. The Dalai Lama even appears on one of his albums. He has also collaborated with Hungarian pianist Tom Barabas, trance guitarist Scott Huckabay, harpist d'Rachael, and Tim Alexander, innovative drummer from the rock group Primus (band). He lives with his wife, Dudley, in the Pacific Northwest by a wild river in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. They have three children and one granddaughter. Soundings of the Planet has two YouTube channels. Soundings of the Planet YouTube which focuses on music and nature videos and Soundings Mindful Media YouTube which focuses on archival videos dating back to 1970 and more recent documentaries and spoken word videos. They also produce the award-winning Soundings Podcast with interviews of thought leaders that can be heard on iTunes and Spotify or on their website soundings.com.

The series is written by Darin Wagner and illustrated by Clint Hilinski and Andrew Dalhouse. The series is recognized as the first Alias comic to feature traditional superheroes and contains such themes as the importance of fatherhood and the shallow nature of fame. Characters The Hyper-Actives are made up of teenaged superheroes recruited by Alphaman, the premiere superhero of the continuity featured within the book. Alphaman, an obvious homage to Superman, is essentially their mentor and they are essentially his wards, not unlike the relationship Batman has with Robin. As of Issue #03, the team's roster is as follows: *Silverwing: A legacy-type superhero and most recent recipient of the \\"Silverwing Essence\\" *Reactor Girl: A nuclear-powered supergirl and daughter of Alphaman *Rush: Self-appointed leader of the team, superspeed hero and son of Alphaman *Surefire: A weapon master, similar to the Marvel Comics anti-hero Punisher, though more satirical *Honeychild: An African-American superheroine resembling Marvel Comics' Wasp *Wereclaw: A feral looking, wolfman-type character *Boy Genius: An inventive super-genius and the youngest member of the team *Panzer: An apparently German superhero with the size, power and texture of a tank *Scandal: Warps probability fields (\\"causing trouble\\"), possibly invisibility Story Hyper-Actives #00 is a 10-page preview issue which introduces the team and depicts them losing a fight with a cold-powered supervillain named Thrillchiller. The team is unfocused and too preoccupied with the nearby news crew to be effective in preventing Thrillchiller's jail break. Afterwards, Rush is shown blowing off the loss to a tabloid television reporter. This issue also introduces the character of Eddie Ellison, a high school student who eventually becomes the newest member of the team as Silverwing. Hyper- Actives #01 depicts the death of the long-running superhero named Silverwing and Eddie's transformation into the newest incarnation of Silverwing. Eddie is then approached by Alphaman and offered membership in his team, which was named \\"The Hyper-Actives\\" by the media and not Alphaman. Eddie arrives at the team's headquarters, referred to as the \\"Hypersphere\\" and is initially dismissed as a fanboy. It is here that we see superheroes first referring to normal people as \\"peds.\\" The term is derogatory and phonetically reminiscent of the word \\"sped\\" (an inappropriate term used in referring to the mentally disabled). \\"Ped\\" is derived from the word \\"pedestrian\\", which is the word most of the adult superheroes use to describe normal people. The issue ends in a cliffhanger where a team of villains called \\"Uberforce\\" break into the Hypersphere and corner Silverwing. Hyper-Actives #02 continues the story, depicting Silverwing on the verge of single-handedly defeating Uberforce. He is prevented from actually doing so due to the arrival of the rest of the team. They distract Silverwing and he gets rendered unconscious. Uberforce easily defeats the rest of the team, thanks to their preparations made prior to the attack. Uberforce kidnaps two members and the rest of the H-As mount a rescue, excluding Silverwing, whom they reject as a member. The team makes their way to Uberforce's hideout, leaving Silverwing behind. Silverwing, however, discovers that he can magically modify vehicles into superhero versions (like the Batmobile) and uses his mother's car (so transformed) to follow them. Silverwing arrives in time to save the team from Uberforce. This issue suffered from incomplete copy and some pages have several pieces of dialogue missing while one had all of the dialogue missing. The reason for these omissions is not known, but creator Darin Wagner has stated on various message boards that it was a clerical error and that future reprints of the issue would have the full dialogue present. Hyper-Actives #03 depicts the team attending a yearly superhero convention. This convention is actually more like a real-life comic book convention, except that it features actual superheroes as opposed to actors who play them on TV and in movies. The team displays their obsession with attention in force at the con, and Rush in particular demonstrates his apathy toward the pedestrians in attendance. (At one point Rush casually takes a pedestrian's cell phone, interrupting the man's own phone call, so Rush can call his press agent. When the man protests, Rush says \\"Quiet ped! Can't you see Rush is on the phone?!\\"). During the convention, Reactor Girl is drawn into a catfight with a walk-on superheroine referred to as \\"K\\" (an obvious parody of Supergirl). The convention is interrupted by a mechanical menace called Ultimato, who constantly declares that he is indestructible and cannot be stopped. Rush initially ignores the threat, instead taking the opportunity for an interview from the media personnel in attendance, but eventually takes charge and attempts to convince Ultimato to destroy himself... citing numerous instances in which that technique worked. Silverwing, however, notices a weakness in Ultimato's chassis and, once Rush's plan fails, rallies the team to his side to try a physical assault. Rush does not join them and demonstrates immaturity and jealousy in doing so. The team defeats Ulitimato and is rewarded with a media blitz while Rush looks on from afar with a spiteful look. Hyper-Actives #04 takes place an unknown number of days after the convention and mostly in the Hypersphere. A black political pundit, referred to as a \\"mayor\\", is shown in a televised interview as criticizing the existence of the new Silverwing. He demands to know what happened to the previous one (who was black) and cites an overall shortage of black superheroes. (The \\"Mayor\\" is an obvious pastiche of New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, who once referred to New Orleans as a \\"chocolate city.\\" The \\"Mayor\\" character refers to Silverwing as being a \\"chocolate superhero.\\") Rush attempts to use this interview as leverage to get a consensus from the rest of the team that they should kick Silverwing. The team does not want to, feeling good about their Ultimato victory. Wereclaw then flips the channel and shows that the footage of the argument Rush had with Silverwing outside the convention has actually been receiving more airtime than the pundit. Not having achieved the consensus he desired, Rush confronts Silverwing (who is in Eddie Ellison form) and demands that he pack up and leave, calling him a \\"ped\\" a number of times. Silverwing then gives Rush the etymology of the term, which is short for pedestrian, and defines it as \\"someone who travels on foot.\\" As Rush is a superspeed runner, he is enraged by this and goes on a miniature megolomaniacal rant, declaring himself to be \\"the modern Mercury, the god of speed\\" and also manages to refer to Silverwing as \\"uppity.\\" Silverwing then informs Rush that Mercury wasn't the god of anything, but rather the messenger of the gods and \\"had a paper route.\\" (Rush demonstrated in the first issue that he abhorred the idea of having to work for a newspaper when it was suggested that his father, Alphaman, would make him take such a job if he didn't keep up on current events.) Rush zooms out of Silverwing's room in frustration and confronts Alphaman, demanding that Silverwing be removed from the team. Rush doesn't notice that Alphaman is holding a strange device in his hand. Alphaman attacks Rush, blasting at him with his laservision. Rush escapes death by vibrating, but the Hypersphere is partially destroyed by the attack. By the time the rest of the team is on the scene, Alphaman has flown off. Boy Genius identifies the device Alphaman was holding as having been constructed by Doktor Uberkoff (leader of the Uberforce). Uberkoff's attack on the sphere in issue one was a diversion in order to plant the device, which has bent Alphaman to his will. Silverwing concludes that Uberkoff was counting on the team's self-absorbed attitude to conceal the true nature of his attack. The team (minus Rush) then intercepts Alphaman and attempts to stop him from joining Uberkoff, while Rush speeds to the prison where Uberkoff is being held in order to somehow break his control over Alphaman. Rush narrowly reaches Uberkoff in time, having had to fight his way through Uberforce first to get to him. The issue ends with Silverwing in Alphaman's office and Alphaman confiding to Silverwing that he intends for Silverwing to be the team's leader.

It served the town of Longridge in Lancashire, England. The line first opened in 1840 to carry stone from the recently opened Tootle Heights quarry on the northeastern side of the village of Longridge, as it then was. Wagons carrying quarried stone ran downhill to Preston and were hauled in the other direction by horses.Till, pp.88-89; Pattinson, p.5 There were rudimentary passenger facilities at a level crossing in Burey Lane (later called Berry Lane) which at the time was a rural lane with only a couple of houses; the village of Longridge was at the southeast end of the lane. A hotel was built next to the station, and was known as the Longridge Railway Tavern and the Station Hotel before being renamed in 1853 the Towneley Arms, as it is still known today.Pattinson, p.19; Till, pp.127 & 158 After the railway converted to steam power in 1848,Suggitt, p.50; Pattinson, p.5; Till, p.92 Longridge expanded rapidly. Four cotton mills were built alongside the railway and Berry Lane became the town centre.Pattinson, p.6 By 1867, the railway was owned jointly by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the London and North Western Railway, and three years later the railway bought the Towneley Arms. A station building was built on the side of the hotel in 1872.Suggitt, p.51; Pattinson, p.6 On the opposite side of Berry Lane were many goods sidings, for the local mills, gasworks and a coal merchant.

Built in the early-1900s, it was home to Mary McLeod Bethune (1875-1955), a prominent African-American educator and civil rights leader, from 1913 until her death. It was designated a United States National Historic Landmark in 1974 It is now managed by the Mary McLeod Bethune Foundation as a historic house museum. Description and history The Mary McLeod Bethune Home is located on the northeast side of the Bethune- Cookman campus, west of Doctor Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. It is a modest two-story frame house. Stylistically, it is an American Foursquare, with wings extending to the sides, and a hip-roof porch across the front. The house is not architecturally distinguished, and is typical of its period of construction. A brick addition, added in 1953, houses papers and documents of the Bethune Foundation. The house was built about 1904-05, and was purchased by the Daytona Educational and Industrial Training School (now Bethune-Cookman University) in 1913 as the residence of Mary McLeod Bethune, the school's founder. Bethune, an African-American born to formerly enslaved parents, achieved nationwide notice for her success in establishing the school, and went on to play an important role in the advance of education and civil rights, particularly in the years between World War I and World War II. She was a good friend of Eleanor and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and acted as an advisor to Roosevelt during his presidency in the 1930s. The Mary McLeod Bethune Foundation was founded in 1953 to preserve her legacy, and is now responsible for the house's maintenance. It is normally open to the public as a historic house museum, interpreting Bethune's life. It closed in 2006 for significant $720,000 renovation and conservation, and reopened in April 2011.Iacuzio, Tom. \\"Mary McLeod Bethune's 'Retreat' Reopens in Daytona Beach.\\" Daytona Beach News-Journal.

She was elected president of the Indian National Congress at its 47th annual session at Calcutta in 1933. Family Born Edith Ellen Gray, she was the daughter of Frederick and Edith Henrietta Gray.Sushila Nayar and Kamla Mankekar (2002). Women pioneers in India's renaissance, as I remember her: contributions from eminent women of present- day India. India: National Book Trust. p. 167. She was born and brought up in Cambridge, where her father worked at a club. As a young girl, she fell in love with Jatindra Mohan Sengupta, a young Bengali student at Downing College who lodged at her parental home. Despite parental opposition, she married Jatindra Mohan and returned to Calcutta with him. Nellie as she was known and Jatin had two sons Sishir and Anil. Non-Cooperation Movement On returning to India, Nellie's husband Jatindra Mohan started a very successful career as a lawyer in Calcutta. In 1921 Jatindra Mohan joined the Indian freedom struggle and was Mahatma Gandhi's right-hand man in Bengal apart from being the Mayor of Calcutta for three terms and the head of the Legislative Assembly. Nellie joined her husband in participating in the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1921. After his imprisonment during the Assam-Bengal Railwaymen's strike, she forcefully protested against the District authorities imposition of a ban on assembly, addressed mass meetings and courted arrest. She defied the law by selling Khadi (hand-spun cloth) door to door. In 1931 she suffered four months' imprisonment at Delhi for addressing an unlawful assembly. Jatin was imprisoned in Ranchi and died in 1933. Congress president During the turmoil of the Salt Satyagraha many senior Congress leaders were imprisoned. Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya the President elect of the Congress was arrested before the Calcutta Session of 1933. Nellie Sengupta was elected in his place, thus becoming the third woman, and the second European-born woman to be elected. She was elected President by the party for her contribution to the party and the country. She was also elected as an Alderman to the Calcutta Corporation in 1933 and 1936. She was also elected on a Congress ticket to the Bengal Legislative Assembly in 1940 and 1946. During the Second World War she drew attention to the misbehaviour of foreign troops. Post-independence After independence, she chose to live in East Pakistan, in her husband's hometown of Chittagong on the specific request of the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru who asked her to look after the interests of the Hindu minority in East Pakistan. She was elected unopposed to the East Pakistan Legislative Assembly in 1954. She was a member of the Minority Board and remained an active social activist. When Bangladesh came into being in 1971 she continued to live on in Chittagong and was well cared for by the Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In 1972 she broke her hip and through the intervention of Indira Gandhi she was brought to Calcutta where she was operated on and all medical expenses were paid for by the Indian government. She was accorded a tremendous welcome in Calcutta and honoured by both the government and the people for her contribution to both the Indian Freedom struggle along with her husband Deshapriya Jatindra Mohan Sengupta and her work for the minorities in Bangladesh. She died in Calcutta in 1973.

The figure was in direct competition with Action Man by Palitoy and in the same manner as the competing product, offered a variety of alternative outfits and accessories. It is rumoured that the designers at Pedigree had contacts within the British Ministry of Defence and hence were able to get accurate drawings of British military weapons and dress leading to better models than Palitoy could offer - for instance, the boots had actual laces in them. The standard of construction of the dolls was also considered better by some, and it did indeed offer a better level of articulation than primary competitor Action Man; having better and more authentic shaped hands and grip gave more equipment holding options and was, more importantly, able to stand, run stooped, and adopt a 'kneel + firing' position without alternative support, much easier than the Action Man figure. Whilst Action Man originally offered the ability to acquire a free figure (although these models were production 'seconds' often arriving with two of same hand, or overly stiff or impaired articulation etc.) by collection of on- pack 'stars' (which were relative in value to the cost of the item), Tommy Gunn included a 'cigarette style' Medal card in each pack. These were saved onto a presentation card and sent off when the set was completed. The card and 'perfect/boxed' new figure were returned together. However, sadly, the presentation cards were red biro (indelible ball point) inked crossed, which seemed a shame as the cards were very detailed and thus, spoilt the presentation. Despite all this, they were unable to offer the same wide range as Palitoy who had access to all Hasbro's designs and Tommy Gunn sold in much lower volumes and production was halted in 1968. After Tommy Gunn's demise, Palitoy shifted the theme of Action Man towards British armed forces rather than following Hasbro's American outfits. Whether this was related is debatable. Pedigree Toys went on to use the body moulds for Tommy Gunn to make action figures of the characters from the TV series Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and these sold well for a brief period. Tommy Gunn and the Captain Scarlet figures are now very rare and are highly collectable.

The Act was introduced for the protection of shipowners, following a petition presented to the House of Commons, and passed without a division in either House. It imposed a limit on the liability of shipowners in regards to goods embezzled by the master or crew of the ship carrying them. The liability for any loss or damage of goods was limited to the value of the vessel, her equipment, and any freight due for the voyage. The Act was held to apply in the case of Sutton v. Mitchell, (1785) 1 T.R. 18, where goods were stolen from a ship moored in the Thames by robbers colluding with a member of the crew. However, this emphasised the liability shipowners were still exposed to in cases where the goods were stolen without the involvement of the crew; as a result, a second petition was brought to the House, leading to the passage of the Merchant Shipping Act 1786.

NCHS serves parts of Normal, Bloomington, and Towanda and is home to over 2,000 students (grades 9‚Äì12) with 150 faculty and staff. History Normal Community High School was founded in 1905. An early NCHS building was built in 1927. It had 14 classrooms, a gymnasium, library, and administrative offices. The average enrollment was 350. By 1954, NCHS had grown to the point where additional classrooms and facilities were needed. This resulted in two additions, one at the north end, housing a cafeteria and music and speech classrooms, and one at the south end, housing a new gymnasium (Arends), physics lab, agriculture lab, metals lab, woodworking lab and electronics lab. Again, in 1967, the growth of the community and increased enrollment resulted in an addition to the NCHS building. This included another new gymnasium (Neuman), a new cafeteria, a new library, new biology and chemistry labs, an automotive lab, new classrooms and office space for the Unit 5 Superintendent. Average student enrollment after this addition was over 1,350 students, peaking at 1,956 in 1974, immediately before the opening of Parkside Junior High School and the movement of 9th grade students to Chiddix and Parkside. The explosive growth of the Unit 5 population base in the 1980s and 1990s, which continues to the present time, led to a need for another high school in Normal, and in 1995, Normal Community West High School, often called simply Normal West, was completed. Some students who would have attended NCHS were transferred to Normal West when the latter opened. Athletic and other rivalries continue to exist between the two schools. On March 21, 2000, the Unit 5 Referendum was passed. This referendum approved a spending budget of over $73 million, of which the State of Illinois would fund nearly $18 million for new construction and renovation of Unit 5 facilities. A new campus opened for NCHS on an entirely new site on Raab Road, northeast of Normal, in August 2003. A portion of the previous NCHS building was remodeled and became a new junior high school (Kingsley Junior High School) for Unit 5. The original 1927 construction was torn down and the 1954 and 1967 sections were completely updated. In the fall of 2003, NCHS officially opened at its new location on Raab Road. This marked the beginning of the first school year at Normal Community's new location. NCHS became the scene of a widely publicized school shooting on September 7, 2012, when a student fired gunshots into the ceiling of a classroom and was tackled by a teacher. Nobody was injured. A 14-year-old student was arrested and charged with 16 felony counts. Academics and courses Some departments offer Advanced Placement (AP) classes. There are classes with several different levels of workload for students of different abilities. There are a few honors classes offered by the Science, Mathematics, and English departments. They include Biology, Chemistry, Algebra II, Geometry, and English I and II. According to the Illinois State Board of Education's online Report Card, 86% of NCHS students in the class of 2012, the most recent class for which the Report Card has information, graduated within four years, down from a peak of 95% in 2010, and 60% were ready for college coursework compared to a 46% average for Illinois high schools. The school did not make Adequate Yearly Progress according to the terms of the No Child Left Behind Act. Note that Adequate Yearly Progress is difficult to achieve when graduation rates are already very high, as they are for NCHS; the school has not been identified for School Improvement according to the AYP specifications of the Act. Athletics and other activities Athletic teams representing NCHS have long been nicknamed the \\"Ironmen.\\" The school currently plays basketball, football, etc., as a member of the \\"Big Twelve\\" Conference along with its crosstown rivals at Normal West, Bloomington High School, and others, although there are presently fewer than twelve teams in the Big Twelve owing to the departures of some schools to conferences with schools more nearly their own size. NCHS teams played for many years in the Corn Belt Conference but eventually departed due to school-size issues. Demographics According to the Illinois State Board of Education's online Report Card, the student body as of the 2015-2016 school year was composed of the following ethnicities: 66.1% White, 11.9% Black, 7.7% Hispanic, 8.6% Asian, 0.5% American Indian, 4.9% Multi Racial/Ethnicity, and 0.5% Pacific Islander. 26.6% of the student body qualified as Low Income Students, and 12.5% received special education services.

The Pakistani city of Abbottabad was founded by and named after him. Early life James Abbott was the third son of Henry Alexius Abbott, a retired Calcutta merchant of Blackheath, Kent,Biog. Of Henry Alexius Abbot per the obituaries of his prominent sons and his wife Margaret Welsh, the daughter of William Welsh of Edinburgh. Abbott was educated at a school in Eliot Place, Blackheath and at the East India Company Military Seminary in Addiscombe, Surrey.Nicholas Storey, Great British Adventurers, 2012, Casemate Publishers, page 29 A number of his siblings achieved distinction, notably Augustus Abbott, Sir Frederick Abbott, Saunders Alexius Abbott and Keith Edward Abbott. Early career in India He was commissioned as a cadet in the Bengal Artillery at the age of sixteen, arriving in India in 1823.Chambers Biographical Dictionary, , page 2 He first saw action at the Siege of Bharatpur under the command of his older brother Augustus. In 1827 he was promoted to lieutenant and made adjutant to the Sirhind division of artillery. During this period he saw little action, and between 1835 and 1836 was assigned to the revenue surveys in Gorakhpur and later Bareilly.Nicholas Storey, Great British Adventurers, 2012, Casemate Publishers, page 30 In June 1838 he was promoted to brevet captain. The Great Game In November 1838, Abbott served in the army of Sir John Keane, who had been tasked with supporting Shuja Shah Durrani in his bid to wrest power from Dost Mohammad Khan in Afghanistan. The British had been eager to secure Afghanistan, the gateway to India, in light of increasing Russian influence in the central Asia. In 1839 the British learned that Russia was planning an invasion of the Khanate of Khiva. In December 1839 acting Captain Abbott was sent from Herat to Khiva in an attempt to negotiate the release of Russian slaves and thereby deny the Russians a pretext for invasion. If war had already broken out, Abbott was instructed to attempt to negotiate a settlement. Abbott reached Khiva in late January, a week or so before the Russians were forced to turn back due to an unusually cold winter. The Khivans knew little of Britain and he was hampered by a lack of understanding of Khivan language and culture. The attempt to release Russian slaves failed. He did agree with the Khivan ruler, Allah Quli Khan, to establish a British agent in Khiva and to travel to Russia to negotiate between the two powers. He had no authorisation to serve as the Khan's agent, but had no way to communicate with his superiors in India. In March 1840 Abbott set off from Khiva to Fort Alexandrovsk on the Caspian Sea. His caravan was attacked by Kazakhs and he was wounded in the hand and taken hostage, but he and his party were released because they feared retribution. He reached St Petersburg but the attempt at mediation failed. His bravery was recognised through promotion to full Captain.Great British Adventurers by Nicholas Storey.

He first held a post with a local battalion in Mewar before becoming assistant to the Resident in Indore in 1842. Following the conclusion of the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1846, Abbott was hand picked to become one of Sir Henry Lawrence's \\"Young Men\\", also known as The Paladins of the Punjab. These were East India Company officers sent to act as \\"advisers\\" to the Sikh ruler.Isobel Shaw, Pakistan Handbook, Hong Kong, Local Colour Limited, (1998) p.519 Sir Henry Lawrence remarked of him:H. Allen, Narrative of a Journey from Heraut To Khiva, Moscow and St. Petersburgh, During the Late Russian Invasion of Khiva; with Some Account of the Court of Khiva and the Kingdom of Khaurism As part of the terms of the Treaty of Lahore signed after the defeat of the Sikhs in the First Sikh War, Hazara and Kashmir were to be transferred to Raja Gulab Singh; Hazara, however, proved an intractable charge and was returned to the Lahore government by Gulab Singh in January 1847, in exchange for Jammu.The Hazara District Gazetteer, 1883-84, Pub. by the Government of the Punjab, Lahore, 1884, pp.41-47 Abbott was appointed assistant to Chattar Singh Attariwalla to quell unrest and undertake a survey of revenues. Abbott succeeded in this by learning the language, culture and religion of the local people and promoting their social and economic interests. He made himself popular with Pashtun elders by permitting the call to prayer, which had been banned by the Sikhs.David Loyn, Butcher and Bolt, Random House, 27 May 2009, page 88 During the Second Anglo-Sikh War, cut off from all communication with British troops, and dependent upon his own resources, Abbott held the Margalla pass with a vastly inferior force until the conclusion of the war, a feat for which he was thanked by the Governor-General, The Earl of Dalhousie:Abbott, Augustus, Low, Charles Rathbone, The Afghan war, 1838-1842 : from the journal and correspondence of the late Major - General Augustus Abbott, 1879, London : R. Bentley and son Abbottabad and later life After the British had annexed the Punjab in the aftermath of the Second Anglo-Sikh War, Abbott was promoted to brevet major and appointed First Deputy Commissioner of Hazara. In 1852, he successfully commanded an expedition to the Black Mountain following the murder of Mr Carne and Mr Tapp, collector and sub-collector of the salt tax by a party of sixty Hussunzyes. Abbott's original seat of government in the Hazara was at Haripur but he eventually decided to shift this up into the hills for climatic and strategic reasons.Omer Tarin and SD Najmuddin, \\"Five Early Military Graves at the Old Christian Cemetery, Abbottabad, c 1853-1888\\", in the 'Kipling Journal', December 2010, Vol 84 No 339, p.37 Thus, a site was selected and acquired in late 1852, and Abbott thereafter shifted his headquarters there in January 1853, founding a small town and military cantonment which was to grow over time. Abbott himself could not long witness the growth of his town, which was later named after him by his colleague Herbert Benjamin Edwardes. In April 1853 he was removed from his post and transferred back to the Bengal Army, where he was placed in charge of a gunpowder factory in Calcutta.Charles Allen, Soldier Sahibs: The Men Who Made the North-West Frontier, Hachette UK, 21 Jun 2012 His transfer came amid concerns from Lahore over the methods of his governance, fears of divided loyalty, and antagonistic relationships with certain fellow officers. His last public act as Deputy Commissioner was to invite every person in the district to a party he was holding at Nara Hills. The party lasted three days and nights and was attended by 'a large and lamenting crowd of people'.Nicholas Storey, Great British Adventurers, 2012, Casemate Publishers, page 32 Abbott reportedly spent all of his savings on the party save for one month's pay. His affection for the local Hazara's was noted by his successor Herbert Edwardes who wrote: Before he left he also penned an ode to his new settlement: > I remember the day when I first came here And smelt the sweet Abbottabad air > The trees and ground covered with snow Gave us indeed a brilliant show To me > the place seemed like a dream And far ran a lonesome stream The wind hissed > as if welcoming us The pine swayed creating a lot of fuss And the tiny > cuckoo sang it away A song very melodious and gay I adored the place from > the first sight And was happy that my coming here was right And eight good > years here passed very soon And we leave you perhaps on a sunny noon Oh > Abbottabad we are leaving you now To your natural beauty do I bow Perhaps > your wind's sound will never reach my ear My gift for you is a few sad tears > I bid you farewell with a heavy heart Never from my mind will your memories > thwart. In 1857, Abbott was promoted to lieutenant-colonel, made a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 24 May 1873 and a general on his retirement in 1877. He settled in Ryde on the Isle of Wight in 1890 and was made a Knight Commander on 26 May 1894. He died on the Isle of Wight in 1896. He is buried with his second wife in Guildford, Surrey.

III, c.86) was an Act of Parliament of the Parliament of Great Britain passed in 1786. The Act stemmed from a petition made to Parliament by a delegation of shipowners in 1786, concerned that recent court cases had put them at risk of significantly greater liabilities in case of loss or damage to cargo. It was passed by Parliament without a division in either House. Section I of the Act imposed a limit on the liability of shipowners in regards to goods lost or damaged in a robbery, regardless of whether the robbers were part of the crew of the ship or not. The liability for any loss or damage of goods was limited to the value of the vessel, her equipment, and any freight due for the voyage. This was an extension to the provisions of the Responsibility of Shipowners Act 1733, as the case of Sutton v. Mitchell, (1785) 1 T.R. 18, had highlighted that the 1733 Act would give no protection to shipowners where a ship was robbed without the collusion of the crew. Section II provided that the liability of the owner in case of fire was entirely removed, a reaction to Forward v. Pittard, (1785) I T.R. 27, where a shipowner had been held liable for loss from an accidental fire. Section III provided that the shipowner was under no liability at all in the case of stolen valuables (gold, silver, jewels, watches, etc.) unless the bill of lading clearly stated their nature, quality and value.Fletcher, pp. 175-176.

She born in 1904 in an upper middle class Brahmo family. She was the daughter of Barrister Kumud Nath Sen, whom she had lost when she was only two and a half years old, and Snehalata Sen, who brought her up. Early life and education Malati‚Äôs family originally belonged to Kamarakhanda in Bikrampur, Dhaka, (now in Bangladesh), but her family members had settled in Simultala, Bihar. Her maternal grandfather was Behari Lal Gupta, ICS, who became the Dewan of Baroda. Her first cousins on her mother's side of the family were Ranajit Gupta, ICS, a former Chief Secretary of West Bengal, and Indrajit Gupta, the famous parliamentarian and former Home Minister of India. Here eldest brother, P. K. Sen Gupta, a former Income Tax Commissioner, belonged to the Indian Revenue Service, and another brother, K. P. Sen, a former Postmaster General, was from the Indian Postal Service. Being the youngest child of her parents, she was a darling of all her brothers and sister. Her mother Snehalata was a writer in her own right, and had translated some works of Tagore, as is seen from her book Jugalanjali. Malati Choudhury adopted to a completely different life style once she joined Rabindranath Tagore's Vishva-Bharati. In an article entitled ‚ÄòReminiscences of Santiniketan‚Äô, her mother had written: \\"Malati was very happy and benefited much from her residence at Viswa-Bharati as a student. The personal influence of Gurudev and his teachings, his patriotism and idealism, have influenced and guided Malati throughout her life.\\" She was fortunate enough to have been deeply influenced by both Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi.Here commitment to the teachings of Tagore was evident in her acceptance speech on receiving the Tagore Literacy Award given by the Indian Adult Education Association in 1995. She said: \\"I feel doubly honoured to receive the Award, which is named after Kabiguru Rabindranath Tagore, to commemorate his memorable achievements in bringing a synthesis among culture, music and aesthetics in evolving and practising his unique philosophy and principles of education. Like Rousseau, Gurudev did not want purposefulness, belonging to the adult mind, to be forced upon the children in school. He believed that once purposefulness was introduced, it brought torture to the child, as it went against the purpose of nature. According to Tagore, nature was the greatest of all teachers for the child. He had tremendous faith in the educational value of natural objects. Natural events like the beautiful sunrise and sunset, blossoming of flowers and singing of birds are the learning resources for children possessing the natural gift of learning things very easily. He had a great faith in the children‚Äôs natural way of learning. He did not insist on forced mental feeding as a result of which lessons become a form of torture. Gurudev considered artificial feeding of the mind to be of man‚Äôs most cruel and wasteful mistakes. According to him, the greatest possible gift for children was their own freedom to grow. Tagore also wanted the children to have another kind of freedom ‚Äì the freedom of sympathy with all humanity, a freedom from all national and racial prejudices. Thus, his philosophy of education is based on the ideal of the spiritual unity of all races.\\" She had also said, \\" Rabindranath was always following the ideal to realize, in and through education, the essential unity of man. The way in which he achieved that unity gave him a deep insight into the object of education and its problems.\\" It was the former at whose feet she learnt and acquired some rare values and principles of education, development, art and culture, which had been the guiding principles in her life; and it was the latter who cast a magic spell on her and at whose instance she plunged herself into the freedom struggle. Malati came to Santiniketan in 1921, when she was only sixteen years old, and lived there for a little more than six years. In those days Santiniketan was small and beautiful. There were nine girls of her age living in the hostel called Notun Bari (New House). They were Manjushree, Surekha (who later on became her sister-in-law), Eva, Satyabati, Latika, Saraju, Tapasi, Amita (mother of Professor Amartya Sen) and herself. They attended classes in the open under trees, learnt embroidery, handicrafts, music, dancing, painting and gardening. Leonard Knight Elmhirst, an Englishman, was in charge of the Agricultural Institute at Surul in Sriniketan, and he used to encourage them to learn gardening. Mr. Pearson, another Englishman, also taught them. It was he who inspired Malati to work for the tribals. Gurudev used to take classes on Balaka, when he read poems from his book ‚ÄòBalaka‚Äô, and explained the significance of the poems to them. Miss Stella Kramisch, who came to India on Gurudev‚Äôs invitation, taught them the principles of Indian Art and dancing. Malati and her friends spent very happy days at Santiniketan. As a young student there, she was quite famous for her outgoing personality, taking active part in Gurudev‚Äôs dance dramas and music sessions, as well as being the source of innocent mischiefs in the community. At this time, a young man, Nabakrushna Choudhuri, from a well known family of Orissa, came to Santiniketan as a student. He came from Sabarmati Ashram at the instance of the Mahatma. He had as batchmates G. Ramachandran, B. Gopala Reddy, and Syed Mujtaba Ali. Malati got engaged to and later married Nabakrushna Choudhuri, who later became the Chief Minister of Orissa and the two left Santiniketan in 1927. This proved to be a turning point in her life. Social work and politics Gandhiji used to call her \\"Tofanee\\" She was Tagore's favourite \\"Minu\\" After her marriage, Orissa became her home and her area of activities. The Chaudhuris settled in a small village named Anakhia, now in Jagatsinghpur District of Orissa, where her husband started improved sugarcane cultivation. Apart from agriculture, establishing rapport with the surrounding villages was their main concern. In their concept and scheme of rural reconstruction, people are at the center of activities. Their development depended on their empowerment, which was again the result of education. They started adult education work in the neighbouring villages. Soon came the Salt Satyagraha, and they jumped into the movement. As activists they used principles of education and communication in creating a conducive environment for Satyagraha. Even as prisoners, they taught fellow prisoners, organized choral singing and disseminated Gandhiji‚Äôs teachings. In February 1933 the Chaudhuris organized the Utkal Congress Samajvadi Karmi Sangh, which later became the Orissa Provincial Branch of the All India Congress Socialist Party. Proverbial courage, sheer dynamism and a strong zeal to fight for the rights of the oppressed and have-nots were the dominant features of her character. She was frank and outspoken, and was never afraid to speak up. In 1934, she had accompanied Gandhiji in his \\"padayatra\\" in Orissa. After a daylong walk, he was obviously too tired to visit a Harijan village which was in his itinerary. The villagers, who had waited long, were disappointed, but were prepared to forgive Gandhiji for the minor lapse. Malati Choudhury did not spare Gandhiji, and told him point blank, \\"Bapu, you have not done the right thing.\\" Gandhiji apologized, and cooled her down with his disarming smile. She was arrested several times (in 1921, 1936, 1942) with other women independence activists like Sarala Devi, Ramadevi Choudhury and others and was sent to jailWomen and Social Change in India by Snehalata Panda - 1992 - Page 14 Even before Independence, she had established the Bajiraut Chhatravas at Angul in Orissa in 1946, and the Utkal Navajeevan Mandal, also at Angul, in 1948. The Bajiraut Chhatravas had its genesis in the Prajamandal Movement (the resistance movement organized and sustained by the people) and its initial activities were geared towards providing residential facilities and educational opportunities to the children of the freedom fighters. Over the passage of time, there was a societal demand on the Bajiraut Chhatravas to provide educational facilities to children belonging to the \\"Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes\\" and under-privileged sections of the society coming from all over Orissa. Established in the memory of a twelve- year-old boy Bajiraut, who sacrificed his life by disallowing the British forces to cross Brahmani River by boat, the Bajiraut Chhatravas has become an institution of national importance. The Utkal Navajeevan Mandal is a voluntary organization of repute, engaged in rural development and tribal welfare in the rural and tribal areas of Orissa. The State Resource Centre for Adult Education, which was established by the Government of India, under the auspices of the Utkal Navajeevan Mandal, at Angul in 1978, had done pioneering work in Adult Education. She had organized the ‚ÄòKrusaka Andolana‚Äô (Farmers Movement) as part of the freedom struggle against the zamindars and moneylenders, who exploited the poor. She had seen and experienced the untold sufferings of the people while walking through many villages in Orissa. She had also realized that women were victims of many superstitious beliefs, and they alone were to fight against superstitions for their own empowerment. As a member of the Constituent Assembly of India, she felt restless, because she was not in tune with the views of other members; when the Mahatma's famous Noakhali yatra began, she joined it at the instance of Thakkarbappa. After independence, Malati Choudhury, as a member of the Constituent Assembly of India, and as the President of the Utkal Pradesh Congress Committee, tried her best to emphasize the role of education, especially adult education in rural reconstruction. When Nabakrushna Choudhuri became the Chief Minister of Orissa in 1951, she highlighted the plight of the have-nots, particularly those belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Eventually, she decided not to join politics, because Gandhiji had advised that all Congress activists need not join politics, but should work for and with the people with service as their goal. A dynamic person like her did not slow down her efforts after the Bajiraut Chhatravas, Utkal Navajeevan Mandal and the Postbasic School at Champatimunda, near Angul, were established. She had joined the Bhoodan Movement of Acharya Vinoba Bhave. During the Emergency she raised her voice against the anti-people policy and oppressive measures adopted by the government and was imprisoned. Malati Choudhury lived an eventful life and died at the age of ninety-three.

It was Kalamazoo's first commercial FM station. According to a Billboard magazine article, the station broadcast from 6 a.m. to midnight and aired an MOR music format incorporating selections from current stereo pop albums, Broadway show tunes, and some light classics. * April 1966: Steere Broadcasting changed WKMI-FM's call letters to WSEO, retaining the easy-listening/MOR music format. Station brass explained that since WKMI-FM had become a popular station in its fewer than two years on the air, the change was made to help the station continue to develop its own identity. * June 1972: WSEO was purchased by Fairfield Broadcasting, separating the station from WKMI. Call letters changed to WQLR (\\"Clear\\") and the station settled into a homegrown Beautiful music format which would continue for the next two decades. In the mid-1970s, the station's owners started a beautiful music syndication service called KalaMusic after WOMC in Detroit copied WQLR's formatics and became a ratings success (1). * Early 1990s: WQLR shifted from beautiful music to adult contemporary under the name \\"Q-Lite 106.5.\\" * March 1999: WQLR dropped its longtime \\"Q-Lite 106.5\\" name to become simply \\"Q106.5.\\" * April 2002-March 2003: \\"Q106.5\\" tweaked its AC format to more of a Hot AC approach, adding music by alternative rock artists such as Nickelback and Puddle of Mudd. * January 2006: Midwest Communications announced that it would purchase WQLR and its sister stations, WKZO 590 AM and WQSN 1660 AM, from Fairfield Broadcasting for $13.25 million, pending FCC approval and closing. Not included in the same was WKLZ 1470 AM which was subsequently taken off the air. The sale was approved in March 2006. * August 27, 2006: WQLR moves from AC to Variety hits as \\"106-5 The Q\\", using Midwest's Guaranteed Music Variety format already in use at several of the company's other FM stations. * March 26, 2007: The WQLR callsign is moved to another Midwest Communications station as part of a drive to help listeners remember the WVFM callsigns for Arbitron listener logs. * '2009: The station shifts to its current classic hits-based adult contemporary format. Through all the changes, the station has remained highly rated in the Kalamazoo market.

Biography Education The Kolessa family was a prominent Ukrainian intellectual family living in Lviv, Western Ukraine, which treated music very seriously. The family included a number of professional composers and performers. Her uncle Filaret Kolessa was a noted ethnomusicologist devoted to the research of Ukrainian folk music. Her cousin Mykola Kolessa was a prominent Ukrainian composer and conductor. Chrystia Kolessa, Lubka's sister was an illustrious cellist. Her first lessons came from her grandmother, a pianist who had studied with Karol Mikuli, a pupil of Chopin. Her father Oleksandr Kolessa (1867‚Äì1945) had been elected as a deputy in the Austrian Reichsrat, the parliament of Cisleithania.Harald Binder: Galizien in Wien: Parteien, Wahlen, Fraktionen und Abgeordnete im √úbergang zur Massenpolitik.

It is best known as a nonsteroidal oral contraceptive which is taken once per week. In India, ormeloxifene has been available as birth control since the early 1990s, and it was marketed there under the trade name Saheli, currently available free-of-cost for the women in India as Chhaya (Centchroman). Ormeloxifene has also been licensed under the trade names Novex-DS, Centron, and Sevista. Medical uses Ormeloxifene is primarily used as a contraceptive but may also be effective for dysfunctional uterine bleeding and advanced breast cancer. Birth control Ormeloxifene may be used as a weekly oral contraceptive. The weekly schedule is an advantage for women who prefer an oral contraceptive, but find it difficult or impractical to adhere to a daily schedule required by other oral contraceptives. For the first twelve weeks of use, it is advised to take the ormeloxifene pill twice per week. From the thirteenth week on, it is taken once per week.http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/1fp/1advances/old/1centch/ceorvw.htm The consensus is that backup protection in the first month is a cautious but sensible choice. A standard dose is 30 mg weekly, but 60 mg loading doses can reduce pregnancy rates by 38%. It has a failure rate of about 1-2% with ideal use which is slightly less effective than found for combined oral contraceptive pills. Other indications * Ormeloxifene has also been tested in experimental setting as a treatment for menorrhagia. * use in treatment of mastalgia and fibroadenoma has also been described. Side effects There are concerns that ormeloxifene may cause delayed menstruation. Pharmacology Ormeloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). In some parts of the body, its action is estrogenic (e.g., bones), in other parts of the body, its action is antiestrogenic (e.g., uterus, breasts).Gara Rishi Kumar, Konwar Rituraj, Bid Hemant K and MM Singh. In-vitro anti-cancer breast activity of ormeloxifene is mediated via induction of apoptosis and autophagy. 37th annual conference of the endocrine society of India. 30 Nov ‚Äì 2 Dec 2007. Abstract p. 35. It causes an asynchrony in the menstrual cycle between ovulation and the development of the uterine lining, although its exact mode of action is not well defined. In clinical trials, it caused ovulation to occur later than it normally would in some women, but did not affect ovulation in the majority of women, while causing the lining of the uterus to build more slowly. It speeds the transport of any fertilized egg through the fallopian tubes more quickly than is normal. Presumably, this combination of effects creates an environment such that if fertilization occurs, implantation will not be possible. History Ormeloxifene was first discovered by Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) in Lucknow, India. Ormeloxifene was marketed in Delhi in July 1991 and in India in 1992, under the brand names Saheli and Choice-7.

Its principal task is \\"to preserve the past for the future\\". The library is located both in Oslo and in Mo i Rana. The building in Oslo was restored and reopened in 2005. Prior to the existence of the National Library, the University Library of Oslo was assigned the tasks that normally fall to a national library. The Norwegian ISBN Agency, responsible for assigning ISBNs with prefix 82- and 978-82-, is part of the National Library of Norway. The National Library is also responsible for legal deposits made from publishers in Norway. All material is to be submitted free of charge. History On 15 August 2005, Norway opened a fully functioning national library for the first time in its history. This occurred exactly 100 years after Norway dissolved its union with Sweden. Although gaining independence in 1905 marked the peak of Norwegian nationalism, it took Norway a century to go from being a sovereign nation- state to establishing its own national library. The establishment of the national library evolved as a result of a lengthy political process. Since 1813, the University of Oslo Library had functioned as both a library for the university and a national library. In 1989, Norway established a repository in Rana in the northern part of the country as part of the national library, with a mandate to preserve everything published within the country in compliance with a revised version of the Legal Deposition Act. The University of Oslo Library retained its mandate to preserve historical and unique collections and to make all its collections available to the public. In 1999, these tasks were consolidated within a newly established branch of the national library in Oslo. Provisional arrangements were made for the period between 1999 and 2005, while the library building was being renovated. In 2005, the national library moved into a renovated building in Oslo, which marked the true beginning for this new national institution. With its reopening in 2005, the national library launched its redesigned website. The institution intended to present itself as a modern library, with both a physical presence and a digital appearance. According to the website, it was to be the premier source of information about Norway, Norwegians and Norwegian culture, and Norway‚Äôs main resource for the collection, archiving and distribution of Norwegian media.AKLE, M. (2010). National reproduction: Norway's new national library. Nations & Nationalism, 16(4), 753-773. Digital Library Project (Bokhylla or NBdigital) National Library of Norway has started with digitization process in 2006 with a goal to digitize its entire collection. In October 2012 the Minister of Culture, Hadia Tajik, opened the Bokhylla (‚Ä≥Bookshelf‚Ä≥) website at bokhylla.no as a permanent service. When launched, the service offered 104,000 books online out of estimated 250,000 total books published in Norway before the year 2000. Digital Library of Norway is sometimes also called NBdigital. Due to copyright restrictions, Bokhylla applies IP address blocking to some of the books which are available only for Norwegian IP addresses. For access outside Norwegian IP-space, users have to apply through special form. In 2013, Bokhylla reported 51 million page views served during 2012, which indicates that, for its users, the National Library of Norway is essentially a digital library.

She lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Many of Iris Haeussler's works are detailed, hyperrealistic installations that visitors can decode as narrative stories. Recurring topics in her work include historic, cultural and social origins, such as family ties and relationships, and physical conditions, such as geography architecture and housing. Biography Haeussler studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich under Heribert Sturm. Students at a German academy of fine arts in the 1980s followed a loosely structured curriculum that emphasized studio work. There were few mandatory courses, rather an emphasis was placed on exploration and experiment, practice and critical discussion. Haeussler's experiments were influenced by artistic positions of Wilhelm Lehmbruck and Joseph Beuys; she herself names Medardo Rosso as her most important inspiration. Recognition received include a scholarship of the German Academic Scholarship Foundation, the Karl-Hofer Prize of the Berlin Academy of Fine Arts and a Kunstfonds Fellowship. She has shown widely throughout Europe in the nineties before moving to Toronto, Canada in 2001. Haeussler had a guest professorship at the Munich Academy in 1999. In Toronto she taught sketching and sculpture at the Toronto School of Art from 2005-2013. She has given talks about her work in Germany, Sweden, Australia, the Norwegian Arctic, the US and Canada. Haeussler was trained as a conceptual artist and sculptor, but her work is not easily classified by method or genre: she has had solo-shows of sketches and drawings, sculpture as well as participatory, interactive pieces. However her most notable works are large, immersive installations. Philosopher Mark Kingwell notes: \\"It is an example of what we might label haptic conceptual art: the art of ideas that functions by way of immersion, even ravishment.\\"Kingwell, 2007 With her installations, she creates hyper-real installations by presenting the living situations of fictitious protagonists who have arranged their lives somewhere between obsession and art.Kingwell, 2007 As well as these immersive installations, Haeussler is also known for her studio sculptural work and drawings.  Major Hyper-real Installations  \\"Synthetic Memories\\" is a tag Haeussler applies to her major installations; she sees \\"synthetic\\" as opposed to \\"analytic\\" in the artistic process of creating memory from research, ideas and studio-work.(Kumlehn, 1995) Die Akzeptanz und das Aufscheinen des Humanen trafen [...] aus einer unerwarteten Richtung. Die bettl√§gerige Bewohnerin eines Altersheims sagte: Ich bin stolz, da√ü mein Nachthemd in einer Ausstellung gezeigt wird. Often years in the making, they derive much of their credibility from painstaking attention to site-specific detail and hyper-realist staging. They are also invariably off- site works. For her later installations she adopted a strategy of erasing herself and the conventions of presenting her work as \\"art\\" by creating environments seemingly built up and then abandoned by obsessed and tormented individuals (so called outsiders) living in isolation. * Ou Topos - Wien (1989), Her earliest apartment installation recreated the situation of an aged man in a turn-of-the-century social housing project \\"Ou Topos\\" in Vienna, Austria. Focus of the installation was the bedroom that had been filled with thousands of tin cans of food and preserves, stacked in crude, wooden shelves, each wrapped in thick lead-foil and labeled with their date of expiry.Gockel, 1999 Visitor's explored the space on their own and unsupervised. \\"[The work] sensitizes for the circumstances of others, without trespassing on their intimacy or dignity. In order to create an authentic representation, [Haeussler] has lived in this apartment for half a year. She immersed herself deeply into this unfamiliar space, absorbed the odors of the house, listened to its sounds and adapted her routines to those of the other inhabitants. When the apartment was opened to visitors, fiction and reality appeared superimposed\\".(Gockel, 1999, p. 275) Um ein m√∂glichst authentisches Bild enstehen zu lassen, hat sie selbst ein halbes Jahr in der Wohnung gelebt. Sie ist tief eingetaucht in die ihr fremde Welt, hat die Ger√ºche des Hauses aufgesogen, den Ger√§uschen gelauscht und ihren Lebensstil dem der Hausbewohner angepa√üt. Als die Wohnung f√ºr das Publikum ge√∂ffnet wurde, schienen sich Fiktion und Realit√§t gleichsam zu √ºberlagern. * Pro Polis (1993) was Haeussler's first hotel intervention, staged in a three-star Hotel near the Duomo in Milano,\\"ProPolis\\" - Hotel Gritti ***, Milano Italy. The walls, floor, window and all amenities of a guest room were covered with a thick layer of wax; the installation could be decoded as the activities of a stranded guest, a salesman in industrial materials perhaps, the room abandoned under obscure circumstances. Visitors obtained the key at the reception for an unsupervised experience of the space.J√§ger, 1993 With this work Haeussler \\"reverses the canon of sculpture, in the spirit of the revolutionary sculptor Medardo Rosso, [...as she ...] raises the question of overcoming its intrinsic limitations\\".(Avogadro, 1993) [...] rovescia i canoni della scultura sull'onda della rivoluzianarie sculture di Medardo Rosso. [Haeussler] si pose il problema di superare i limiti intrinseci alla scultura. * Monopati (2000), featured two apartments in two separate cities - Munich and Berlin, Germany. These were transformed into different narratives, but remained connected through a single picture of a school class, taken in the late 1930s that could be seen in both apartments. Visitors were able to obtain the key to the apartments at nearby galleries (Galerie Huber-Goueffon in Munich, Wohnmaschine in Berlin) and proceed on their own into the installation. * The Legacy of Joseph Wagenbach (2006) was Iris Haeussler's first major work in North America and her largest and most complex installation at that time. Curated by Rhonda Corvese and widely reviewed and acclaimed nationally and internationally,cf. project press review this multilayered installation in an entire house in downtown Toronto \\"The Legacy of Joseph Wagenbach\\" - Toronto recounts the life of an aged, reclusive artist, through the mediation of an on-site archivist (often Haeussler herself).Carson, 2007Medicus, 2007 Initially, the project was not publicized as an artwork but presented as an assessment by the fictitious \\"Municipal Archives\\". Haeussler intended to facilitate an unfiltered and unhindered experience of discovery. The subsequent disclosure sparked controversy on the ethics of engaging uninformed visitors in an often emotional encounter with a fictional narrative that is initially presented as fact.Whyte, 2006 Canada's National Post ran the frontpage headline \\"Reclusive downtown artist a hoax\\"George-Cosh, 2006 which prompted Mark Kingwell to deconstruct this \\"miniature narrative of outrage\\" and to clarify that the transformation from fact to fiction in the visitor's experience was indeed central to the work. Novelist Martha Baillie visited the assessment, trusting in the veracity of the presentation. She published an essay on her experience, noting that: \\"She'd had no right to lie to me\\", feeling anger and loss, yet finally conceding: \\"The Joseph Wagenbach I'd created in my mind, [...] nobody could take from me, not even Iris Haeussler. He was mine\\".Baillie, 2007 * The Joseph Wagenbach Foundation marks Haeussler's long-term project, resuming from her 2006 installation and expanding Wagenbach's legacy into a fictitious foundation. Launched officially at the Villa Toronto in January 2015, it offers small edition bronzes of a number of his sculptures and a drawing edition to the public. While the foundation works on digitizing his drawing and sculpture archive, and planning on the dissemination of his work and life, Haeussler states: \\"the Joseph Wagenbach Foundation is a fictitious foundation of a fictitious artist, but his works are real.\\" * He Named Her Amber (2008-2010) was an installation in The Grange, Toronto,\\"He Named Her Amber\\" - The Grange, Toronto curated by David Moos and commissioned by the Art Gallery of Ontario for the re-opening of the Frank Gehry Transformation. Haeussler had invented the character of a 19th-century immigrant servant who followed her habits and passions in secrecy for decades, and excavations conducted about 150 years later by the (also fictitious) company named Anthropological Services Ontario. Guided tours through the extensive site Adler, 2009cf. AGO site-tour information Milroy, 2008 allowed viewing of the astounding findings of personal artifacts as if in a time-capsule embedded in beeswax. In 2012, the Art Gallery of Ontario published a book documenting the project with its complexities of a contemporary art project created, installed and narrated in a historic building, first not labelled as an artwork but as an \\"ongoing excavation\\" and the various and very controversial visitors responses. In November, 2011, the Art Gallery of Ontario published a book documenting the project. * Invited for the 18th Biennale of Sydney, Haeussler developed a work on Cockatoo Island. It was titled He Dreamed Overtime (2012). The story of a former ranger about a lost love he never overcame resulted in his creation of strange beeswax objects that looked like corals of an alien sea, and provoked an investigation of a pest-control company. Ultimately, the company's manager himself got so deeply fascinated by the case that he re-enacted the missing ranger's work in parts, mixed it with his own interpretations and created a vibrant blog on his company's web-site, illustrating his own psychological reconstruction of a world of human desire, sensuality and loss. * Ou Topos - Abandoned Trailer Project, was commissioned for For Nuit Blanche Toronto, 2012. Haeussler revisited her very first apartment installation (OuTopos - a Synthetic Memory) in Vienna in 1989, inventing a grandson to the original protagonist. This new character represented a social dropout, doing obsessive research into surviving environmental degradation due to toxic pollution, in particular nuclear fallout. Without being noticed by the authorities, he managed to install himself, his belongings and experimental lab-like trailer in an underground garage of the Toronto city-hall. * Sophie La Rosi√®re Project (2016-2017) presented the life history of the fictitious French female artist of the early 20th Century. Chapter I, presented at the Art Gallery of York University in 2016, introduced La Rosi√®re's biography and presented a reconstruction of her studio. Chapter II, presented simultaneously at the Scrap Metal Gallery in Toronto, examined some of La Rosi√®re's art works through X-ray analysis and presented video interviews with experts about the veracity and provenance of her work. Chapter III, presented early in 2017, showed many of the artifacts created by \\"La Rosi√®re\\". The fictitious life of Sophie was tightly intertwined with real artists of the era such as Madeleine Smith. The exhibitions received extensive coverage. * Florence Hasard (2017 - 2018) an extension, of the Sophie La Rosi√®re project, this new thread develops the life story of fictitious character and former lover of the aforementioned. This narrative takes us from France to the United States of America and explores further the intricate relationship of these two women and their historical circumstances. Exhibitions include: \\"Tale of Two\\" (2018) and \\"Apartment 4\\" (2018-2019), both presented at the John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, WI. Followed by the Apartment 5 project shown at the Armory Show in New York (2019).  Non-fictional Art Works  \\"Archivio\\" - shelf, on the third day of the project * Archivio (1991) was created within Milano's annual festival of the arts, Milano Poesia, curated by Gianni Sassi. Haeussler had begun work with wax, exploiting its translucency by encasing objects or documents, an act of protection and removal. \\"Archivio\\" was an exhibition of process, a performance in which she collected daily newspaper clippings for the duration of the MILANO POESIA festival, cast them into thin slabs of wax on-site, and ordered them into a large steel shelf. Visitors browsed through the slabs, rearranging them, breaking some; over the duration of the show the archive was transformed into a collection of disorder. Archivio was reinstalled a year later in Prague.Meyer-Stoll, 92 The act of encasing objects in wax would remain a theme in her work to this date. Examples are stacks of wax-tablets that encase the laundry of children and adults, arranged into constellations of family relationships, or panels of gauze-curtains and dresses in which the fabrics' color and texture shimmers through the enclosing wax matrix; they appear as large, ethereal paintings.Fuchs et al., 2001 * Paidi (1994), a gallery show at the Kunstraum, Munich, Germany contained more than 200 passport-size images of infants, taken between 1905 and the present, juxtaposed with 280 samples of mother's milk the artist had collected from nursing mothers. The installation explored how location, social conditions and history define biographies from day one.Erdmann Ziegler, 1994 * Huckepack (1995: Piggyback) was a hotel intervention in which H√§ussler installed the personal belongings of a traveling woman into a room of a downtown hotel in Leipzig,\\"Huckepack\\" - Hotel Leipziger Hof, Leipzig Germany. Germany. Guests were offered an upgrade into this room, if they agreed to share their space with this fictitious person. They were confronted with one of the beds being unmade and a silk-pyjama left on site, one of the towels having been used, an open suitcase with personal items on the dresser, all conspiring to create a virtual, yet tangible physical presence. Although the piece comes with a disclaimer - the guests realize that they are part of an artwork for a night - the intrusion is disorienting and sidesteps confrontation; in the words of curator Klaus Werner: \\"All attempts to unveil the mysterious stranger lead into autobiography.(Werner, 1995 b) Alle Versuche hinter die Geheimnisse des/der Fremden zu kommen enden autobiographisch.\\"\\"On Loan\\" - Installation view * Leihgaben (1995: On Loan) presented laundries, pillowcases and bedsheets Haeussler collected from institutions - an orphanage, a hospital, a prison - to remove them for a short while from their cycles of use. \\"Acceptance and the appearance of a human dimension came [...] from an unexpected direction, when the bedridden inhabitant of a nursing home stated: I am proud to have my nightgown shown in an exhibition.\\" \\\\- such engagement of participants through their unique biographies is characteristic of many of her works. * Xenotope (1994, 1997, 1998, 2000) was a small series of projects that provided temporary overnight accommodation. The first Xenotop in Leipzig furnished a spartan room with bed, desk, TV, towels and bottled water, all painted in a uniform light-grey. Visitors registered at the gallery and received the key for one night, to be spent without further direction or observation. \\"The only cost is to absorb the emptiness.(Werner, 1995 b) Sein Preis daf√ºr ist die Absorption der Leere.\\" Variations of this theme were shown in Bonn, Munich and Friedrichshafen. * Repla¬©e (1997) A piece of Institutional Critique - was a response to an invitation to a \\"Blind Date\\" with Maria Lindberg, by curators Susanne Gaensheimer and Maria Lind. Haeussler sent a non-artist substitute in her place, a scientist who filled the large studio at IASPIS at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, Stockholm, with scientific and educational chalkboard drawings. The project generated controversy, \\"...because it was made suddenly obvious how tightly the acceptance of an artistic work is still bound to the guaranteed authorship of an artistic personality.Fuchs, 2001 (p. 19)\\" * Honest Threads (2009) was a boutique installation in one of Toronto's most idiosyncratic mega-stores: Honest Ed's Department Store, curated by Mona Filip of the Koffler Centre of the Arts. A lush, theatrically furnished show-room held row upon row of framed photographs and very personal stories relating to some piece of garment, contributed by Torontonians.Broverman, 2009Campbell, 2009 Visitors were able to borrow the garments and wear them for a few days, experiencing both literally and psychologically what it is like to \\"walk in someone else's shoes\\".Koffler Centre of the Arts, 2009 This piece loosely built on an earlier project (Transition coat, √úbergangsmantel/P≈Çaszcz Przechodni), 1999, collaboration between Frankfurt (Oder), Germany, and S≈Çubice, Poland, two cities on opposing banks of the Oder river. * Bonavista Biennale (2017) \\"Dust at Dawn\\", Bonavista Peninsula Newfoundland. Large collages show stripes aligned underneath each other, visually evoking lines on ruled paper. The stripes consist of tape mounted from behind on the mylar and showing through. The tape holds dust collected from cracks and door- and window-frames, lint from carpets, dead flies from the floors of dwellings in the area. Institutions Haeussler's major projects include the invention, corporate identity and accessibility of fictitious institutions or corporations that serve as investigators and presenters of the discoveries before they are identified and labelled as artworks to the public.

Although construction was completed in March 1943, the lighthouse was not lit until May 1944 due to concerns of possible enemy invasion. Its original light consisted of eight 200-watt bulbs that were later replaced by a flashing green light in 1960. It was deactivated on June 25, 1967, when the United States Coast Guard Training Station moved to Governors Island. It is officially listed as the last lighthouse built in the state; the only other claimant is the replica Mystic Seaport Light. The lighthouse deteriorated until it was declared a hazard by the University of Connecticut in 1997. A restoration effort was launched in 1999 through the American Lighthouse Foundation (ALF) and in 2000 by a new local chapter, the Avery Point Lighthouse Society. The restoration of the lighthouse began in 2001 and was completed in 2006, requiring a replica lantern and extensive structural repairs and replacement of the crumbling of the blocks. Two bills for $150,000 and $100,000 were appropriated and used to complete the restoration. The relighting and re-dedication of the lighthouse was held on October 15, 2006. The lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.  Construction  Avery Point Light overlooks Fisher's Island Sound from the bluffs at Avery Point The land upon which Avery Point Light was constructed was owned by Morton F. Plant's estate; his Branford Manor is located several hundred feet away. Twenty four years after Plant's death the estate was sold to the state of Connecticut before being transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard. The Coast Guard's deed required the construction and maintenance of beacon lights or other navigational aids as part of the Coast Guard's new training facility. The Avery Point Light was named for Captain James Avery of New London, Connecticut. The Avery Point Light was designed by Alfred Hopkins and Associates to be a 41-foot (12 m) octagonal tower. Construction of the tower was completed in March 1943; it is built of brown concrete blocks and topped with an octagonal wooden lantern. During the restoration effort, it was discovered that six different types of concrete blocks were used in the construction. The tower has a total of five windows, with two facing south and one for the north, east and west. The lantern gallery deck is constructed of concrete and lined with thirty two Italian marble balusters, originally imported from Italy around 1900. The interior has an iron ladder, originally wooden, that leads up to the watchroom level. The lighthouse design and masonry tower have Colonial Revival elements. It is the last lighthouse built in the state of Connecticut as an official navigational aid.  Service  The Avery Point Light was not lighted until May 2, 1944, due to concerns about possible enemy invasions by sea. D'Entremont notes that the first light, consisting of eight 200-watt bulbs, were an unusual array that created a fixed white light source. Though it never had a formal keeper, the lighthouse was tended by personnel or students from the United States Coast Guard Training Station. In 1960, the light was changed to flashing green and the candlepower rating doubled from 100 to 200. The light was deactivated on June 25, 1967 when the training facility moved from Avery Point to Governors Island.  Restoration  In 2000, prior to restoration. The Avery Point Light was listed by the university as being in \\"dangerously poor condition\\" by July 1997 and declared it a safety hazard. In December 2007, Lighthouse Digest included a brief article with the title \\"Avery Point added to Doomsday List\\" after rumors of it being torn down were reported. The article included two images that show the blocked off lighthouse with its crumbling bricks and a sign reading \\"Keep Out Hazardous Area\\". In 1999, fund-raising began to save and restore the lighthouse through the American Lighthouse Foundation (ALF) and in 2000 through the Avery Point Lighthouse Society (APLS), a chapter of the ALF. In 2000, the APLS website estimated $25,000 for the initial engineering study and $150,000-200,000 to complete the restoration. In 2001, Connecticut State Senator Catherine Cook introduced a bill for $150,000 in bonds to fund the restoration of the Avery Point Light; it was later approved. An article in the New London Day also noted an engineering study valued at $40,000 was being conducted for no cost by James Nordon's engineering firm of Gibble, Norden and Champion. On December 1, 2001, the first part of the restoration began with the removal of the lantern. Due to the deterioration of the lantern, the decision was made to make a replica of the original lantern. From 2003 through 2004, the West Mystic Wooden Boat Building Company donated the materials and labor to construct the replica. The company's owner, Steve Jones, has close ties to the Avery Point Light; he is a former lighthouse keeper for the Harbor of Refuge Light in Lewes, Delaware and is also a University of Connecticut professor. The concrete blocks used in the construction were of poor construction due to the high sand content that crumbled with the expanding and contraction of the mortar. The decision was made to replace the outer face of the concrete blocks and strengthen the remaining original blocks with cement and steel reinforcements. A total of 3,000 blocks were needed to complete the restoration and had to be produced using special molds. The restoration work on the tower began in September 2003. Though increased costs of the restoration resulted in another need of funding to complete the project. In 2003, federal funding for another $100,000 came from the National Park Services \\"Save America‚Äôs Treasures Act\\" and it was endorsed by Senators Christopher Dodd and Joseph Lieberman. Delays in the appropriation of funding delayed the second phase of the structural restoration until June 2005; and the work was conducted from July through early November. The relighting and re-dedication of the lighthouse was held on October 15, 2006.  Importance  The lighthouse has been claimed to be a memorial tower in various sources, including the 1994 America's Atlantic Coast Lighthouses: A Traveler's Guide which states \\"the tower was built as a memorial tower and as a symbolic representation of the USCG lighthouse keeping responsibilities.\\" D'Entremont notes that the misunderstanding stems from an article from 1955 in U.S. Coast Guard Magazine and acknowledges that it has come to serve as a memorial.

At the 2006 census, its population was 124,291, in 20,300 families. History In ancient times, the town was actually by the Persian Gulf. However receding water has pushed the coastline 100 km south to where the city of Bushehr is today. This has left vast amounts of salt covered flats from Borazjan to Bushehr. The land is sparkling white. The salt crystals can be used to extract many minerals such as brine and sodium however such extraction does not exist. The surrounding landscape was greener in the past however over grazing and drier climate has killed off most of the vegetation. Many wild animals such as deer, boars and coyotes lived in the area, but they have since gone extinct. The ruins around the city are over three hundred years old. A citadel that was constructed 250 years ago and served as a caravansarai for decades has been transformed into a prison in the last 70 years. Many jewels and treasures have been discovered around the city. Town description Borazjan is the capital city of Dashtestan county, and is the largest city of the province. Approximately 70 km north of Bushehr, it was built based on the waters which flow from Giskan mountains into Dalaki river. Borazjan grew rapidly over the last two decades. The population of the town was 10,000 in 1980, 40,000 in 1990, 75,000 in 2000, and 124,291 in 2006. The two reasons for the growth have been an ever-increasing migration of villagers and nomads from the surrounding area to the city, and an explosive birth rate of 4%. A very large and modern hospital serves the city and far away communities surrounding the city. The hospital has a helipad and a helicopter. This helicopter is not used for the welfare of the general population; it only takes wealthy paying passengers. The city has one large fire department. It has several engines on standby for the city and beyond however it is rarely used. If the engines leave the station it quickly becomes the talk of town as to what happened. The city has no airport. There has consistently been the talk of creating a small airport to serve the town. The nearest airport is in Bushehr about 70 km away. Research in 1992 showed that for every 100 passengers flying out of Bushehr for Tehran 35 were from Borazjan. This is not enough to create an airport but proponents attest that opening one up would encourage the growth of the town. The main street of Borazjan is called Bimarestan Street. Bimarestan translates to Hospital in English. The hospital is located on this street. Many young people drive up and down this street in motor cycles in their free time. The city also has a very large cemetery. The cemetery again serves the town and all the surrounding areas. The cemetery has no cremation facilities as this is not practiced in Iran. The cemetery is very beautiful and has many trees. On Fridays it is very busy with mourners and visitors. Borazjan used to be home to a large Jewish population and locals believe that some Israeli officials are originally from this city. The climate is dry and hot, and main products are dates, flour and tobacco. Economy The main economy of the city is food processing from the nearby fields. The largest silo in all of southern Iran is in Borazjan. It was built with Russian aid and completed in 1971. It houses grain shipped there from the surrounding farms. The cultivation of dates and the processing and packaging of dates is a very important industry. About half of the dates are shipped north to consumers in the rest of the country and half are shipped to Bushehr to be exported to other countries. The nearby farms are almost all privately owned. They average only several acres in size each. A handful of people own very large pieces of land and use very modern machinery to maximize its potential. Farm workers and day labourers are a common sight in these areas. Products grown around the city in order of popularity (not monetary value per se) are wheat, dates, sesame seeds, watermelons, and tomatoes. There are two major flouring mill factories in Borazjan: Al-Zahra and Borazjan flouring mills. Other industry near or around the city consists of furniture making, metal working, small scale manufacturing, and textiles.

Since Perl's pattern-matching constructs have exceeded the capabilities of formal regular expressions for some time, Raku documentation refers to them exclusively as regexes, distancing the term from the formal definition. Raku provides a superset of Perl 5 features with respect to regexes, folding them into a larger framework called rules, which provide the capabilities of a parsing expression grammar, as well as acting as a closure with respect to their lexical scope. Rules are introduced with the \`rule\` keyword, which has a usage quite similar to subroutine definitions. Anonymous rules can be introduced with the \`regex\` (or \`rx\`) keyword, or simply be used inline as regexes were in Perl 5 via the \`m\` (matching) or \`s\` (substitution) operators. History In Apocalypse 5, a document outlining the preliminary design decisions for Raku pattern matching, Larry Wall enumerated 20 problems with the \\"current regex culture\\". Among these were that Perl's regexes were \\"too compact and 'cute'\\", had \\"too much reliance on too few metacharacters\\", \\"little support for named captures\\", \\"little support for grammars\\", and \\"poor integration with 'real' language\\". Between late 2004 and mid-2005, a compiler for Raku style rules was developed for the Parrot virtual machine called Parrot Grammar Engine (PGE), which was later renamed to the more generic Parser Grammar Engine. PGE is a combination of runtime and compiler for Raku style grammars that allows any parrot-based compiler to use these tools for parsing, and also to provide rules to their runtimes. Among other Raku features, support for named captures was added to Perl 5.10 in 2007.Perl 5.10 now available - Perl Buzz In May 2012, the reference implementation of Raku, Rakudo, shipped its Rakudo Star monthly snapshot with a working JSON parser built entirely in Raku rules. Changes from Perl 5 There are only six unchanged features from Perl 5's regexes: * Literals: word characters (letters, numbers and underscore) matched literally * Capturing: \`(...)\` * Alternatives: \`|\` * Backslash escape: \`\\\\\` * Repetition quantifiers: \`*\`, \`+\`, and \`?\`, but not \`{m,n}\` * Minimal matching suffix: \`*?\`, \`+?\`, \`??\` A few of the most powerful additions include: * The ability to reference rules using \`\` to build up entire grammars. * A handful of commit operators that allow the programmer to control backtracking during matching. The following changes greatly improve the readability of regexes: * Simplified non-capturing groups: \`[...]\`, which are the same as Perl 5's: \`(?:...)\` * Simplified code assertions: \`\` * Allows for whitespace to be included without being matched, allowing for multiline regexes. Use \`\\\\ \` or \`' '\` to express whitespace. * Extended regex formatting (Perl 5's \`/x\`) is now the default. Implicit changes Some of the features of Perl 5 regular expressions are more powerful in Raku because of their ability to encapsulate the expanded features of Raku rules. For example, in Perl 5, there were positive and negative lookahead operators \`(?=...)\` and \`(?!...)\`. In Raku these same features exist, but are called \`\` and \`\`. However, because \`before\` can encapsulate arbitrary rules, it can be used to express lookahead as a syntactic predicate for a grammar. For example, the following parsing expression grammar describes the classic non-context-free language \\\\\\\\{ a^n b^n c^n : n \\\\ge 1 \\\\\\\\} : S ‚Üê &(A !b) a+ B A ‚Üê a A? b B ‚Üê b B? c In Raku rules that would be: rule S { > a+ **} rule A { a? b } rule B { b **? c } Of course, given the ability to mix rules and regular code, that can be simplified even further: rule S { (a+) (b+) (c+) <{$0.elems  $1.elems  $2.elems}> } However, this makes use of assertions, which is a subtly different concept in Raku rules, but more substantially different in parsing theory, making this a semantic rather than syntactic predicate. The most important difference in practice is performance. There is no way for the rule engine to know what conditions the assertion may match, so no optimization of this process can be made. Integration with Perl In many languages, regular expressions are entered as strings, which are then passed to library routines that parse and compile them into an internal state. In Perl 5, regular expressions shared some of the lexical analysis with Perl's scanner. This simplified many aspects of regular expression usage, though it added a great deal of complexity to the scanner. In Raku, rules are part of the grammar of the language. No separate parser exists for rules, as it did in Perl 5. This means that code, embedded in rules, is parsed at the same time as the rule itself and its surrounding code. For example, it is possible to nest rules and code without re-invoking the parser: rule ab { (a.) # match \\"a\\" followed by any character # Then check to see if that character was \\"b\\" # If so, print a message. { $0 ~~ /b {say \\"found the b\\"}/ } } The above is a single block of Raku code that contains an outer rule definition, an inner block of assertion code, and inside of that a regex that contains one more level of assertion.  Implementation   Keywords  There are several keywords used in conjunction with Raku rules: ;regex: A named or anonymous regex that ignores whitespace within the regex by default. ;token: A named or anonymous regex that implies the \`:ratchet\` modifier. ;rule: A named or anonymous regex that implies the \`:ratchet\` and \`:sigspace\` modifiers. ;rx: An anonymous regex that takes arbitrary delimiters such as \`//\` where regex only takes braces. ;m: An operator form of anonymous regex that performs matches with arbitrary delimiters. ;mm: Shorthand for m with the \`:sigspace\` modifier. ;s: An operator form of anonymous regex that performs substitution with arbitrary delimiters. ;ss: Shorthand for s with the \`:sigspace\` modifier. ;\`/.../\`: Simply placing a regex between slashes is shorthand for \`rx/.../\`. Here is an example of typical use: token word { \\\\w+ } rule phrase { [ \\\\, ]* \\\\\\\\. } if $string ~~ / / { ... }  Modifiers  Modifiers may be placed after any of the regex keywords, and before the delimiter. If a regex is named, the modifier comes after the name. Modifiers control the way regexes are parsed and how they behave. They are always introduced with a leading \`:\` character. Some of the more important modifiers include: * \`:i\` or \`:ignorecase\` - Perform matching without respect to case. * \`:m\` or \`:ignoremark\` - Perform matching without respect to combining characters. * \`:g\` or \`:global\` - Perform the match more than once on a given target string. * \`:s\` or \`:sigspace\` - Replace whitespace in the regex with a whitespace-matching rule, rather than simply ignoring it. * \`:Perl5\` - Treat the regex as a Perl 5 regular expression. * \`:ratchet\` - Never perform backtracking in the rule. For example: regex addition { :ratchet :sigspace \\\\\\\\+ }  Grammars  A grammar may be defined using the \`grammar\` operator. A grammar is essentially just a namespace for rules: grammar Str::SprintfFormat { regex format_token { \\\\%: ? ? ? } token index { \\\\d+ \\\\$ } token precision { ? ? } token flags { <[\\\\ +0\\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\-]>+ } token precision_count { [ <[1-9]>\\\\d* \\\\\\\\* ]? [ \\\\\\\\. [ \\\\d* \\\\\\\\* ] ]? } token vector { \\\\\\\\*? v } token modifier { ll <[lhmVqL]> } token directive { <[\\\\%csduoxefgXEGbpniDUOF]> } } This is the grammar used to define Perl's \`sprintf\` string formatting notation. Outside of this namespace, you could use these rules like so: if / / { ... } A rule used in this way is actually identical to the invocation of a subroutine with the extra semantics and side-effects of pattern matching (e.g., rule invocations can be backtracked). Examples Here are some example rules in Raku: rx { a [ b c ] (d e) f : g } rx { (ab*) <{ $1.size % 2  0 }> } That last is identical to: rx { (ab[bb]*) } References External links * Raku Grammars - The reference manual page for grammars. * Grammar tutorial - A tutorial for grammars in Raku * Synopsis 05 - The standards document covering Perl 6 regexes and rules. * Perl 6 Regex Introduction - Gentle introduction to Perl 6 regexes.

Description Built in 1880 by Fr. Suitbert Mollinger, who was at that time pastor of Most Holy Name of Jesus Parish in the neighborhood of Troy Hill, the chapel houses 4,000 to 5,000 religious relics, making it the largest collection of relics outside the Vatican. History As originally planned, the building of the chapel was meant to be a joint effort between the congregation of Most Holy Name and Father Mollinger, who would match their contribution. However, when the parish refused to appropriate the large sum of money needed, Father Mollinger erected the building at his own expense with money which he had inherited from his family in Belgium. After the original dedication, additions were made to house the life-sized stations of the cross as well as the growing number of pilgrims, and so the enlarged chapel was rededicated on June 13, 1892, the feast day of Saint Anthony. Father Mollinger died two days later following an operation for a ruptured stomach. Father Mollinger was the primary driving force behind the erection of the chapel and the collection of relics housed therein. Mollinger's great personal devotion to Saint Anthony of Padua prompted him to dedicate a chapel in his name. He made several trips to Europe in order to collect relics, an unprecedented amount of which were floating in the market at the time due to political upheavals due to the so-called Kulturkampf in Germany and the unification of Italy. Most of the 4,000 to 5,000 relics in the chapel have original certificates of authenticity, the oldest of which dates from August 12, 1716. Because Father Mollinger apparently died without leaving a will, his heirs descended on the chapel and stripped it of its crystal chandeliers, black onyx altar, candelabra, and all portable items that could be sold. The chapel and its remaining contents were subsequently sold to the parishioners of Most Holy Name for $30,000, a sum U.S. dollars. Notable among the chapel's collection are what purport to be the complete skeletal remains of a saint named Demetrius (housed underneath the altar), the skulls of Saint Macharius and a saint named Stephana, skulls of the martyred companions of Saint Ursula, the skull of Saint Theodore, the tooth of the chapel's patron, Saint Anthony of Padua, and a thorn from the Crown of Thorns. The chapel also houses a life-sized set of statues that depict the Way of the Cross, which were imported from Munich and made by the Royal Ecclesiastical Art Establishment of Mayer and Company. Restoration By the 1970s the chapel had fallen into serious disrepair. A group of concerned parishioners formed a committee to raise funds to restore the chapel to its original beauty. On April 7, 1972, the pastor of Most Holy Name approached Bishop Leonard of Pittsburgh and asked for his approval for this effort. Permission was granted, and the restoration was undertaken completely by donation. By 1978 the badly needed restoration was complete.

Saturday of Souls (or Soul Saturday) is a day set aside for the commemoration of the dead within the liturgical year of the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic Churches. Saturday is a traditional day of prayer for the dead, because Christ lay dead in the Tomb on Saturday. These days are devoted to prayer for departed relatives and others among the faithful who would not be commemorated specifically as saints. The Divine Services on these days have special hymns added to them to commemorate the departed. There is oftena Panikhida (Memorial Service) either after the Divine Liturgy on Saturday morning or after Vespers on Friday evening, for which Koliva (a dish made of boiled wheatberries or rice and honey) is prepared and placed on the Panikhida table. After the Service, the priest blesses the Koliva. It is then eaten as a memorial by all present.  Relationship to Radonitsa  Another Memorial Day, Radonitsa, does not fall on a Saturday, but on either Monday or Tuesday of the second week after Pascha (Easter). Radonitsa does not have special hymns for the dead at the Divine Services. Instead, a Panikhida will follow the Divine Liturgy, and then all will bring paschal foods to the cemeteries to greet the departed with the joy of the Resurrection. Schedule There are several Soul Saturdays throughout the year: * The Saturday of Meatfare Week (the second Saturday before Great Lent) * The second Saturday of Great Lent * The third Saturday of Great Lent * The fourth Saturday of Great Lent * Radonitsa (Monday or Tuesday after St. Thomas Sunday, i.e. Second Sunday of Easter) * The Saturday before Pentecost * Demetrius Saturday (the Saturday before the feast of Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki, i.e. 26 October). Observances by denomination Orthodox and Byzantine Catholics All Orthodox and Byzantine Catholics observe Soul Saturdays on Meatfare Saturday (i.e., two Saturdays before the beginning of Great Lent); the second, third and fourth Saturdays of Great Lent; and the Saturday before Pentecost. Bulgarian Orthodox Church In the Bulgarian Orthodox Church there is a commemoration of the dead on the Saturday before the feast of Saint Michael the Archangel on 8 November instead of the Demetrius Soul Saturday. Russian Orthodox Church The Russians observe memorials on the Saturdays closest to 26 October (Saint Demetrius) and 23 September (Conception of St. John the Forerunner). Serbian Orthodox Church In the Serbian Orthodox Church there is also a commemoration of the dead on the Saturday closest to the Conception of St. John the Baptist‚Äî23 September. Slavic and Greek Churches In Slavic and Greek Churches, all of the Lenten Soul Saturdays are typically observed. In some of the Churches of the Eastern Mediterranean, Meatfare Saturday, Radonitsa and the Saturday before Pentecost are typically observed.

The model includes descriptions of the proposed signaling mechanism and several proposed examples of exploitation of this signaling in disease states. Background The concept of immunity refers to an organism's ability to respond to various foreign intrusions (as occurs in infection). A basic requirement in such a system is the ability to avoid self-harm through some mechanism of recognizing \\"self\\". In classic immunity several types of molecules label the organism's own cells as \\"self\\". Cells labelled in this manner are tolerated and not damaged by the various defense mechanisms employed to protect against infection. Dysregulation of this system is responsible for several types of disease states known collectively as autoimmune disorders. The term Eutheria is a taxon describing placental organisms such as mammals. The sister group of Eutheria is Metatheria, which includes marsupials and their extinct relatives. The term eu-FEDS was first described in 1997 by Gary F. Clark et al. as \\"the human fetoembryonic defense system\\", and later renamed to apply more broadly to all members of the taxon Eutheria. In 1949 Frank Burnet, and later in 1953 Peter Medawar, observed that the developing fetus was, in fact, similar to a transplanted \\"foreign\\" organ, because of the father's contribution to its genome. In 1960, Medawar and Burnet were awarded the Nobel Prize in part for their early contributions and discoveries related to understanding the necessity for the development of tolerance to the developing eutherian. It is now apparent that a human fetus is tolerated by its birth mother, even when it is completely unrelated. These observations were made following the introduction of modern assisted reproduction technologies involving unrelated donor eggs and the use of in vitro fertilization (IVF). The eu-FEDS hypothesis was itself proposed to describe the precise immunological mechanisms that mediate protection of the developing eutherian fetus from the immune responses of its mother. Hypothesis The basic premise of the eu-FEDS hypothesis is that both soluble and cell surface associated glycoproteins, present in the reproductive system and expressed on gametes, suppress any potential immune responses, and inhibit rejection of the fetus. The eu-FEDS model further suggests that specific carbohydrate sequences (oligosaccharides) are covalently linked to these immunosuppressive glycoproteins and act as \\"functional groups\\" that suppress the immune response. The major uterine and fetal glycoproteins that are associated with the eu-FEDS model in the human include alpha-fetoprotein, CA125, and glycodelin-A (also known as placental protein 14 (PP14)). Normally, a low level of these glycoproteins is detected in the maternal serum during the early stages of pregnancy. It appears that the effects of these eu-FEDS associated glycoproteins are manifested only during implantation and the very early development of the embryo. In humans, the expression of such glycoproteins greatly decreases toward the end of the first trimester. Therefore, more highly targeted mechanisms of immune suppression (such as the expression of the enzyme indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO)) are likely employed by the fetus during the subsequent stages of development. One potential reason for early inactivation of the system is that the immunosuppressive effect of these glycoproteins may be so complete that their continued leakage into the circulatory system could lead to a global suppression of the maternal immune response, compromising the mother's ability to carry the fetus to term. Implications of the hypothesis Human sperm and eggs also lack molecules for the immune recognition of \\"self\\". These immune markers are also known as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens or more specifically in humans as human leukocyte antigens (HLA)). Therefore, a major question is how are human gametes recognized by immune effector cells. Specifically, their lack of MHC recognition markers should trigger the immune system, resulting in lysis of both sperm and eggs by leukocytes known as natural killer, or NK cells. These cells target and kill other cells lacking such MHC markers, a concept known as \\"missing self\\". One distinct possibility is that sperm and eggs are recognized via oligosaccharides expressed on their surfaces. For example, human gametes are coated with carbohydrate sequences that have been implicated in the suppression of NK cell mediated responses. One of the major corollaries of the eu-FEDS hypothesis is that persistent pathogens and aggressive tumor cells are able to either mimic or acquire the same carbohydrate functional groups used to suppress any immune response that could interfere with the reproductive imperative, thus enabling them to similarly resist the human immune response. These pathogens include HIV-1, helminthic parasites such as schistosomes, and Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium that causes stomach ulcers. There are some notable examples of this mimicry or acquisition of the same carbohydrate sequences implicated in this protective system by pathogens and aggressive tumor cells. The major carbohydrate sequence linked to glycodelin-A also profusely coats the surface of schistosomes. The profile of the major oligosaccharides linked to CA125 and the major surface glycoprotein of HIV-1 (gp120) almost perfectly overlap. More persistent pathogens linked to the eu-FEDS model may be identified as mass spectrometry methods for sequencing oligosaccharides become more sensitive. Other experimental models Several other models have been developed that seek to address this hypothetical system for immune tolerance, including the depletion of tryptophan via the enzyme indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO) and the expression of the nonclassical MHC class I molecule designated HLA-G. However, genetic deletion of IDO in female mice does not lead to the rejection of their foreign fetal offspring, indicating that a redundant system for the suppression of the mother's immune response exists in the uterus during pregnancy. In addition, HLA-G expresses oligosaccharides that are very different from those linked to other HLA class I molecules, so the possibility exists that HLA-G at the fetomaternal interface is itself employing its unusual carbohydrate sequences as functional groups to suppress the mother's immune response.

In 1958 the station was closed and the airfield became Sunderland Airport. Following the closure of the airport in 1984, the site has since been redeveloped as a manufacturing facility for Nissan cars - Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK. History  Early history  In October 1916, the airfield that subsequently became Sunderland Airport started as a Flight Station for 'B' Flight of No. 36 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), and was originally called Hylton (after nearby Hylton Castle), although when being prepared it was known as West Town Moor. Due to an increase in German bombing raids and the heavier commitment of Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) aircraft in France, the Royal Flying Corps was given the task of Home Defence, setting up a number of squadrons, with flights spread over the length of the British coastline. The coast in North East England between Whitby and Newcastle was protected by No. 36 (Home Defence) Squadron, equipped with the B.E.2c and B.E.12. On 1 February 1916, the squadron was formed at Cramlington, outside Newcastle, commanded by Captain R. O. Abercromby. In addition to the main aerodrome, flights were detached to Seaton Carew and Ashington as well as Hylton. An area of land just north of the River Wear between Washington and Sunderland was set aside for the new landing field. 36 squadron was tasked with the defence of the coast between Whitby and Newcastle. On 27 November 1916, a patrol of B.E.2cs flying from Seaton Carew intercepted two groups of Zeppelin airships over the North East coast. Lieutenant I.V. Pyrott destroyed LZ34 that crashed into the mouth of the Tees; the sight of this caused the other airships to turn back. The only other action that the squadron was involved in was the unsuccessful attack on Zeppelin L42 over Hartlepool on New Year's Day 1918. After the end of the First World War, the area around Usworth was returned to non-flying use. In the manner of many First World War aerodromes, Usworth languished unused for over a decade, apart from at least one visit by Alan Cobham's Flying Circus, until being re-activated on 17 March 1930.  The 1930s  The newly re-opened airfield was sited alongside the B1289 road between Washington and Sunderland, with the flying field to the south of the road. The South Camp also housed the Squadron Office, pilots huts, armoury, photographic hut, bombing training aids, and the firing butts alongside the railway. The airfield had been designed to accommodate one squadron of the recently expanded Auxiliary Air Force. This was to be No.607 (County of Durham) Bomber Squadron. It was initially proposed to erect canvas-covered Bessonneau hangars at the South Camp, but these were rejected in favour of the erection of one large Lamella hangar. North Camp was provided with living quarters and dining facilities for Officers, NCOs and airmen. In September 1932, the airfield was ready to receive personnel under the command of Leslie Runciman, later Viscount Runciman. The Auxiliary pilots and groundcrew of No 607 squadron came from all walks of life locally and were trained by a nucleus of regular RAF personnel, including 2 Qualified Flying Instructors. The following month the first aircraft, a DH Gipsy Moth and two Avro 504N trainers, arrived for flying training to commence. In December 1932, the first operational equipment for the squadron, the Westland Wapiti day bomber, arrived. Evenings and weekends were busy when the part-time airmen turned out for training. Training continued in earnest, and in June 1934 the squadron proudly flew nine of its Wapiti aircraft in formation past its first Honorary Air Commodore, the Marquis of Londonderry. On 24 May 1934, at the Empire Air Day, the County Durham public had been given their first opportunity to view the work of the squadron at close hand when the station was opened. This show attracted 1,300 visitors to the station, although it is reported that almost 5,000 other spectators watched the flying display from outside the airfield. Empire Air Days were staged on an annual basis, with the next one occurring on 25 May 1935. Proceeds from these events went to the RAF Benevolent fund, with admission being one shilling for adults and three pence for children. On the day, the visitors were able to see fourteen aircraft on the station, including Avro 504s and Wapitis. Highlights of the day included formation flying by the Wapitis, and the opportunity of sitting in a Wapiti for a small fee. When Usworth opened its gates to the public on the RAF's Empire Air Day in May 1936, the flying display of all twelve of No. 607 Squadron Wapitis attracted a crowd of 3,500 people. In addition to these aircraft, some new shapes in the form of the Avro Tutor and Hawker Hart trainer were present with No. 607 Squadron. This show probably marked the last public appearance of the Wapiti. This type of aircraft continued to fly with No. 607 Squadron through until January 1937, even though on 23 September 1936 No. 607 Squadron had been re- designated as a fighter squadron. With the squadron becoming a fighter unit, the Wapitis were given up for the faster and more graceful Hawker Demons that started to arrive in late September 1936. From 26 February 1937, a regular squadron, No. 103(B) flew Hawker Hinds from Usworth alongside No. 607. The only regular squadron, No. 103 Squadron, was active during the week, leaving the airfield free for the Auxiliary boys and their Demons at the weekends. The Second World War New construction projects Further development of the airfield commenced in September 1939, when work was started on laying two concrete runways. In addition to the laying of the runways, the airfield was expanded to the south, east and west by taking in adjoining fields. The new long runway was laid north-east to south-west, with another of similar length on a north-south heading. A new perimeter track was laid around the airfield boundary with eight dispersal pens, each capable of taking a twin-engined aircraft. Also along the track were thirty four hard standings for single-engined fighters, and nine slightly larger hard standings. Three of the old pre-war Callendar hangars were dismantled, leaving just the Lamella and one Callendar hangar opposite the main gate. Many additional buildings were constructed between the airfield and the road. An Operations room for the stations new role was built near the Lamella hangar. This Operations room was later supplemented by an underground Battle Headquarters near the Cow Stand Farm corner of the airfield. On the North Camp, much of the vacant land was taken up with new accommodation blocks for the expected large influx of personnel, including WAAFs. A new WT/RT station was set up to supersede the old hut. On both camps, numerous air raid shelters were constructed. To assist in the defence of the airfield, a series of dispersed sites were set up over a wide area around the airfield. These sites included a searchlight camp at the top of Ferryboat lane, and small AA gun posts out on the Birtley road, above the old quarries at the bottom end of Boldon Bank and along the disused railway line towards North Hylton. A large gunsite was set up near Downhill Farm, and on the Birtley road, well away from the station, a decontamination centre was built. Most of these dispersed sites were to be manned by members of the Durham Light Infantry and the Royal Artillery. This work effectively rendered the airfield unusable, and thus No. 607 Squadron moved north to RAF Acklington, which they shared with the newly formed No. 152 Squadron. This squadron was also flying Gladiators, coded UM-, before receiving Spitfires in December of that (?) year. However, it would not be long before 607 Squadron would be called to action as they were to move to Merville between 10/15 November 1939, as part of the Air Component of the British Expeditionary Force. Despite the lull in flying activity, Usworth was designated a Sector Fighter Station in No. 13 Group, Fighter Command, and thus controlled the reporting of all raids on the area. The work on the runways continued into 1940, and was much hampered by severe frosts that delayed the reopening for flying until the end of March 1940. It was expected that the airfield would once again become the home for No.607 squadron. However, on 11 May 1940 new residents moved in from RAF Church Fenton. At 15:35 fifteen Spitfires from No.64 squadron arrived at Usworth, and were dispersed around the airfield, becoming the first wartime residents one month after receiving its new Spitfires. The pilots were accommodated in the Officers Mess. The stay of No.64 Squadron was to be extremely brief, for the threat to the South of England resulted in all of the aircraft departing for Kenley at 16:00 on 16 May 1940. Had it not been for this threat, Usworth may well have become a Spitfire base. Battle of Britain Newly equipped with Hurricanes, No. 607 Squadron returned home, when ten aircraft arrived from RAF Croydon on 4 June 1940 to re-assemble and re-arm after their big show in France. The squadron received additional Hurricanes to replace those lost in France. During its time in France the squadron had been responsible for destroying over 70 aircraft of the Luftwaffe. Even at Usworth, danger was ever present with two aircraft being destroyed in flying accidents, these being N2704 on 26 June, and another on 9 September. On 15 August 1940, a large formation of Heinkel He 111s of KG26, escorted by Bf 110s of I/ZG76, were detected approaching the east coast. The Hurricanes of 607 Squadron, now back at Usworth, encountered the German formation over Whitley Bay, and accounted for at least two He 111s. Spitfires from No. 72 squadron at Acklington had met them to the northeast of the Farne Islands, and although heavily outnumbered, claimed several destroyed. Post-war period Flying did return to Usworth when No. 31 Gliding School formed sometime in 1944, giving elementary flying training to cadets of the Air Training Corps, from local squadrons in the north-east. An Aircrew Disposal Unit arrived on 24 June 1944, being responsible for finding posts for tour-expired aircrew, many from overseas. This unit was supplemented from 10 August 1944 when No. 2739 & No. 2759 Squadrons of the Royal Air Force Regiment took up residence. Their stay was brief as they departed for overseas duty on 18 September 1944. The departure of the RAF regiment was followed quickly by that of the Aircrew Disposal Unit which relocated to Coventry on 22 September 1944. Once again the airfield reverted to care and maintenance under the control of No 14 Maintenance Unit, based at Carlisle. This unit retained control of Usworth through to 1952 and stored various items at the airfield, including parachutes and engines. At one stage several hundred Cheetah XIX engines were stored in their packing cases in the Lamella hangar. In 1952 Airwork Ltd took over the maintenance and flying training for the Chipmunks of Durham University Air Squadron and 23rd RFS plus the Anson 21s of 2 Basic Air Navigation School(both serving the RAFVR)the CFI was 'Ernie Lancaster'. Airwork themselves flew 2 Proctors, 2 Oxfords and a DH Rapide. The Chipmunks were kept in the east end of the Lamella hangar at night and pushed out on to the tarmac during the day to allow minor maintenance to be carried out. Majors were carried out for all aircraft in the west end of the Lamella hangar. When the government of the day closed half the VR air stations Usworth was closed. Sunderland council then bought it and a small airline flew for a short time. Sunderland Airport On 3 July 1962, RAF Usworth was purchased by Sunderland Corporation for ¬£27,000, and reopened as Sunderland Airport. Sunderland Corporation re-laid the runways, while Runway 23/05 was extended to 3,838 ft and renovated the hangar, and in June 1963, Sunderland Flying Club came into being. On 28 June 1964, an Open Day and commemorative ceremony took place to celebrate the rebirth of what was then Sunderland Airport. Current status The main site of the former Sunderland Airport/RAF Usworth is now the Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK car plant and the North East Land, Sea and Air Museums is also located immediately north of the factory.

The J. Roderick MacArthur Foundation, a philanthropic organization supporting civil rights in the United States, was established in his name. The foundation established the MacArthur Justice Center, a public interest law firm that formed an alliance in 2006 at the Northwestern University School of Law, and litigates for civil rights. In addition, MacArthur Justice centers have been opened in Louisiana (2013), Mississippi, in an association with the law school at University of Mississippi (2014); Missouri (2016); and Washington, D.C. (2017). He is the son of John D. MacArthur, who established the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in his will. It has funded the MacArthur fellowships, grants to authors, artists and scientists. Biography J. Roderick MacArthur, known as Rod MacArthur, was born December 21, 1920 to the former Louise Ingalls and John D. MacArthur. The couple also had a daughter, Virginia MacArthur. In 1926 John D. MacArthur traveled to Mexico to obtain a divorce. Two years later he married Catherine T. Hyland. Rod MacArthur attended Rollins College in Florida and worked as a stringer for the Associated Press in Mexico. During World War II, he joined the American Field Service, serving with the French Army in the ambulance corps, and he participated in the campaign that liberated France. He worked for his father in the insurance industry before they became estranged. In 1973, while working with a company that sold ceramic collectible plates, MacArthur noticed that the ceramic- collectible market was chaotic. He started the Bradford Exchange, and by the time of his death, it sold about 90 percent of all the collectible plates in the world. Often credited with becoming \\"a self-made millionaire,\\" MacArthur did have some financial backing from his father, but the concept, business plan and effort behind the Bradford Exchange were Rod MacArthur's own. In 1975, once the business had become successful, MacArthur's father claimed that the Bradford Exchange was his business, seizing its customer lists and putting the on-hand inventory under lock and key. Rod MacArthur then organized a group of employees to enter his father's warehouse in Northbrook, Illinois, and hustle the inventory into a waiting fleet of trucks. He reestablished the business away from his father.  Personal life  Rod MacArthur married Christiane L'Entendart in Paris in 1947. They had a daughter, Solange, and two sons. John Roderick \\"Rick\\" MacArthur later became the publisher and president of Harper's Magazine.  Death  Rod MacArthur died December 15, 1984, at age 63 from pancreatic cancer. He is buried in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago. His epitaph, written in English using Greek letters, is ŒøŒΩŒµ œÜŒøŒøœÑ ŒπŒΩ œÜŒ±ŒπœÅŒπŒµŒªŒ±ŒΩŒ¥ (\\"one foot in fairieland\\"). Philanthropic endeavors MacArthur reconciled with his father before John D. MacArthur died on January 6, 1978 (of pancreatic cancer). He named MacArthur to the board of his foundation, which was founded according to his will. At that point, John D. MacArthur was worth in excess of $1 billion and was reportedly one of the three richest men in the United States. John D. MacArthur bequeathed ninety-two percent of his estate to begin the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The Foundation's first Board of Directors, per John D. MacArthur's will, included J. Roderick MacArthur, Catherine T. MacArthur (his second wife), his attorney William T. Kirby, two officers of Bankers Life and Casualty, and radio commentator Paul Harvey. Rod MacArthur's son, John Roderick \\"Rick\\" MacArthur, has charged publicly: \\"The idea behind the foundation was as a tax dodge that he thought would allow his business executives to run his company forever. He clearly didn't understand the tax laws.\\" In any event, Rod MacArthur quickly clashed with the board of his father's foundation. The Bankers Life executives and Paul Harvey held conservative views regarding the structure and size of the board, its purpose, and issues related to the sale of the business. Largely due to Rod MacArthur's efforts, the board was expanded to thirteen members in 1979. The new members had backgrounds from academia, science, government, and business. This board now argued over the grants that were made to favorite board member causes, often trading votes among themselves. Even though there was support for each board member's causes, an extremely bitter and public argument erupted between Rod MacArthur and former U.S. Treasury Secretary William E. Simon over board grants to a number of conservative causes. Eventually Simon resigned from the board. Rod MacArthur filed two lawsuits in an effort to redirect the board and foundation. In February 1984 he sued fellow board members, charging that they were acting as executives of Bankers Life and were looking out for their own best interest and not the needs of the foundation. He alleged that the foundation was not managing its assets properly. MacArthur said that high fees were being paid to board members for their foundation work, and he believed that Bankers Life was not being managed well and had lost value. He requested that either the foundation be dissolved or that the court appoint a receiver to manage and sell Bankers Life. After MacArthur blocked the sale of Bankers Life at $268 million, the board found a buyer that was willing to pay $384 million for the company. This sale removed the Bankers Life issue from the suit. MacArthur's allegations that board members and key foundation executives were profiting at the expense of the foundation were still open. While still on the board of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, MacArthur pushed the Board to offer the MacArthur fellowships, also called \\"Genius Grants\\". Second, in 1980 at the urging of his son John R. \\"Rick\\" MacArthur, then 23, the senior MacArthur persuaded the Board to partner in creating and funding a Harper's Magazine Foundation, in order to acquire and operate Harper's Magazine, which had been struggling financially. This new entity acquired Harper's Magazine (which was then losing nearly $2 million per year and was on the verge of ceasing publication) for $250,000. Rick (now called Roderick) MacArthur eventually took over the foundation that owned Harper's. In 1976 Rod MacArthur had used his substantial fortune from the Bradford Exchange to form his own foundation, the J. Roderick MacArthur Foundation. As of 2004, the J. Roderick MacArthur Foundation had $22 million in assets., The MacArthur Justice Center, Northwestern University School of Law (archived 2004) It has supported causes of civil rights and civil liberties, including the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, D.C., and the Roderick & Solange MacArthur Justice Center, a public interest law firm in Chicago that is named and managed by two of his children. In 2006 the MacArthur Justice Center formed an association with the Northwestern University School of Law and has a clinic there. It has opened additional centers since then: in New Orleans (2013), in Oxford, Mississippi, in an association with the law school at University of Mississippi (2014); and in Saint Louis, Missouri (2016).

He served as president of the American Medical Association and as president of the Board of Trustees of the University of Rochester. One type of radial fracture is named for him. Biography Moore was born in Rahway, New Jersey to Lindley Murray Moore and Abigail Mott, abolitionists, educators, and women's rights activists, of Quaker and Huguenot descent.New York Times, March 5, 1902, p. 9. His mother's sister-in-law was Lucretia Coffin Mott, the abolitionist and pioneer of the civil rights movement in the United States. His maternal uncle was Richard Mott who was elected to the Thirty-fourth and the Thirty-fifth Congresses. His paternal uncle was Elias Moore, who was elected to the Twelfth and Thirteenth Parliaments of Upper Canada. In 1847, Edward married Lucy Prescott of Windsor, Vermont. They were active in St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Rochester, New York. He received his medical education in New York City and in Philadelphia (MD, University of Pennsylvania, 1838). His family had settled in Rochester, New York, and it was there that he made his permanent residence. With the title of professor of surgery, he gave lectures at medical colleges ‚Äì at Woodstock, Vermont (1842‚Äì1854), at Berkshire, Massachusetts (1855), at Starling Medical College (the predecessor of The Ohio State University College of Medicine), Columbus, Ohio (1857), and at Buffalo Medical College (1859‚Äì83). He was president of the Medical Society of the State of New York (1874), of which society he was one of the founders, of the American Surgical Association (1883), and of the American Medical Association (1890). For many years he was president of the board of trustees of the University of Rochester, and he is remembered as the \\"father\\" of the Rochester park system. In 1883, two great nurserymen, George Ellwanger and Patrick Barry, offered 19 hilltop acres of their nursery grounds to the City of Rochester for a memorial park. The city officials at the time refused the offer, but by 1888 Bishop Bernard McQuaid, Dr. Moore, and Councilman George W. Elliot persuaded them to accept the land and establish the Rochester Park Commission. Moore became the first president of the commission. The commission's next big decision was to hire Frederick Law Olmsted, the pioneer of American landscape architecture, to design a system of parks along the waterways in Rochester. A large statue was placed in Genesee Valley Park in his honor. ‚ÄúAt dedication ceremonies held October 19, 1927, Dr. George W. Goler delivered an address, portions of which are interesting in describing Dr. Moore as a physician and as a man. 'He was never a money-getter. Notwithstanding his great physique he was as delicately organized and as tender as a child. He avoided pain wherever and whenever possible. He never spared himself. In the early period of his Rochester career, when roads were bad and the income meager, he would frequently ride on horseback a distance of eighteen or twenty miles and back to make a single visit or perform a surgical operation. He had a dignified, even a majestic presence. He was simple of manner and easy of approach. His appearance in the sick room, where the patient was in pain and the family in tears, seldom failed to bring that calm which denoted the presence of a great physician. He relied more upon his powers of simple exposition and encouragement than he did upon the use of drugs. Not only as a practitioner but as a consultant was his opinion sought both in this as well as neighboring states'.‚Äù Hayes, Catherine D., Edward Mott Moore: Nineteenth Century Medical Student, University of Rochester Library Bulletin, Volume XIX ¬∑ Autumn 1963 ¬∑ Number 1 The Monroe County Medical Society presents the Edward Mott Moore Award to a physician and to a layperson whose lives reflect the qualities embodied by Moore.Edward Mott Moore Award .

Hewitt Associates, 508 U.S. 248 (1993), is the second in the trilogy of United States Supreme Court ERISA preemption cases that effectively denies any remedy for employees who are harmed by medical malpractice or other bad acts of their health plan if they receive their health care from their employer. Background According to John H. Langbein, Sterling Professor of Law and Legal History at Yale University the trouble got off to a bad start with Justice John Paul Stevens' dicta in Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134 (1985) a case where the plaintiff was an employee who after getting her improperly denied disability income insurance benefits paid in full also sought money damages for physical and emotional injury for the delay of six months while the employer had denied payment. Because Section 502(a)(2) of ERISA ran to the benefit of the employee benefit plan (rather than the employee) and because the Ninth Circuit gave the plaintiff victory based on that section instead of Section 502(a)(3) which ran to the employee, the case was presented to the High Court in an awkward procedural posture.What ERISA means by \\"Equitable\\": the Supreme Court's Trail of Error in Russell, Mertens, and Great-West, by John Langbein, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 1317, 1340 (2003). This mistake in choosing which section of ERISA to base the claim would lead to an error by Justice Scalia later in Mertens. Because the plaintiff in Russell won in the Ninth Circuit, and because all Ninth Circuit decisions must be reversed by the High Court, Justice Stevens' dicta said that \\"remedying consequential injury even under the authorization for 'appropriate equitable relief' in section 502(a)(3) would entail the creation of an implied cause of action, contrary to the Court's established constraints on the implication of causes of action under federal statutes.\\" Langbein at 1341. Stevens then suggested that ERISA was only concerned with protecting employee benefit plans not employees. This error in construing that Section 502(a)(2) limit to plans into a limit to all of ERISA remedy led to the High Court in denying an effective remedy to employees under ERISA Section 502(a)(3) in Mertens. When Mertens reached the High Court, Russell was already in the U.S. Reports suggesting that money damages for consequential injury sounding in ERISA is an implied right of action rather than an express right. Facts Hewitt Associates \\"was the plan's actuary in 1980, when Kaiser began to phase out its steelmaking operations, prompting early retirement by a large number of plan participants. Respondent did not, however, change the plan's actuarial assumptions to reflect the additional costs imposed by the retirements. As a result, Kaiser did not adequately fund the plan, and eventually the plan's assets became insufficient to satisfy its benefit obligations, causing the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to terminate the plan....\\" Mertens, 508 U.S. 248, 250. Procedure Plaintiff Mertens sued for a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA. They asserted that it was a breach for an actuary to allow the employer, the Kaiser steel company, to select actuarial assumptions rather than have the professional actuary choose reasonable assumptions. Plaintiff sought \\"appropriate equitable relief\\" under Section 502(a)(3) not 502(a)(2) chosen by the Ninth Circuit in Russell. Decision From this word \\"equitable\\" Justice Scalia made new law by basing the decision on the purported (ahistorical) bifurcation of English Courts into equity courts and law courts where plaintiffs sue for injunctions and money damages respectively. Professor Langbein asserted that from this incorrect division, Scalia disjoined any possibility of money damages for make whole remedy because he construed Section 502(a)(3) to be limited to a purely equitable remedy. The reason this preemption decision was wrongly decided is that back in the old days in England's courts of equity, it was possible for the court to order money to be paid.

It was first published as a seven-part serial in the magazine Argosy All-Story Weekly for February 2, 9, 16 and 23 and March 1, 8 and 15, 1924. It was first published in book form in hardcover by A. C. McClurg in September 1924. The story was also adapted for Gold Key Comics in Tarzan #174-175 (1968). In the book Master of Adventure: The Worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Richard A. Lupoff places Tarzan and the Ant Men in his list of essential Burroughs novels and states that it represents Burroughs at the peak of his creative powers. Plot summary The story begins 1 year after the end of the previous novel (#9, Tarzan and the Golden Lion) which would place it around 1936 which would make Tarzan around 47 years old. His son Korak, now at about 23 has a verbal child, the grandchild of Tarzan. Tarzan, the king of the jungle, enters an isolated country called Minuni, inhabited by a people four times smaller than himself, the Minunians, who live in magnificent city-states which frequently wage war against each other. Tarzan befriends the king, Adendrohahkis, and the prince, Komodoflorensal, of one such city-state, called Trohanadalmakus, and joins them in war against the onslaught of the army of Veltopismakus, their warlike neighbours. He is captured on the battle-ground and taken prisoner by the Veltopismakusians, whose scientist Zoanthrohago conducts an experiment reducing him to the size of a Minunian, and the ape-man is imprisoned and enslaved among other Trohanadalmakusian prisoners of war. He meets, though, Komodoflorensal in the dungeons of Veltopismakus, and together they are able to make a daring escape. Spanish actor/Tarzan lookalike Esteban Miranda, who had been imprisoned in the village of Obebe, the cannibal, at the end of the previous novel, Tarzan and the Golden Lion, also appears in this adventure. Major themes Burrough's view on what is a natural relationship between the sexes is neatly illustrated by a secondary narrative thread in the novel, that one about the Alali or Zertalacolols, an ape-like matriarchal people living in the thorny forests which isolate Minuni from the rest of the worlds. When the enslaved and persecuted Alali males see that Tarzan is a male too and yet stronger and more formidable than any Alali female, they go to war against the females, and by killing or maiming several of them, subjugate them. When Tarzan, towards the end of the novel, meets the Alali again, the females are submissive and obedient to their mates and actually prefer it that way. The Minunian city states and their politics are strongly reminiscent of those of Barsoom. They also share the Barsoomian philosophy of perpetual war as a good and commendable state, as illustrated by the words of Gefasto, the Commander in Chief of the Veltopismakusian armed forces: > We must have war. As we have found that there is no enduring happiness in > peace or virtue, let us have a little war and a little sin. A pudding that > is all of one ingredient is nauseating‚Äîit must be seasoned, it must be > spiced, and before we can enjoy the eating of it to the fullest we must be > forced to strive for it. War and work, the two most distasteful things in > the world, are, nevertheless, the most essential to the happiness and the > existence of a people. Peace reduces the necessity for labor, and induces > slothfulness. War compels labor, that her ravages may be effaced. Peace > turns us into fat worms. War makes men of us.Tarzan and the Ant-men, chapter > ten. Importance Tarzan and the Ant Men marks the end of a sequence that began with Tarzan the Untamed and continued through Tarzan the Terrible and Tarzan and the Golden Lion in which Burroughs' vivid imagination and storytelling abilities hit their peak, and which is generally considered a highlight of the series. The novel is also the last in the series to focus primarily on Tarzan's own affairs and to routinely feature the customary locales and supporting cast of the early novels. In later novels Burroughs largely dropped the use of such important characters as Jane and Korak, as well as the familiar base of Tarzan's African estate. Formerly pivotal characters would return only occasionally; Jane, La of Opar and Paul d'Arnot would each reappear once, while the Waziri or Jad-bal-ja the golden lion would only be brought in as needed to get Tarzan out of a tight spot. The Ape Man would become a seemingly rootless adventurer intervening in the affairs of an endlessly changing gallery of secondary characters whose goals and entanglements were henceforth to form the basis of the novels' plots. This shift in plot-type had first been presaged by the introduction of strong secondary characters as early as Tarzan the Untamed; after Tarzan and the Ant Men it would become dominant. References in other literature Tarzan and the Ant Men is referred to in Harper Lee's novel To Kill a Mockingbird (1960) as a book read by the young protagonist, Jean Louise (\\"Scout\\") Finch. Comic adaptations The book has been adapted into comic form by Gold Key Comics in Tarzan nos. 174-175, dated June‚ÄìJuly 1969, with a script by Gaylord DuBois and art by Russ Manning.

Most sources indicate Bullion was born in Knickerbocker, near Mertzon, in Irion County, Texas; the exact day of her birth is unclear. Data in the 1880 and 1900 federal census suggests a Laura Bullion might have been born on a farm in the township of Palarm near Conway in Faulkner County, Arkansas, and might have grown up in Tom Green County, Texas. Other sources claim Laura Bullion was born in Kentucky in 1873. In the 1890s, Laura Bullion was a member of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch gang; her cohorts were fellow outlaws, including the Sundance Kid, \\"Black Jack\\" Ketchum, and Kid Curry. For several years in the 1890s, she was romantically involved with outlaw Ben Kilpatrick (\\"The Tall Texan\\"), a bank and train robber and an acquaintance of her father, who had been an outlaw as well. She was arrested in early November of 1901 in St. Louis, Missouri. Bullion was convicted of robbery and sentenced to five years in prison for her role in the Great Northern train robbery. She was released from the Missouri State Penitentiary at Jefferson City, Missouri, on September 19th, 1905 after serving three years and ten months of her punishment. Laura Bullion moved to Memphis, Tennessee in 1918, posing as a war widow and using assumed names. She supported herself as a householder and seamstress, and later as a drapery maker, dressmaker and interior designer. Her fortunes declined in the late 1940s, at which time she was without an occupation. In 1961, she died of heart disease at the Shelby County Hospital in Memphis. Her final resting place is at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Memphis. Early life Laura Bullion (1890s) Most sources report Laura Bullion was born in Knickerbocker, Texas, near Mertzos, in Irion County in or around October 1876. Although the actual date of her birth is unknown, Bullion's death record indicates October 4 as her birthday. Bullion's death certificate lists Henry Bullion as her father and Fredy Byler as her mother. Bullion's father had been an outlaw and was acquainted with outlaws William Carver (\\"News Carver\\") and Ben Kilpatrick (\\"The Tall Texan\\"), both of whom Bullion met when she was around 13 years of age. Her aunt, Viana Byler, married Carver in 1891, but she died soon after the marriage from fever. At age 15, Bullion began a romance with Carver, who for a time after his wife's death had been involved with female outlaw Josie Bassett, sister to Cassidy's girlfriend Ann Bassett. Birthday ambiguity Most sources, as well as Bullion's grave marker, provide 1876 as the year of her birth; 1873 is also mentioned as a possible year of her birth. The exact day is not known. In an arrest report dated November 6, 1901, her age is mentioned as 28 at the time of the arrest. Provided the birth year of 1876 is correct, Bullion would have been 24 or 25 years of age at this time. The death certificate states Bullion's age at death as 74, and her date of birth as October 4, 1887. Provided the birth year of 1876 is correct, Bullion would have been 84 or 85 years of age at her death. The certificate is issued under the name Freda Bullion Lincoln, a false identity she assumed when she moved to Memphis, claiming to be the war widow of Maurice Lincoln and making herself about 10 years younger than she was. Birthplace ambiguity Most sources, including Laura Bullion's death certificate, give Texas as her state of birth. Data found in the 1880 and 1900 census suggests Bullion might have been born on a farm in the Palarm Township near Conway in Faulkner County, Arkansas. The 1880 Federal Census of Population for Palarm Township shows the family of a Kentucky-born farmer named Henry Bullion, aged 42, living with his wife Martha, 40 years old, and four children, including a son Lewis, 4 years of age.1880 Federal Census of Population, Enumeration District 52, Page 36, Lines 6-11 The 1900 census documents a 23-year-old Laura Bullion, born October 1876 in Arkansas, who stated her occupation as \\"housekeeper\\" and who was living with her grandparents E.R. and Serena Byler, her aunt Mrs. Mary Allen, and her three children at the Byler homestead in the southwest portion of the Commissioner's Precinct Number 4 in Tom Green County, Texas.1900 Federal Census of Population, Enumeration District 158, Sheet No. 4, Lines 62-68 Tom Green County borders Irion County, Bullion's assumed county of birth, in the north and east.

However, he would not allow it at first, and they only saw one another between robberies. While in Utah and on the run from lawmen, Carver became involved with the Wild Bunch gang, led by Butch Cassidy and Elzy Lay. Aliases and disguises Members of the Wild Bunch nicknamed Laura Bullion \\"Della Rose\\", a name she came by after meeting Kid Curry's girlfriend Della Moore. Often, Bullion also was referred to as the \\"Rose of the Wild Bunch\\". When her boyfriend Ben Kilpatrick and she fled east to evade the law after a train robbery in 1901, the couple traveled under the names \\"Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin Arnold\\". In an arrest report following the train robbery, dated November 6, 1901, Bullion's name is filed as \\"Della Rose\\" and her aliases are stated to be \\"Clara Hays\\" and \\"Laura Casey and [Laura] Bullion\\". The arrest report lists her profession as prostitute. According to a New York Times article, she was \\"masquerading as 'Mrs. Nellie Rose' at the time of her arrest.Woman Train Robber Held; Special to The New York Times; New York, NY; Nov. 8, 1901; page 2 The same article also mentions the suspicion that she, \\"disguised as a boy\\", might have taken part in a train robbery in Montana. The paper cites Chief of Detectives Desmond: \\"I would'nt think helping to hold up a train was too much for her. She is cool, shows absolutely no fear, and in male attire would readily pass for a boy. She has a masculine face, and that would give her assurance in her disguise.\\" Instead of \\"Clara Hays\\", Bullion also used \\"Clare Hayes\\" or \\"Clara Hayes\\" as a version of her alias. Other assumed names she used at that time were \\"Desert Rose\\", \\"Wild Bunch Rose\\", and \\"Clara Casey\\". When Bullion turned up in Memphis in 1918, she used the names \\"Freda Lincoln\\", \\"Freda Bullion Lincoln\\", and \\"Mrs. Maurice Lincoln\\", claiming to be a war widow and her late husband had been Maurice Lincoln. She also made herself 10 years younger, claiming to have been born in 1887. On her grave marker at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Memphis, Bullion's name is inscribed as \\"Freda Bullion Lincoln\\" and \\"Laura Bullion\\", her birth name. The epitaph \\"The Thorny Rose\\" refers to her nickname in the Wild Bunch. Relationships Ben Kilpatrick (1900) In the early 1890s, Bullion became involved romantically with Ben Kilpatrick after Carver began a relationship with a prostitute named Lillie Davis, whom he had met at Fannie Porter's brothel in San Antonio. As the gang robbed trains, Bullion supported them by selling stolen goods and making connections that could give the gang steady supplies and horses. By 1901, Bullion again was involved romantically with Carver as well as occasional involvement with other members of the gang. When Carver was killed by lawmen on April 1, 1901, Bullion became involved romantically with Kilpatrick again, and the two fled to Knoxville, Tennessee. Della Moore and Kid Curry met with them there, and the four stayed together for a number of months, until October, when Della Moore was arrested for passing money linked to one of the gang's robberies. Arrest On about Nov.1, 1901, Ben Kilpatrick and Laura Bullion arrived in St. Louis, Mo. by train, and checked into The Laclede Hotel using the aliases Mr. & Mrs. J.W. Rose. At 11:50 pm on Nov.5 ( Tuesday ), Ben Kilpatrick was arrested at Josie Blakey's resort at 2005 Chestnut St. In his pocket, the authorities found a key to a room at The Laclede Hotel. On the morning of November 6, they entered the hotel lobby, where Laura Bullion was in the process of checking out with her luggage. In her valise, they discovered $8500 in unsigned banknotes taken in The Great Northern train robbery.Laura was arrested at 9:15 A.MSt. Louis Post Dispatch Nov. 6, 1901 pg 1.. on federal charges for \\"forgery of signatures to banknotes.\\" Curry escaped capture on December 13, 1901, killing two Knoxville policemen in the process. Both Bullion and Kilpatrick were convicted of robbery, with Bullion being sentenced to five years in prison and Kilpatrick receiving a 20-year sentence. She served three and a half years before being released in 1905. Kilpatrick was not released from prison until 1911. After the outlaw life Kilpatrick stayed in contact with Bullion through letters. By the time of his release from prison in 1911, she had become involved with at least four other men, but they never reconnected nor did they see one another again. Kilpatrick was killed robbing a train on March 13, 1912. By this time, the Wild Bunch gang had disbanded. Memphis years Memphis from 1927 to 1948 (2007) In 1918, Bullion moved to Memphis, where she spent the remainder of her life working as a householder and seamstress, and later as a drapery maker, dressmaker, and interior designer. In 1920, the Memphis City Directory lists her as seamstress for the Jennings Furniture Co., with rooms at 221 Monroe Ave. From 1927 to 1948, she is listed as \\"householder\\" at 1374 Madison Ave. This is the only one of the buildings still in existence in 2007. In the 1930s, Bullion was listed as \\"drapery maker\\". Her occupation was upgraded to \\"interior decorator\\" in 1940. Her fortunes declined in the late 1940s. In 1950, Bullion moved to 1065 Walker Ave, with no profession listed. The following year, she moved to 3691 Southern Ave and in 1952 to 733 Decatur St. From 1953 to 1959, Bullion disappeared from the telephone book and is not listed in the city directory. In 1959, Bullion was listed as living at 278 Cossitt Place. She lived there until her death two years later. Death Grave marker at the Memorial Park Cemetery, Memphis (2007) According to her obituary, Bullion died of heart disease at the Shelby County Hospital at 6:45 pm on December 2, 1961. The memorial service was held two days later at 11:30 am on December 4. She is buried in the Memorial Park Cemetery. Bullion was the last surviving member of the Wild Bunch gang. Her grave marker reads: :Freda Bullion Lincoln :Laura Bullion :The Thorny Rose :1876 - 1961 Bullion's bronze grave marker has a decoration of embossed rose vines along the edges. The decoration and her epitaph \\"The Thorny Rose\\" refer to Bullion's nickname in the Wild Bunch. Her cohorts' fate For a number of years before her death, Bullion was one of only three people who had known the mysterious Etta Place, girlfriend to Wild Bunch gang member, the Sundance Kid. Place simply disappeared in 1909, following the Kid's alleged death in Bolivia. Only Bullion, Ann Bassett, and Josie Bassett could have shed light on the facts about Etta Place. Ann Bassett died in 1956. In 1964, Josie Bassett died. Notes References to the Shelby County Register of Deeds reflect information from the death certificate of Freda Bullion Lincoln, the identity Laura Bullion assumed for 43 years, when she was living in Memphis. Some of the information does not match the real facts, which is not unusual for a false identity. She registered under a false name, made herself 10 years younger and claimed to be the widow of Maurice Lincoln. The state of her birth is given correctly as Texas. It is unclear how truthful the information about her parent's names is or about the day of her birth. The information is not provided to start speculation; it is the data on the record about the assumed identity of Laura Bullion at the time of her death. It is an 'accurate' and 'truthful' reflection of vital records containing potentially 'inaccurate' or 'untruthful' data as provided to the authorities by Laura Bullion herself.

The species is found in deep water off Chile in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. It was the only member of the genus Mollisquama, until another species, M. mississippiensis, was discovered in the Gulf of Mexico. Both species are distinguished from other sharks by two pockets next to the front fins. The pockets are large, measuring about 4% of the shark's body length. Some researchers hypothesize that the pockets may excrete some kind of glowing fluid or pheromones. Etymology The specific name, parini, is in honor of Russian ichthyologist Nikolai Vasilevich Parin (born 1932). Distribution and habitat The first specimen of M. parini was found off the coast of Chile in the Nazca Submarine Ridge. This specimen was an adolescent female with a total length of , taken at a depth of , in 1979. This initially suggested that the species was distributed throughout the Pacific Ocean. In February 2010, a similar specimen with a total length of was caught off the coast of Louisiana, in the Gulf of Mexico. This second specimen was determined to be a new species which was described and named as M. mississippiensis.Grace, Mark A.; Doosey, Michael H.; Denton, John S. S.; Naylor, Gavin J. P.; Bart, Henry L. Jr.; Maisey, John G. (2019). \\"A new Western North Atlantic Ocean kitefin shark (Squaliformes: Dalatiidae) from the Gulf of Mexico\\". Zootaxa 4619 (1). (Mollisquama mississipiensis, new species). It is now believed that the genus Mollisquama is more widely dispersed than what was previously hypothesized. Description Sharks of the family Dalatiidae are small-sized to medium-sized, with two spineless dorsal fins. They are described as having strong jaws with dagger-like upper teeth and wider blade-like teeth in the lower jaw. From the one finding of the pocket shark in the Gulf of Mexico (M. mississippiensis), the mouth was described to have a rectangular-like opening on the underside of the body. The juvenile male shark found in the Gulf of Mexico weighed and had a total length of . The overall shape of the shark is cylindrical, with a wide, rounded snout tapering back toward the caudal fin. Pocket gland The pocket shark, Mollisquama parini, gets its common name from a small pocket gland that is found behind each pectoral fin on either side of the shark. The purpose of this gland is still unknown as not enough specimens have been found to investigate the matter. The closest suggestion for the purpose of this gland is to act as a luminous pouch as found on the species Euprotomicroides zantedeschia. While this pocket gland appears to have a slightly darker gray coloration, the rest of the shark's body is described to be a light gray with brown undertones. The pocket is located approximately from the base of the pectoral fin and was measured to be long and wide. Environmental threats and conservation There is essentially no interaction of M. parini with humans; so the species does not seem to cause any threat to the environment and other species, including humans. No methods of conservation are in place to protect this species as population numbers are unknown.

It was composed in 1959 at the request of Wolfgang Steinecke as a test piece for a percussion competition at the Darmstadt Summer Courses, where it was premi√®red on 25 August 1959 by Christoph Caskel. It quickly became the most frequently played solo percussion work, and \\"inspired a wave of writing for percussion\\" . Instrumentation The work is written for one percussionist playing a marimba, vibraphone (motor off), 4 tom-toms, snare drum, g√ºiro (one or several, if necessary), 2 African log drums (each producing 2 pitches), 2 suspended cymbals of differing sizes, hi-hat, 4 almglocken (suspended, clappers removed), a suspended \\"bunch of bells\\" (preferably Indian bells or tambourine mounted on a stand), at least 2 high pitched triangles, gong (with raised boss in center) and tam-tam. Form The title of Zyklus is reflected in its form, which is circular and without a set starting point. The score is spiral-bound, and there is no \\"right-side up\\"‚Äîit may be read with either edge at the top. The performer is free to start at any point, and plays through the work either left to right, or right to left, stopping when the first stroke is reached again. (In this way, it is an example of what Stockhausen calls \\"polyvalent\\" form.) The instruments are arranged in a circle around the performer, in the order they are used in the score. The notation is only conventional in some details, and an early review of this first graphic score by Stockhausen remarked that \\"The initial impression is that one is looking not at a score, but at a drawing by Paul Klee\\" . Zyklus contains a range of notational specificity, from exactly fixed at one extreme, to open, \\"variable\\" passages at the other. Stockhausen composed these elements using a nine-degree scale of statistical distribution, but states that the listener is not \\"supposed to identify these nine degrees when you hear the music, nevertheless the music that results from such a method has very particular characteristics...\\" . In principle, the percussionist decides on the starting point and direction through the score only at the moment of commencing a performance, but in practice this is almost universally worked out well in advance. Only the percussionist/composer Max Neuhaus claims to have consistently given \\"spontaneous\\" versions . Filmography *Brandt, Brian, and Michael Hynes (prod.). 2014.

The Seniors reached the Derry Junior Final 2008. History There is a history of the Gaelic Athletic Association in Desertmartin stretching back to June 1885, where Gaelic games were played in the townland of Tirgan. In 1933 Master McLaughlin, a teacher from Derry City proposed a club be founded. It was decided the club's name should be St. Martins and the club played in yellow with a green shamrock. One of the club's first successes came in 1945 when they won the Derry Football League. It was in 1938 that Camogie began in Desertmartin, with the formation of three teams; St. Bridget's, Brackagh and Tirgan. These teams amalgamated into St. Mary's in 1959, which went on to win the South Derry League in 1961. However camogie went out of existence in the late 1960s before re-forming in 1977, and again going out of existence in the early 1980s. The 1950s were a successful period for the club. Among honours they won the 1950 Derry Junior Football Championship, beating Kilrea in the South Derry final before beating Coleraine in the All-Derry decider. They went on to win the Ulster title that year. The club's greatest honour came three years later when it won the 1953 Derry Senior Football Championship, beating Ballerin in the final. St Martin's reached the final again in 1959, but lost out to Bellaghy. In 1960 the club purchased their current playing field in the townland of Longfield. After falling from the Senior ranks, Desertmartin won the Derry Junior Championship for a second time in 1968. The club entered Sc√≥r for the first time in 1971 and have had some successes. The then GAA President Paddy Buggy opened the club's new Gaelic Centre in 1984, the GAA's centenary year. The 1990s saw more development around the new Gaelic Centre in Longfield with the opening of a new re-furbished pitch and the opening of the John O'Hagan memorial stand. On the field, the senior team had an up and down spell, during which time them won the Division 2 league on 3 occasions, and adding 4 Intermediate Reserve Championships during this time. 1993 also seen the Minor team lift the South Derry Minor Championship, beating Newbridge in the final. In 2002 Desertmartin lifted both the South Derry 'B' and All-Derry B Minor Championships. They have also lifted the South Derry 'B' championship in 2004 and the Derry League in 2007.

Khor√∫gv (, , , , , , sometimes translated as gonfalon),Historically, the Russian word khorugv, as well as Polish choragiew also referred to a military banner in the secular sense, and the corresponding detachment associated with it. Derived from this word are the Polish \\"ChorƒÖgiew\\" (an administrative unit), as well as the military ranks ChorƒÖ≈ºy in Poland or Khorunzhiy among Russian Cossacks. is a religious banner used liturgically in the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches. The khorugv or banner consists of an icon of Christ, the Theotokos or a saint, either painted or embroidered on a rectangular piece of cloth. The cloth is often pointed or swallow-tailed, or has several streamers coming down from it. The banner often has two or three tails on it, each terminating in a tassel, and may be fringed around the edges. It is suspended from a crossbar which is attached horizontally to a long vertical pole (see the article Gonfalon for a picture). The finial at the top of the pole is usually a cross. More rarely, banners can also be made of metalwork, or carved out of wood. Banners are carried in a religious procession known as Holy Cross Processions (Russian: –∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–π —Ö–æ–¥, krestny khod), and when not being carried are usually displayed in the church. The use of banners in the Church Khorugv \\"Saint Nicholas with archangels\\", Russia, early 20th century. Easter Cross Procession, with khorugvi seen in the background, center (1880-83, Ilya Repin). Russian Orthodox Crucession with lantern, processional cross and banners. The first ensign used by the Christian Church was the labarum of the Roman Emperor Saint Constantine I. In the year 312, on the eve of the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, he saw a vision of the Cross of Christ appear in the sky, and beneath it the words ·ºòŒΩ œÑŒøœçœÑ·ø≥ ŒΩŒØŒ∫Œ± (En touto nika, \\"In this, be victorious\\"). Constantine ordered the symbol of the Cross to be placed on the imperial standards. He was victorious in the battle, and as a result legalized the practice of Christianity in the empire, and was himself baptized before his death. Constantine's victory was seen by Christians not only as a military victory, but as a victory of Christ over those who would persecute the new faith. After this point, we begin to see in Christian art the Greek letters IC (Jesus) XC (Christ) NIKA (\\"is victorious, conquers\\") added to depictions of the cross. The meaning is that, through the cross, Jesus Christ is victorious over sin and death. It was an ancient custom for emblems of victory to be placed in temples. Thus, after the legalization of Christianity, banners began to be placed in Christian churches. The faithful with khorugvi are waiting for the arrival of the relics of Venerable Macarius to Kstovo. During the time of the Byzantine Empire, embroidery developed a great deal, thanks to contact with the orient and the introduction of silk. Artists often copied from Persian models and enhanced their work with pearls and with gold and silver threads. In the Byzantine Empire and other Orthodox lands (Bulgaria, Serbia, Imperial Russia, etc.), fine needlework studios developed, which produced exquisite banners, some of which today are displayed in museums around the world. Spain and Italy were equally influenced by Byzantine tastes, and by the Middle Ages, the use of richly embroidered church banners is attested in both the East and the West. Liturgical use Receiving Holy Communion at Chudov Monastery, Moscow. Metalwork khorugvi can be seen on the right (1866, Stepan Shukhvostov). Metallic khorugv, Theotokos of St. Theodore, Moscow (1916). Since these banners are intended for religious use and not secular, they are normally blessed when first brought into the church. The priest says a prayer and sprinkles the banner with holy water, after which the banner is placed in its stand by the Iconostasis. To either side of the Iconostasis is a kliros, from which the singers chant the service. A banner is usually mounted at each kliros. The banner on the right (south) side often has a mandylion on it; the one on the left (north), an icon of the Theotokos. There may be more banners as well: banners of Saint Nicholas and the Patron Saint of the church or monastery are very common. The two choirs (klirosi) symbolize the ranks of the Church Militant, and the banners represent the victorious triumph of Christ over the world, sin and the devil. The banners are used in all church processions, except the procession on Great Saturday, when the Epitaphios is carried. The khorugv usually comes in line right after the Cross in processions, representing triumphant banners leading the faithful in their pilgrimage to the kingdom of heaven. On Good Friday and Great Saturday, the khorugv have black cloth tied around their borders, indicating mourning over the death of Christ. At Pascha (Easter) these black borders are replaced by white ones bearing the triumphal words: \\"Christ is Risen!\\" There is also a special paschal banner in the form of an icon of the Resurrection mounted on a pole. Sometimes the background of the icon is cut away, and a wreath of flowers surrounds the whole.

The building is currently South Korea's fourth tallest, and has 68 floors. It surpassed the previous record-holder, Samsung Tower Palace 3 ‚Äì Tower G in Seoul, when it topped-out in 2009. Although finished in 2011, the completion of its interior had been delayed due to financial complications during a recession. It was surpassed in height in 2017 by the current highest building in South Korea, the Lotte World Tower. The building was intended to be a landmark of the Songdo International Business District which was constructed on unused land along the waterfront near Incheon. It features 19 floors of class A office space, South Korea's tallest observatory on the 65th-floor, a luxury hotel, serviced residences, and retail stores. The column-free floors include an office lobby at ground level with French limestone floors and Vermont slate stone walls. Design Like the One World Trade Center, the tower features a faceted glass facade that gently tapers from a square base but transitions to a triangular rooftop. The offices, apartments and a hotel each have their own entrance lobby. The facade is made of high-performance glazed glass with exterior shading devices which allows the structure to regulate internal temperatures. The tower also features low-flow plumbing fixtures allowing reduced water usage by more than 20 percent compared to the average consumption rate of a typical office building. In addition, a graywater collection system is used to flush wastewater while collected stormwater is stored and reused, reducing water consumption by more than 50 percent. Amenities The building is next to Songdo Convensia, the Riverstone shopping center, and the Sheraton Incheon Hotel. It has an extensive parking station next door, and will have pedestrian access to a future subway station. Floors 2 to 33 are occupied by several businesses, with Daewoo occupying levels 9 to 21. The 36th and 37th floors are allocated for banquets, restaurants, meeting rooms and other formal activities, while floors 38 to 64 features a residence hotel with 423 guest rooms, including a penthouse on the upper floor. In February 2010, the 65th-floor observatory temporarily opened to the public for the G-20 major economies meeting of finance ministers.

El Centro Espa√±ol de Tampa is one of two individual structures within Hillsborough County to be so designated. The historic and cultural significance of El Centro Espa√±ol de Tampa was noted well before the announcement of its NHL status. As early as 1974, the building was included by the National Register of Historic Places as one of the Contributing Properties within the Ybor City Historic District. The building remains an important component of the district, which on December 4, 1990, gained more distinct recognition as a National Historic Landmark District. It is now home to Jason Fernandez's restaurant Carne.  History  El Centro Espa√±ol de Tampa Moorish styled front entry Immigrants from Spain (including some by way of Cuba) to the bustling factory town of Ybor City in 1891 established El Centro Espa√±ol as the first of several ethnic social club and mutual aid society organizations. El Centro Espa√±ol served as the organizational model for its later counterparts such as El Centro Asturiano, El Circulo Cubano, L'Unione Italiana, and others. These clubs grew to play vital roles in Ybor City's development and were of particular importance in welcoming and orienting new arrivals to the immigrant community. In exchange for membership dues, they offered not only social, cultural, and recreational opportunities, but educational programs and health care.\\"Cigar makers & the Mutual Aid Societies\\".

The organization's first clubhouse, an ornately constructed frame structure flanked by two towers, was built in 1892 on the site of the present Centro Espa√±ol building, and featured a theater, dance hall, canteen, soda fountain, and classrooms, where English courses were offered. The club's membership expanded rapidly, surpassing 2,600 people by 1908, and soon after outgrew their facility. The club replaced their original clubhouse with the building today known as El Centro Espa√±ol de Tampa in 1912. In the same year, the organization established a second clubhouse, El Centro Espa√±ol de West Tampa, to serve the Spanish population of West Tampa. After several decades of prosperity and growth, El Centro Espa√±ol and the other area social clubs entered a period of decline. Factors such as Prohibition, the Great Depression, and restrictions in immigration curtailed the influx of potential new membership, and sent much of the area's existing population looking for work elsewhere. By World War II, much of the organization's roles in terms of health care and social welfare were absorbed by government and private interests. The membership base declined further as the now second and third generation Spanish-Americans more freely interacted with the rest of the population and more closely identified with American culture. In 1983, the organization consolidated their remaining membership to the West Tampa clubhouse, and the Centro Espa√±ol de Tampa building was sold. After sitting vacant for several years, it was restored in 2010 and now houses Jason Fernandez's Carne Chophouse restaurant. The West Tampa clubhouse houses The Hillsborough Education Foundation and its Teaching Tools for Hillsborough Schools program. Historical Marker  Architecture  The Centro Espa√±ol building was designed by Francis J. Kennard, an architect who was responsible, either solely or in part, for many Tampa Bay area structures now considered to be of historic importance, including Hillsborough High School,\\"Building\\". Hillsborough High School. Retrieved May 6, 2010. St. Andrews Episcopal Church, and the Belleview-Biltmore Hotel.\\"Florida ‚Äì Pinellas County\\". National Register of Historic Places. Retrieved May 6, 2010. Kennard employed the French Renaissance Revival style in his design for the building, with heavy influence from Moorish Revival and Spanish Mediterranean Revival styles. The structure features masonry construction of red brick with white stone accents. The shape is a basic rectangle, exposed on all but the west side, consisting of a two and 1/2 story-tall main block, with an attached rear wing of three and 1/2 stories. The building's south facade along 7th Avenue features an arched main entrance in Moorish style with cast-iron trim. The long, east facade resembles a palazzo, an effect commonly utilized in Renaissance Revival designs, and also incorporates the use of cast-iron balconies.
