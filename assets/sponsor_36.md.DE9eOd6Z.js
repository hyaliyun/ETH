It is named after the American town of the same name. It was shot in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Plot Federal agents stake out Ketchikan Harbor, Alaska in an operation involving laundered money. Guns start blazing and some crooks are killed and some escape. A bomb goes off when the Feds are looking over a yacht. In Black Point, Washington (state), John Hawkins is getting drunk in a bar. Still drinking from a bottle, he drives home, playing chicken with a truck which narrowly avoids him and then runs into a tree. This leads to the sheriff (Lisa) and her chief deputy (Fred) turning up at his log cabin with guns drawn in case of trouble though Lisa is an old friend of John‚Äôs. However this is next day and John has now sobered up. Lisa tells him he has two strikes against him and the next time he causes trouble he‚Äôll be put away (under America‚Äôs Three Strikes law where a minor offense can lead to a long term of imprisonment). This leads to a contrite John jogging into town to the local docks where he passes a young couple who are moving into a riverside house they have rented. He meets his friend Standing Bear who runs a fishing boat (and the Seahorse Cafe) who John has let down again in not turning up for work because of his binges. John is set to work and later delivers some fish in his banged up vehicle to the new couple. The husband (Gus) is out and the wife (Natalie) is having trouble with a water leak, which John fixes. As they are beginning to get friendly, Gus and some friends turn up so John leaves. He chucks away his booze stash when he gets home. Early next morning, he joins a hunting party with Standing Bear and some of his (Red) Indian friends. Malcolm rings Gus up. He‚Äôs the man behind the villains and is a nasty person. Gus tells him that the Feds just got some ‚Äúdirty money‚Äù but he still has the clean money.. The gang leave in a motor launch. John is jogging again and rescues Natalie who has jumped into the water to drown herself. Taking her back to her place, he sees bruises on her body where Gus has beaten her up. Gus meanwhile kills his gang leader and gets the money back. John returns to his house late to meet Natalie there. They cook and eat a meal and talk about her husband Gus and things get more romantic and they end up in bed. Later she wanders into a nearby shack where John is sitting. All around are photos of a young girl. John reveals that it is his daughter Gabrielle, who was six when someone took her while out Christmas shopping two years ago. His wife later left him. After everyone else gave up on her, he is still looking for her. Natalie talks of them leaving together. Later, Natalie phones John that Gus and his cronies have turned up while she is packing. He rushes to her house and finds one of Gus‚Äôs men shoving her about. He attacks him and the other men and while one is accidentally shot by his friend, she shoots the other with a gun she stole from John the night they slept together. She then knocks John out and tapes his hands together, planning to kill him in the woods. John manages to escape and she thinks he fell over a cliff. Back at her house she then injures herself and makes it look like John is the guilty party before phoning the sheriff. The law turns up, then Gus turns up and it turns out that over $20,000 of jewelry is missing. Natalie who is in a local clinic tells Gus that ‚Äúthe bag‚Äù which Eddie (one of the dead crooks) carried is gone. It had all the clean money in it. Natalie tells Lisa some lies, meanwhile Fred finds the gun belongs to Hawkins so she and he head to his cabin with other armed officers. Gus is informed that Hawkins is one of the men who took the money. Gus and his cronies go to the caf√© and give Standing Bear a good beating to get information about John. John (who we hear taught tactical training at a Military Academy) finds the beaten up friend and takes him to the clinic and is arrested when he leaves. Gus and Natalie are taken for a ride to see Malcolm who is busy torturing three men (nooses around the neck while standing on melting ice), one of whom he knows tipped the Feds off about the ‚Äúharbour drop‚Äù at the film‚Äôs start. Malcolm wants his three and a half million dollars of clean money back, or else. Gus hears that Hawkins has been arrested, which naturally shocks Natalie. John is saying nothing, and in return Natalie says he was not one of the people who robbed her. Lisa knows that she does not have the whole story as people are lying to her but with no other choice, she lets John go. He goes to see Bear who is recovering in the clinic and on leaving is met by two of Gus‚Äôs men who want to take him to meet Gus. He slaps them about some and before leaving tells them to tell Gus he‚Äôll be at Flanagan‚Äôs (bar) at two o‚Äôclock. At Flanagan‚Äôs he tells Gus he wants Natalie in exchange for the money, and that he‚Äôll take him to the money. If anything happens to him though, a ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù letter goes to the sheriff in an hour‚Äôs time. Gus stays with the car while two men follow him into the woods. He is having doubts over Natalie. In the woods, one of the men reaching for what he thinks is money puts his hand in a bear trap. John knocks the other out. Natalie now blames Malcolm, saying he set Gus up so he gets Natalie and the money. Gus sends Logan into the woods to kill John and heads off to Harbour Manor Inn to confront Malcolm. Logan fares badly and ends up in the hands of John, Bear and some Indian buddies. Malcolm‚Äôs tough guy image cuts no ice with Gus now and he shoots him and his two enforcers. Natalie escapes by car as Gus finds out too late that she is ‚Äúplaying him‚Äù. John visits the Sea Vista Camp Grounds, closed for the winter and finds the bag of money there, then goes to the Inn where he finds the dead bodies and alerts Lisa by phone. Gus is tipped off by Fred who is paying him for tip offs about Gus, and Lisa finds the money gone. She goes to John‚Äôs cabin where Gus gets her and he is waiting when John arrives with the bag of money. But while Gus has a gun on him, John threatens to drop a lit lighter into the bag of money which is now soaked in petrol. He does and dives out of the window, taking a bullet as he did so. Gus shows him Natalie who is ready to be hanged, then he kicks the chair out from under her. The wounded John tackles him and they smash into a post which knocks down the cross beam Natalie is hung from. The wounded John is losing the fight against Gus when Natalie who has got free of the noose stabs him in the back, killing him. Lisa and Fred turn up, and Natalie decides to tell all. She goes to prison but John (now recovered) is going to wait for her. He decides to leave the area for a job interview in San Francisco.

Death is a universal feature of human life, so stories about its origin appear to be universal in human cultures. As such it is a form of cosmological myth (a type of myth that explains the origins of a culture and the problems that faces it). No one type of these myths is universal, but each region has its own characteristic types. Such myths have therefore been a frequent topic of study in the field of comparative mythology.See for example, Africa Pervasively in the myths of African cultures, in the beginning there was no death. This can be because a supreme being makes people young again when they grow old; people die but go to heaven to live. In some stories eternal life is lost through some flaw (such as greed, curiosity, stubbornness or arrogance), or as a punishment for disobedience, or as the result of human indifference. Other themes are the failure of a message to be delivered to humans, or a severing of the link between heaven and Earth. Sometimes it is as a result of an accident. North America Coyote ‚Äî a common trickster figure in North American myths The origin of death is a common theme in Native American mythology. The myths of the plateau tribes blame its origin on the interference of the trickster figure Coyote. The Chiricahua Apache myth also blames Coyote. The plains tribes ascribe it to the result of unfavorable chance. For example, in the Blackfeet account, Old Man and Old Woman arguing over whether people should die, with Old Woman using magic to ensure that the sign that they agreed upon gave her desired result. Among the native peoples of the Western United States, a common explanation of death was that it was the result of a debate between two people or animals in which one would favour death and the other immortality. For example, the story of the Thompson Indians was that Raven wanted death as there would otherwise be too many men. Coyote preferred sleep to death but was outvoted by Crow, Fly and Maggot, who sided with Raven. Raven's daughter was then the first to die and so Raven wanted to reverse his choice. But Coyote, the trickster, said that the decision was now irrevocable. Oceania In Oceania, the most common myth is that originally people had the power to rejuvenate themselves by shedding their skin like a snake. However, when somebody, usually an old woman, does this, she frightens her grandchildren, who cry until she resumes her old skin, an act which mandates death for future generations. Polynesia In Polynesian mythology, death is the result of the hero MƒÅui being swallowed up by Hades or Night. If he had escaped, mankind would be immortal, however one of the birds that accompanied him burst out laughing, awakening Hine-nui-te-po who crushed MƒÅui to death, ending hopes of immortality with him.Lang(2007) p119 Western civilization Christianity Adam and Eve by Albrecht D√ºrer According to Christianity, death is a consequence of the fall of man from a prior state of innocence, as described in the Book of Genesis. Greek mythology Pandora by Lefebvre In an early Greek myth, death is a consequence of the disagreement between Zeus and Prometheus. As a result of this quarrel, Zeus creates woman, in the form of Pandora and presents her to Prometheus' brother Epimetheus, with death being one of the results of his opening of Pandora's box, which she brought with her.Lang(2007) p116 See also * Archetypal literary criticism * Death and culture * Epic of Gilgamesh * Immortality * Mythology Notes References * Further reading     Berezkin, Yuri, 'Why Are People Mortal?

As of 2018, the agency's official name is Ministry of Education, Science and Research (Bundesministerium f√ºr Bildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung or BMBWF). Responsibilities The Ministry is responsible for all matters regarding public education, including general education, vocational preparatory schools, Adult education, educational research and the Pedagogical Universities. History The Ministry was first founded in 1848 in the wake of the Bourgeois revolution. Back then, it was named \\"Ministry for Cultus and Education\\" and included religious affairs. In the first years of the First Austrian Republic it was merged into the \\"Ministry for Interior and Education\\", until it became its own authority again in 1923. Chancellor Bruno Kreisky restructured it in 1971, creating the Ministry of Science and Research on one hand and the \\"Ministry of Education and Arts\\" on the other. From 2000 to 2007, they were merged again and formed a \\"Ministry of Education, Science and Culture\\". In 2007, the Science Ministry was again established as its own authority. This left the remaining parts as \\"Ministry for Education, Arts and Culture\\" (German: Bundesministerium f√ºr Unterricht, Kunst und Kultur, short: BMUKK or Unterrichtsministerium). It then had additional responsibilities in the fields of Religious foundations and the arts, such as theatre and Film promotion, Museums and related management and funding, such as for the Austrian National Library, and the Vienna Philharmonic.

Chernaya Molniya) is a 2009 Russian action superhero film directed by Alexandr Voitinsky and Dmitriy Kiselev, and produced by Timur Bekmambetov.  Plot  Dmitry \\"Dima\\" Maykov (Grigoriy Dobrygin) is a student at Moscow State University. For his birthday, his father (Sergei Garmash), gives him a black '66 Volga. In the glove compartment, Dima finds an old photo of three scientists and an old audio record, but he gives them no mind. Dima is in love with his classmate Nastya Svetlova (Yekaterina Vilkova). Dima believes that the only way to her heart lies through money and status, which in turn are only attainable through ambitiousness and egoism. This belief is strengthened when Dima sees the success of Nastya's friend, Max (Ivan Zhidkov), who also happens to have a Mercedes. Dima begins working as a flower delivery boy. During one of the runs, he gets into trouble with Kuptsov's men, and while being chased by them, accidentally engages the car's flight system. Losing control of the flying car, Dima crash lands into an abandoned building. With Max's help, Dima is able to play the record from the glove box which helps him track down two of the scientists in the photo, Pavel Perepelkin and Olga Romantseva, who turn out to be husband and wife. Dima, pretending to be a newspaper reporter, asks them about the car. The Volga is revealed to be a product of a Soviet black project, equipped with multiple rocket engines allowing supermaneuverable flight, as well as a device called \\"nano-catalyzer\\" which transmutes ordinary gasoline into high-yield nanofuel to power them. Romantsova gives Dima the car's manual, which the third scientist, Mikhail Yelizarov, wrote. At first, Dima enjoys the flights and makes decent money delivering flowers while avoiding the infamous Moscow traffic jams. But his egotism leads Dima to leave a stabbed man on the street instead of helping him, and that man later turns out to be his own father. The death of his father changes Dima's outlook on life. He decides to use his car to help people in need. He rapidly gains many fans among the city dwellers, and newspapers grant him the nickname \\"Black Lightning.\\" Meanwhile, Kuptsov starts a hunt for the nano-catalyzer, which can produce fuel needed to power his tectonic drill concealed within one of the Moscow City skyscrapers. The drill will allow Kuptsov to reach a layer of diamonds located beneath the tectonic plate, but will likely destroy the city in the process. Kuptsov finds the scientists who worked on the flying Volga and forces them to build the same kind of flight system for his Mercedes, as well as outfit it with weaponry and armor shielding. Kuptsov lures Dima out by letting Perepelkin, one of the scientists, escape to the roof of the skyscraper. Kuptsov then ambushes \\"Black Lightning\\" with rocket fire from his Mercedes, stealing the nano-catalyzer and sending the Volga falling down, crashing into the ice and sinking to the bottom of the Moscow River. A call from his girlfriend, Nastya, that says that she really loves him, brings the hero back to his senses. Dima remembers the emergency backup tank with 30 minutes' worth of nanofuel, bursts out from under the ice, and rushes into Kuptsov's lair, freeing the scientists and recapturing the nano-catalyzer. He then flies to pick up Nastya, but Kuptsov beats him to her, taking her as a hostage and offering to trade her for the nano-catalyzer. Dima and Kuptsov confront each other over the Red Square. Dima flashes his headlights and honks the horn in a special signal that Nastya knows about. Nastya jumps out of Kuptsov's car and Dima grabs her in midair, safely landing her to the earth below. The final battle between the flying cars in the sky above Moscow ends with Dima luring Kuptsov's car to the outer reaches of the atmosphere, where the Mercedes runs out of nanofuel. Kuptsov floats in the Earth's orbit, left for dead. Dima and Nastya meet on the ground and celebrate the New Year together.

Operated by one of the company's Convair 580s, on 5 March 1967, the flight crashed near Marseilles, Ohio, with the loss of all 38 passengers and crew on board. Synopsis On 5 March 1967, Lake Central Flight 527 was scheduled from Chicago, Illinois to Detroit, Michigan. The flight, operated by one of the company's Convair 580 aircraft, left Chicago at 1704H and proceeded normally to Lafayette, Cincinnati, and Columbus. No problems were reported. The aircraft was serviced in Columbus, and departed at 1952 hours for Toledo. At 2005 hours the flight was cleared by air traffic control to descend from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet as it approached Toledo. Air traffic control requested that the flight report its descent, and to report crossing 8,000 and 7,000 feet. The crew acknowledged leaving 10,000 feet. This was the last transmission from the aircraft. Witnesses in the vicinity of Marseilles, Ohio reported hearing sounds from an aircraft at times between 2005 hours and 2010 hours. Some reported sounds like an engine \\"revving up\\". Shortly thereafter the sound of an explosion was reported. By 2100H the authorities had confirmed that an aircraft had crashed in the area. Rain mixed with snow was reported at the time of the accident. Cause The aircraft was found to be loaded within normal limits, and the crew was found to be properly qualified for the flight, with no deficiencies reported. The aircraft was equipped with a flight data recorder. It was able to be read, having sustained no damage in the crash. Approximately 14 minutes after departing Columbus, the aircraft was on a heading of 322 degrees, when it abruptly veered right 40 degrees, and then left 55 degrees, at which point power to the recorder was abruptly terminated. The cockpit voice recorder lost power at the same time, though right before power loss a sound described by investigators as \\"the first few seconds of an air raid siren\\" was heard. The aircraft had crashed in a farm field, on a heading of 360 degrees. The front fuselage had been separated from the main part of the aircraft, and debris was recovered from a 1.5 mile long, 1/2 mile wide trail on a heading of 135 degrees from the main wreckage. The right propeller was completely detached from the engine, as were the blades. In reconstructing the wreckage, the investigators revealed that the right propeller had separated in-flight and severed the fuselage. During manufacture, propeller pistons, which control the pitch of the propellers, are coated through a process called nitriding, which hardens them and makes them more resistant to surface wear. They are supposed to be inspected to make sure the process is completed. While it is not known why the propeller on N73130 was not nitrided or failed inspections, the fact remains that it was, and was installed on N73130. During the life of the engine, the piston had been slowly wearing away. During the flight, the piston finally failed, causing the propeller to over-speed. The propeller subsequently failed due to overstress, 1 to 2 seconds later. When the propeller failed, the blades were hurled through the cabin, severing control cables as well as the structural integrity of the plane itself. The investigators determined that the crash was solely caused by the propeller defect and subsequent failure.

It was the band's first new release since 1993 and saw a reunion of the band, featuring the return of original lead guitarist Terry Bickers (although not bass guitarist Chris Groothuizen). Background The House of Love had been defunct since splitting up in 1993, with former group leader Guy Chadwick having made fitful attempts at other projects in the intervening years. He had been estranged from the band's former lead guitarist Terry Bickers since the latter's acrimonious exit from the band at the end of 1989, following several years of frustrating recording sessions, drug abuse and mental imbalance. Bickers had subsequently spent time in bands including Levitation, Cradle and Monkey Island and dealt with his personal issues. Circa 2000, Bickers and Chadwick reestablished contact and began to rebuild their friendship, aided by their mutual experience of fighting depression. In 2003, the House of Love's former agent Mick Griffiths persuaded Chadwick and Bickers to reunite as songwriting partners. This in turn led to a reunion of the original band (minus guitarist and singer Andrea Heukamp and bass guitarist Chris Groothuizen, the latter of whom opted instead to continue his career as an architect). Following recording sessions done at the band's own pace, and without record company involvement (one of the factors which had contributed strongly to Bickers' original departure over a decade previously), Days Run Away was released in 2005 on the Art and Industry label. The band went on to tour throughout the UK, Ireland and Sweden to support the release.

Built by the Mekong Exploration Commission, the railway was operated by the Lao State Railway. It opened in 1893, and closed in 1940 or 1949. The railway was initially laid to gauge, and may have been partially (or fully) converted to . It facilitated the transportation of vessels, freight and passengers along the Mekong River. The Don Det‚ÄìDon Khon islands railway was the only railway built, opened and operated in Laos until 2009,The only railway (ever) in Laos The International Steam Pages when a line was opened between Nong Khai, Nong Khai Province, Thailand and the Thanaleng Railway Station in Dongphosy (near Vientiane).  History  The bridge between the two islands.  Background  The French colonial administration of Indochina was determined to use the Mekong River for a route into China, and to help counter British colonial expansion in Upper Burma. The governor of Indochina saw the Mekong as \\"the main point of connection between the different countries of French Indo-China (Cochin-China, Cambodia, Laos and Tonkin), which will be able to communicate with each other through it\\".Mad About the Mekong: Exploration and Empire in South East Asia, Harper Collins, 2005. The main obstacle was in southern Laos, where the river divides into several channels with rapids (known as the Khone Phapheng Falls) at the Siphandon Islands. Attempts in 1891, 1892 and 1893 to scale the falls failed; accounts exist of steamships with \\"engines roaring and boilers near bursting, with hundreds of men hauling from the rocks on ropes and others pushing from the decks with pikes\\", and one vessel \\"allegedly wriggled up a narrow water- slide to within fifty metres of the top before the attempt had to be abandoned\\". Alternative modes of transport were necessary. One idea came in the form of Herbert Warington Smyth, a British tidal expert living in Siam, suggested that a tramway or canal with a series of locks should be built around the falls; a canal \\"would satisfactorily cripple the French economy, costing about the same as the Manchester Ship Canal yet never carrying more than one ten-thousandth of its tonnage\\". The French settled on a small portage railway across the islands of Don Khon and (later) Don Det, which would allow specially-designed vessels to be dismantled, transported on the railway, reassembled and launched further upstream.  Development  The first railway was laid on Don Khon‚Äîthe more-southerly of the two islands‚Äîin 1893, when Laos became part of French Indochina (the French colonial empire in Southeast Asia). Its route stretched four kilometres, from the southeastern corner of the island (near the village of Ban Hangkhon) north-west to the northern part of the island near the village of Ban Khon. The railway was temporary for its first four years, laid in segments which could be lifted when the train had passed and relaid in front. The gun-sloops Lagrandi√®re, Ham Luong and Massie were the first to cross the island by this method, followed by the Garcerie, Colombert and Trentinian in 1896; the latter sank in the Mekong River after a 1928 gasoline explosion. Imported Vietnamese labour hauled wagons which carried sections of the vessels. A permanent railway was laid by 1897, and a wood-burning steam locomotive replaced manpower for traction. The first seven-tonne steam locomotive was christened Paul Doumer (Governor-General of French Indochina from 1897 to 1902), and equipment was supplied by Decauville via Cochinchina. Trains could have a maximum of 12 cars (consisting of a steam locomotive, open-topped wagons and carriages), and it took an average of two trains to load a vessel. At the northern terminal, passengers transferred to a steamship on the river channel dividing Don Det and Don Khon. As the vessels could only travel when the river was in flood, during the 1910s the railway was extended three kilometres to Don Det and it terminated at a pier near Ban Khon. The outbreak of the Second World War apparently sealed the railway's fate, and the last train reportedly ran in 1940. However, the year the railway was extended from Don Khon to Don Det is unknown; one reference dates the extension to the 1920s. Although the viaduct was probably built by 1917 (possibly as early as 1910), the line may not have been operational until the 1920s.  Contemporary account  Although there are few accounts of the railway‚Äìwritten or pictorial‚ÄîMarthe Bassenne, a physician's wife, travelled between Phnom Penh and Luang Prabang in 1910:  Present-day route  The remains of the railway on Don Khon. Although the railway‚Äîincluding the concrete viaduct‚Äîremains largely intact and can be walked or cycled (except for short stretches in a maintenance yard), its rails have been removed. The trackbed, consisting of compacted ballast and sand, is used to traverse the islands. Nearly all visitors reach the islands via Nakasang in Champasak Province (off Route 13), arriving by boat at Ban Hua Det on Don Det. At Ban Khon on Don Khon, one of the two wood-burning steam locomotives still in existence is at a former maintenance depot. Built in 1911 by Orenstein & Koppel and named Elo√Øse, the rusty engine sits on a short stretch of track. A shed has been constructed to protect the locomotive from further deterioration, and the section of track has been raised onto a small concrete plinth to protect the wheels from water.  Proposed reconstruction  Until the first decade of the 21st century, the government of Laos made no serious attempt to reopen the railway since its closure in the 1940s. The Vientiane Times published news in December 2005 about the possible reopening of the railway by 2007 for tourism. The budget for reconstruction was an estimated US$1.5 million and, although local materials would have been sought, new rolling stock from abroad would have to be purchased. A memorandum of understanding was signed between the principal backer (the South Korean Kyungin Engineering and Construction Company) and the Laotian government, but the company backed out of the agreement. Improvements in local and regional highways and airport infrastructure have reduced the need to use the Mekong River for freight transportation in Laos.

The desert shrub plant community includes such species as Atriplex confertifolia, Pleuraphis jamesii, Artemisia nova, and Achnatherum hymenoides. The cactus flowers are pollinated by insects, probably including bees, ants, and beetles. This cactus grows throughout the Uinta Basin of Utah, mainly in Uintah County along the Green River and its tributaries. Despite its being limited to one region, it is found in many locations there and its population could number 30,000. Threats to the species include damage to the habitat during hydrocarbon exploration, poaching, off-road vehicle use, and grazing. There are many active oil wells in the area, and there is associated activities in the habitat such as road construction and maintenance and pipeline installation and maintenance, which cause habitat fragmentation and the edge effect. Other damage includes erosion, dust production, and the introduction of weeds.

It is also one of the rare exceptions to the rule that a transfer of assets which only takes effect upon a person's bankruptcy is normally void.  Facts  Steel Bros Ltd‚Äôs articles of association said if a member went bankrupt his shares would be transferred to designated persons at a fair price not above par value. Mr JE Borland held 73 ¬£100 shares and went bankrupt, and so the company gave Borland‚Äôs trustee in bankruptcy notice of the transfer.

The transfer could be made, because the contract engendered in the articles of association are prior to the rights contained in a share.

It illustrates the principle of exhaustion, that the rights attached to a share in an article would be presumed exhaustive, although one should construe the nature of a share with a starting presumption of equality. The principle is now subject to the advice given by Lord Hoffmann in Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd and ICS Ltd v West Bromwich BS. Facts The company sold its canal business to another company and made a profit. It proposed to wind up and distribute the ¬£500,000 remaining to shareholders. There were 130,000 ordinary shares. There were also 30,000 preference shares (with 5% preference on dividends), some one-third paid up, some fully paid up. There was nothing in the articles concerning the preferential shares' entitlements on winding up. The company argued that the preferential shares were just like debentures, and they should only get their money back. The preferential shareholders argued that they should be entitled to a priority in the distribution. Judgment The House of Lords held clearly preferential shares were not debentures, they are equity, because the 5% preference would not be paid if there was no profit, whereas a 5% interest rate would have to be. To calculate their entitlement on winding up, the court should begin the process of construction with a presumption of equality. Since it was deemed that the provision on 5% extra dividends was exhaustive, and there was no indication this should apply to winding up, there was no automatic right to more preferential distributions on winding up. Lord Macnaghten noted that preference shareholders ‚Äòmust be treated as having all the rights of shareholders, except so far as they renounced these rights on their admission to the company.‚Äô See also *UK company law *Andrews v Gas Meter Co [1897] 1 Ch 361 Notes References * External links * Category:United Kingdom company case law Category:House of Lords cases Category:1889 in case law Category:1889 in British law ","title":"Birch v Cropper"},{"id":"32517010","title":"Called Out in the Dark"},{"id":"32517011","text":"Sclerocactus wrightiae is a rare species of cactus known by the common names Wright's little barrel cactusVan Buren R, Cooper JG, Shultz LM, Harper KT. 2011.

It is numerous threats and is federally listed as an endangered species of the United States (listed under the Endangered Species Act on October 11, 1979). This plant grows in shrublands on a specific type of soil. It is usually fine or sandy in texture and there is a large amount of material scattered on the land, including pebbles, gravel, and fossil oyster shells. An important component of the substrate is the cryptobiotic crust that lies on top. The cactus is absent from areas where this crust has been destroyed. Description Sclerocactus wrightiae has stems 4‚Äì12 cm tall that are depressed-hemispheric to obovoid to short-cylindric (but not becoming tall-cylindric). Flowers are 2 to 3.5 cm long, yellowish to white or pink. Filaments are red-violet.

Livestock activity, such as trampling and uprooting of plants, may be a threat. Off-road vehicle use causes damage. Poaching is also a significant problem. The cactus also suffers from natural predation by the beetle Moneilema semipunctatum which has been exacerbated by climate change. Small mammals such as Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii) and White-tailed antelope squirrel (Ammospermophilus leucurus) may eat the cactus.

He is the co-founder of South Sudan Reborn, a political organisation that attempts to bring peace to South Sudan and is the primary spokesperson. He is also the head of the SPLM-Former Detainees (SPLM-FD). Early life Pa'gan Amum Okiech was born in a small post known as Wat in the Lou Nuer area. His father was a non-commissioned police officer responsible for the Wat post. His family moved to Malakal after his grandfather, Okiech, chief of the Ubuar people, died and Pa'gan Amum's father was asked to take over the role. His father went from being a clan chief to later being paramount chief and president of the court. His mother named him Pagan, which means 'incredible' in the Shilluk language. Both his parents were educated and his family had considerable wealth. His father acquired substantial tracts of land, farmed various crops and operated a series of shops in Malakal. He left home to study at the University of Khartoum in the late 1970s, where Southern Sudanese students were a minority. Sudanese civil wars In 1982, Pa'gan Amum left law school in Khartoum to organize and command a group of young revolutionaries committed to the establishment of a new country in southern Sudan. This group joined with other insurgent groups to form the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) under the leadership of Pa'gan Amum's mentor Dr John Garang de Maboir. In 2005, Pa'gan Amum was part of Dr. Garang's team that negotiated the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA), which brought to an end the Sudanese Civil War and led to a historic, internationally supervised referendum in 2011. South Sudanese politics After the referendum, Pa'gan Amum continued his service as Secretary General of the SPLM. He was elected by the National Liberation Council. He was also South Sudan's Chief Negotiator with Sudan on post independence issues. He served as the Minister for Peace and Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) Implementation in the Government of Southern Sudan, prior to independence in 2011, and as the caretaker Minister of Peace in the first government post-independence, taking office on 23 July, 2011. In 2011, he was the chief negotiator, negotiating on behalf of the South Sudanese government with the Sudanese government over splitting oil revenues after South Sudanese independence. In January 2012, Sudan confiscated the South's oil shipments at Port Sudan, effectively holding hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue hostage in order to secure a stronger bargaining position during revenue negotiations. In retaliation, the South Sudanese government threatened to shut down all oil production. A few days later, the South Sudanese council of ministers chose to completely shut down all oil production. President Salva Kiir (of South Sudan) and President Omar al-Bashir (of Sudan) negotiated an agreement to the stand-off during an emergency heads of state summit at Addis Abba, however Pa'gan Amum rejected the agreement and refused to sign it. President Kiir was then forced to renege on the agreement, infuriating the Sudanese. In 2013, the South Sudan descended into civil war and on 23 July that year, Pa'gan Amum was put under house arrest by SPLM and suspended from all official duties. A trial against Pa'gan Amum and three other SPLM leaders (the 'detainees') accused of treason began the following year in March, 2014 but was overturned in April. During this period, Pa'gan Amum claims he avoided several assassination attempts. In June 2015, the detainees were returned to Juba from exile in Kenya and were reintegrated into the ruling party. Pa'gan Amum was re-instated as secretary general. Pa'gan Amum signed the 2015 peace agreement in Addis Ababa between the current government and the opposition. Claiming continuous threats to his security, Pa'gan Amum is currently in exile in the United States. He is currently living in Denver. In 2017, he received a restraining order against Amira Ali and then sued her for slander after she posted videos on Facebook accusing him of murder and rape.

Early life The young James Edward Corea was educated at the Royal College, Colombo. Gate Mudaliyar James Edward Corea of Chilaw with his wife and ten children. Arnold Wright in 'Twentieth Century Impressions of Ceylon,' writes that Gate Mudaliyar J.E.Corea owned extensive coconut estates as well as large tracts of paddy lands in Chilaw. Corea was born in Chilaw, on the west coast of Sri Lanka, on 2 December 1865. His father was Johannes Christoffel Corea who was a Mudaliyar of the Chilaw District. In the 1870s Corea was educated at one of the leading educational institutions in the country, the Colombo Academy. In 1888 he married Frances Eleanor Terentia, daughter of D. C. Ameresekera, Proctor of the Supreme Court, Kurunegala and they had ten children. They came from an Anglican Christian background. Roper Lethbridge in 'The Golden Book of India'; a genealogical and biographical dictionary of the ruling princes, chiefs, nobles, and other personages, titled or decorated, of the Indian empire, with an appendix for Ceylon, written in 1900, mentions James Edward Corea: 'COREA, Abhayaratna Gunasekara Wi-kramasundara Wijayasekere, James Edward, Gate Mudaliyar; born 1866. His father was Mudaliyar Johannes Christopher Corea, Mudaliyar of Chilaw, who was son of Mudaliyar Abraham Corea, brother of Mudaliyar Simon Corea.' The Corea family J.E.Corea was a member of the Corea Family who grew in influence as a result of being wealthy land owners. The Sri Lankan author, Kumari Jayawardena, writing about the Coreas observed: 'Unconnected to the liquor trade but making their money on plantation ventures was the Corea Family of Chilaw, an influential govigama group with a history going back to Portuguese rule when they were warriors to Sinhala kings. During Dutch and British rule, members of the family were officials serving the state in various ways and rewarded with titles.' The writer Kumari Jayawardena goes on to state that: 'While being professionals and political activists, the Coreas were also important landowners.' Descendant of King Dominicus Corea James Edward was a direct descendant of King Dominicus Corea, who was also known as Edirille Rala. He was crowned King of Kotte and Sitawaka. His coronation was arranged by Vimala Dharma Suriya, King of Kandy, in 1596. Dominicus Corea often switching allegiances fought for all the opponents and finally changed sides and fought the Portuguese Army, he was captured and executed in Colombo on July 14, 1596. Dominicus Corea was hailed as a 'war hero' in the Mahavamsa, the ancient chronicles of Sri Lanka. Mahatma Gandhi, the 'Father of India', visited Chilaw in 1927. Gate Mudaliyar James Edward Corea met Gandhi at 'Sigiriya,' a Corea home situated in the town. The Coat of Arms of the Dominion of Ceylon used in the British era. Landed proprietor and planter James Edward Corea owned vast coconut estates and paddy fields in and around the Chilaw area. Arnold Wright, writing in 1907 in his book Twentieth Century Impressions of Ceylon, noted: \\"James Edward Corea Abhayaratna Vijayasekera Mudaliyar Pitigal Korale, North Chilaw was educated at Colombo Academy (now Royal College, Colombo), and entered Government Service in 1887.\\" He was attached to the Provincial Road Committee at Kurunegala. He was appointed to the District Roads Committee in 1888 in Chilaw and in 1899 he became Mudaliyar of Pitigal Korale North. Also he was inspector of coaches and inquirer into crimes of the Chilaw District and in charge of the Rural Police of Pitigal Korale North. He was the chairman of the Village Committee and also the president of the Council of Irrigation. Also he owned extensive estates being a landed proprietor and planter. He owned Karrukkuwa, Tittakada and Tambagalle coconut estates in Chilaw district as well as large tracts of paddy lands. He was also a member of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society. ' Gate Mudaliyar Recognising his influence in the world of trade and commerce on the island, the Governor of Ceylon appointed James Edward Corea, a Gate Mudaliyar of Ceylon. Mudaliyar was a colonial title & office in Sri Lanka. When the British governed the island of Ceylon, they re-introduced the 'Mudaliyar Class,' first set up by the Portuguese and then the Dutch colonial rulers. All these appointments were made by the Governor of Ceylon. The Governor delegated special duties to Gate Mudaliyar J.E. Corea. Meeting Mahatma Gandhi When Mahatma Gandhi, the 'Father of India,' visited Ceylon for the first time in 1927, he travelled to Chilaw and met with the Corea Family including Gate Mudaliyar J.E.Corea. Gandhi was hosted in a Corea home called 'Sigiriya,' in Chilaw. The family organised a huge banquet for Gandhi who had been invited to Chilaw by J.E.Corea's kinsemen, Charles Edgar Corea and Victor Corea, leading figures in the independence movement. Both brothers were elected members of the Legislative Council of Ceylon. They also founded the Chilaw Association and the Ceylon National Congress. Gandhi stayed for several days in Chilaw at the request of the Corea family. Family One of the sons of J.E.Corea, J.C.A. Corea who was born in 1904 in Chilaw, created education history on the island, when he was appointed the first ever Sri Lankan Principal of the Royal College, Colombo, by the Government of Sri Lanka.

The company‚Äôs assets were transferred to the National Coal Board, and the company was waiting for reimbursement. In advance of liquidation the company procured a special resolution for reduction of capital, whereby all paid up capital would be returned to preference shareholders, to settle any claims. The aim was to eliminate them from the company, so ordinary shareholders could get excesses from compulsory purchase compensation. The preference shareholders, including Scottish Insurance Corp Ltd complained that they should be able to share in the proceeds from liquidated assets.

Balagopal, a former Indian Administrative Service (IAS, 1977 Batch) officer from the Manipur Cadre. It was established as joint venture with Sree Chitra Thirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology and soon became the first company in India to produce blood bags using indigenous technology. In 1989, Penpol started exporting and followed it up it by setting up an R&D; centre. In 1999, Tokyo-based Terumo Corporation signed a contract to acquire a 74% share of Peninsula Polymers Limited, and the new joint venture was renamed as Terumo Penpol Limited (TPL). The stake of financial institutions and other investors bought over by Terumo, leaving only the promoters and itself as shareholders. Operations Terumo Penpol has its headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala and employs 1200 people. Terumo Penpol Blood Bags are sold in over 64 countries across the world and its medical equipment division has commissioned more than 25000 installations.

It is endemic to Florida in the United States, where it is known only from the Florida Panhandle. It is threatened by a number of human activities and its small population sizes make it vulnerable.USFWS. Scutellaria floridana Five-year Review. June 2009. It is a federally listed threatened species. This is a perennial herb growing up to 40 centimeters tall with one or more upright, square-edged stems. The tiny, narrow leaves are linear in shape with rolled edges and are just a few millimeters long. Flowers occur next to the leaves. The corolla has one lower lip and a hoodlike upper lip. It is purple‚Äìblue in color with a white spot inside.Scutellaria floridana. The Nature Conservancy. Blooming occurs in April through July. Blooming is heavier in the seasons after a fire. This plant grows in soils containing humus and sand. Habitat types include flatwoods, wet prairie, bog, savannah, the transition between flatwoods and wetland areas.Scutellaria florida. Center for Plant Conservation. The plant's habitat is fire-dependent; it is maintained by a natural fire regime of periodic wildfire. In protected areas that are managed appropriately with prescribed burns the plant is locally abundant and flowers properly. In areas where fire suppression is practiced, large and woody vegetation grows up and produces shade so that the plant does not receive enough sunlight. The plant itself responds to fire. It simply does not produce flowers if it does not burn every three years. Lack of fire is a main threat to the species. Other threats include habitat destruction during coastal development and the conversion of land to agriculture, particularly silviculture for the paper pulp industry. Off-road vehicle use in the habitat is a threat. This plant occurs in Gulf, Franklin, and Liberty Counties. Most of the populations are within the Apalachicola National Forest. It can be found in St. Joseph Bay State Buffer Preserve, the Apalachicola River Wildlife and Environmental Area, and Tate's Hell State Forest. Many of these protected populations are healthy. Those which are found on private land, particularly in timber-growing areas, are not.

There are many interpretations of the story, but he is variously thought to portend the death of a member of the Ogilvy family, Earl of Airlie or the owners of Cortachy Castle. He is said to be nine foot tall and is occasionally accompanied by ghostly pipes. The legend can trace its roots back to at least the 19th century and the death of the 14th Earl of Airlie. He is said to play a tattoo when he appears. The ghost is thought to be the spirit of a drummer for the Carlisle family; who was thrown out of a window in the high tower of the castle after incurring the jealousy of the then Lord. However, some versions of the story say that the drummer was the messenger for a hated chieftain and in yet another version of the tale, he is the spirit of a drummer who deliberately failed to warn the castle of an impending attack. In all versions of the tale he was stuffed into his drum before his death. The most famous sighting of the drummer was in 1844, when the Lady Airlie (or in some versions, her guests) heard the noise. She would later write in a note on her deathbed that she 'knew the drumming was for [her]'. The spirit is now thought to be dormant since in 1900 the Earl of Airlie died in the Boer War without a reported sighting.

It concerns the rule that shares should not be issued \\"at a discount\\" on the price at which they were issued. Under United Kingdom company law the rule is now codified in Companies Act 2006, sections 552 and 580. Facts The Ooregum Gold Mining Co of India issued 120,000 shares at ¬£1 each. Shareholders said they wanted to sell on the shares for 5 shillings, (i.e. 25 new pence) one quarter of the value the shares were issued at, but that the buyers would be credited with a full ¬£1 in the company. This would mean that shareholders would get a 15 shilling (75 new pence) discount. At the time of the litigation, the share price stood at ¬£2 14s. The shareholders at the time of the purchase (who now wanted money to pay off a debenture) even though they had voted for the issue, then turned around to the buyers and argued that shares were prohibited from being issued at a discount, and that the transaction was void. Judgment The House of Lords agreed that shares must not be issued at a discount. It was concerned with the potential effects on creditors. Although it is arguable that any capital increase would benefit creditors (hence speaking in favour of not preventing issue at a discount), the Lords held the proper technical route would be for the company to reduce the nominal value of the shares (as seen in the later case of Greenhalgh v Arderne Cinemas Ltd[1951] Ch 286).

In addition to that, Machado also sparked further controversy after she revealed that she had done three plastic surgeries: breast augmentation, liposuction and rhinoplasty. Machado was also met by loud booing during the preliminary phase of the Miss Universe pageant on 8 September, mixed with cheers from the audience of mainly local Brazilians. A few hours after the preliminary competition, Machado tweeted the following: \\"Respect is something good, and we all appreciate it. I work hard, seriously, and I have high morals. Nobody in this world has the right to judge me\\".

Late 19th century The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA, to differentiate from the British RSPCA) was established in Singapore on 27 March 1876. A committee, consisting of W.H. Read and John Cameron, the editor of The Straits Times, was to oversee its activities with William Adamson acting as its Chair and D.E.A. Hervey as the Honorary Secretary. The society's mission was to \\"inquire into the present law and to suggest such amendments and additions to it as may seem necessary for the carrying out of the objects of the Society.\\" A subscription for membership cost $3 per year, or $25 for lifetime. In July 1878, the SPCA published its first annual report, highlighting the treatment of working animals: > No matter how small they may be, weak or strong, sick or well, they are > employed in conveying loads frequently above their strength, as for instance > a cart load of bricks, about 400 to the load, weighing...1 ton 8 cwt [1.4 > metric tons]. They are often beaten throughout the journey, and goaded on > with those favorite native methods of torture - twisting the tails or > progging with a point in tender places. By the mid-1880s, the SPCA held regular meetings among its members and actively addressed complaints involving the mistreatment of animals. Among its notable representatives was Inspector E.F. Paglar, who brought to court nine cases of animal abuse that resulted in the offender's incarceration in 1885. With the increasing involvement of municipal officials, including engineer James MacRitchie and coroner Alexander Gentle, both present at a meeting in July 1890, the Society began to debate the definition of cruelty in public with the stated goal of promoting awareness. Modern Days After the Japanese occupation of Singapore, the RSPCA, as it was known then, was restarted by Miss Lucia Bach, an Englishwoman. She ran a boarding house and also took in unwanted stray animals. In 1954, the RSPCA was set up formally and moved to Orchard Road, facilitated by the presence of an RSPCA from England to run the operation and train an inspector. Two additional staff members were hired as a telephone operator and a driver of its first official vehicle. When Singapore ceased to be a crown colony in 1959, RSPCA was renamed the SPCA. In 1984, the SPCA moved to 31 Mount Vernon Road after the Government acquired the Orchard Road land. The Singapore SPCA plays an important role in animal rescue. It is not government funded and depend on donations, charity organizations, memberships and money from selling of SPCA merchandise from the public. The Singapore SPCA receives more than 400 unwanted, abandoned or abused animals. They also depend on volunteers who are willing to lend a helping hand to the SPCA. Objectives and services The Singapore SPCA's two main objectives are to promote kindness to animals and birds, and to prevent cruelty to animals and birds. The SPCA provides various animal welfare services to the community including investigation of cruelty complaints, a 24-hour emergency service for sick, injured and very young animals and an adoption programme. Financial information The Singapore SPCA relies primarily on donations from the public to fund its operations. In its website, it states that \\"over $2,000,000 annually is required to carry out the animal welfare work.\\" In 2010, they received over S$2.2 million from various avenues such as cash donations, membership fees, fund-raising events and sales of souvenirs and pet supplies. In that same year, their total expenditure was over S$2.1 million.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Heaton, the archdeaconry of Manchester, and the diocese of Manchester. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II listed building, having been designated on 9 February 2012. History The church was built in 1874‚Äì75 and designed by the Lancaster partnership of Paley and Austin. It was consecrated on 15 March 1875 by the Bishop of Manchester. It initially consisted of a three-bay nave, a chancel and a south aisle, providing seating for about 200 people. The site for the church was given by Lord Egerton of Tatton Park. In 1881‚Äì82 the same architects added the bellcote, followed by the clergy vestry, a reredos and the organ screen in 1885. In 1901 the successors in the practice, Austin and Paley added the north aisle at a cost of ¬£3,000 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ). Further work was carried out on the west end of the church by the same practice in 1925‚Äì26, and a baptistry, and two porches were added. In 1998 the oak pulpit and choir stalls were removed, and the pews were replaced by chairs. Architecture St Margaret's is constructed in sandstone. Its plan consists of a three-bay nave, north and south aisles, a south porch, a baptistery, and a chancel. The architectural style is Decorated. In the Buildings of England series, the authors describe the interior as \\"well-proportioned\\", and with a \\"single- framed roof\\". The reredos dates from 1885. The memorials to the World Wars have been designed to match the reredos; the inscriptions are on small tiles, separated by gold mosaic. The stained glass includes a window in the south aisle dated 1894 depicting Faith, Hope and Charity. In the south wall of the chancel is a window dating from about 1920 by Walter J. Pearce, and in the east of the south aisle is a window from about 1950 by T. F. Wilford. Also dating from 1950 is a window in the baptistery depicting Scouts, Guides, Cubs and Brownies. The two-manual organ was built by George Sixsmith and Son in 1973. It replaced an earlier three-manual organ.

He signed for Willenhall Pickwick in 1885. In 1886 Fletcher signed for Wolverhampton Wanderers when Jack Addenbrooke paid a golden sovereign for his signature from Willenhall Pickwick. Wolverhampton Wanderers joined the Football League two years after Fletcher joined the club.

Background Kia Ora Gold Corporation NL was incorporated in South Australia in September 1954 and was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. It carried on business principally as a gold mining company in Western Australia. Western United Limited, originally formed in 1953, had an equal partnership with Kia Oro in the Marvel Loch mine, which was sold in 1987. After 1983, it changed its focus to concentrate on the provision of financial and mining services. Each company had a shareholding in the other, and both were under common control. In 1987, Kia Ora made a takeover bid to purchase all shares of Western United Ltd, in consideration for either: :* 4 fully paid ordinary shares of Kia Oro for every Western United share, or :* 5 fully paid ordinary shares for every two WU shares, together with $1.20 for each WU share. This valued WU Ltd at $3.95 to $4.40 a share, based on Kia Oro's market price of $1.10 a share. WU's shares then had a market price of $2.45 a share. Kia Ora's directors instructed the Perth office of Nelson Wheeler,subsequently merged into Parkhill BDO, now part of BDO International to do a report for its shareholders, and this valued WU Ltd at $3.22 a share, and it was reasonable to pay a premium to acquire WU Ltd. Kia Ora shareholders approved the takeover. In 1988, Kia Oro entered into a reverse takeover for the assets of the Duke Group of companies, with Duke acquiring all the issued capital of Kia Oro. Upon completion, in July 1988 Kia Oro changed its name to The Duke Group Limited. In July 1989 it was placed in liquidation by order of the Supreme Court of South Australia. The administrator subsequently sued Pilmer and other partners of Nelson Wheeler in all States, for breach of duty of care in contract and in tort, as well as in breach of fiduciary duty. The directors were also sued for breach of their fiduciary and statutory duty to the company by the administrator, and in cross-claim by Pilmer and his fellow partners. Pilmer alleged that the directors breached their duty of care and fiduciary duties, in getting a report that was not reasonably accurate. Pilmer alleged the directors had a personal interest in the takeover outcome as they were substantial shareholders in WU Ltd, and this conflict of interest led to a fallacious report which wrongly stated the price was fair, as Australian Stock Exchange rules required. The Nelson Wheeler partners in offices outside Perth contended that each office constituted a separate partnership, and no national partnership existed therefore no liability would fall on them for actions arising in the Perth office. The courts below At trial, Mullighan J found: :* Western Union's success was based upon significant transactions it performed for Kia Oro. The activities of Kia Oro and Western Union ultimately depended on the success of the Marvel Loch mine, and its sale resulted in the creation of a large cash reserve, which was used in the takeover bid for WU. :* Nelson Wheeler Perth were negligent in the preparation of their report, and were liable both in contract and in tort, as well as having a contractual duty to act independently, but they were not liable for breach of fiduciary duty. Duke's directors were held not to be liable for contributory negligence in the matter. :* The directors were in breach of their fiduciary and statutory duties. :* Aside from three individuals, Nelson Wheeler partners in all States were ruled to be in a national partnership. :* Liability was assessed proportionately. On appeal to the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia, Doyle CJ, Duggan and Bleby JJ, found: :* Nelson Wheeler Perth were liable for breach of duty of care both in contract and in tort, but there was no contractual duty to act independently. However. Duke's directors were liable for contributory negligence, and so NWP's damages should be reduced by 35%. :* NWP were also liable for breach of fiduciary duty. :* There was no national partnership in effect for Nelson Wheeler. At the High Court Appeal was allowed. Majority ruling The High Court discussed the nature of fiduciary duty, citing from jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada. Australian jurisprudence in the matter, however, draws from the High Court's decision in Hospital Products Ltd v US Surgical Corporation. and subsequently in Breen v Williams,.see also . and accordingly fiduciary obligations are proscriptive rather than prescriptive in nature; there is not imposed upon fiduciaries a quasi-tortious duty to act solely in the best interests of their principals. In that regard, the trial judge was correct in his interpretation of the law. In addition, it could not be shown that a conflict of interest existed with respect to NWP's dealings with Kia Ora: Although it was not a crucial point in the appeal, the High Court also held that \\"the actual decision in re White Star Line Ltdre White Star Line Ltd, [1938] Ch 458. LawCite Records may be understood as turning on the fact that both parties to the transaction knew that the consideration offered and received was not worth the sum attributed to it.\\" Opinion of Kirby J Kirby J agreed that the appeal should be allowed. However, he held that Breen did not exclude a fiduciary obligation: He proceeded to summarize principles relating the nature of fiduciary obligations: #They are not confined to established relationships, or to exactly identical facts, as those that have given rise to them in the past. #It is not sufficient, to impose fiduciary obligations on an alleged wrong-doer, simply to point to the vulnerability of the person claiming to have been wronged. #The mere fact that a party may have remedies at law, whether in contract or tort, does not exclude the possibility that fiduciary obligations may also be imposed. #The greatest difficulty facing those who assert the existence of fiduciary obligations, outside the classic per se relationships, arises from the fact that the law has not formulated any precise or comprehensive definition of the criteria adopted for imposing such obligations. #The unifying principle of fiduciary obligations arises from the existence of a duty of loyalty that, reflecting \\"higher community standards or values\\", gives rise to a \\"legitimate expectation that the other party will act in the interests of the first party or at least in the joint interests of the parties and not solely self-interestedly\\". #To reduce the uncertainties that arise from the elusive \\"essence\\" of the \\"fiduciary principle\\", it is reasonable for courts to have regard to features commonly found in cases where fiduciary obligations have been upheld.

Later, they were symbols of royal power and grandeur in the gardens of the kings of France. Today, though they no longer provide drinking water, they decorate the squares and parks of French cities and towns. Roman fountains Roman fountain that spouted water into the bathing pool of the Roman baths of Glanum, in Provence. (1st century AD) The first known fountains in France were built by Roman engineers in the first and second centuries A.D. in Glanum, Vaison-la-Romaine, N√Æmes, and other towns of Provence. Like the fountains in Rome, they were fed with water from distant lakes and rivers aqueducts, sometimes more than fifty kilometres from the fountains. Remains of the aqueducts can be found outside Avignon, Arles, Aix-en-Provence, Glanum, and other Roman towns. Once the water arrived in the cities, it was channelled into lead pipes which distributed it to street fountains, or direct to Roman baths and villas. Examples of these fountains can be seen in the ruins of Glanum and the museum at Vaison-La-Romaine. The Roman street fountains were free-standing stone blocks connected to lead pipes beneath the street; water flowed through the pipes and then upward to spouts in the blocks, pushed by water pressure from the higher sources of the water and drawn by the siphon effect of the water flowing out of the spigots. The water emerged from the mouth of a mask shaped like an animal or human face. The water flowed continually, was collected into pots or jars, and was taken home. Beginning in the 5th century A.D., with the invasion of barbarian tribes into France, the Roman fountain system began to break down. Aqueducts were wrecked or fell into ruin, cities were abandoned, and the fountains usually stopped working, either from destruction or from neglect. French cities were not to have a reliable water distribution system until the 18th century.Plantier, pg. 42 File:Roman fountain Vaison-la-Romaine.jpg|Stone of a Roman street fountain from Vaison- la-Romaine, in Provence (1st or 2nd century AD) File:Roman fountain in louvre 01.JPG|Vasque of an ancient Roman fountain in the Louvre, Paris File:Venerand font3.JPG|Roman fountain in V√©n√©rand, Charente-Maritime, SW France File:Glanum Monumental Fountain.JPGRemains of a monumental Roman fountain near the forum in Glanum, (about 20 BC) French Medieval Fountains Fontaine de la Croix de Pierre, in Rouen (1519) During the Middle Ages, Roman aqueducts were wrecked or fell into decay, and many fountains in France stopped working, so fountains existed mainly in art and literature, or in secluded monasteries or palace gardens. Fountains in the Middle Ages were associated with the source of life, purity, wisdom, innocence, and the Garden of Eden.Psalms 36:9; Proverbs 13:14; Revelation 22:1; Dante's Paradisio XXV 1-9. In illuminated manuscripts like the Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry (1411‚Äì1416), the Garden of Eden was shown with a graceful gothic fountain in the centre (see illustration). The cloister of a monastery was supposed to be a replica of the Garden of Eden, protected from the outside world. Simple fountains, called lavabos, were placed inside Medieval monasteries such as Le Thoronet Abbey in Provence and were used for ritual washing before religious services and meals.Molina, Nathalie, 1999: Le Thoronet Abbey, Monum - Editions du patrimoine. Fountains were also found in the enclosed medieval jardins d'amour, \\"gardens of courtly love\\" - ornamental gardens used for courtship and relaxion. The medieval romance The Roman de la Rose describes a fountain in the center of an enclosed garden, feeding small streams bordered by flowers and fresh herbs. Medieval fountains could also provide amusement. The gardens of the Counts of Artois at the Chateau de Herdin, built in 1295, contained famous fountains, called Les Merveilles de Herdin which could be triggered to drench surprised visitors.Allain and Christiany, L'art des jardins en Europe This type of \\"water joke\\" later became popular in Renaissance and baroque gardens. The Fontaine de la Croix-de-Pierre in Rouen is one of the few existing medieval fountains in France. It was built in 1517 next to a stone cross erected by the local bishop in 1197. It was demolished by the Calvinists in 1562, but was rebuilt. In 1792, during the French Revolution, the cross at the top was replaced by a bust of Marat. but this was removed in 1795. In 1872 the fountain was rebuilt according to the original plans.

While few fountains were built in French cities, where water was usually taken directly from the river or from wells. many fountains were built in villages, particularly in Provence. These fountains were originally located just outside or at the entrance to a village, at a spring, or close by, connected by an underground gallery. They were often built on the same site as an earlier Roman fountain, and the same basic designs were used from medieval times until the 19th century. Wall fountains were built at the spring, or against the wall of the building. They had a reservoir of water which was filled by gravity, and then the water poured out spouts, or canons, which were often decorated with mascarons, or masks, in the form of the heads of humans, animals or monsters. Later, in the 16th century, a more sophisticated version of the wall fountain appeared, based on the design of ancient Roman street fountains. These new fountains showed the wealth and prestige of the town or village. and were usually placed in the central square, near the church. Inside the buffet, or the wall behind the fountain, was a hollow chamber called the bassin de repartition, connected by a pipe to the source of water below. The canon of the fountain was connected with the basin, with its entrance just below the water level in the basin. As the water poured out the canon, it would create a siphon, drawing water up the pipe and keeping the bassin de repartition filled.Plantier, pg. 57 As the water poured out the canon, it would be captured in an earthenware jar and carried home. The water not taken this way went into a stone abreuvoir, or basin, where it could be drunk by cattle, sheep or horses. The overflow water went then into a separate basin, a lavoir, where it could be used for washing clothes. The overflow water was then used for irrigating gardens. Since the traditional village way of washing clothes was to use wood cinders as a detergent, which were rich in potassium, the wash water was an efficient fertilizer for the gardens. Another common village fountain design beginning in the 16th century was the fontaine ronde √† f√ªt, or barrel fountain. This type of fountain was illustrated on ancient Greek vases from the 6th century B.C. The fountain was free-standing, in the center of a square. It was composed of a circular stone basin, in the center of which was a stone column with a hollow cavity in the center for the bassin de repartition, connected to one or more canons. As the water poured from the canons, water was drawn by a siphon effect from the pipe below, keeping the bassin filled. The top of the fountain was covered by a stone cap, or couvercle, which could be removed to service the fountain.Plantier, pg. 79. A third common type of village fountain was the fontaine √† bulbe, or bulb fountain. The bulb fountain operated in the same way as the barrel fountain, except that the bassin de repartition was located in a separate stone container, usually bulb shape, placed on top of column. The canons of the fountain were attached to the bulb rather than the column. The masks through which the water flowed were frequently carved directly onto the stone of the bulb.

They became works of art, and not just of engineering. Between 1546-1549, the merchants of Paris built the first Renaissance-style fountain in Paris, the Fontaine des Innocents, to commemorate the ceremonial entry of the King Henry II of France into the city. The fountain, which originally stood against the wall of the church of the Holy Innocents, was moved and rebuilt several times and now stands in a square near Les Halles. It is the oldest fountain in Paris.Marion Boudon, \\"La fontaine des Innocents\\", in Paris et ses fontaines, de la Renaissance √† nos jours, 1995. Henry constructed an Italian-style garden with a fountain shooting a vertical jet of water for his favorite mistress, Diana de Poitiers, next to the Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau (1556‚Äì1559). At the royal Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau, he built another fountain with a bronze statue of Diane, goddess of the hunt, modeled after Diane de Poitiers.Le Guide du Patrimoine en France, Editions du Patrmoine, Centre des Monuments Nationaux, 2009 Later, after the death of Henry II, his widow, Catherine de' Medici, expelled Diana de Poitiers from Chenonceau and built her own fountain and garden there. King Henry IV of France made an important contribution to French fountains by inviting an Italian hydraulic engineer, Tommaso Francini, who had worked on the fountains of the villa at Pratalino, to make fountains in France. Francini became a French citizen in 1600, built the Medici Fountain, and during the rule of the young King Louis XIII, he was raised to the position of Intendant g√©n√©ral des Eaux et Fontaines of the King, a position which was hereditary. His descendants became the royal fountain designers for Louis XIII and for Louis XIV at Versailles.A. Muesset, Les Francinis, Paris, 1930, cited in Luigi Gallo, La pr√©sence italianne au 17e si√®cle, in Paris et ses fontaines de la Renaissance √† nos jours, Collection Paris et son patrimoine, (1995). The Renaissance style spread widely in France, as noblemen and members of court transformed their castles into Renaissance-style residences and laid out gardens and fountains. One example is found at the Ch√¢teau d'Opme, in the Auvergne near Clermont-Ferrand, where the treasurer of King Louis XIII, built a garden and a fountain, designed by Jean Androuet du Cerceau. In 1630 another Medici, Marie de' Medici, the widow of Henry IV, built her own monumental fountain in Paris, the Medici Fountain, in the garden of the Palais du Luxembourg. That fountain still exists today, with a long basin of water and statues added in 1866.Luigi Gallo, La pr√©sence italianne au 17e si√®cle, in Paris et ses fontaines de la Renaissance √† nos jours, Collection Paris et son patrimoine, File:Fontaine des Innocents1.jpg|Front and side views of the Fontaine des Innocents in Paris (1546‚Äì1549) in its original form File:Fountain of Diane de Poitiers Chenonceau.JPG|Fountain of Diane de Poitiers in the gardens of the Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau (1556‚Äì1559) File:Palazzo del luxembourg fontana di maria de' medici 02.JPG|The Medici Fountain, Paris (1630) French Baroque fountains The Bassin d'Apollon at Versailles as it appeared in 1714 In 1662, King Louis XIV of France began to build a new kind of garden, the Garden √† la fran√ßaise, or French formal garden, at the Palace of Versailles. In this garden, the fountain played a central role. He used fountains to demonstrate the power of man over nature, and to illustrate the grandeur of his rule. In the Gardens of Versailles, instead of falling naturally into a basin, water was shot into the sky, or formed into the shape of a fan or bouquet. Dancing water was combined with music and fireworks to form a grand spectacle. These fountains were the work of the descendants of Tommaso Francini, the Italian hydraulic engineer who had come to France during the time of Henry IV and built the Medici Fountain and the Fountain of Diana at Fontainebleau. Two fountains were the centerpieces of the Gardens of Versailles, both taken from the myths about Apollo, the sun god, the emblem of Louis XIV, and both symbolizing his power. The Fontaine Latone (1668‚Äì70) designed by Andr√© Le N√¥tre and sculpted byGaspard and Balthazar Marsy, represents the story of how the peasants of Lycia tormented Latona and her children, Diana and Apollo, and were punished by being turned into frogs. This was a reminder of how French peasants had abused Louis's mother, Anne of Austria, during the uprising called the Fronde in the 1650s. When the fountain is turned on, sprays of water pour down on the peasants, who are frenzied as they are transformed into creatures.Allain and Christiany, L'art des jardins en Europe The other centerpiece of the Gardens, at the intersection of the main axes of the Gardens of Versailles, is the Bassin d'Apollon (1668‚Äì71), designed by Charles Le Brun and sculpted by Jean Baptiste Tuby. This statue shows a theme also depicted in the painted decoration in the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles: Apollo in his chariot about to rise from the water, announced by Tritons with seashell trumpets. Historians Mary Anne Conelli and Marilyn Symmes wrote, \\"Designed for dramatic effect and to flatter the king, the fountain is oriented so that the Sun God rises from the west and travels east toward the chateau, in contradiction to nature.\\" Besides these two monumental fountains, the Gardens over the years contained dozens of other fountains, including thirty-nine animal fountains in the labyrinth depicting the fables of Jean de La Fontaine. There were so many fountains at Versailles that it was impossible to have them all running at once; when Louis XIV made his promenades, his fountain-tenders turned on the fountains ahead of him and turned off those behind him. Louis built an enormous pumping station, the Machine de Marly, with fourteen water wheels and 253 pumps to raise the water three hundred feet from the River Seine, and even attempted to divert the River Eure to provide water for his fountains, but the water supply was never enough.Robert W. Berger, The Chateau of Louis XIV, University Park, Pennsylvania. 1985, and Gerald van der Kemp, Versailles, New York, 1978.

The mascaron came from the chateau of the Count of Valbelle, destroyed during the French Revolution. The eighteenth century saw the construction of thirty new fountains in Paris, of which fourteen still survive, and the building of three ch√¢teaux d'eau, water reservoirs located inside large structures.Christophe Morin, Le 18e si√®cle, Les fontaines de pierre, in Paris et ses fontaines, pg. 80. Many of these fountains were the work of Jean Beausire, who, by royal edict, was Contr√¥leur des b√¢timents of the city of Paris between 1692 and 1740. His fountains were usually small, set against a wall, with a niche and a single spout pouring water into a small basin, but they were dignified and elegant, decorated with seashells, mythological figures, and sometimes had imitations of the calcified walls of grottos, imitating natural springs. In the middle of the 18th century Voltaire and other critics began to demand more open squares and more ornamental fountains. In Les Embellisements de Paris, written in 1749, Voltaire wrote, \\"We have only two fountains in good taste, and they should certainly be better placed. All the others are worthy of a village.\\"Cited by P. Lavadan, Histoire de l'urbanism a Paris (1975), 1993, p. 304. Translation by D.R. Siefkin. The government responded to these demands for grander fountains by commissioning the Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons (1739) and by an even grander project for a square with fountains, Place Louis XV, which became the Place de la Concorde.Janine Barrier, Fontaines et embellissements de Paris, in Paris et ses fontaines, pg. 125.

The fountain was originally in the Cistercian convent of Neubourg at Dauendorf. 19th Century Fontaine de la Rotonde, in Aix-en-Provence (1862) The Fontaine Bartholdi in Lyon (1892) was created by the sculptor of the Statue of Liberty. The 19th century was the golden age of the French fountain. At the beginning the century, Napoleon Bonaparte began the construction of a new canal to Paris to supply water for drinking and for fountains, restored dozens of earlier fountains, including the Medici Fountain, and constructed fifteen new fountains, including the Fontaine du Palmier in Place du Chatelet. King Louis-Philippe (1830‚Äì1848) built more monumental fountains, including the Fontaines de la Concorde (1836‚Äì1840) on the Place de la Concorde. The Emperor Louis Napoleon (1851‚Äì1870) rebuilt many older fountains, including the Medici Fountain, and built new ones, including the Fontaine Saint-Michel (1860). Outside of Paris, the major cities of France competed to build the most majestic monumental fountains. In 1862, the city of Aix-en-Provence built the Fontaine de la Rotonde at the crossroads of the major roads coming into the city. It was built on the site of an earlier fountain, from 1697. The central element is a bronze vasque eight meters in diameter. Water flows from the vasque through bronze masquerons down into a stone basin ornamented with bronze children riding on swans. Sculpted dolphins on the base of the vasque shoot outwards to a lower basin, 32 meters in diameter, decorated with twelve bronze lions, and at the top, on a pedestal in the center of the vasque, are three statues of women representing agriculture, justice, and the arts.Plantier, pg. 218 In Marseille, the Palais Longchamp was constructed to mark the end of a new aqueduct which brought clean water from the Durance River to Marseille, ending a long water shortage; the fountain, opened in 1869, was the work of Henri Esp√©randieu, the architect of the major church of Marseille, Notre-Dame-de-la- Garde. The basins of the fountain were placed in the center of a double colonnade, which also housed the city's art museum and museum of natural history. The fountain was an allegorical group of sculptures, representing the Durance bringing well-being the Vine and Wheat, symbols of abundance. The end of the 19th century saw a competition between the major cities of France to construct the most elaborate monumental fountains, composed of groups of allegorical figures. The City of Toulon built a monumental fountain, the Fontaine de la F√©d√©ration, in 1890, to commemorate (a year late) the centennial of the French Revolution. It was the work of two brothers from Toulon, Stanislas Gaudensi Allar, the architect, and Andr√©-Joseph Allar, the sculptor. The fountain represents the person of France, in a boat, holding the torch of civilization in one hand, and the table of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in her other and. At her feet are two figures representing Force and Justice. The boat seems to be riding on a cascade of water from which rise two spouts of water.Plantier, pg. 219 In 1890 the family of a wealthy Marseille merchant, Estrangin, donated another monumental fountain, the Fontaine Estrangin, a group of allegorical statues depicting Marseille seated upon a throne atop the prows of four ships, representing four continents, made by the Toulon sculptor Andr√© Allar.Plantier, pg. 211-214 The city of Nice built monumental fountain in 1891 to honor its native son, Garibaldi, the hero of Italian independence, who was born in Nice in 1807. The fountain features Garibaldi himself, and bronze figures of France and Italy. The city of Bordeaux originally commissioned a monumental fountain for the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution from Fr√©d√©ric Auguste Bartholdi, the sculptor who had made the State of Liberty. The statue was finished in 1889, and displayed at the Exposition Internationale in Paris in that year. Bordeaux decided in the end not to fund it, and the fountain instead was placed in Place des terreaux in Lyon in September 1892. The Fontaine Bartholdi shows France as a woman driving a chariot drawn by four horses, representing the four great rivers of France. The improved technology of cast iron allowed mass production of fountains for the first time ‚Äì the most famous example was the Wallace fountain, which appeared first in Paris, then in other cities around France. In 1872 a British millionaire, temperance advocate and philanthropist, Sir Richard Wallace, who had spent much of his youth in Paris and had lived there during the 1870 war, recognizing the difficulty and cost of finding drinking water in Paris after the 1870 war, and following a program he had already begun in London, donated fifty cast-iron drinking fountains to the city of Paris. The sculptor of the fountains was Charles-Auguste Lebourg, a student of Fran√ßois Rude. He designed two models, one free-standing and the other to be attached to a wall, and in 1881, added a third, simpler version. The fountains were a popular success, and new ones were still being installed until the beginning of the First World War.Elie Frebault, Les fontaines de sir Richard Wallace, l'Illustration, August 17, 1872, pg. 103-105.

File:Fontaine paris.JPG|A cast-iron Wallace fountain, one of dozens installed in French cities by millionaire Sir Richard Wallace to provide an alternative to liquor for the working classes Twentieth century Relatively few new fountains were built in France in the 20th century. Fountains were no longer needed to supply drinking water, and two World Wars interrupted the creation of purely decorative architecture. The fountains of the first half of the century were largely in the classical styles of the previous century. In the second half of the century, fountain designs became as diverse as the styles of modern art, using new materials and new technologies. From 1911 to 1913 the city of Marseille built an exceptional monumental fountain, the Fontaine Contini, donated by the stone merchant Jules Cantini, made by the Toulon sculptor Andre Allar. It was made entirely of white Carrara marble, and was in the form of a group of allegoritical statues, surrounding a column thirty meters high. At the top of the column was an allegorical statue of Marseille, holding a ship in her hand, and passionate figures around the base representing the Rhone River, the Mediterranean, the Torrent and the Spring.Plantier, pg. 213-215. Plantier notes that the torrent and spring were named as the subjects at the time of the opening of the fountain; today the figures are commonly described as the two tributaries of the Rhone River, the Durance and the Gardeon. The Fontaine de l'H√¥tel de Ville, Place de l'H√¥tel de Ville, (1983), Fran√ßois-Xavier Lalanne, sculptor. Cascade, Parc Andr√© Citro√´n, (1992) Only a handful of fountains were built in Paris between 1940 and 1980. The most important ones built during that period were on the edges of the city, on the west, just outside the city limits, at La D√©fense, and to the east at the Bois de Vincennes. Between 1981 and 1995, during the terms of President Fran√ßois Mitterrand and Culture Minister Jack Lang, and of Mitterrand's bitter political rival, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac (Mayor from 1977 until 1995), the city experienced a program of monumental fountain building that exceeded that of Napoleon Bonaparte or Louis Philippe. More than one hundred fountains were built in Paris in the 1980s and 1990s, mostly in the neighborhoods outside the center of Paris, where there had been few fountains before.Andr√© Hoffman, La cr√©ation contemporaine, in Paris et ses fontaines. Pg. 266, The Stravinsky Fountain, the Fountain of the Pyramid of the Louvre, the Buren Fountain and Les Sph√©rades fountain in the Palais Royale, the Fontaine du Parc Andre Citro√´n, and new fountains at Les Halles, the Jardin de Reuilly, and beside the Gare Maine-Montparnasse were all built under President Mitterrand and Mayor Chirac. The Mitterrand-Chirac fountains had no single style or theme. Many of the fountains were designed by famous sculptors or architects, such as Jean Tinguely, I.M. Pei, Claes Oldenburg and Daniel Buren, who had radically different ideas of what a fountain should be. Some of them, like the Pyramide de Louvre fountain, had glistening sheets of water; while in the Buren Fountain in the Palais Royale, the water was invisible, hidden under the pavement of the fountain. Some of the new fountains were designed with the help of noted landscape architects and used natural materials, such as the fountain in the Parc Floral in the Bois de Vincennes by landscape architect Daniel Collin and sculptor Fran√ßois Stahly. Some were solemn, and others were whimsical. Most made little effort to blend with their surroundings - they were designed to attract attention.Andr√© Hoffman, La cr√©ation contemporaine, in Paris et ses fontaines. Pg. 266. File:Fontaine Cantini le torrent √† Marseille.jpg|Fontaine Cantini, Marseille, detail of 'The Torrent\\" (1911) Contemporary French fountains Contemporary French fountains use a wide variety of new materials (plastic, stainless steel, glass) and are often designed to make a statement. Water is always present (otherwise they wouldn't be fountains) but sometimes it plays a minor or supporting role to the sculptural element. Few new fountains have been built in Paris since 2000. The most notable is La Danse de la fontaine emergente, located on Place Augusta-Holmes, rue Paul Klee, in the 13th arrondissement. It was designed by the French-Chinese sculptor Chen Zhen, shortly before his death in 2000, and finished by his widow and collaborator Xu Min in 2008. It shows a dragon, in stainless steel, glass and plastic, emerging and submerging from the pavement of the square. Water under pressure flows through the transparent skin of the dragon.

Facts CNG published the Penrith Observer with a 5500 weekly circulation. The chairman Sir John Burgess (as he later became) also had 10.67% of the shares in CWHNP since 1968. Under the constitution CNG had negotiated special rights which it had bargained for in return for closing down a competing paper, the Cumberland Herald, when it had joined, and for acting as CWHNP‚Äôs advertising agent. It had the right to preferences on unissued shares (article 5) to not be subject to have a transfer of shares to it refused by the directors (article 7) pre emption rights (article 9) and the right to appoint a director if shareholding remained above 10% (article 12). The CWHNP directors wanted to cancel CNG‚Äôs special rights. CNG argued they were class rights that could only be varied with its consent. Judgment Scott J held that the CNG's rights as a shareholder could not be varied without its consent because they were class rights when they were conferred ‚Äòspecial rights on one or more of its members in the capacity of member or shareholder‚Äô. He set out three main categories of \\"special rights\\" that might exist: (1) rights annexed to shares (2) rights for particular people under the constitution, and (3) rights unattached to particular shares but conferring a benefit on a group of members. Strictly they could not fall into the first category of rights ‚Äòannexed to‚Äô particular shares, because CNG‚Äôs special rights came from the constitution. A second classification of right might be like that in Eley v Positive Government Security Life Assurance Co Ltd(1875) 1 Ex D 20 but they were not like that either. A third category involves rights or benefits that, although not attached to any particular shares, were nonetheless conferred on the beneficiary in the capacity of member or shareholder of the company.‚Äô These are in this category. It is like the rights in Bushell v Faith.[1969] 1 All ER 1002 Enforcement of such rights depends simply on the possession of some shares, except article 12 which would appear to require 10% for enforcement. But what did the legislature mean with the phrase ‚Äòrights attached to a class of shares‚Äô? ‚ÄòIt would, in my opinion, be surprising and unsatisfactory if class rights contained in articles were to be at the mercy of a special resolution majority at a general meeting, unless they were rights attached to particular shares.‚Äô So, he said that the phrase ‚Äòwas intended by the legislature to cater for the variation or abrogation of any special rights given by the memorandum or articles of a company to any class of members, that is to say, not only rights falling into the first category I have described, but also rights falling into the third category.‚Äô The court also held that this applied not just to rights, but also to obligations. So in Rayfield v Hands [1960] Ch 1 the obligation of shareholders who were directors to purchase the shares of non-director shareholders on request was enforceable on the same basis as a class right (or class obligation) of the director- shareholders.

J.A.E Corea's father died in 1872 when his youngest son Victor was just one. His wife Henrietta was a widow from the age of 21. Early life The young James Alfred Ernest Corea was educated at the prestigious St Thomas' College, Mt. Lavinia. James Alfred Ernest Corea was a highly respected physician who worked in Chilaw, in Sri Lanka. Dr. J.A.E.Corea was a man of compassion - the Sunday Times of Sri Lanka wrote that he never charged fees from the poor for his medical services. James Alfred Ernest Corea grew up in the west coast town of Chilaw, with his older brother and his three younger siblings, They lived with their mother, who was of the Seneviratne family of Sri Lanka. Education and Medical Practice  J.A.E Corea was educated at Royal College, Colombo along with his older brother Charles Edgar Corea. After leaving Royal College, he participated in a five year course at the Ceylon Medical College and qualified as a doctor. Following this, he entered government service and held his appointments at Elkaduwa and Kandy. Following his marriage to Letita Grace Alice Senevirante in 1897, he resigned, but continued his practice in Chilaw privately.

Corea was elected president of the Ceylon National Congress in 1924. Both brothers were also elected members of the Legislative Council of Ceylon. The Sunday Times newspaper of Sri Lanka writing about the three brothers, noted: 'Of the three boys, the eldest, Charles Edgar Corea, was educated at Royal College and having excelled in studies and cricket, he passed out as a proctor of the Supreme Court, took to politics and in 1924 was elected president of the Ceylon National Congress. Warden Stone of S. Thomas' College described old Royalist C.E. Corea as one of the finest speakers of the English language. The second boy in the family was Dr. Alfred Ernest Corea who was educated at S. Thomas' College. He passed out as a doctor of medicine and chose to practise in Chilaw. He was a clever doctor and what was unique about him was that he charged no fees from the poor for his services. ' Members of Dr.James Alfred Ernest Corea's family stayed in Corea Court in Madampe, Sri Lanka - the estates were given to the Seneviratne Family by the King of Sri Lanka in 1758. Dr.James Alfred Ernest Corea met Mahatma Gandhi in a Corea home called 'Sigiriya,' when he visited Chilaw in 1927 and stayed with the family. The English author, Arnold Wright in 'Twentieth Century Impressions of Ceylon,' published in 1907 wrote: 'Charles Edward has left three sons, the eldest of whom, Charles Edgar, a Proctor, is the unofficial leader of the Chilaw Bar, a member of the Royal Asiatic Society, and Chairman of the Chilaw Association. In 1899, he was elected by the various native associations of Ceylon, and a public meeting in Colombo, to proceed to England as a delegate of the people of Ceylon, to lay before the Imperial Government a representation against the Waste Lands Ordinance. The second son, Alfred Ernest, is a physician, and the youngest, Charles Edward Victor, is an Advocate of the Supreme Court.' Sri Lankan author Kumari Jayawardena, writing about the Coreas noted: 'Unconnected to the liquor trade but making their money on plantation ventures was the Corea Family of Chilaw, an influential goyigama group with a history going back to Portuguese rule when they were warriors to Sinhala kings. During Dutch and British rule, members of the family were officials serving the state in various ways and rewarded with titles. Some members of the family took to the legal and medical professions, most notably the sons of Charles Edward Corea (a solicitor), who were active in local politics and in the Chilaw Association which campaigned against British land policies - especially the Waste Lands Ordinance, and for political reforms. The most active of Corea's sons was C.E.(Charles Edgar) who spoke up for peasant rights and was militant in his stand against the government. He was President of the Ceylon National Congress in 1924. C.E.Corea's brother, Alfred Ernest, was a doctor and the youngest Victor Corea was a lawyer who achieved fame for leading a campaign (and going to jail) in 1922 to protest the Poll Tax on all males; he was the first President of the Ceylon Labour Union led by A.E.Goonesinha and was active in the Ceylon Labour Party. While being professionals and political activists, the Coreas were also important landowners.

Life Vines was born in Bideford, Devon, in 1585, and studied medicine. He came into the employ of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, a leading organizer of the English exploration and settlement of North America. It is possible that Gorges sent him on an exploratory expedition in 1609, but the evidence for this is uncertain. In 1616 Vines went on an expedition whose purpose was to establish a \\"test winter settlement\\" on the coast of Maine. This expedition followed up on the failed Popham Colony (1607-8) and a similar failed expedition by explorer John Smith. Vines successfully spent the winter of 1616-7 in Maine, trading with the local Indians and further exploring its coast. His signature appears as a witness on a document dated 1629 claiming to be a deed for the sale of land by Indians to a group of settlers led by John Wheelwright on the south side of the Piscataqua River in what is now New Hampshire. This document was alleged to be a forgery by 19th century historian James Savage, based in part on evidence that Vines was in England at the time of the sale. In 1630 he was definitely involved in the establishment of settlements around Cape Elizabeth, Maine as part of Gorges' efforts to establish the proprietary Province of Maine. Gorges did not receive a royal charter for the land and a commission as governor until 1639, at which time Gorges appointed his cousin Thomas as deputy governor. Thomas Gorges established the government of the colony, and in 1642 he and Vines led an exploratory expedition into the interior that reached as far as the White Mountains. Gorges returned to England in 1643 to fight in the English Civil War. Government of the colony devolved to a council, which elected Vines deputy governor in 1644. Vines governed until 1645, during which time the colony was involved in conflicting land claims of the Lygonia territory administered by George Cleeve. By 1646 Vines had established himself in Barbados, where he had two plantations, principally growing cotton, and also practiced medicine. Family By 1625 he had married a woman named Joan, with whom he had four children. She outlived him by about 20 years. Monument In 1912, William E. Barry, a well known author, artist, historian, philanthropist, and world traveler from Kennebunk, Maine had a hobby of marking historical sites and erected a monument on the original Richard Vines property as a tribute to Vines. Measuring 49-1/2 by 19-by-34-by-21 feet, Barry had a large granite monument with a bronze tablet placed commemorating Vines' successful stay through his first winter 1616-1617. In 1931, Barry met with the Rebecca Emery Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, and offered to will the Chapter the Vines Monument, and the land where it's located, with a stipulation that the monument never be moved from its original location. The Rebecca Emery Chapter agreed and has been taking care of the monument ever since. The monument stands at 56 Bridge Road at Leighton's Point, Biddeford, Maine.\\"Biddeford Pool - A Founding History\\" - by Margo Alley The monument is on the Maine Registry of Historic Places.

The company had a monopoly over tobacco production. Revenue from the Regie Company was supposed to help overcome the Ottoman state's persistent shortage of income. The Regie Company constituted the largest foreign investment in the Ottoman Empire, and it attempted to introduce more efficient production methods - against local resistance. In 1881, the state monopoly on salt was incorporated into the Regie Company, which passed revenue from salt taxes (tuz resmi) to the Public Debt Commission. As the state (or a parallel state controlled by the government's creditors) now effectively controlled salt production and salt prices, salt smuggling became a problem. In Turkey, the Regie Company was nationalised in 1925 and became Tekel, which was sold to British American Tobacco in 2008. There are successor companies in other Ottoman successor states. To this day, the state-run tobacco monopoly in Lebanon is known as Regie.

The game was released across Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 platforms on May 24, 2011. The Xbox 360 version requires Kinect. The Wii version uses the uDraw GameTablet. Plot Kinect version Before the game starts, Po (who is now the Dragon Warrior and a Kung Fu master) has a short Kung Fu tutorial with the player, teaching the player some basic moves, like punching and kicking. Then the story of the game starts. The story of the game happens after the events of the 2011 movie of the same name. Master Po, the rest of the Furious Five, and the villagers celebrate after defeating Lord Shen. However, remnants of Shen's Wolf and gorillas arrive, create chaos, and capture various villagers. Unknown to Po, the Five and the Villagers, two Komodo dragon mercenaries planned to use Shen's thugs to distract Po and the Five, and with them out of the way, they plan to take over Gongmen City. Shifu holds a meeting with Master Storming Ox and Master Croc. Master Storming Ox says that they can't let the thugs take over the city, so Shifu, Storming Ox and Croc decide to split up and go around the city to stop the thugs. Po, with nothing to do, decides to tag along with Master Storming Ox, too. Po and Storming Ox have to attack and defeat all the Komodo dragons' minions and Shen's thugs at the same time. They track down the thugs to the Undercity, an underground city, and find Komodo dragons lurking there, and realize that the Komodo dragons were behind this, and get to the place where the Komodo dragons are lurking and fight some of them and continue to fight more and more Komodo dragons, before they fight the final boss. Throughout the game, there are other short Kung Fu tutorials with Po. However, these tutorials are different from the first, because in the tutorials, there is usually a minion of Shen or the Komodo dragons for Po to fight to show an example for the player. PlayStation 3 / Wii version The plot of the PlayStation 3 / Wii version is the same as the Kinect version. During the game, all tutorials are excluded. The game skips straight to the start of the story, as the villagers of the Valley of Peace celebrate the defeat of Lord Shen. However, Lord Shen's goons appear and attack the villagers. Unknown to Po and the Five, two Komodo dragons plan to use the goons to distract Po and the Furious Five and take over Gongmen City. Po runs to tell Master Shifu, Master Storming Ox and Master Croc, who are having a meeting. Po accidentally interrupts them, and tells them about the news. Shifu and the two Master already know about the news, and have been discussing about it. Master Storming Ox implies that the goons will ruin the spirits of the villagers, and the three Master agree to split up and drive away the thugs, with Shifu going uptown, Ox going North, and Croc going to the Docks at the South. Po, with nothing to do, decides to go with one of the Masters. Unlike the Kinect version, the player can choose which Master to go with. Gameplay The gameplay styles of Kung Fu Panda 2 differ across game platforms. In the Kinect version, a player's body movements are used to control Po, and the player is able to perform basic kung fu moves, like punches, kicks and blocks. If the player jumps, Po will jump and also double- kick. The player can use these moves to wear out enemies. To finish the enemy, the player can use several kinds of kung fu techniques, such as the flowing form. Because the player can only use body movements to control Po, the player is not able to move around without also moving Po. In the PlayStation 3 version of the game, the player can move Po around, and can use moves similar to the game based on the original film to defeat enemies. Reception Unlike the first game, Kung Fu Panda 2 received generally mixed to negative reviews from critics. Metacritic calculated a score of 50 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 version based on 18 reviews.Kung Fu Panda 2: The Video Game review for Xbox 360 The DS version was received a little better, scoring a rating of 59. The game fared worse with a rating of 31/100 for the PS3 version from 7 critics. On GameSpot, the game received a poorer rating, receiving only 3.5 out of 10 points. The game received a slightly more positive score on IGN, receiving 6.5 out 10 points. However, IGN gave the PlayStation 3 version of the game a low score, giving it only 3.5 points.Kung Fu Panda 2: The Video Game review for PS3 Play also gave the game a 20%.Play magazine review, issue 207, Imagine Publishing References External links  Kung Fu Panda 2 at Internet Movie Database Category:2011 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Beat 'em ups Category:Kung Fu Panda video games Category:Martial arts video games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Wii games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Kinect games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Griptonite Games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games about animals Category:Video games set in China ","title":"Kung Fu Panda 2 (video game)"},{"id":"32518366","text":"Kamrupi Lokgeet is popular form of folk music that expresses thoughts and emotion of the Kamrupi people.Bƒ´rendranƒÅtha Datta (1999), Folkloric Foragings in India's North-East, p.31. p.p.240 The songs are derived from Ancient Kamrup.

Petrou was British Welterweight Champion in 1985. Background Petrou spent much of his childhood in Birkenhead where he became a renowned amateur fighter learning his ring craft with Willaston ABC. Professional boxing career Petrou later moved to Birmingham and turned professional in 1981 with the Lynch brothers (Tommy and Paddy). After losing on his pro debut due to a cut eye, he raced to 15 successive victories. Petrou became Midlands Area Champion after outpointing Lloyd Christie and British Welterweight Champion on 13 April 1985 after defeating Rocky Kelly by TKO at 1:09 of the ninth round in Darlington. He also contested the Commonwealth (British Empire) Championship against Sylvester Mittee and was at one time the Number 1 contender for the European Title, although Petrou was in fact never afforded the opportunity of fighting for the European crown. Petrou's style was that of a pressure fighter who incessantly marched forward and eventually wore down his opponents, hence the label \\"The Greek Tank\\". He was a regular on ITV's The Big Fight Live series hosted by Gary Newbon and was known as a crowd pleaser. The former World Champion and now Sky Sports pundit Jim Watt often said that Petrou breaks the heart of his opponents with his never say die attitude. The war with Rocky Kelly for the famous Lonsdale belt is still remembered today as one of the great British fights of the 1980s. Daniel Herbert, Managing Director of Boxing News, enthused that it was the best fight he had ever been to, with fortunes back and forth until Petrou proved too strong. Boxing Columnist Clive Bernath stated that Petrou's war with Kelly will live with him forever. Earlier in his career, The Greek Tank fought the future undisputed World Champion Lloyd Honeyghan, losing only on points. Petrou took the fight with only 24 hours notice. Petrou lost the British title on 18 September 1985, when he was outpointed by Sylvester Mittee for the British and Commonwealth titles, 116-119 for referee Harry Gibbs. Petrou's last professional bout was an impressive TKO victory over future British champion and World Title challenger Ensley Bingham in 1988. Petrou retired at the end of 1988 when he was on the verge of fighting Kirkland Laing for another British title, with a final record of 30 wins out of 37 fights (12 KOs). Petrou was stopped just once in his career, and that was only due to a cut eye in his first professional fight. Paddy Lynch, who has been in the sport for decades, and was Petrou's manager throughout his career, described Petrou as the third best boxer he ever had in his stable.

This eliminates the need to lift oxidizer to orbit and therefore brings significant cost benefits. A major portion of the total world payload sent into low earth orbit each year is either liquid oxygen or water.  Propulsive Fluid Accumulator (PROFAC) In the period 1956 to 1963, S.T. Demetriades proposed methods of atmospheric gas accumulation by means of a satellite moving in low Earth orbit, at an altitude of around 120 km, or propellant accumulation by stations on the surface of a planet or by gathering and exploiting interstellar matter JBIS, Vol 17, p114, 1959 - 1960; ARS Preprint 2438-62, Part I, 14-16 Mar 1962; Parts II, III and IV not to be found in the open literature; also National Archives ARC Identifier No. 1250057 and 12500581963 McGraw-Hill Yearbook of Science and Technology. In its simplest form, Demetriades' proposed satellite extracts air from the fringes of the atmosphere, compresses and cools it, and extracts liquid oxygen. The remaining nitrogen is, in part, used as propellant for a nuclear-powered magnetohydrodynamic electromagnetic plasma thruster, which maintains the orbit at about 120 km, or a solar powered thruster (and collection system) for altitudes above 150 km (as stated in the original 1959 JBIS article, p119) compensating for atmospheric drag. This system was called ‚ÄúPROFAC‚Äù (PROpulsive Fluid ACcumulator). Several systems were studied, e. g. PROFAC-S for Surface, PROFAC-C for Orbital, PROFAC-A for combination with aerospaceplane making one reusable stage to orbit possible, etc. Several inlets (e. g. conical as in AIEE 10 Aug 1960 San Diego meeting, or funnel) and cryopumps were studied for orbital air collection. The work slowed down in late 1961 although much progress was made in later years on such items as a solar-powered PROFAC. There are, however, safety concerns with placing a nuclear reactor in low Earth orbit.  Propellant harvesting of atmospheric resources in orbit (PHARO)  Demetriades' proposal was further refined by Christopher Jones and others in 2010. In this proposal, multiple collection vehicles accumulate propellant gases at around 120 km altitude, later transferring them to a higher orbit. However, Jones' proposal does require a network of orbital power-beaming satellites, to avoid placing nuclear reactors in orbit.  Harvesting at about 200 kilometers altitude (LOX-LEO)  Klinkman and Wilkes proposed, at the AIAA Space 2007 and Space 2009 conferences, that gases could be harvested at the very edge of the earth's atmosphere by a high vacuum pump. An ion propulsion engine would consume a portion of the harvested gases and would restore the spacecraft's orbital momentum. Klinkman's proposal has a fairly low energy threshold for a small-scale harvesting operation, and air friction is far more forgiving at 200 km than at 100 km. Note that S. T. Demetriades pioneered in space propulsion, from the atomic oxygen ramjet (he proved it not feasible in the 1950s) to nuclear, ion, and plasma thrusters. He received the 2010 AIAA Award for Plasmadynamics and Lasers.  Propellant depots  Boeing has suggested a non-extractive propellant depot, or \\"space gas station,\\" which accumulates material launched from the planet at low cost, allowing future lunar missions without the need for large launch vehicles like the Saturn V. MIT has recently proposed a similar plan which would store emergency fuel reserves left over from lunar missions.

Detroit: Gale, 2004. Gale Biography In Context. Web. July 24, 2011. was an American author. Rosmond sold her first short story to The New Yorker at age seventeen. She published short fiction of her own and with Leonard M. Lake. She worked as an editor at the magazine publisher Street & Smith, editing two of their most famous pulp magazines, Doc Savage (from 1944 to 1948) and The Shadow (from 1946 to 1948). Fellow Street & Smith editor John W. Campbell, the legendary science fiction editor, published Rosmond's sf debut, a story co-written by Lake called \\"Are You Run-Down, Tired-,\\" in the October 1942 issue of Unknown Worlds and included her story \\"One Man's Harp\\" from the August 1943 issue in From Unknown Worlds (1948), an anthology of the best stories from that magazine. In 1944, she married lawyer Henry Stone, brother of Louis Stone of the brokerage firm Haydn Stone, and uncle of director Oliver Stone. They would be married for the rest of her life and they had two children, one of whom is the writer Gene Stone, www.genestone.com, the other is James Stone, founder, CEO and Chairman of The Plymouth Rock Assurance Corporation. Rosmond set her debut novel, The Dewy Dewy Eyes (1946), in the world of pulp magazine publishing, featuring a heroine fresh out of college and an editor-in-chief who plans a new glossy paper publication. Her second novel, A Party for Grown-Ups (1948), was about an affair between a married doctor and a wealthy divorcee. Lucy, or the Delaware Dialogues (1952) was about infighting amongst the suburban Delaware family. She also wrote The Children: A Comedy for Grown-Ups (1956), The Lawyers (1962), Error Hurled (1976), and Monarch (1978). She published the satirical novel Diary of a Candid Lady (1964) under the name Francis M. Arroway. She served as fiction editor of Today's Family (from 1952 to 1953) then worked at Better Living (from 1953 to 1956), and Seventeen (from 1957 to 1975). At Seventeen she was fiction editor and edited a series of anthologies of fiction published in the magazine: Seventeen's Stories (1958), Seventeen from Seventeen (1967), Seventeen Book of Prize Stories (1968), and Today's Stories from Seventeen (1971). With actor Henry Morgan she published a collection of the work of humorist Ring Lardner, Shut Up, He Explained: A Ring Lardner Selection (1962). She also wrote a well-received biography of author and humorist Robert Benchley, whom she had met as a teenager, Robert Benchley: His Life and Good Times (1970). In the 1970s, Rosmond became an important early activist against traditional treatments for breast cancer. In February 1971 she found an olive- sized lump in her breast and was diagnosed with breast cancer. The traditional treatment was a radical mastectomy, which required removal of the entire breast as well as surrounding tissue, muscle, and lymph nodes. Two of her friends had that procedure and reported being unhappy with their choice and the resulting side effects. In response to her refusal to undergo a radical mastectomy, her doctor was condescending and insulting and told her she would be dead within three weeks. Through an article in McCall's by Dr. William A. Nolen she learned about Dr. George Crile, Jr. at the Cleveland Clinic. Crile was a leading advocate in the United States for procedures that removed much less material, a simple mastectomy, which only removes the breast, and a lumpectomy, which removes only a small amount of tissue. Then extremely controversial, these treatments are now standard instead of using a radical mastectomy in all cases. Crile performed a successful lumpectomy on Rosmond and her cancer did not reappear until the late 1990s. She said \\"I think what I did was the highest level of women's liberation. I said 'No' to a group of doctors who told me, 'You must sign this paper, you don't have to know what it's all about. Under the name Rosamond Campion, she began writing about her experiences. Her article in the February 1972 issue of McCall's, \\"The Right to Choose\\", generated more mail than any article in that publication's history. Some 80 percent of the mail was in support of her decision and many of the letters were from women who asked how to contact Dr. Crile, whose name she had withheld at his request. She told her story in a book, The Invisible Worm (1972), which takes its title from the poem \\"The Sick Rose\\" by William Blake. She appeared on a number of television programs, including a 1973 episode of The David Susskind Show where she and Crile debated two surgeons and two breast cancer survivors all opposed to her position. Public activism like Rosamond's caused a drastic transformation in how patients and doctors interacted regarding breast cancer and prompted a growing rejection of more radical procedures in favor of more informed decision making by the patient. Rosmond died in 1997. Her breast cancer never recurred.

Small Teen, Bigger World aired during the summer of 2011, and was part of the 'Extraordinary Me' season on BBC Three. Background Jasmine Emily Burkitt has restricted growth, but despite being only the height of an average nine- year-old, she is fearlessly determined to live a normal teenage life. Although she is only 3 ft 11, Jasmine has never let her size get in her way. From the age of 13, she has cared for her mum, who also has restricted growth. Jasmine stated that a key reason behind taking part in the documentary was for people to treat her as they would any other teenager, as opposed to \\"treating her like a doll and wanting to treat her like a baby\\". Small Teen, Big World As part of BBC Three's Adult Season, 'Small Teen, Big World' aired on 27 July 2010 -- and was a one-hour long documentary detailing the life of Jasmine Burkitt and her family.

Despite this, Tilley was involved in the organisation of The Great Exhibition held in Hyde Park, London in 1851.Victoria Glendinning, Trollope (Hutchinson, London, 1992) passim In 1854 a Commission of Enquiry into the establishment of the Post Office was set up which brought about a number of changes in the London establishment. The Postmaster General of the day, Lord Canning, sent Tilley to Edinburgh and Dublin to revise the establishments there. Tilley is credited with having ensured that the clerks, sorters and postmen received better pay. Tilley had been a great supporter of the Savings Bank Act (1861). This enabled the Post Office to offer savings accounts to less wealthy citizens with more security than banks could offer, resulting in the present-day National Savings and Investments. In 1864, when Sir Rowland Hill vacated the position of Secretary of the Post Office, Tilley was appointed to succeed him. However, this appears to be contradicted by the existence of a letter dated 8 August 1860 which suggests that Tilley had been appointed Secretary earlier.letter dated 8 August 1860 at Post Office Heritage Throughout Tilley's time at the Post Office, his close friendship with his brother-in-law, Anthony Trollope, continued. In 1888, Trollope described Tilley as one of his \\"oldest and dearest friends\\". On 16 April 1880, at the age of 67, Tilley retired from the Post Office. He was described by a colleague, Edmund Yates, in his Recollections and Experiences as a \\"shrewd, caustic and clever man, bred in the Post Office service and knowing it thoroughly; by no means a crocheteer, but with his public office experience, tempered by plenty of worldly knowledge, and as unimpressionable as an oyster\\" Further description of his \\"remarkable\\" personality is given by one of Tilley's oldest official friends, but unidentified by name, who described him as \\"a hard man in official relations, yet genial. He was truthful, courageous and unaffected, generally a sound judge of character, and always ready to admit and correct a mistake. He was clear sighted, just and absolutely fearless, with a strong sense of duty; always wanting to do right.\\" Charitable and public work Sir John Tilley dedication in St Saviour, Pimlico Having retired from the Post Office, Tilley did not retire from public life. For fifteen years he was a member of the Board of Guardians of St George's, Hanover Square, of which he became vice- chairman and later chairman.

It held that money can be ordered to be returned if a sum paid to a director is in substance a reduction of capital, because the amounts cannot seriously be regarded as remuneration. The proper procedure for reduction of capital is now found in Companies Act 2006, sections 641-653. Facts Mr and Mrs Charlesworth started Halt Garage (1964) Ltd. After Mrs Charlesworth became ill, the business declined, from ¬£106,000 turnover in 1967 to voluntary liquidation in 1971. From 1968 to 1971 Mr Charlesworth worked full time and got ¬£3500 as a director, while Mrs Charlesworth did not work due to her illness but was still paid ¬£500 to ¬£1500. The liquidator claimed this represented an illegal reduction of capital. Judgment Oliver J said that creditors are entitled to assume that what is paid as remuneration is so in substance, and not a disguised distribution to shareholders. Here it was a genuine payment of remuneration to Mr Charlesworth. For Mrs Charlesworth, the facts were more problematic. There was nothing as a matter of construction to prevent someone being paid during absences for illness, but although it was irrelevant that she was paid when the company was unprofitable, it appeared that some of the sums could not really be considered remuneration and she would have to restore the excessive sums. Those were not \\"a genuine award of remuneration\\" but rather a \\"disguised gift out of capital\\".

It was decided when the law was that dividends should only be paid out of a company's profits, although the courts deferred to company directors to define their own rules for determining when that was so. Facts The directors of the Exchange Banking Company had presented account reports before shareholder meetings, which were untrue. Between 1873 and 1878 they paid half yearly dividends totalling ¬£3,192 when they knew items in the accounts were bad debts, irrecoverable and consequently there were no distributable profits. The shareholders acted on the reports and declared dividends. The liquidator issued a summons against five former directors. Judgment High Court Bacon VC found that the directors were liable to repay the unlawful dividends. Court of Appeal Lord Jessel MR agreed the directors must repay the money.

They are venerated as saints in the Oriental Orthodox Church. Biography According to their hagiography, Behnam and Sarah were born in the 4th century, and were the children of Sennacherib, King of Assyria, who ruled under the Shahanshah Shapur II of Iran. Whilst hunting with forty slaves, Behnam was separated from his entourage, and was forced to spend the night in the wilderness. He received a dream in which an angel instructed him to seek Saint Matthew the Hermit on Mount Alfaf, as he could heal Behnam's sister Sarah, who was afflicted with leprosy. Behnam met with his entourage the next day, and they searched and discovered the hermit in a cave, where he explained Christianity to the prince. Behnam demanded proof, and Matthew told him to bring Sarah to him to be healed of her leprosy. Behnam and his entourage returned to the city and told his mother of his dream and the saint. His mother allowed Behnam and Sarah to return to the saint in secret, and he healed Sarah of her leprosy, after which Behnam, Sarah, and the forty slaves were baptised. Matthew used water from a spring that appeared after he hit the ground with his staff. The king learned of his children's conversion and threatened to punish them if they did not abandon Christianity. Stalwart in their faith, Behnam, Sarah, and the forty slaves, fled to Mount Alfaf, but were slain by soldiers sent by the king. Sennacherib was afflicted by madness after the death of the martyrs. An angel appeared before Behnam's mother and told her the king would only be cured of his madness if he converted to Christianity and prayed at the site of the martyrs' death. Behnam's mother and Sennacherib followed the angel's instructions, and the king was cured. They were then baptised by Saint Matthew at Assur. At the request of Saint Matthew, Sennacherib constructed a monastery atop Mount Alfaf, that would later become known as the Monastery of Saint Matthew. The king also constructed a monument on the site of the martyrs' death called gubba (\\"pit\\" in Syriac). A wealthy pilgrim called Isaac later visited the site of the martyrs' death in the hope it would exorcise the devil from his servant, and constructed a monastery named as Beth Gubbe near Behnam's tomb upon receiving instructions to do so from the saint in a dream. This became known as the Monastery of Saints Behnam and Sarah. Hagiography The life of the martyrs is recorded in at least twenty Syriac manuscripts. The earliest surviving manuscript is named the History of Mar Behnam and Sarah. The German historian Gernot Wie√üner argued it was composed in Late Antiquity, but it has since been proven by more recent studies that it was written in 1197. It was written by an adherent of the Syriac Orthodox Church, and details of the saints' lives are also recorded in other Syriac manuscripts from the late 12th and early 13th centuries. The hagiography may have been written to establish the pre-Islamic foundation of the Monastery of Saints Behnam and Sarah, and thus prevent confiscation from Muslim rulers. A mention of a church of Saint Behnam at Tripoli in 961 by Bar Hebraeus in his Chronography has been argued to suggest that an oral version of the saints' lives had existed prior to the earliest surviving manuscript. Two homilies () on the martyrs named On the Martyrdom of Behnam and his Companions are known to have been written by Jacob of Serugh. The 15th century author Ignatius Behnam Hadloyo also wrote two poems on Behnam, of which five copies survive. Names and places in the hagiography were derived from pre-existing traditions, as demonstrated by the name Sarah, which is known to be the traditional name given in Syriac hagiographies to the sister of a male martyr, such as the Saints Zayna and Sarah, and was derived from Sarah, wife of Abraham. Also, as a consequence of the Christianisation of Assyria, figures and sites from Assyrian history were integrated into Christian narratives, and thus Assur was mentioned as the place of the king's baptism, and the name Sennacherib used for Behnam and Sarah's father was inspired by the Assyrian king Sennacherib (r. 705-681 BC). The French historian Jean Maurice Fiey noted that the Forty Martyrs of Bartella, the village near the monastery of Saints Behnam and Sarah in Iraq, are also commemorated on 10 December in the Martyrology of Rabban Sliba, composed in the late thirteenth century or early fourteenth century. Sarah is also separately commemorated in some Syriac Orthodox calendars on 22 November. Relics The relics of Behnam and Sarah are kept at the Monastery of Saints Behnam and Sarah in Iraq. Some relics of the saints are also contained in the Monastery of Saint Menas in Cairo. As well as this, the Syriac Orthodox Church of the Forty Martyrs at Mardin in Turkey purports to contain the remains of Saint Behnam.

The Stranger's Child (June 2011) is the fifth novel by Alan Hollinghurst. The book tells the story of a minor poet, Cecil Valance, who is killed in the First World War. In 1913 he visits a Cambridge friend, George Sawle, at the latter's home in Stanmore, Middlesex. While there Valance writes a poem entitled 'Two Acres', about the Sawles' house and addressed, ambiguously, either to George himself or to George's younger sister, Daphne. The poem goes on to become famous and the novel follows the changing reputation of Valance and his poetry in the following decades. The phrase \\"the stranger's child\\" comes from the poem In Memoriam A.H.H. by Alfred, Lord Tennyson: \\"And year by year the landscape grow / Familiar to the stranger's child.\\" In an interview with The Oxonian Review in 2012, Hollinghurst commented of the epigraph that \\"[t]he music of the words is absolutely wonderful, marvellously sad and consoling all at once. It fitted exactly with an idea I wanted to pursue in the book about the unknowability of the future\\". Plot The Stranger's Child consists of five sections, each set in a different period: Two Acres In 1913 Cecil Valance, the 22-year-old heir to a large country estate and a published poet, spends a weekend at Two Acres, the suburban family home of his younger Cambridge University friend, George Sawle. Cecil makes a deep impression on the Sawle family, not least on George's 16-year-old younger sister Daphne, who develops a crush on him. Unbeknownst to the Sawles, Cecil and George are gay and the two of them spend much of their time together engaging in amorous trysts. On his final night at Two Acres, Cecil drunkenly kisses Daphne. On the following morning she discovers that the autograph book she has asked Cecil to sign contains a freshly written five-page poem, which he has entitled 'Two Acres'. Daphne believes that the poem contains secret references to her kiss with Cecil and is surprised when George is churlish in his reaction to it. Revel In 1926 members of the Sawle and Valance families gather over a weekend at Corley Court, the large country house at the centre of the Valance family estate. They are there to discuss the life and legacy of Cecil ‚Äì killed during World War I ‚Äì and to assist a family friend, Sebastian \\"Sebby\\" Stokes, who is planning to write an 'authorized' memoir of the, by now, famous soldier-poet. Daphne has married Cecil's younger brother, Dudley, and is now Lady Valance. The couple have two children and a tense, unhappy marriage. Though Sebby hints that he may have known about the affair between Cecil and George, the latter refuses to say anything of it, as does his mother, Freda, who accidentally became aware of it after uncovering love letters written by Cecil to George which she stole and claimed to have destroyed. Daphne, no longer enchanted by the feelings she once had for Cecil, nevertheless plays along with the fiction that he loved her. After a drunken dinner, Eva Riley, the fashionable designer engaged by Dudley to modernize the Dorley Court interiors, makes a pass at Daphne. The latter, however, prefers to spend the night kissing Revel Ralph, a family friend who ‚Äì as Daphne well knows ‚Äì prefers men. The following morning after many of the guests leave, Daphne's younger son Wilfred discovers that Clara Kalbeck, Freda Sawle's elderly German companion, has died in a fall. He tells his father about it and in the process accidentally uncovers an affair between his father and his nanny, although he is too young to understand it. Steady, Boys, Steady! In 1967, Paul Bryant, a young man in his 20s, has just started work at a bank. Walking his manager, Mr Keeping, home he encounters the matriarch of the family, Mrs Jacobs. Mrs Jacobs is Daphne Sawle, now on her third marriage and 69 years old. Paul is a closeted gay man and at work he encounters Peter Rowe, to whom he is immediately attracted and whom he recognizes as also being gay. Rowe is a young school teacher at Corley Court, which has now been converted into a private prep school for boys. He is also a friend of Corinna Keeping, Daphne's eldest child, who also teaches at the school. Because of their loose connections to the Keeping family both men are invited to Daphne's 70th birthday party where they meet George Sawle and they talk about Cecil Valance. George discusses Sebby's book and intimates that Cecil was gay, suggesting that with the imminent passage of the Sexual Offences Act 1967 this information will become more public. Paul and Peter sneak away from the party to have a sexual encounter and later make plans to meet again using the pretext of Paul visiting Corley Court to see Cecil's tomb which is installed in the chapel there. On their first date at Corley Court Peter finds Paul inexperienced and shy but decides to keep him as a potential boyfriend. He also muses on the idea of writing an updated biography of Cecil Valance, although by now he is considered a minor poet and has been eclipsed in reputation by his younger brother Dudley. Something of a Poet By 1980, Paul, now no longer with Peter, is working on a definitive biography of Cecil, hoping to explore his sexuality. He faces competition from Nigel Dupont, who is writing a book on Cecil's poetry at the same time. Paul reaches out to Dudley, George, and Daphne in an attempt to find out more information for his book. By now the surviving Sawles and Valances are elderly and unwilling to talk. Dudley refuses to collaborate with Paul and George gives a rambling interview in which he implies that Cecil was bisexual and also fathered Daphne's eldest child Corinna. Paul at last secures an interview with Daphne, but she too is unforthcoming and is deliberately evasive about Cecil. The Old Companions At a memorial service for Peter Rowe, who has died at the age of 62, antiquarian Rob Salter meets several of Peter's friends including his civil partner and Paul Bryant, now a semi-famous biographer. He is seated beside Daphne's granddaughter, Jennifer Ralph, descended from her marriage to Revel Ralph. Jennifer openly disapproves of Paul as his first biography England Trembles, on Cecil Valance, made numerous unsubstantiated claims concerning Cecil's life: that Corinna was in fact Cecil's daughter, that Dudley was himself gay, and that Jennifer's real father was the artist Mark Gibbons, a family friend. During the course of his work Rob is shown a series of hand-copied letters recovered from the home of Harry Hewitt, the Sawles' former neighbour and another gay character. The majority of the correspondence is from Hubert Sawle, George and Daphne's older brother, whom Hewitt has tried, unsuccessfully, to woo in the years before Hubert's death in WWI. Another five letters appear to be from Cecil Valance to Hewitt and hint at a sexual affair between the two of them. Rob goes to Harry Hewitt's former home before it is demolished to see if he can find any other evidence but learns that all the papers had been burned in a bonfire the day before.

Key themes In particular The Stranger's Child looks at the gradual evolution of gay culture in Britain and the effects of memory and ageing on individuals and society (for instance literary reputation, architecture and romantic relationships). Critical reception The Stranger's Child was generally received positively by critics, with Hari Kunzru in The Guardian calling it \\"this affecting, erudite novel\\" and Keith Miller in The Daily Telegraph describing it as \\"sleek, seductive and a little sly\\". Nicola Shulman in the Evening Standard said: \\"This subject - of memory and memorial, and the fates of the keepers of the flame - has been done before, and well, as the author acknowledges. But it may never have been done as amusingly\\". Peter Kemp in the Sunday Times said: \\"Masterly in its narrative sweep, richly textured prose and imaginative flair and depth, this novel about an increasingly threadbare literary reputation enormously enhances Hollinghurst's own. With The Stranger‚Äôs Child, an already remarkable talent unfurls into something spectacular\\". Awards and honors *2011 Man Booker Prize, longlist. *2011 Walter Scott Prize, shortlist.

Early life, education and early career Blair was born in Glasgow and spent the first few years of his life there. His father died shortly after his birth, and following the death of his mother, when Blair was eleven, he moved to the United States to live with an aunt. He wanted to return to Scotland, however, and got a part-time job at age fifteen to save up for his fare home. After graduating a year later from West Division High School in Milwaukee he returned to Glasgow to begin work with an insurance company. But he quickly became bored with the job and he moved to Australia at seventeen where he worked as a proof reader on the Sydney Bulletin newspaper, and as a lifeguard at Sydney's South Steyne Beach. Acting career After a year in Australia he returned to his native Glasgow once again, where he worked as a feature writer on the Sunday Post. But following a visit to the cinema to see Burt Lancaster in The Flame and the Arrow he resolved to become an actor. He won a place at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and after graduating from there secured work with the Royal Shakespeare Company. During a 20-year career in acting he appeared in many acclaimed television dramas. Among his television acting credits are roles in The Borderers, the police series The Sweeney and Juliet Bravo, The Brontes of Haworth, Rock Follies, The Saint and the sitcom Citizen Smith. In addition to these roles, he featured in an unbroadcast educational episode of Only Fools and Horses in which he portrays an \\"oil man\\" who cons David Jason's Del Boy with a dodgy deal. His acting career came to an end after an exchange with Steven Spielberg when he went to audition for a part in the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark. He once recalled a difficult journey to the studio followed by a lengthy wait: \\"Eventually a rather small man came into the room. 'I'm Steven Spielberg. Can you come back tomorrow?' he announced, not expecting a negative. 'No, I fucking can't,' I replied in traditional Glasgow fashion. And that was the end of my acting career.\\" Writing career Blair began writing while a stage actor, doing so in his spare time. Initially he wrote plays for theatre and television, but later began to write novels. He started out as a thriller writer, but after being unsuccessful with this genre, switched to writing romantic fiction. Upon submitting the first of these stories, titled Where No Man Cries, to his publishers in 1982, it was suggested the book would sell better if the author was a woman. Consequently, he adopted the pseudonym Emma Blair. Speaking about his change of name, he once joked: \\"The publishers decided on a sex change and so that was that. Emma I became and Emma I stayed.\\" His wife, Jane Blanchard, has said of the Emma Blair nom de plume: \\"Emma was not the quiet, retiring type but a 6ft 3in Glaswegian called Iain Blair who enjoyed a pint and a smoke.\\" When No Man Cries, a story set in Glasgow during the inter war years, features a central character who overcomes social and financial hardships and ultimately finds the woman he loves. The book was an immediate success and generated good sales. Blair followed it with a series of other Emma Blair stories, many of them set in Scotland. Writing of Blair, The Scotsman's Alasdair Steven said: \\"Many of his books were of that genre: strongly romantic but very realistic. Blair had a fine ability to reflect social conditions within the body of his writing while the romantic element provides the main thrust to the story. He was a fine wordsmith and an exceptional story- teller...As he indeed demonstrated in two of his most acclaimed books. Flower of Scotland was about a family of whisky distillers in Perthshire as the First World War is about to break out. The family face many problems and as the war ends, they return to Scotland much changed.\\" During a writing career spanning three decades he wrote some 30 novels, but his true identity remained a secret until 1998 when his novel Flower of Scotland was nominated for the Romantic Novel of the Year Award, something which required him to admit to being the author of the books. He was one of Britain's most popular authors and his books the most borrowed from British libraries. He was forced to give up writing in 2007 after being diagnosed with diabetes. He died as a result of the condition at his home in Torquay, Devon, on 3 July 2011. Personal life Blair was married to the television producer and author Jane Blanchard. The couple lived in Torquay in Devon. Blair is survived by two sons from a previous marriage and a step son.

Jos√© Luis Garci won the Oscar to Best Foreign picture the next year with his next film \\"Volver a Empezar\\" (\\"Begin The Beguine\\"), the first Oscar won by Spanish cinema. The plot was inspired by the novels written by Dashiell Hammett, to whom the film is dedicated. It is a detective film and basically a Spanish film noir. The whole story takes place in Madrid and New York City in December 1980.  Plot  Germ√°n Areta (nicknamed \\"El Piojo\\") is a 43-year-old private detective in Madrid. He previously spent 12 years as a Police Detective and now has his own Private Eye agency solving mostly \\"routine\\" cases like marital infidelities, working absences, minor celebrity-related information and other matters. Along with him works his employee and \\"jack-of-all-trades\\" C√°rdenas, (nicknamed \\"El Moro\\"), a chatty and funny man and former car thief, once arrested and after that freed by Germ√°n while he was in the Police. Moro is German's main connection with the underworld and night life. One day, Francisco Medina, a widower and mysterious man, comes to German's office and asks him to find his daughter, Isabel, who was 17 years old when she ran away two years ago. The only reference he can provide is a former boyfriend she had, Nico, who now works as a radio DJ. Germ√°n comes in contact with him and learns that she became pregnant of him; Nico says he told her that it was fine for him and they could have the baby, but her father opposed and forced her to have an abortion in a London clinic. Just after she recovered from the abortion she run away from home and Nico lost her trail, until half a year later he got word she was in Madrid working in Las Gatitas, a high-end nightclub, as an escort (a barely-legal cover for prostitution). Indirectly it is shown that, in the best cinema-noir line, Germ√°n is a cold-blooded, hard-boiled man, disenchanted of a lonely life and tired of his dirty work and the violent underworld surrounding it, but nevertheless in his spare time, Germ√°n has a blossoming relationship with Carmen, a nurse he met when he was in hospital some time ago. Carmen has a four-year-old daughter, Maite, born from a former relation with a married doctor. Carmen has not overcome completely the end of that relation, but reveals to Germ√°n she likes being with him, but she still needs some time and patience from him. The detective is so fond of the little girl Maite, he often takes her to or from school and plays with her, and evidently his only moments of real happiness are while being with Carmen and Maite. El Moro confirms the nightclub lead was correct, but Isabel Medina is not there anymore. He learns that she left and enrolled in a private VIP escort pool whose head is Mim√≠ de Torres, the \\"Madame\\" of a luxury brothel in the dark but a lady with an impeccable social face up front, and wealthy and powerful customers who have become friends. Germ√°n proceeds to visit Mim√≠ de Torres, but after Germ√°n explains to her the story of Isabel's disappearance and his knowledge of her working for Mim√≠ for some time, Mim√≠ denies everything and dismisses Germ√°n from her house after a brief argument. Not long after, Germ√°n starts receiving pressure from various channels to stop investigating the case of Isabel Medina's disappearance. His former police superior, with whom he still deals now and then as part of his detective job, informally meets him and tells him that \\"someone from a high spot\\" is taking an interest in his investigation, and suggests him to stop it at once since Mim√≠ de Torres has powerful friends in politics, financial areas, etc. Then his former police colleague Alberto \\"El Guapo\\", an impeccably-dressed young man now also working free-lance in the Security private sector for some wealthy clients, meets him and after discussing German's confrontation with Mim√≠ de Torres, offers him to join his security group with an excellent wage, with the unspoken condition that he stops the Medina investigation immediately. Germ√°n refuses his offer at once, but wonders what will come next, now that he has turned down the \\"carrot\\" offered to him. When Germ√°n contacts Francisco Medina to speak with him again, he founds out that he is in an hospital ICU, with a terminal illness he had not revealed to Germ√°n. He is aware he has a short time to live and what he wanted is to see his daughter before dying. Nevertheless, Germ√°n speaks hardly to him for not telling him the whole truth about Isabel. The day after, C√°rdenas tells Germ√°n that he has found a good lead from a friend working in bank computer databases. His friend found that Isabel Medina withdraws money from a certain bank office exactly the 17th of each month, which happens to be the next day. Germ√°n and C√°rdenas wait the next day in the bank until Isabel shows up; Germ√°n talks to her and says her father is willing to see her and he might not have much time left due to his illness. She says that for her her father died time ago and is not interested in seeing him anymore. Germ√°n now has the sad duty to inform Isabel's father (who is in an almost terminal state by now) that she does not want to see him anyway; after Germ√°n leaves the room he commits suicide by disconnecting his vital support machines. Although badly, the case seems over for Germ√°n, until while going to the movies with Carmen the next evening he stops looking at a film publicity still in the hall of the Cine Capitol, one of Madrid's most famous cinemas. It is a reversed copy of the film's main poster, left being right. Suddenly, he realizes the photo from Isabel Madina he had from her father is mirrored too, and that she is left-handed. Consequently, he realizes the woman he met in the bank was not Isabel since she was clearly right-handed, and it was a set-up. Someone of high finance areas are involved in the girl's missing case, and as a warning to the detective, a bomb in his car kills Maite. This leaves Areta heartbroken, but more determine than ever to find the truth of what ever happened to Isabel. Some time later, Germ√°n breaks into Alberto's house and knocks him unconscious. When he wakes up, he is obliged to confess everything he knows about Medina's case as Germ√°n strapped a bomb to his stomach with bandages when he was passed-out. Alberto reveals that the girl died two years ago at the hands of Ziener, an important entrepreneur and financier he works for. Afterwards, Alberto threw the body inside the formwork of an under- construction bridge at the time. Areta travels to New York City in pursue of the responsible for the deaths of Maite and Isabel with the forced collaboration of Alberto. Germ√°n finally kills Ziener in the restroom of an Italian restaurant. In the airport before returning home, Germ√°n calls Alberto, who is waiting in his hotel room as they had planned before, to tell him that he doesn't really have a bomb attached to his body. Furious about the assumed deception, Alberto removes the bandages and the bomb explodes, killing him instantly. Back in Madrid, Germ√°n rekindles his relationship with Carmen.

His passion for camping developed as a child when he crossed the United States with his parents in a wagon train. He was also passionate about sailing, designed his own sailing dinghies, and published Watery Wanderings 'mid Western Lochs. A practical canoe cruise in 1886. In July 1897, at the age of 52, he designed and made a very small, lightweight tent which could be carried on a bicycle, and set off on a three-day cycle-camping tour in south-west Ireland with his son Frank and two friends, all of whom had spent much time together camping and sailing for many years. By December of that year, he had written Cycle and Camp detailing how the four made that pioneering journey and how this kind of holiday could be enjoyed by anyone for little cost.

It is the oldest festival dedicated to Mozart's music in Germany. The Festival is held in the building and the gardens of UNESCO World Heritage W√ºrzburg Residence .  Event The Mozart Festival W√ºrzburg is Germany's oldest Mozart Festival. Like the Salzburg Festival it ranks among the most well-known festivals of classic music in the German-speaking world. Each year between May and June internationally renowned symphony orchestras perform Mozart's masterpieces in more than 60 concerts. It is a mixture of indoor and open-air concerts in the unique atmosphere of W√ºrzburg Residence and its court gardens. Today between 25,000 and 30,000 people from all over the world visit W√ºrzburg to join this musical event.  History The Mozart Festival W√ºrzburg was founded in 1922. The idea of organising a Mozart Festival in W√ºrzburg came up one year earlier after an evening of music at the Grand Emperor‚Äôs hall in the W√ºrzburg Residence. The conductor, Hermann Zilcher, overwhelmed by the ornate stucco and lavish surroundings said \\"I only needed to trace a certain piece of ornamentation with my baton in the air, and that was enough for a union between sound, architecture and colour\\". One year later the W√ºrzburg Mozart Festival was installed. The last regular Mozart Festival was held in 1942. During the Nazi era, especially in the years 1943-1944, the festival was strongly influenced by the propaganda organisation Kraft durch Freude. Parts of the Residence were destroyed by the bombings of W√ºrzburg in 1945, thus the annual festival ceased for the time being. In the following years the Residence was rebuilt and in 1951, encouraged by Bayerischer Rundfunk, the festival could be continued. In 2011 the Mozart Festival W√ºrzburg celebrated its 90th birthday.

It is an Anglican parish church in the deanery of Ripon, the archdeaconry of Richmond, and the Diocese of Leeds. Its benefice is united with those of five local churches. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History The tower and chancel date from the 11th century, the south aisle, arcades and the chancel arch from the 14th century, and the battlements and pinnacles on the tower from the 15th century. In 1874‚Äì75 the north aisle was rebuilt to provide an organ chamber and a vestry, and the east window was altered, the architects being the Lancaster partnership of Paley and Austin. Also during the 19th century the porch was added. Architecture Exterior The older parts of the church are constructed in stone rubble, and the newer parts in dressed sandstone. The porch is timber-framed on stone, and the roofs are in stone flags. The plan of the church consists of a two-bay nave, north and south aisles, a south porch, a north organ chamber, a chancel with a north vestry, and a west tower. The tower is in three stages with an embattled parapet with pinnacles, a saddleback roof, and a weathervane in the form of a cockerel. On the south and west sides of the tower are round-headed windows. The louvred bell openings are in pairs and are round-headed. On the side of the south aisle is a gabled porch, with two two-light square-headed windows to the east of it. The east window of the aisle has three lights, under a lintel consisting of a re-used grave slab carved with a wheelcross. On the south side of the chancel is a round-arched priest's door between pairs of lancet windows. On the side of the north aisle are two three-light square- headed windows and the organ chamber. The vestry has a north three-light window and two lancets on the east side. The east window in the chancel has five lights under a pointed arch. At the west end of the south aisle are fragments of an early sculpture. On the gable at the east end of the nave is a finial consisting of a wheelcross. Interior The tower arch has a round head; the chancel arch is pointed. The arcades have pointed arches carried on octagonal piers. In the south wall of the chancel is a recess for an aumbry, and a damaged piscina. There is another aumbry recess in the wall of the south aisle. One of the pews in the church is carved with a poppyhead and a parrot. Other pews are carved with poppyheads, these dating probably from the 19th century. The two-manual organ was built in 1872 by Brindley and Foster. External features Mausoleum To the southwest of the church is a mausoleum dating from the middle of the 18th century. It was built for Henry Thompson of nearby Kirby Hall who died in 1760. The mausoleum is constructed in sandstone ashlar and has a lead roof. It consists of a rotunda surrounded by a Greek Doric colonnade with a triglyph frieze and cornice; it is surmounted by a drum with a domed roof. It is a Grade II* listed building.

Biography He was the son of Jacques (‚Ä† 1436), Lord of Cr√®vec≈ìur and Thois, Captain of Compi√®gne, Governor of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis and a Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece. Philippe entered the service of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. He was governor of Troyes in 1463 and distinguished himself in 1465 at the Battle of Montlh√©ry.

Facts T. Brady & Sons Ltd and its subsidiaries went through restructuring after the two brothers that owned the majority of shares fell out and wished to divide the company's assets. One part of the process involved paying financial assistance to reduce liability on the company buying some of the shares. The fact that it was financial assistance was accepted, but it was argued that this was not the main purpose, relying on the exception in section 153(2) of the Companies Act 1985 (now the Companies Act 2006 section 678(4) exception). That section provided that: \\"Section 151(2) [of the Companies Act 1985] does not prohibit a company from giving financial assistance if (a) the company‚Äôs principal purpose in giving the assistance is not to reduce or discharge any liability incurred by a person for the purpose of the acquisition of shares in the company or its holding company, or the reduction or discharge of any such liability is but an incidental part of some larger purpose of the company, and (b) the assistance is given in good faith in the interests of the company.\\" Judgment Lord Oliver held the requirement is the assistance is given in good faith and in the best interests of the company, a subjective standard . He rejected that a ‚Äòlarger‚Äô purpose of freeing deadlock would suffice for almost anything, and so on this ground the exemption was not fulfilled.

In 1467 he became Archbishop of Ohrid, a post he held until his death. Life Concerning the early life of Mark our main source is a document of the Senate of Venice dated 26 June 1466, which orders the Venetian government in Crete to prevent Mark and his father in case they tried to seek refuge on the island. From this document scholars, such as Laurent, deduce that in June 1466 Mark was actually Patriarch, that he and his family had previously been in Crete and that they opposed the East-West Union of Churches established in the Council of Florence and supported by the Republic of Venice. Mark became Metropolitan of Adrianople in 1464, and in autumn 1465 (or early 1466) he was elected Patriarch of Constantinople with the support of lay archons such as the Great Chartophylax George Galesiotes and the Grand Ecclesiarch (i.e. Head Sacristan) Manuel (the future Patriarch Maximus III), as well as the secretary of the Sultan Demetrios Kyritzes. On the other hand, it is known that some bishops refused to commemorate him during the Divine Liturgy, as a sign that they did not recognize him as patriarch, probably accusing him of simony. Mark clashed mainly with the faction composed of the nobles of the former Empire of Trebizond who were forced to move to Istanbul (Constantinople) after Trebizond's fall to the Ottomans in 1461. This faction supported its own candidate for the patriarchal throne, the future Patriarch Symeon of Trebizond. Symeon was successful in obtaining the throne, giving 2000 pieces of gold as a present to the Ottoman government, thus beginning a simoniac practice that marked the history of the Patriarchate of Constantinople for the following centuries. According to Laurent however, who places the patriarchate of Mark after the one of Symeon, it was Mark that bought the patriarchal office paying 2000 pieces of gold. Whichever the cause, Mark was deposed in humiliation from the throne, facing lapidation in autumn 1466 or early 1467. However he was soon rehabilitated and appointed by Sultan Mehmed II as Archbishop of Ohrid. The Archbishopric of Ohrid was at the time the semi-autonomous main religious center of the Ottoman Bulgaria. The date of death of Mark is not known. Disputed chronology There is no consensus among scholars concerning the chronology of Mark II's reign. Many scholars, such as Kiminas (2009), Runciman (1985), Grumel (1958) and Bishop Germanos of Sardeis (1933‚Äì8), as well as the official website of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, follow the chronicles of Dorotheos of Monemvasia and place the reign of Mark II before Symeon I, even if with some slightly different suggestions about the precise dates of the reign, however generally in the range from 1465 to 1467. Laurent (1968), followed by Podskalsky (1988), believes that the clashes with Symeon happened when Mark was still Metropolitan of Adrianople, and place Symeon's reign before Mark's. For a comparison of the main proposals, see the List of Patriarchs of Constantinople. Laurent alone suggests a second short patriarchate of Mark after the first reign of Dionysius I at end 1471.

Also known as the EC-3 ter, its name is the Italian word for owl.  Description  The first prototypes were designed by navy technicians Ugo Tiberio, Nello Carrara and Alfeo Brandimarte in the period 1936‚Äì1937. The project was stalled due to budget cuts until 1941, when interest was revived soon after the Italian navy suffered a series of heavy setbacks in night actions against the radar-equipped units of the Royal Navy, especially that of the Battle of Cape Matapan. The first tests were conducted on board the ageing torpedo boat Giacinto Carini in April 1941. The radar sets were produced by the Italian company SAFAR. Only 12 devices had been installed on board Italian warships by 8 September 1943, the day Italy signed an armistice with the Allies. Beginning in the spring of 1943, the recommendation of the Italian high command was to switch the radar on only in proximity of enemy forces, after an incorrect German advisory that the British had radar warning receivers similar to the Metox. The Allies, however, did not develop such technology until 1944. In spite of this, it has been reported that the crews made a wide use of the Gufo as a search radar, omitting to mention it on the ship's logbook to avoid sanctions. The radar was used in combat by the light cruiser Scipione Africano on the night of 17 July 1943, while on passage from La Spezia to Taranto, when she detected a flotilla of four British Elco motor torpedo boats five miles ahead in the strait of Messina. One of the motor boats, MTB 316, was destroyed by the cruiser's guns, and another one was seriously damaged. Twelve British seamen lost their lives.

The Murle people at one time lived in the Thingaita Valley, but were later displaced by the Toposa. The Toposa people now live along both sides of the Singaita and Lokalyen rivers.

Near Kapoeta the river is about 150 yards wide, and normally has a sandy dry bed, but heavy rainstorms in the Didinga Hills can turn it into a raging, impassable flood overnight.

It is located only 8 miles from Chatham, on the Miramichi River. History The lazaretto was established in 1844, on the site of a cholera quarantine station from 1832. 44 lepers were landed in July 19, 1844, the majority being Acadians, from the Tracadie-Neguac area. The island also contained housing for typhus patients, but the lepers objected to this. The arrival of a ship from Ireland with many typhus and smallpox patients forced them to be moved to Middle Island. Dr. Alexander Key, Secretary to the Board of Health for Northumberland and Gloucester, was the official in charge. The buildings were filthy with vermin. Soon the lepers lost faith in Dr. Key's remedies and began escaping. By December 18, there were only 20 left. The board recommended punishment and locking them up. The escaped lepers were hunted down and brought back in handcuffs. The lazaretto was soon surrounded by a spiked palisade 12 ft high. The inmates burned the buildings in October 1845. The quarantine station was reopened after 1847. The remaining inmates were moved to a new lazaretto in Tracadie in 1849. A temporary quarantine station was ordered to be erected on the island in March 1848. Disagreements over the matter meant that the buildings were not moved from Middle Island until April 3. A brawl erupted on the island between representatives of the Board of Health and Justices of the Peace over the matter. As a result, the buildings stayed on the ice until the order was cancelled and the buildings were moved back. Current uses The island is mostly uninhabited, except for an historic lighthouse, known as Sheldrake Island Front Range Light. A leper's cemetery is on the island, containing 15 graves.

The first tropical cyclone and first tropical storm of the 1960 Atlantic hurricane season, this system developed from an area of showers and thunderstorms in the Bay of Campeche on June 22\\\\. Initially a tropical depression, it strengthened and was estimated to have reached tropical storm status on June 23\\\\. Early on the following day, the storm peaked with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Later that day, it made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas, at the same intensity. The storm weakened slowly and moved across the Central United States, before dissipating over Illinois on June 28\\\\. In Texas, the storm dropped up to of precipitation in Port Lavaca. Thus considerable flooding occurred in some areas of south and eastern Texas. Throughout the state, more than 150 houses sustained flood damage in several counties. In addition, numerous major highways were closed, including portions of U.S. Routes 59, 87, 90, and then-185, and Texas State Highways 35 and 71. In Arkansas, a few buildings in Hot Springs were damaged from high winds. Flooding in that state resulted in three deaths from drowning. Light to moderate rainfall was recorded in at least 11 other states, though damage was minimal. The storm was the rainiest tropical cyclone on record in the state of Kentucky, dropping in Dunmor. Overall, 18 fatalities were attributed to the storm and $3.6 million (1960 USD) in damage was reported. Meteorological history In late June 1960, a large mass of deep convection developed in the Gulf of Mexico. A reconnaissance flight into the system on June 22 did not indicate a closed circulation. However, weather stations in Mexico reported a circulation and thus, it is estimated that the first tropical depression of the season developed at 0600 UTC on June 22\\\\. Early on June 23, barometric pressures in from Tampico, Tamaulipas to Brownsville, Texas had significantly decreased, which indicated that the tropical cyclone was moving generally northward. Shortly thereafter, another reconnaissance flight into the depression indicated winds of only 20 mph (30 km/h) and a barometric pressure of . However, the plane may not have flown under the most intense convection. The depression gradually strengthened, and by 0600 UTC on June 23, it reached tropical storm status. Over Texas, airborne radars and the Dow Chemical Company radar in Freeport indicated curved convective banding associated with the storm. Though no wall cloud was reported, the Kelly Air Force Base reported a cloud center. The storm continued to intensify, peaking with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) by 0000 UTC on June 24\\\\. At 0400 UTC that day, the tropical storm made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas. After moving inland, the storm quickly weakened back to a tropical depression. Over the following 24 hours, the depression executed a small cyclonic loop over southern Texas. On June 26, the depression accelerated to the north-northeast, and eventually dissipated over northern Illinois on June 29 at 0000 UTC. Impact Texas Rainfall totals associated with the Unnamed Tropical Storm Some towns in Texas considered it the worst disaster since a hurricane in 1945. In Copano Bay, waves produced by the storm damaged three fishing piers; a shrimp boat also capsized, killing three people. In addition, another ship was beached. However, the tides measured were only above mean water levels. In Rockport, sustained winds reached 40 mph (65 km/h) and gusts were up to 60 mph (95 km/h). Padre Island Park also reported tropical storm force winds, with sustained winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) and gusts reaching 60 mph (95 km/h). Heavy rainfall was reported, peaking at in Port Lavaca. As a result, water was reported in several homes and businesses in Port Lavaca. Two boys drowned in Port Lavaca after being swept by flood waters into the city harbor. Over fell in Bay City. It was reported by the Bay City Tribune that all of Matagorda County was \\"under water\\". Due to large amounts of precipitation, portions of U.S. Routes 59, 87, 90, and then-185, and Texas State Highways 35 and 71. Rainfall totals in the Houston area peaked at more than . At the height of the storm, about one-fourth of the streets in Houston were flooded. Three subdivisions of the city were significantly affected by flooding: Alameda Plaza, Pleasantville, and Sunnyside. Many shingles were blown off the roof of a house, and then water caused the roof to collapse into the dining room and living room. However, no one was injured or killed. Several hundred people were evacuated from places with poor drainage or low-lying areas. Between 150 and 200 houses were affected by flooding and damaged estimates reached $1.5 million in Harris County alone. In addition, three people drowned in the flood waters in Houston. Following the storm, the town of Port Lavaca requested aid from the United States Navy and Fourth United States Army. Later, cots and blankets were sent by helicopters and trucks. Three schools were opened as shelters for flood refugees in Port Lavaca. The Texas Department of State Health Services sent water and sanitation teams to the areas affected by the storm, as well as 3,000 shots of typhoid vaccine. In addition, Calhoun County was declared a disaster area. Overall, the storm caused $3.6 million and 15 fatalities in the state of Texas. Elsewhere Elsewhere along the Gulf Coast of the United States, light to moderate rainfall was reported in the states of Mississippi and Louisiana. In both states, affects were minimal, and rainfall was generally less than . To the north of Texas in the state of Oklahoma, precipitation was also light, peaking at in Kiamichi. The storm brought moderate to heavy rainfall throughout Arkansas. Much of the state reported at least , while precipitation in some areas was more than . The Ouachita River reached flood stage at Arkadelphia. Three children drowned near Redfield after the car they were occupying was swept off U.S. Route 65 and fell into a ditch. Near Hot Springs, high winds damaged a few buildings. In Tennessee, much of the state reported precipitation, though it was generally no more than . Heavy rainfall was reported in Kentucky, peaking at in Dunmor, making it the wettest tropical cyclone in the history of that state. Light precipitation was reported in Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri; none of those states experienced more than of rain. The storm dropped rainfall was far north as Michigan and Wisconsin.

The species was first described scientifically by American mycologist Alexander H. Smith in 1966. Taxonomy Old growth Douglas-firs A number of species of Rhizopogon are morphologically similar and they are collectively known as the R. vinicolor species complex. A phylogenetic investigation of R. vinicolor, R. diabolicus, R. ochraceisporus, R. parvulus and R. versiculosus was published in 2002. It was determined that they separated into two distinct clades, R. vinicolor and R. versiculosus. Characteristics The fruit bodies of R. vinicolor are produced underground. They are in diameter, rounded or irregularly shaped, of a dirty white colour, later red, and with a few rhizomorphs at the base. The peridium is a single layer, becoming wine-red when exposed. The gleba is firm and buff coloured, darkening with age, with small labyrinthine locules. The trama are well-filled with basidiospores. These are elliptical to ovoid, 5‚Äì9 √ó 3‚Äì5 Œºm, do not have a septum and are smooth and hyaline. The mycelial cords are few in number or absent altogether.Rhizopogon vinicolorMycoBank Ecology This species forms a mutualistic relationship with coniferous trees. Although some authorities state that R. vinicolor associates exclusively with the Douglas-fir, others mention it being found in association with the ponderosa pine and other pines and firs. The trees benefit from the saprophytic fungus which makes nutrients available by breakdown of the leaf litter and rotting wood, while the fungus benefits from the trees' photosynthetic mechanisms which produce carbohydrates.Schultz, Stewart T. The Northwest Coast: A Natural History. (1990) Timber Press, Inc. Portland, Oregon. p275-276. The western red-backed vole is one of a number of rodents that feed on the fruit bodies. The spores then pass through the vole's gut and are deposited in faecal pellets throughout its extensive burrows. The spores are still viable and this enables the fungus to spread and form associations with uninfected trees. It has been found that if a forest is clear cut and all the dead wood removed, R. vinicolor and other mycorrhiza stop fruiting, the vole population dies out and any newly planted trees fail to thrive.

This festival is held in May or June, during the ‚ÄúAscension day‚Äù, Christian religious holiday. The festival normally begins on a Thursday and ends the following Saturday night. Every year musicians from countries in Europe and around the world travel to meet and perform. During the festival about 50 bands or 200 musicians perform. Every year the EWOB attracts 500 to 600 visitors.  Format of the festival / Design  During the bluegrass festival there are stage performances that take place in the public room of the building 't Trefpunt. The best bluegrass bands from Europe participate in a battle to win the European bluegrass band award. The musicians from the festival vote to determine who is the winner. The public also vote to determine who gave the best performance. Parallel to the festival, workshops dealing with bluegrass are performed by renowned European and / or American bluegrass musicians. There are also activities and workshops for children of all ages as EWOB strives to be a family oriented bluegrass event as well. Near the location is a campsite which can be used. The camping itself is located on a sports field adjacent to the main bluegrass festival and is equipped with good sanitary facilities, with hot running water for showering and free parking. EWOB supplies its attendees with around the clock first aid volunteers, security and a transportation system to and from the festival.  History  In the year 1995 a group of people throughout Europe, started a network called European Bluegrass Network (EBN). The task of this network was and is to coordinate activities across the Bluegrass State borders. Pretty soon it became clear that a European bluegrass festival was needed. In line with the wishes of EBN in the Netherlands a group of volunteers who then resurrected in 1998 organized the first festival. EBN then developed further so that in 2001 became an association with statutes, a board and paying members. Thus, the European Bluegrass Music Association (EBMA) was born. European World of Bluegrass was organized by members of the board of EBMA and the festival in the Netherlands, EWOB festival was conducted under the umbrella of EBMA up to 2010. In 2011, the EWOB festival in the Netherlands became an independent organization and one of the founders of the EBMA Festival Network (EFN). The mission of EBMA states working together to support bluegrass music and each other across national borders. EBMA also wants to promote and facilitate the sharing of Bluegrass enjoyment across borders (regional or national), support bands, fans, musicians, organizations, professionals and everything connected to Bluegrass. The organization is a non-profit, professionally run, dynamic and inclusive organisation. It aims to get more people in Europe interested and involved in bluegrass and enhance the image of bluegrass music. (source: www.ebma.org) These stated objectives are achieved by holding annual meetings, maintaining a website as the primary means of communication, and creating contacts between European bluegrass people (networks).  Remarks of bluegrassmusic  The bluegrass music is played with acoustic string instruments. The instruments that are used in line with the tradition are banjo, mandoline, guitar, violin, dobro en double bass. Besides these instruments the voice is a key element to make this kind of music.  Bluegrass in the Netherlands  In the Netherlands there is a relative small group approximately 2000 active and/or passive busy with bluegrass music. The EWOB festival in Voorthuizen has the function of being the most important public event in the country. In June of the year 2013 the 16th edition of the festival in a row took place. This festival sets an example for many local 'Picking Parties' organised through the year. In the past 16 years of EWOB Bluegrass festivals in the Netherlands the following countries through bands were represented: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, England, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Norway, Poland, Russia, Scotland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. In the past period of 18 European World of Bluegrass festivals about 300 Bluegrass Bands performed once or more than once. A list of names of Bluegrass Bands can be found HERE.  Bluegrass international  Bluegrass is originally from Northern America. Therefore the main language is English. Among others a few big names in the world of Bluegrass are Bill Monroe, Earl Scruggs, Ralph Stanley, and Lester Flatt. In Europe there is a chain of Bluegrass festivals.

The structure of morphine is not particularly complex, however the electrostatic polarization of adjacent bonded atoms does not alternate uniformly throughout the structure. This \\"dissonant connectivity\\" makes bond formation more difficult and therefore significantly complicates any synthetic strategy that is applied to this family of molecules. The first morphine total synthesis, devised by Marshall D. Gates, Jr. in 1952 remains a widely used example of total synthesis. This synthesis took a total of 31 steps and proceeded in 0.06% overall yield. The hydrocodone synthesis of Kenner C. Rice is one of the most efficient and proceeds in 30% overall yield in 14 steps. At 9 steps, the Barriault route is the shortest to date, but contains a number of low-yielding steps. Several other syntheses were reported, notably by the research groups of Evans, Fuchs, Parker, Overman, Mulzer-Trauner, White, Taber, Trost, Fukuyama, Guillou, Stork, Magnus, Smith, and Barriault.

Since 2011 Lippestad has expanded his law-firm, handling several high-profile cases, as well as speaking at public events. He is also noted for being an outspoken proponent of progressive causes; from 2013 to 2020 he was chairman of the left-wing think tank Agenda.https://snl.no/Geir_Lippestad From 2015 to 2019, he was a member of the Oslo City Council, representing the Labour Party.https://snl.no/Geir_Lippestad  Early life and education  Geir Lippestad was born 7 June 1964 in H√∏nefoss, in the Ringerike district in Buskerud county. His family name originates from Lippestad farm in Tomter in √òstfold. His great grandfather Carl Thorvald Lippestad left the farm and relocated to Oslo at the end of the 19th century. Lippestad's parents, originally from Nordstrand in Oslo had moved to the village of Heradsbygd outside of H√∏nefoss, where his father worked as an engineer. When Lippestad was six years old, the family of five moved back to Nordstrand. After finishing high school he enrolled in the University of Oslo, studying law. He obtained the cand.jur. degree in the autumn of 1990.  Legal career  After graduating and receiving his law degree in 1990, Lippestad was employed at a small law-firm in Harestua, a small rural town outside of Oslo. Later he moved to the Association of Norwegian Insurance Companies, where he worked as a legal counsel. Afterwards he, along with a colleague, started a private law- firm based in Nedre Slottsgate street in down-town Oslo. It was while working here that Lippestad first came to the national spotlight, when he represented Ole Nicolai Kvisler, who was later convicted of participation in the racially motivated murder of Benjamin Hermansen in 2002. Kvisler received a 17-year prison sentence. Three years later, Lippestad left the firm when he was appointed secretary-general at the National Association of the Hearing Impaired (), Lippestad applied to this position due to his daughter Rebekka, who was born with a severe hearing impairment. In 2009 he was one of the contenders for the position of Gender Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud, but lost to Sunniva √òrstavik. He then decided to return to private practice and in 2010 he opened his own law-firm called Advokatkontoret Lippestad AS.  The 22 July trial  In July 2011, he was appointed as defence counsel for Anders Behring Breivik, the perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks, after the latter specifically requested him. His co-lead counsel was Vibeke Hein B√¶ra, and they were assisted by assistant counsels Tord Jordet and Odd Ivar Gr√∏n, both of whom are employed at his law firm. Before the trial Lippestad told the French newspaper Le Monde: \\"I feel I have lost my soul in this case [...] I hope to get it back once it's over ‚Äì and that it will be in the same condition as before.\\" At the trial, Lippestad chose not to argue for the innocence of his client, although Breivik himself had specifically requested to be acquitted due to the legal principle of necessity. In his closing arguments, Lippestad asked only for his client to be found sane and to be sentenced leniently without mentioning the subject of culpability. In a bizarre moment of confusion, the presiding judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen asked Lippestad if he would request an acquittal for his client, to which Lippestad replied that he would not. Breivik then interceded and told Lippestad; \\"You've got to do it!\\" after which Lippestad formally requested an acquittal. Although Lippestad successfully argued before the court that his client was legally sane and competent, Breivik was found guilty and sentenced to the maximum penalty of 21 years in containment. The prosecution had asked for Breivik to be formally acquitted and found legally insane, and sentenced to mandatory psychiatric confinement. This was rejected by the court. After the sentencing of Breivik, Lippestad formally transferred the legal responsibility of his client within the law-firm to Tord Jordet, thereby ceasing to be his official defence attorney.  After Breivik  Following the Breivik case, Lippestad experienced a significant increase in financial revenue. He expanded his law-firm, hired new staff and opened another branch in Skien, which would serve as the main office, in addition to the office in down-town Oslo. In January 2014, the law firm Lippestad signed a contract with the Norwegian Police Federation, the trade union organizing all employees in the police sector in Norway. The agreement included assisting with all types of legal issues that members would have. It also included legal representation in cases where police officers are accused of criminal offences, as well as Lippestad holding lectures and speaking at events organized by the Police Federation.  Activism   Politics  Lippestad is an active member of the Norwegian Labour Party, and has been deputy chair of its Nordstrand local chapter. In April 2013, he was invited as a keynote speaker at the annual Labour party congress. During his speech to the delegates, he spoke about humanity and human values. He sharply criticised the treatment of Roma people in the city of Oslo. In December 2013, Lippestad was appointed chairman of the new left-wing think tank Agenda. The think-tank was established with support from the trade union centre as well as the Labour party and intended as a left-wing counter-weight to the influential liberal think-tank Civita. In 2014 it was revealed that the Labour Party was considering Lippestad as a mayoral candidate for Oslo in the 2015 local elections due to him being a highly respected person who could possibly rival the popular incumbent conservative mayor Fabian Stang. The Labour party had not had a mayor of Oslo in 20 years, and a majority of the Oslo chapter felt that Lippestad possessed the \\"broad appeal\\" necessary to pose serious challenge to mayor Stang. In September 2014 however, Lippestad told the party that he did not want to be nominated. In the 2015 Norwegian local elections he was instead elected as a member of Oslo city council. He also served as Oslo City Commissioner for Trade and Ownership from 2015 to 2017. In 2020, he co-founded a new politcial party named Sentrum (The Centre); as of September 2020 it does not yet have the five thousand signatures needed, to become one of the parties in 2021 parliamentary elections. \\"N√• trenger de 5000 underskrifter for √• kunne stille lister i stortingvalget neste √•r\\"  Other  An outspoken advocate for the rights of people with physical disabilities, especially children, Lippestad was in 2014 awarded the \\"Defender of Human Life\\" award by the Pro-Life organisation Menneskeverd. In its citation, the jury wrote that the Lippestad couple reflects a set of values where respect and an unwavering belief in human life, no matter what situation you are in, is the basis. At the event, Lippestad called for a reduction in the number of abortions. He also spoke out against what he believes is an expectation from society that parents should abort fetuses with genetic disorders. He later echoed his statements in an interview with Dagbladet, claiming that there is a lack of options for mothers who wish to give birth to a child with disability. He also stated that: \\"Many are aborted almost automatically, and that is very sad.\\" In 2013 he was appointed chairman of the Kirkens Familievern Foundation, a charity which aims to promote family values, as well as offer assistance to families or couples. Its activities also includes strengthening the family, marriage, parenting, relationship and singles' position in the church and society. He is chairman of Youth For Understanding in Norway, an organization which promotes international peace and tolerance, by exchange programs.  Personal life  Geir Lippestad is married to registered nurse Signe Lippestad (n√©e Husebye). Combined they have eight children, two of them together. Lippestad has two from his previous marriage, and his wife has four from her previous marriage. The entire family resides in the Nordstrand suburb in southern Oslo. Two of the children were born with disabilities and one of them, 16-year-old Rebekka, was critically ill early in 2012, in the midst of Lippestad's preparations for the Breivik trial. She pulled through the crisis which also coincided with Lippestad's wife giving birth to a baby girl, Mille Madicken. Rebekka died on June 14, 2013.  Controversy  In the aftermath of the 22-July trial, Lippestad caused controversy when he wrote a book about the trial called \\"That which we may stand for\\" (). In the book Lippestad included full conversations which he had between himself and Breivik, which took place within the prison in full confidentiality. The book caused fierce reaction and condemnation from the legal establishment in Norway, some calling the book illegal. Lippestad defended himself and the book by stating that Breivik had absolved him of the attorney-client privilege, as well as given him permission to write the book. Many high-profile attorneys as well as legal scholars were of the opinion that Lippestad had breached the attorney-client privilege as well being disloyal to his client. The leader of the Norwegian Bar Association Berit Reiss-Andersen accused Lippestad of exploiting his role as a defence attorney in order to create \\"another platform for himself in the public sphere\\". Other lawyers called the book \\"social pornography\\" and \\"an obvious breach of ethics\\". The Association of Defence Attorneys () unanimously voted to refer the case to the Bar Association's Main Board for possible sanctions. The board subsequently ordered Lippestad to send a formal reply explaining his case within three weeks, which he did. After formally hearing the case, the Main Board unanimously ruled that Lippestad had not breached legal ethics, thereby avoiding sanctions.

He won races at Royal Ascot and in Dubai. His finest hour came when winning the 2011 Prince Of Wales Stakes, beating Australian superstar So You Think. As a 3-year-old he won the Cocked Hat Stakes at Goodwood and the Great Voltiguer Stakes at York. Rewilding was put down after the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at the Betfair Weekend at Ascot Racecourse on Saturday, 23 July 2011. The horse tripped and broke its leg, throwing jockey Frankie Dettori to the ground. The jockey received no serious injuries in the incident. Background Rewilding was sired by the Irish-bred, German-trained horse Tiger Hill out of Darara. Tiger Hill won three Group One races and finished third in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Since retiring to stud he has sired the winners of over a hundred races including Oriental Tiger (Gerling- Preis), Iota (Preis der Diana) and K√∂nigstiger (Gran Criterium). Darara was a top-class racemare, winning the Prix Vermeille in 1986 and was a half-sister to the Prix du Jockey Club winner and notable sire Darshaan. She has been a highly successful broodmare producing, apart from Rewilding, the Group One winners Dar Re Mi, Darazari (Ranvet Stakes) and River Dancer (Queen Elizabeth II Cup). Rewilding was bred at the Watership Down Stud, near Sydmonton, Berkshire. As a yearling he was sent to the Tattersalls sales where he was bought for 500,000 gns by John Ferguson Bloodstock representing Sheikh Mohammed. Racing career 2009: two-year-old season Rewilding was sent into training with Andr√© Fabre and made his debut at Longchamp in October when he finished a neck second to Handsome Devil in the Prix de Belleville. Three weeks later, he recorded his first win when beating three previous winners in the Prix Coaraze at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse. 2010: three-year-old season Rewilding made his three-year-old debut in the Group Two Prix Noailles at Longchamp. Ridden by Mixime Guyon he stayed on strongly in the straight to finish one and a half lengths second to Planteur, five lengths clear of the rest of the field. After this race Sheikh Mohammed transferred him to the Godolphin Racing team. He was sent to be trained in England by Mahmood Al Zarooni in England to be prepared for The Derby. On his first English start, he was made evens favourite for the Listed Cocked Hat Stakes at Goodwood, a recognised Derby Trial. Frankie Dettori who rode Rewilding in all his starts from this point on, tracked the leaders on Rewilding, before moving the colt to the lead a furlong out. Rewilding went clear and pulled away to win \\"easily\\" by four lengths. At Epsom, Rewilding was made 9/2 second favourite behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained Jan Vermeer. He was slowly away and towards the rear for most of the race, before making steady progress in the straight to finish third, seven and a half lengths behind Workforce. Rewilding was off the course for two and a half months before re-appearing in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York. Dettori held the colt up in the early stages before sending him into the lead a furlong out. Rewilding soon went clear and won impressively by four lengths from Midas Touch. On his final start of the season, Rewilding was made an even-money favourite for the St Leger over one mile six and a half furlongs at Doncaster. As on his previous starts, Rewilding was held up before challenging in the straight. On this occasion, however, he was unable to reach the lead and faded in the closing stages to finish sixth behind Arctic Cosmos. 2011: four-year-old season In the winter of 2010‚Äì2011, Rewilding moved to Dubai with the rest of the Godolphin team. His first target was the Sheema Classic on Dubai World Cup night at Nad Al Sheba. As usual, the race attracted an international field, with runners from Britain, Hong Kong, South Africa, France, Saudi Arabia, Japan and the United States. Rewilding started favourite and won \\"comfortably\\", pulling clear in the closing stages to win by three and three-quarter lengths. On his return to England, Rewilding was sent to Royal Ascot for the Prince of Wales's Stakes in which he was matched against the Australasian champion So You Think. The rest of the field included Planteur, Jan Vermeer, Twice Over and Debussy, but So You Think, who had won both his starts in Ireland in spring was sent off the 4/11 favourite. Ryan Moore sent So You Think into the lead two furlongs out and made a long run for home. As most of his rivals began to struggle, Dettori brought Rewilding up on the outside to challenge. So You Think and Rewilding raced alongside each other throughout the final furlong, with Rewilding pulling ahead in the final strides to win by a neck. On his final start, Rewilding was made 3/1 second favourite for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. Dettori held him up in last place before moving up to challenge in the straight. Two furlongs from the finish, Rewilding veered sharply left and fell heavily. He immediately returned to his feet but had sustained a broken leg and was put down on the course. Assessment In the 2010 World Thoroughbred Rankings Rewilding was assessed at 121, making him the equal twenty-sixth best horse in the world, and the twelfth best three-year-old. At the time of his death, he was rated the third best racehorse in the world and the best in the Intermediate distance division.http://www.horseracingintfed.com/resources/2011Rankings/2011_0630_WTR.asp At the end of the season he was given a rating of 127, placing him fourth in the 2011 World Thoroughbred Rankings.

In 1996, Levis sold the business to a partnership formed by his son Ty along with Dave Forester, Brian Lock, and Carlos Muller. Lock bought out the other three partners in 2003 to become the sole owner. In 2005, Santa Fe Brewing moved its operations to a much larger facility, the former Wolf Canyon Brewery near Interstate 25. This doubled the brewery's capacity from 15 barrels to 30 barrels, and annual production increased from 1,750 barrels in 2004 to 6,000 barrels in 2007. In 2010, Santa Fe Brewing began offering its Freestyle Pilsner and Happy Camper IPA in cans, becoming the first brewery in New Mexico to do so.

History  The \\"upper\\" and \\"lower\\" Drei Annen Hohne stations, in or after 1907 The derelict Drei Annen Hohne \\"lower\\", terminus, station in February 2016. The upper station was built in 1898 by the Nordhausen-Wernigerode Railway Company after the completion of the Harz Railway and initially bore the name Signalfichte, then Signalfichte-Hohne. After a storm blew down the Signalfichte (a prominent \\"signal spruce\\" tree) in October 1901, the names of two hamlets in the vicinity were joined together to make the new station name. For the standard gauge railway line to Elbingerode a separate station was opened on 1 May 1907 south of the Harz Railway station and called the Lower Station (Untere Bahnhof). It was built by the Halberstadt-Blankenburg Railway. The two stations were linked by an underpass for pedestrians. This line was closed on 1 December 1965. The surviving railway embankment is used in places as a cycle path. Until 1947 both stations were in the borough of Elbingerode. Railway line and stations were then exchanged for the forest settlement of B√ºchenberg that belonged to Wernigerode. The Lower Station has fallen into disrepair since the line closure, after having been used for a period as a Mitropa restaurant. In the year the station on the Harz Railway was built, a hotel appeared opposite it to the north, that was called Beckers Hotel until it was sold in 1940. After 1945 it was owned by the Interior Ministry. Since the Wende it has been once more in private hands and is now called the Kr√§uterhof. The name of the station was later transferred to the small settlement of Drei Annen Hohne that is situated around the station.

Their work has been shown at numerous venues around the world including the Centre Pompidou in Paris; Participant, Inc. in New York; Museo Reina Sofia in Spain; and Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin.artists' official website Early life Moskowitz and Trager were both born and raised in New York City. When Moskowitz was 8 years old, he was selected by Spalding Gray from a pool of public school children, to play a part in The Wooster Group‚Äôs Sakonnet Point (1975). He performed in various roles with The Wooster Group until 1982; his relationship with video and performance artist Joan Jonas dates from this period. His parents are the painters Hermine Ford and Robert Moskowitz, and his grandfather was the painter Jack Tworkov. Early work Trager studied painting and drawing at the Art Students League throughout her adolescence. Her first job after studying painting at Antioch College (Yellow Springs, Ohio) was with Telos Press, an academic journal founded in 1968. Its founder and editor Paul Piccone was a friend and mentor until his death in 2003. Trager exhibited painting, sculpture and installation before her collaborative partnership with Moskowitz, which began in 2006. From 2001-2008 Moskowitz produced low-budget syndicated Television for E!, Sony Pictures Television, MTV, and CBS Television. Simultaneously, he made video works, which have been presented at the Centre Pompidou, International Film Festival Rotterdam and 303 Gallery, NY, among other venues. In 2005, Trager appeared in Moskowitz's video, A Bit of Dirt. Collaborative work Erik Moskowitz and Amanda Trager began to work together formally in 2006 when invited to the Montalvo Arts Center in Northern California as part of the Lucas Artists Residency Program, where they conceived their first collaboration, Cloud Cuckoo Land (2008). The work takes its title from a failed utopia in Aristophanes' comedy The Birds and tells the story of a couple that leaves the city for an intentional living community. Using a formal device of ventriloquism, which appears in Moskowitz and Trager's other collaborative work, dialogue is dubbed and sung by a \\"digitally layered 'multi-voice,'\\" in which \\"the artists' voices, mixed occasionally with others are collapsed in a single harmony.\\" The work features both Trager and Moskowitz as fictional characters and, later, as themselves in the process of editing the video. The work also features video artist Joan Jonas in the role of town elder. In 2008, Cloud Cuckoo Land was the recipient of three grants: a Fellowship in Video from the New York Foundation of the Arts (NYFA), a Finishing Funds Award from the Experimental Television Center and a Cuts and Burns Artist Residency from The Outpost. The work has been screened worldwide and was shown as an installation at Momenta Art (Brooklyn) in 2008, 303 gallery (NYC) in 2009, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt (Berlin) in 2010. Their next video, The Story of Elfranko Wessel (2011), also featured the artists in lead roles, this time in their personae as \\"artist-couple\\" and emphasized \\"the home as opposed to a site of production\\". It received a Concordia Career Advancement Award from the Concordia Foundation, a grant issued through New York Foundation for the Arts. In 2010, The Outpost in Brooklyn, NY awarded the artists a Cuts and Burns Artist Residency to complete a component for the planned installation. In its first iteration as a single-channel video, it premiered in 2011 at the International Film Festival of Rotterdam in the Tiger Awards shorts competition. From there it was presented at IndieLisboa where it won Grand Prize for international short. In 2012, the project was given a Finishing Funds Award from The ARTS Council of the Southern Finger Lakes / NYSCA for its most recent iteration as an installation at Studio10, a gallery in Brooklyn. Their most recent project, Two Russians in the Free World (2013-2014), is a narrative about \\"a billionaire who doesn't collect art, and \\"an artist who no longer makes art\\". The work \\"maps the interconnections between artistic inspiration, love, and the marketplace.\\" The narrative also includes Trager and Moskowitz as artists in the process of making the video. The formal device of ventriloquism appears again in this work, suggesting \\"a group subjectivity but also a subjugated puppet body.\\" The question recurs throughout the work: \\"why and for whom do artists create?\\" The work was made with the support of a residency granted to the artists at Headlands Center for the Arts in Northern California in late 2011. In 2014, the project received a Finishing Funds Award from The ARTS Council of the Southern Finger Lakes / NYSCA for its presentation as an installation at Participant Inc, a non-profit gallery on New York's Lower East Side. In 2013, the Centre Pompidou‚Äôs Hors Pistes film festival featured Cloud Cuckoo Land, The Story of Elfranko Wessel, Two Russians in the Free World, and A Bit of Dirt in a retrospective screening.

The General Assembly of Connecticut adopted a design for the official arms of the state on March 24, 1931, which it ordered to be drawn and filed with the Secretary of the State. Description The official blazon of the arms calls for: A shield of rococo design of white field, having in the center three grape vines, supported and bearing fruit. Below the shield shall be a white streamer, cleft at each end, bordered with two fine lines, and upon the streamer shall be in solid letters of medium bold Gothic the motto: \\"QUI TRANSTULIT SUSTINET\\" (He Who Transplanted Still Sustains) While adopted in 1931, the coat of arms had appeared on the state flag since 1887. Motto Qui transtulit sustinet (Latin \\"He who transplanted sustains\\", or \\"[He (i.e.,God)] Who Bore [Us] Across [the Ocean] Sustains [Us]\\" or \\"[He] Who Transplanted Continues to Sustain\\") is the state motto of Connecticut depicted on a blue ribbon below the grapevines. The motto has been re-used for the name of Connecticut‚Äôs SustiNet program to provide health care to state residents. Grapevines The grapevines are said to represent more specifically either early towns or the early individual colonies. Some 19th-century versions of the Connecticut Great Seal show several grapevines. The best answer today is that the grapevines should be taken to represent the three original colonies of Connecticut: (Hartford), Quinnipiac (New-Haven), and Saybrook, though it can also represent the first three settlements of the Connecticut colony proper‚ÄîWindsor, Hartford, and Wethersfield, as New Haven and Saybrook were reluctant additions to Connecticut. Use Coats of arms of similar design, but of differing tinctures, are used in the state, including on that of the Governor.

Van Gogh was shot in the stomach, either by himself or by others, and died two days later. Background Ward in the Hospital in Arles, Vincent van Gogh (1889) Early presentiments of a premature death As early as 1883 Vincent van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo: \\"... as to the time I still have ahead of me for work, I think I may safely presume that my body will hold up for a certain number of years... between 6 and 10, say\\", \\"... I should plan for a period of between 5 and 10 years...\\"Vincent van Gogh, \\"letter to Theo van Gogh, written c. 4-8 August 1883 in The Hague\\", translated by Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, edited by Robert Harrison, letter number 309. Van Gogh authority Ronald de Leeuw interprets this as van Gogh \\"voic[ing] the presentiment that he himself had at most another ten years of life in which to realize his ideals.\\"The Letters of Vincent van Gogh, Penguin Classics, translated by Arnold Pomerans, edited by Ronald de Leeuw, 1997, Deteriorating mental health In 1889, van Gogh experienced a deterioration in his mental health. As a result of incidents in Arles leading to a public petition, he was admitted to a hospital. His condition improved and he was ready to be discharged by March 1889, coinciding with the wedding of his brother Theo to Johanna Bonger. However, at the last moment his resolution failed him and he confided to Fr√©d√©ric Salles, who served as an unofficial chaplain to the hospital's Protestant patients, that he wanted to be confined to an asylum.Naifeh & Smith pp. 711, 713 At Salles' suggestion van Gogh chose an asylum in nearby Saint-R√©my.Reverend Salles, \\"Letter to Theo van Gogh, written 19 April 1889 in Arles\\", translated and edited by Robert HarrisonTheo van Gogh, \\"Letter to Vincent van Gogh, written 2 May 1889 in Arles\\", translated by Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, edited by Robert Harrison, letter number T6. Theo originally resisted this choice, even suggesting that Vincent rejoin Paul Gauguin in Pont Aven, but was eventually won over, agreeing to pay the asylum fees (requesting the cheapest third-class accommodation). Vincent entered the asylum in early May 1889.Vincent van Gogh, \\"Letter to Theo van Gogh, written c. 10-15 May 1889 in Saint-R√©my\\", translated by Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, edited by Robert Harrison, letter number 591.

However at the end of July, following a trip to Arles, he suffered a serious relapse that lasted a month. He made a good recovery, only to suffer another relapse in late December 1889, and early the following January an acute relapse while delivering a portrait of Madame Ginoux to her in Arles.Naifeh & Smith pp. 768-71, 795-8Vincent van Gogh, \\"Letter to Theo van Gogh, written c. 15 March 1890 in Saint-R√©my\\", translated by Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, edited by Robert Harrison, letter number 628.

In May 1890 Vincent was discharged from the asylum (the last painting he produced at the asylum was At Eternity's Gate, an image of desolation and despair),Naifeh & Smith p.820 and after spending a few days with Theo and Jo in Paris, Vincent went to live in Auvers-sur-Oise, a commune north of Paris popular with artists.Naifeh & Smith pp. 821-23 Changing mood at Auvers from May 1890 Shortly before leaving Saint-R√©my, Van Gogh told how he was suffering from his stay in the hospital: \\"The surroundings here are beginning to weigh me down more than I can say...

The shooting Article on Van Gogh's death from L'Echo Pontoisien, 7 August 1890 Adeline Ravoux, the innkeeper's daughter who was only 13 at the time, clearly recalled the incidents of July 1890. In an account written when she was 76, reinforced by her father's repeated reminders, she explains how on 27 July, van Gogh left the inn after breakfast. When he had not returned by dusk, given the artist's regular habits, the family became worried. He finally arrived after nightfall, probably around 9 pm, holding his stomach. Adeline's mother asked whether there was a problem. Van Gogh started to answer with difficulty, \\"No, but I have...\\" as he climbed the stairs up to his room. Her father thought he could hear groans and found van Gogh curled up in bed. When he asked whether he was ill, van Gogh showed him a wound near his heart, explaining \\"I tried to kill myself.\\" During the night, van Gogh admitted he had set out for the wheat field where he had recently been painting. During the afternoon he had shot himself with a revolver and passed out. Revived by the coolness of the evening, he had tried in vain to find the revolver to complete the act.

He then called on van Gogh's friend and physician, Dr Gachet, who dressed the wound but left immediately, considering it a hopeless case. Her father and Hirsching spent the night at van Gogh's bedside. The artist sometimes smoked, sometimes groaned but remained silent almost all night long, dozing off from time to time. The following morning, two gendarmes visited the inn, questioning van Gogh about his attempted suicide. In response, he simply replied: \\"My body is mine and I am free to do what I want with it. Do not accuse anybody, it is I that wished to commit suicide.\\" As soon as the post office opened on Monday morning, Adeline's father sent a telegram to van Gogh's brother, Theo, who arrived by train during the afternoon. Adeline Ravoux explains how the two of them watched over van Gogh who fell into a coma and died at about one o'clock in the morning. (The death certificate records the time of death as 1.30 am.) In a letter to his sister Lies, Theo told of his brother's feelings just before his death: \\"He himself wanted to die.

Van Gogh's body was set out in \\"the painter's room\\" where it was surrounded by the \\"halo\\" of his last canvases and masses of yellow flowers including dahlias and sunflowers. His easel, folding stool and brushes stood before the coffin. Among those who arrived in the room were artists Lucien Pissarro and Auguste Lauzet. The coffin was carried to the hearse at three o'clock. The company climbed the hill outside Auvers in hot sunshine, Theo and several of the others sobbing pitifully. The little cemetery with new tombstones was on a little hill above fields that were ripe for harvest. Dr Gachet, trying to suppress his tears, stammered out a few words of praise, expressing his admiration for an \\"honest man and a great artist... who had only two aims, art and humanity.\\" Controversy of Naifeh and Smith biography In 2011, authors Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith published a biography, Van Gogh: The Life, in which they challenged the conventional account of the artist's death. In the book, Naifeh and Smith argue that it was unlikely for van Gogh to have killed himself, noting the upbeat disposition of the paintings he created immediately preceding his death; furthermore, in private correspondence, van Gogh described suicide as sinful and immoral. The authors also question how van Gogh could have traveled the mile-long (about 2 km) distance between the wheat field and the inn after sustaining the fatal stomach wound, how van Gogh could have possibly obtained a gun despite his well-known mental health problems, and why van Gogh's painting gear was never found by the police.Boehm, Mike (13 October 2011). New book, '60 Minutes' question if Van Gogh really killed himself. Los Angeles Times, 13 October 2011. Retrieved from http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/10/vincent-van- gogh-60-minutes.html. Naifeh and Smith developed an alternative hypothesis in which van Gogh did not commit suicide, but rather was a possible victim of accidental manslaughter or foul play.New revelations on Vincent van Gogh's death, CBSNews.com, 13 October 2011 Naifeh and Smith point out that the bullet entered van Gogh's abdomen at an oblique angle, not straight as might be expected from a suicide. They claim that van Gogh was acquainted with the boys who may have shot him, one of whom was in the habit of wearing a cowboy suit, and had gone drinking with them. Naifeh said: \\"So you have a couple of teenagers who have a malfunctioning gun, you have a boy who likes to play cowboy, you have three people probably all of whom had too much to drink.\\" Naifeh concluded that \\"accidental homicide\\" was \\"far more likely\\". The authors contend that art historian John Rewald visited Auvers in the 1930s, and recorded the version of events that is widely believed. The authors postulate that after he was fatally wounded, van Gogh welcomed death and believed the boys had done him a favour, hence his widely quoted deathbed remark: \\"Do not accuse anyone... it is I who wanted to kill myself.\\" On 16 October 2011, an episode of the TV news magazine 60 Minutes aired a report exploring the contention of Naifeh and Smith's biography. Some credence has been given to the theory by van Gogh experts, who cite an interview with French businessman Ren√© Secr√©tan recorded in 1956, in which he admitted to tormenting‚Äîbut not actually shooting‚Äîthe artist. Nonetheless, this new biographical account has been greeted with some skepticism. Skeptic Joe Nickell also was not convinced and offered alternative explanations. In the July 2013 issue of the Burlington Magazine, two of the research specialists from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, Louis van Tilborgh and Teio Meedendorp, present a theory that at the time of his death, van Gogh was in a troubled state, both personally (mentally and physically) and with his relations with his brother, Theo, and a likely candidate for suicide. They also present alternative explanations to the theories presented by Naifeh and Smith.Did Vincent van Gogh commit suicide or was Dutch painter killed by an acquaintance? . . Nick Clark, The Independent, 9 August 2013. In 2014, at Smith and Naifeh's request, handgun expert Dr. Vincent Di Maio reviewed the forensic evidence surrounding Van Gogh's shooting. Di Maio noted that to shoot himself in the left abdomen Van Gogh would have had to have held the gun at a very awkward angle, and that there would have been black powder burns on his hands and tattooing and other marks on the skin around the wound, none of which is noted in the contemporary report. Dr Di Maio gave his conclusion that > \\"It is my opinion that, in all medical probability, the wound incurred by > Van Gogh was not self-inflicted. In other words, he did not shoot himself.\\" and to which Nickell responded, unconvinced.Joe Nickell : Van Gogh ‚ÄúMurdered‚Äù‚ÄîAgain. Center for Inquiry, Nov 25, 2014. The 2017 film Loving Vincent drew heavily on Smith and Naifeh's theory; it is also the account presented in the 2018 film At Eternity's Gate. Selection of van Gogh's final works Van Gogh was particularly productive during his last few weeks in Auvers, completing over 70 paintings as well as a number of drawings and sketches. They cover landscapes, portraits and still lifes. Some of them appear to reflect his increasing loneliness while many others, with their bright colours, convey a more positive attitude. The letters he wrote during his last two months offer a considerable amount of background on van Gogh's relentless will to paint coupled with frequent periods of despondency.

It was released on December 15, 2011 in Japan and Europe on June 13, 2014 and released on July 18, 2015 in Australia and New Zealand. There are two versions of the game, Shine and Dark, which was released in Europe as Light and Shadow. An Inazuma Eleven GO anime and manga based on the game began serialization in CoroCoro Comic, while an anime based on the game produced by OLM started airing on May 14, 2011. The game takes place in a world where an organization called Fifth Sector rules over the world of soccer and manipulates matches as an authoritarian dictatorship based on broad-communistic values of distributing soccer and the joy of victory equally among everyone. Tenma Matsukaze (Arion Sherwind in the English dub), and his soccer club, Raimon Jr. High, attempt to lead a revolution against Fifth Sector, by going against Fifth Sector's laws and winning the Holy Road soccer tournament. Level-5 later announced a sequel to this game entitled . The sequel stars Tenma, the protagonist of GO, and revolves around time travel.  Gameplay  The gameplay is the same previous entries. The core gameplay involves a role-playing adventure in which the player controls Matsukaze Tenma to explore the map, recruit new players, advance the story, and engage in soccer battles. Likewise, soccer Matches and soccer battles are controlled using the touch screen, and play in the same way as all prior games. New to GO are \\"avatars\\" (fighting spirits in the dub). Avatars are mythical beings which players can summon during soccer matches/battles. A player's avatar gives them an offensive and defensive advantage, and often allow the summoner to perform unique hissatsu techniques which involve their avatar. Plot 10 years after the FFI, an unnoticed darkness lurks behind the country; Japan and what used to be soccer has changed over the decade. Because of the victory of Inazuma Japan, soccer has become greatly popular and influential in the country, to the point that a school's worth is directly proportional to the skill of their soccer team. The weak schools are forgotten and forced to close down due to lack of public interest and applicants. Soccer in Japan is now controlled by an organization called Fifth Sector and is led by the one known as the \\"Holy Emperor\\" Ishido Shuuji. Soccer in its current state is controlled and relies on the commands of the Holy Emperor on whether a team wins or loses based on set scores. This saved schools all over the nation from closing down by balancing tournaments‚Äîbut a price had to be paid: \\"real soccer\\" didn't exist. The protagonist, Matsukaze Tenma, tries out for the Raimon soccer team and passes. But he soon realizes that soccer is not how he imagined it to be. Tenma stirs a revolutionary wind among with the members of the Raimon team, and they soon aim to free soccer from Fifth Sector so that middle school students all over Japan can finally play without Fifth Sector's orders. And the Raimon team is not alone; they discover the Resistance that aims to replace the Holy Emperor, and are also assisted by the previous main characters of the series. With every match they win in the Holy Road, Raimon wins over more schools to their cause.

The magazine was published by the NVA‚Äôs Deutschen Milit√§rverlag which later became the Milit√§rverlag der DDR. The magazine was headquartered in East Berlin.  Readership  This approximately 80 to 100-page color magazine had an initial print run in 1956 of 11,000 copies. In later years up to 340,000 copies were published with a readership of 1.5 million. Only 5-6% of the readership were military personnel.  Background  The Armeerundschau was popular among soldiers, despite the relatively high price of one Mark. This popularity was primarily because of the clothed pin-ups of women in each issue. The magazine was renamed in 1990, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, with the subtitle \\"The International Military Magazine\\". The last issue appeared in July 1990, just three months before the reunification of Germany on 3 October. Up to 1962 it was in European size A4, after 1962 in A5 size. Colonel Karl-Heinz Freitag was the longest serving chief editor of Armeerundschau until he was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Harald M√ºhle in early 1990.  Purpose  Armeerundschau sought to represent the Army in an everyday, entertaining way, and was aimed at young people and women soldiers. It was the magazine equivalent of the more politically oriented military weekly newspaper Volksarmee (English: People‚Äôs Army) published by the Ministry of National Defense. In his book, Fallen Elites; The Military Other in Post-Unification Germany, Andrew Bickford indicates that the purpose of Armeerundschau was to promote the virtue and glory of the military, the ruling political regime and the nation as a whole. It also was designed to idealize the view of socialist military families and relationships linking the defense of the state to the defense of these families. Bickford‚Äôs quote from the chief editor of the magazine, Karl-Heinz Freitag, sums up this purpose: :‚ÄúYes, AR was a military magazine, with a lot of coverage of military technology, history, and what not. But the real purpose of the magazine, from my point of view ‚Äì and I was the chief editor for a very long time ‚Äì was to prepare boys and men for their military service in the NVA, and to prepare women and girls to be good wives and girlfriends, to teach them to love soldiers and be willing to wait for them. We knew we had to convince women to love soldiers. If we didn‚Äôt, men wouldn‚Äôt want to go into the NVA.‚Äù References * Eifler, Christine : ‚Äû... es sch√ºtzt Dich mein Gewehr.‚Äú Frauenbilder in der NVA-Propaganda. In: Unter Hammer und Zirkel.

Filming for the season began on July 25, 2011. Jim Rash, who portrays Dean Pelton, was promoted to a series regular after having a recurring role throughout the first two seasons. Michael K. Williams was cast as the study group's new biology professor, who is described as a deeply intense character.

The character of Star-Burns is killed off in episode 17 of the season, as portrayer of the character Dino Stamatopoulos simply asked for it to happen. Stamatopoulos also serves as a consulting producer and writer for the series, so he wanted to focus on his main job, as he explained \\"I'm not an actor\\". Series creator Dan Harmon explained Star-Burns' death is \\"not just thrown away\\", but \\"triggers the rest of the entire season. Filming of the season concluded in mid-February 2012. Dan Harmon planned on making the third season more cohesive than the previous, with more connectivity between the storylines of the episodes, as well as to make the show more grounded, with somewhat fewer themed episodes. Harmon also planned out the characters' storylines for the entire season. Explaining the theme of the third season, and Jeff's journey for the season, Harmon says, \\"Season 3 is about the price that you pay when you figure out that you love a group of people. That's it in a nutshell. It's about the high cost of valuing people other than yourself, and that's the path that Jeff has been on. The third chapter for him is going to be the toughest of all. When you love people, their pain is your pain. Nobody likes having to deal with hassles more than Jeff Winger, and nobody's going to have to deal with more this year.\\" On November 14, 2011, NBC announced that they were removing Community from their mid-season schedule to make room for 30 Rock, which returned to Thursday nights.

It is located in the municipality of Gennep, Limburg. In 2011 the population reached just over 800. The town has a typical linear geography with most of its residences situated along its two main roads; the Kleefseweg and the Vensestraat. In the southwest, Ven-Zelderheide is bordered by the town Ottersum, and in northeast it is bordered by Germany. A windmill (Gristmill) called; Rest after Labor (Dutch: Rust na Arbeid) is situated at the Kleefseweg. Ven Zelderheide, windmill named: \\"Rust na Arbeid\\" History Early writings on Zelder date from the end of the 14th century. In this time Zelder was part of Guelders and was managed by Johan Kodken van Zeller who lived in Haus Driesberg in a neighboring town called Kessel.  Name  The town comprised three areas, which have influenced the town‚Äôs current name.Kaart Ottersum, Gemeente Atlas van Nederland, Hugo Suringar, Leeuwarden, 1868 The first part, ‚ÄúVen‚Äù originates from the Dutch word ‚Äúveen‚Äù which means peat, referring to the original vegetation in the northern part before it was cultivated and turned into arable land. The second part, ‚ÄúZelderheide‚Äù means: moorland of Zelder, referring to the former central situated moorland. Historically, the town consisted of three areas: an area of peat, an area with moorland and an area called Zelder, the latter is situated in the south. Locally the town is referred to as ‚ÄúHet Ven‚Äù.  Legend  According to a local legend, somewhere in the 15th century, the Dutchess of Cleves made a visit to Lord van Zeller. The road in Ven-Zelderheide on the way back to her castle in Cleves was so bad that the axle of her carriage broke and the carriage got stuck in the mud. The two coachmen quickly scanned the area in the incoming darkness but there were no people around. The Dutchess shouted for help but no one came. She then desperately prayed to Anthony the Great and then, all of a sudden, men started rushing in to help. To show her gratitude to the people of Ven-Zelderheide, she had a chapel built, devoted to Anthony the Great. The chapel can be seen in the Vensestraat.  The Zelder estate  Zelder, Chapel on a mound, Anno 1600 The southern part of Ven-Zelderheide is considered an estate named Zelder. It is largely surrounded by the river Niers.

In 2005, McIntyre founded his dance company, Trey McIntyre Project (TMP), which first appeared at the Vail International Dance Festival. The company was initially a summer touring company, but its national and international success led McIntyre to establish the company year-round as of 2008, based in Boise, Idaho. TMP has been featured in The New York Times, Dance Magazine, and on PBS NewsHour, and has earned coast-to-coast acclaim from the likes of the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, The Boston Globe, People Magazine, and elsewhere. In 2013, Trey McIntyre Project expanded its artistic vision and announced a crowdsourced documentary film entitled Ma Maison. The project was announced on Kickstarter on August 7, 2013, and in November 2013, McIntyre went to New Orleans to begin filming. On January 16, 2014, it was announced that McIntyre would move the Trey McIntyre Project towards new artistic ventures, reducing his efforts in dance. The company revealed a press release\\"Trey McIntyre Project Announces New Direction for Year 10\\", TMP. explaining that McIntyre, after contributing heavily to the dance world, is interested in exploring other art forms, specifically film and the visual arts. He will continue to create pieces on a freelance basis but the dance aspect of Trey McIntyre Project is downsizing as he makes room for other artistic projects. McIntyre is the recipient of numerous awards, including a Choo San Goh Award for Choreography, an Achievement Award from North Carolina School of the Arts, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Society of Arts and Letters, as well as two grants for choreography from the National Endowment for the Arts. His works have been performed by companies including Stuttgart Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Queensland Ballet, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, New York City Ballet, The Washington Ballet, Smuin Ballet, Oregon Ballet Theatre, and San Francisco Ballet.

As many soldiers left the army, including those from Ipswich, Hodgkins reenlisted along with Wade. Hodgkins was immediately promoted to captain and given his own company. Meanwhile, his friend Wade was eventually promoted to lieutenant colonel and made aide-de-camp to General George Washington, and was placed in command of West Point, New York after the treason of General Benedict Arnold.http://suvcw.org/in/wwdudley.htm Hodgkins would go on to lead his company in the Battles of Saratoga and would be one of the junior officers that would help oversee the surrender of General John Burgoyne's army.

Life The son of organ builder, piano tuner and music teacher Franz Jacob Brambach, he was born in Oberdollendorf, a village across the river Rhine from Bonn. Brambach's mother, born L√ºckerath, was the daughter of a free-roving puppet master builder.Fellerer, Karl Gustav (1960), Rheinische Musiker, p. 17, A. Volk, . His brother was German musicologist Wilhelm Brambach. The young Caspar Joseph spent his first years in his native village, where he received his first music lessons from his father, which continued after he passed in Bonn elementary and high school and at the Conservatory of Music, Cologne. After that, Brambach followed his musical career as first violinist of the Bonn Opera House (1847‚Äì1850) and studied at the Cologne Conservatory (1851‚Äì1854),Champlin, John Denison & Apthorp, William Foster: Cyclopedia of Music and Musicians: Abaco-Dyne (C. Scribner's sons, 2008), p. 225; . which promoted young composers and where he received awards for a string quartet and various songs for the Mozart scholarship at Frankfurt Liederkranz.Hubbard, W. L. (2005), The American History and Encyclopedia of Music: Musical Biographies Part One, p. 97, Kessinger Publishing, . Later he studied there as a private pupil of Ferdinand Hiller and Carl Reinecke before he himself became a teacher in 1858. In 1861 he was appointed municipal music director in Bonn, where he led performances of oratorios by Bach, Haydn, Handel and other composers. He retired from this position in 1869 to devote himself entirely to his compositions and the musical life in Bonn.The same year Brambach married Magdalena Gohr. From 1862 to 1877 he conducted the men's choir \\"Concordia\\" and from 1861 to 1869 the Municipal Choral Society, now known as the Bonn Philharmonic Choir. Death On 20 June 1902 Brambach died in his home in Bonn. His funeral was accompanied by singers from all over Germany. With great sympathy of the German minstrelsy, two years after his death a memorial designed by the architect Karl Senff was built on his grave at the cemetery in Bonn-Poppelsdorf. The relief on his donated, well elaborate tomb is signed by the Bad Honnef sculptor Charles Menser (1872‚Äì1929) and bears the inscription \\"Dedicated to German singers\\".Even 25 years after his death, Brambach was honoured by an American delegation headed by Mark P. Campbell on behalf of the \\"Music Industries Chamber of Commerce\\" at the Beethoven Festival in Bonn in 1927. It is now a grave of honour, located under the Cross Mountain Church. In the obituaries of his time,General Gazette, 21 June 1902, no. 4428. the importance of Caspar Joseph Brambach as a musician and his work in the city of Bonn was highlighted. It was also added that he was one of the kindest and most unselfish people, whom no one will forget. Music Brambach's grave stone inside Bonn's Poppelsdorf cemetery From 1861 until his death Brambach was lauded as a performing musician always acclaimed by the masses, devoting himself entirely to work and the private training of young musicians. One of his most important pupils was Max von Schillings who, for some time during his highschool years, was taught by him.Schillings was taught by Brambach from 1879 on. Friedrich Nietzsche was asked by Brambach for advice someday whether he should become a musician or a scholar. Brambach, whose works are almost forgotten today, was known primarily as a composer of works for male choir, besides writing numerous songs, among which the melody of the Bergisches Heimatlied resembles his best-known song.The Bergisch home song is the anthem of the Bergisches Land. The text was by Rudolf Hartkopf (1859‚Äì1944). Brambach's choral compositions were widely performed at festivals of the time (Leipzig, Munich, Vienna, etc.), sometimes even in the presence of the Prussian imperial family. Brambach musical style corresponds to the post- Mendelssohn era, with a very cantabile mood, which stands out from the majority of his contemporaries. Many admirers among musicians, conductors, the general public, and no less a figure than Hans von B√ºlow (1830‚Äì1894) himself, spoke highly not only of his most recognised work, but also of his piano concerto op. 39. Works Brambach's best works are his cantatas The Eleusinian Festival, A Hymn to Spring, The Power of Prometheus, Lorelei and the choral work Columbus, which acquired recognition in the U.S. where he was awarded a prize. He also wrote the opera Ariadne and several minor pieces, which were very popular in his time. His best instrumental works date from the last third of the 19th century. Among them are: *Sextet in C minor op. 5 (for 2 violins, 2 violas, cello and piano) *Piano Quartet in E-flat major op. 14 *Piano Quartet in A minor op. 43 *Violin Sonata in D minor op. 55 *Violin Sonata in A minor op. 74 *Piano Quartet in G minor op. 110 Notes and references ;Notes ;References *Josef Niesen: Bonner Personenlexikon, 2nd edition (Bonn: Bouvier Verlag, 2008).

The narrator and \\"you\\" see human life as an absurd collection of meaningless events, but \\"your\\" suicide gives previously meaningless actions meaning. \\"Your\\" suicide organizes \\"your\\" life into a coherent narrative. The narrator claims that \\"your\\" suicide has actually become the beginning of \\"your\\" life story. The book, fittingly, begins by recounting \\"your\\" suicide., Mentions Lev√©'s idea that suicide creates a coherent narrative for a life. Lev√©'s suicide Much of the analysis and interpretation of Suicide hinges on the fact that ten days after giving the text to his publisher, Lev√© hanged himself. The book has been interpreted as autobiographical. It has also been viewed as an internal dialogue between the two sides of Lev√© (\\"you\\" and \\"I\\")., Interprets the text as an internal dialogue between \\"you\\" and \\"I\\". Throughout the work, Lev√© ensures \\"your\\" motivations for committing suicide are unknown to the narrator and, consequently, the reader. In the book, \\"you\\" leave open a comic book to a two-page spread as an explanation of \\"your\\" suicide. But, when \\"your wife\\" sees \\"you\\" dead, she knocks over the comic book. Nobody knows which page \\"you\\" thought explained \\"your\\" suicide. Contrastingly, Lev√© is said to have left a suicide note.

Born in November 1945 in Cadgwith, Cornwall, he lived from a young age on the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall, an area with which he is still closely associated. His father was the artist and ventriloquist Francis Coudrill. In 2011 he founded the Lizard Stuckists.\\"Stuckist groups\\", stuckism.com. Retrieved 30 November 2011. Career With notable contributions in a number of fields, Jonathon Coudrille can be described as a polymath. Broadcasting After attending the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe from 1957 to 1961,Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe - School Lists for 1957, 1958, 1959 and 1960 Coudrille started out in broadcasting at the age of 17, appearing as a political satirist on both BBC Plymouth and the local commercial station Westward Television, which gave him his own show entitled Young Tomorrow. He also worked on BBC Radio's Today programme, under the aegis of Jack de Manio. He continued with musical political satire when he moved from the BBC to Southern Television, where he was given a Monday news magazine slot, and was later the station's musical director for a period. However, his career in broadcasting was abruptly cut short by a car accident in 1972, which temporarily crippled him with spinal damage. Art Coudrille studied painting with the leading English surrealist John Tunnard at the Penzance School of Art, where Tunnard taught from 1945 to 1965. During the 1990s, Coudrille exhibited at the Royal Academy in London and the South West Academy of Fine and Applied Arts in Exeter. In 2004, during the Liverpool Biennial, his work was included in The Stuckists Punk Victorian show at the Walker Art Gallery. Some of his recent work, most notably the photographic montage Analogue of Surreal Nostalgia (2005), is in the permanent collection of Falmouth Art Gallery. Coudrille was interviewed about his life and paintings for the programme John Nettles' Westcountry, broadcast by the Artsworld channel, now known as Sky Arts. Music Coudrille is also a multi-instrumentalist; he plays and composes for guitar, 7-string banjo, piano, organ and trumpet. His musical interests and influences are principally jazz, Russian and gypsy music. During the 1960s, Coudrille played in Soho strip-clubs. During his broadcasting career, he composed and arranged for television and radio; his guitar performance and arrangement of Francisco T√°rrega's Recuerdos de la Alhambra was the signature tune for Jack Hargreaves' long-running Out of Town. He entered the Melody Maker's national folk contest in 1974, and was named top rock-folk soloist. Later, at the peak of his musical career during the 1980s, he performed his composition Caballeta Suite for Spanish guitar in concert with the National Symphony Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall in London. He is currently a member of the Cornish semi- acoustic jazz band Gwelhellin Goth , and the Russian folk-music duo Muzika Muzikantov. Writing Coudrille took up the writing and illustration of children's books as a form of occupational therapy, while recovering from spinal damage. This unexpected turn of events led to him becoming an award- winning author and illustrator. The illustrated alphabet A Beastly Collection was published in 1974 by Frederick Warne & Co, the publishers of Beatrix Potter. The book received critical acclaim, and was compared to the work of John Tenniel. His second book Farmer Fisher (1975) was a best seller, winning the UK Children's Book of The Year award in 1976. Farmer Fisher is thought to have been the first picture book on the UK market to include a record (7-inch vinyl disc). It was republished in 1978 by Puffin Books, and in 2010 by Footsteps Press.

It is a payam and village in Kapoeta North County. Location The community is on the road between Torit and Kapoeta, open in both the dry and rainy seasons. A local bus links Riwoto to Kapoeta, to the southeast. As of 2010 Riwoto was described by the United Nations Mission in Sudan as a \\"relatively calm and peaceful place without any security incidents reported in recent times, with exception to sporadic cattle raiding and abduction of local children by other local tribes\\". A well provides water. The village has a basic medical clinic attended by a nurse. The primary health care center is a base for distribution of treated mosquito nets, and provides vaccinations against tetanus, polio and measles. Economy The people of Riwoto are Toposa, a pastoral community. In 2008 the Riwoto Cooperative Society, run by women, was set up to improve livestock marketing of livestock and sale of animal products such as milk. According to Nakwam, secretary of the cooperative: \\"Now I am able to send my children to school, because I can pay the costs of school from the income I get from selling animals. Before, we were keeping livestock only for our prestige and for wedding dowries\\". A very basic market with limited goods for sale is open sporadically in Riwoto village. Relations with neighbors The Toposa of Riwoto and their neighbors, including the Larim group of the Buya people to their west, have a history of clashes. In September‚ÄìOctober 2003 a series of reconciliation meetings were held with the Toposa sections of Paringa, Riwoto, Machi. About 400 people participated in the Riwoto session, and accepted reconciliation with the other Toposa sections and with the Buya. Following further disputes over cattle and resources, a series of peace and reconciliation meetings between the Buya and Toposa in October 2004 culminated in a spontaneous peace dialogue in Kimotong payam of Budi county that drew 3,000 participants, including 800 women. 21 leaders from both communities then walked the to Riwoto, where they were welcomed with a feast and celebration. In December 2007 the Riwoto and Larim communities held a five-day youth peace and reconciliation conference in Kimotong. They recommended opening the Napak- Riwoto road to improve communications. In June 2010 some Toposa men from Riwoto abducted a 10-year-old Buya boy, taking him over to Moru Akipi, near the border with Ethiopia, where they planned to trade him for cattle. Other members of the Toposa were concerned that the crime would damage the push for reconciliation with the Buya. They traveled by foot to Moru Akipi to recover the child and brought him back, handing him to the local authorities for return to the Buya. Impressed by this action a leader of the Buya women in Chawa, Anna Nalemuo Lotubatamoi, walked with other women the from Chawa to Riwoto, stopping at villages along the way and managing to persuade the Toposa leaders to start peace talks.

Image:Wikoelsch trans.png The WiKoelsch Logo During the first half of 2005, the idea condensed and a first small group of contributors were willing to try it. One of them installed MediaWiki on his own server and made it available under the domain wikoelsch.dergruenepunk.de for everyone willing to contribute to it at July 6, 2005. After a phase of initial silence, slightly more than 1000 pages were created in the remainder of the year. Roughly half of them were stub pages and disambiguation pages, for instance about abbreviations. In September 2004 already, a request had been made to create a Wikipedia for Ripuarian languages, which spurred a discussion which finally led to the acceptance of the proposal by the Wikimedia Foundations board of trustees two days before Christmas in the same year.:meta:Requests for new languages/Wikipedia Ripuarian Although the Wikipedia is dedicated to all Ripuarian languages, it was - pars pro toto - to be created with the identifyer \`ksh\` for the wiki and interlanguage links to it. That was a SIL code, which was later to become an ISO 639-3 code. It refers solely to the Colognian language, the biggest and best documented With more than 50 monographic publications at least about the language according to the German National Library as of July 2011, see http://d-nb.info/gnd/4378826-9/about/html Ripuarian variety.

Transition  When the new wiki was created on the server cluster of the Wikimedia Foundation under the domain ksh.wikipedia.org and was going to be used, a series of outages of the test website delayed copying content from there. Also, it was not possible to transfer data directly from one SQL server to the other, thus the newly developed page export and import feature of MediaWikim:Help:Export, m:Help:Import. had to be used. Several bugs and deficiencies See, for instance, bugs 5438, 5703, 5701, 6119, 6120, 5770, 8798, 10372, and :ksh:Project:Wikoelsch-ƒñmpocht/√Ñk√üpocht Lƒó√ü√ü Deijl 1 were detected during the process and had to be overcome.A more detailed but somewhat incomplete report can be found at: :ksh:Project:Wikoelsch-ƒñmpocht Since it was not possible to transfer user accounts and passwords, a volunteer developed and hosted a dual login web page allowing to supply two username/password pairs which were automatically verified against either wiki. If successful, a public list of user name pairs was updated, so the user continuity and proper attribution was guaranteed.See: :ksh:Project:Archiv/Impocht-Klaaf#Sisherheijdt Towards the end of April, 2006, the Wikipedia became eventually usable with page data and its history,The transfer of page contents was finally completed at April, 30th, 2005, see: :ksh:Project:Archiv/Impocht-Klaaf#Date √ñvvernaahm affjeshlo√ü√üe ‚Ä†‚Ä†‚Ä† but cleaning up various remains of the problems left behind by the transition took several more months.

Wikipedia  Though a Colognian localization of MediaWiki had already been begun during the preparation phase, it was incomplete and had in part become outdated.

He was the eldest son of the third Radomsker Rebbe, Rabbi Yechezkel Hakohen Rabinowicz and great-grandson of the founder of the dynasty, Rabbi Shlomo Hakohen Rabinowicz, the Tiferes Shlomo. Under his leadership, Radomsk grew to be the third largest Hasidut in Poland, after Ger and Alexander. Rabinowicz built a network of 36 yeshivas across Poland and Galicia that enrolled over 4,000 students by 1939. He was murdered in the Warsaw Ghetto together with his entire family. Biography Rabinowicz was born in Radomsko, Poland, the eldest of two sons of the third Radomsker Rebbe, Rabbi Yechezkel Hakohen Rabinowicz. He married the daughter of Rabbi Ahrele Twerski of Kras and had one daughter, Reizel. Reizel married her father's first cousin, Rabbi David Moshe Rabinowicz (1906-1942), in 1929. Rabbi David Moshe was the son of Rabbi Nosson Nachum Hakohen Rabinowicz, Rav of Krimilow, and grandson of the second Radomsker Rebbe, Rabbi Avraham Yissachar Dov Hakohen Rabinowicz.\\"A World That Was\\", Hamodia Magazine, 21 July 2011, p. 7. Shlomo Chanoch Rabinowicz succeeded his father as Rebbe upon the latter's death in 1910. He was a dynamic and charismatic leader. Thousands of Hasidim attended his court on Shabbat and Jewish holidays. On the eve of World War II, Radomsk was the third largest Hasidut in Poland, after Ger and Alexander. In Krak√≥w, there were more Radomsker shtieblach (small houses of prayer and study) than Gerrer shtieblach. The Rebbe considered himself a Hasid of the Chortkover Rebbe. The Rebbe was quite wealthy. He owned a glass factory and homes in Berlin, Warsaw, and Sosnowiec, where he lived after World War I. He also amassed a huge personal library of old manuscripts and prints, which was said to be the second-largest private library in Poland after that of the Gerrer Rebbe. Although he suffered from diabetes like his father and grandfather, and both of his predecessors had died of complications from diabetes at the age of 48, his life was extended by the discovery of insulin in 1921.Besser, Rabbi Shlomo C. \\"The Chessed L'Avraham of Radomsk: In honor of his 120th yahrtzeit, 13 Elul\\". Hamodia, 30 August 2012, pp. C2‚ÄìC6. Keser Torah yeshiva network World War I uprooted hundreds of thousands of Jews and decimated established communities. Traditionally, Hasidic youth had learned Torah from their elders and picked up the customs and lore of their Hasidic groups in the shtiebelach of Poland and Galicia. Now the Radomsker Rebbe proposed a new method of Hasidic education. On Lag B'Omer 1926, he announced his plan to establish a network of yeshivas called Keser Torah (Crown of Torah). Soon after, eight yeshivas were opened in Bƒôdzin, Podg√≥rze, Chrzan√≥w, Wolbrom, O≈õwiƒôcim, Czƒôstochowa, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Krak√≥w. Though Hasidic in nature, the yeshivas did not promote Radomsker Hasidut, nor did they staff only Radomsker Hasidim. Each yeshiva had its own rosh yeshiva and initially studied its own Talmudic tractate; later, all the yeshivas studied the same tractate at the same time. The Rebbe paid for the entire operation, including staff salaries, food, and student lodging, out of his own pocket. At the same time, the Rebbe established Kibbutz Govoha in the city of Sosnowiece exclusively for high- level students and avreichim (married students) and appointed his son-in-law, Rabbi David Moshe Hakohen Rabinowicz (1906‚Äì1942), a brilliant Torah scholar, to head it. Rabbi David Moshe also served as rosh yeshiva of the entire Keser Torah network, monitoring students' progress, delivering shiurim, and administering the end of the semester tests. By 1930, nine yeshivas and the kibbutz were functioning. Over the following decade, more yeshivas were added. On the eve of World War II, there were 36 Keser Torah yeshivas enrolling over 4,000 students in Poland. The yeshivas were disbanded after the German invasion of Poland in 1939, and most of their students were murdered in the Holocaust. World War II When war broke out, the Rebbe was in L√≥d≈∫. His Hasidim completed arrangements to fly him to Italy by mid-1940, but he refused, saying, \\"I want to be with all the Jews\\". The Rebbe eventually escaped to Alexander, but from there was most likely sent by the Nazis into the Warsaw Ghetto. The Radomsker Rebbe was one of the prominent Hasidic Rebbes incarcerated in the Warsaw Ghetto; others included the Piaseczner Rebbe; the Alexander Rebbe, the Sochatchover Rebbe, the Krimilover Rebbe, and the Strickover Rebbe. Rabinowicz was registered as a worker in the Shultz factory. Notwithstanding the danger, he refused to shave off his beard. The Rebbe's son-in-law, Rabbi David Moshe Rabinowicz, gave regular shiurim in the Warsaw Ghetto, and also composed many chiddushim (novel Torah thoughts) which his students recorded. All of these chiddushim as well as the sefarim he had written previously were lost in the war.Shema Yisrael, pp. 329‚Äì330. Death and legacy Memorial to Rabbi Shlomo Chanoch Rabinowicz in the Warsaw Jewish cemetery. The Rebbe and all the members of his family, including his only daughter, son-in-law, and their infant son, were killed during the aktion of 1 August 1942. When the Nazis stormed his house with the intention of deporting its residents to the Chelmno extermination camp, the Rebbe refused to leave, saying, \\"I know you've come to kill me. I prefer to die here in my house and not in a car filled with poison gas\\". He then recited the Shema Yisrael and was shot in the head when he reached the last word, Echad (One). His family members were shot together with him. They were buried in a mass grave in Warsaw's main cemetery. With the Rebbe's death, the father-to-son lineage of Radomsker rebbes came to an end. The Rebbe's brother, Rabbi Elimelech Aryeh Hakohen Rabinowicz, died in the Mauthausen concentration camp. In 1965, however, a descendant of the Radomsker dynasty, Rabbi Menachem Shlomo Bornsztain of Sochatchov (his grandfather, the second Sochatchover Rebbe, Rabbi Shmuel Bornsztain, married the granddaughter of the first Radomsker Rebbe, Shlomo Rabinowicz) was asked by the Radomsker Hasidim who had survived the Holocaust to become their Rebbe as well. After consulting with leading rabbis, Bornsztain officially became known as the Sochatchover-Radomsker Rebbe.Growise, Yisroel Alter. \\"The Sochatchover Rebbe, Harav Menachem Shlomo Bornstein, zt\\"l, 40 Years Since His Tragic Passing\\".

George Alonzo Johnson was born on August 16, 1824, in Palatine Bridge, Montgomery County, New York. In 1849 as a sailor he heard of the discovery of gold and left New York drawn by the California Gold Rush and came to San Francisco, in June 1849. There he worked unloading ships, except for a short trip to the mines, until May 1850. Hearing news of the Glanton Massacre he got together a small group of partners, (including Benjamin M. Hartshorne) with things necessary to build a ferry and traveled to the Yuma Crossing via San Diego. There they built and began operating a ferry, then sold it and returned to San Francisco. Autobiography and Reminiscence of George Alonzo Johnson, San Diego, 1901. p.14 Seeing the opportunity in bringing supplies to the isolated post of Fort Yuma, in 1852 Johnson and his partner Benjamin M. Hartshorne contracted to carry supplies up the Colorado in poled barges. This failed due to the strong current and many sandbars in the river. After a steam tug, the 20 hp Uncle Sam was successfully used to ascend the river in 1853, Johnson formed George A. Johnson & Company with Hartshorne and another partner Captain Alfred H. Wilcox. They brought the disassembled side-wheel steamboat General Jesup to the Colorado River Delta. There in the estuary he assembled this more powerful 70 hp steamboat and began successfully shipping cargo and carrying passengers on the Colorado River from its mouth, up to Fort Yuma. His steamboat carried 50 tons of cargo to the fort in 5 days and brought the cost to supply the fort down to $75 a ton from the $500 a ton shipped across the desert from San Diego. It made the Company $4,000 per trip to ships in the mouth of the Colorado River. Johnson was instrumental in getting Congressional funding for a military expedition to explore the Colorado River above Fort Yuma in 1856. Cut out of providing the steamboat for the 1857 expedition of Lt. Ives, Johnson at his own expense took the General Jesup up river first exploring the river up to what is now Nevada. As the only steamboat company on the river, Johnson and his partners became wealthy after the discovery of gold along the Colorado River in 1858. In 1858 he moved to San Diego, where he married a famous beauty, Maria Est√©fana Alvarado on June 4, 1859 in San Diego, California. Her parents gave Johnson's wife the Rancho Santa Maria de Los Pe√±asquitos as a wedding present. Johnson also built a home in Yuma for his wife for when they traveled there, that became the commanding officers quarters of the Yuma Quartermaster Depot in 1864. The Johnsons had nine children, but only two lived to adulthood.Lynne Newell Christenson, Ellen L. Sweet, Ranchos of San Diego County, Arcadia Publishing, 2008, p. 13 In 1863, Johnson became a Member of the California State Assembly for the 1st District, and again in 1866‚Äì67. Johnson had delegated operations to his senior steamboat captain Issac Polhamus, and distracted by his rancho and political career did not invest in more shipping to keep up with the growing traffic caused by the 1862 Colorado River gold rush. By 1864 it had created a large backlog of undelivered freight and caused competition of opposition lines to arrive on the Colorado River. This finally forced Johnson to expand his fleet of steamboats and to begin to use barges to increase their cargo carrying capacity. Following a price war that lasted until 1866, with the advantage of the contracts to supply the U. S. Army posts and his system of wood-yards, Johnson's company was again the only steamboat company on the river. In 1869 he incorporated his steamboat company as the Colorado Steam Navigation Company which he and his partners held until they sold its steamboats to the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1877.Autobiography and Reminiscence of George Alonzo Johnson, San Diego, 1901. p. 15] Johnson acquired title to the Rancho Los Pe√±asquitos when the U.S. government granted a patent to the land in 1876.

Report of the Surveyor General 1844-1886 In 1880, the Johnsons lost their rancho to creditors and within several years moved to a building, now known as the Johnson House, which they owned on the plaza of San Diego where they remained until his death.

Despite being located in the Vale of Glamorgan, the school is administered as part of the Cardiff local education authority and mainly educates children from the city. Close to 40% of its pupils are entitled to free school meals and there is a growing number of non-Catholic families who attend the school as the Catholic population of west Cardiff has changed. History The school was founded in 1963 as Archbishop Mostyn Secondary Modern School, which later merged with, what was then, Cyntwell Boys' School. In 1987 Roman Catholic education was reorganised in the Archdiocese of Cardiff, which saw all secondary schools lose their post-16 education facilities in favour of one united tertiary college, St David's. This saw the creation of Mary Immaculate High School. In 2002 the school moved to new purpose-built accommodation. In September 2013, the school celebrated its 50-year anniversary of Catholic education on the school site. A mass celebrated by Archbishop George Stack, attended by governors, parents, pupils and staff (both existing and former) along with invited dignitaries marked the occasion. The current Headteacher is Huw Powell who started at the school in 2014. Period of change In recent years the school has undergone a significant amount of change which has led to rapid improvements, courtesy the hard work of all staff. The spring of 2009 was particularly challenging for the school when it was identified for closure as part of the local authority reorganisation plan. This was coupled with a damning Estyn inspection which identified the school as \\"in need of significant improvement\\". Since this time the school has undergone many changes and a rapid increase in fortunes. By January 2011, the school has been cleared of closure and shown Estyn it had made significant improvements. Over the last four years, there has been a significant improvement in examination results. In the summer of 2011 the school recorded its, as of then, best ever GCSE results with 68% of the school pupils achieving 5 A*-C only for the record to be beaten in 2012 with 81% of students achieving the same benchmark. The record was further beaten In 2013, when the school recorded its best ever results with over 92% of pupils achieving 5 of more A*-C grades. Outcomes in 2014, represented a further improvement with another set of record-breaking results. 98% of pupils achieved 5 A*-C and a stunning 60% 5A*-C including English and mathematics. This represents a remarkable standard of improvement from 2009 when the examination results saw only 23% of children achieve 5 A*-C grades and 9% including English and mathematics. Mary Immaculate has also been the subject of praise from observers, both in the local and wider community. In the spring of 2013, the school appeared in The Cambridge University Student Guide to Excellence where it cited the school's improvements over the recent years.http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/most-improved-school-wales- not-282025 A school described by former Education Minister, Leighton Andrews as \\"one of the most improved in Wales\\" has also attracted praise from Estyn by featuring in a number of best practice thematic reports.

It is about east of Burns on U.S. Route 20. History The community was named after the family of William D. Buchanan, who, with his sons Joe and George, homesteaded there beginning in 1886. Buchanan post office was established in 1911, with Hattie E. Buchanan the first postmaster. The office closed in 1919 but the area around the Buchanan Ranch is still known as Buchanan. By 1978 the community had a single store. Today Buchanan has a Burns mailing address and a business that includes a tractor repair shop, gas station, gallery, and free museum, all located within the only building in the community. The school once stood along Little Rock Creek on the site of the present-day Buchanan Springs Rest Area on U.S. 20, a mile northeast of the community. William Buchanan and his sons ran a stage stop at the top of the hill, north of the present-day Buchanan, on the former J. W. Buchanan ranch. The stop served the route from Vale to Burns. Meals for stagecoach passengers were 50 cents, while those traveling with horses only paid 35 cents, but they paid 25 cents per head for feed and water for their livestock. The stop was later run by Thomas Buchanan. Transportation In the 21st century, Buchanan is a stop on the Eastern POINT intercity bus line between Bend and Ontario. It makes one stop per day in each direction.

Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 The aircraft is often referred to as the Schleicher AS-K 14 or the Schleicher ASK-14, the AS for Alexander Schleicher and the K for Kaiser. The US Federal Aviation Administration designates the aircraft as the Schleicher ASW-14, while Transport Canada and the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority call it the Schleicher ASK 14. Design and development The ASK 14 was developed as a low-wing motorized version of the Schleicher Ka 6E. The powerplant is a Hirth F10 K19 four-cylinder, two-stroke engine, made by Hirth and driving a fully feathering propeller. The aircraft is built from wood and covered with doped aircraft fabric covering. The span wing employs a NACA 63-618 airfoil at the wing root transitioning to a NACA 63-615 section at the wing tip and features spoilers. The monowheel landing gear is retractable. The cockpit is covered by a bubble canopy that gives all-around visibility. Due to its Ka 6E heritage the handling of the ASK 14 was described by Soaring Magazine in 1983 as \\"superb\\". The ASK 14 was never type certified and aircraft registered in the United States were in the Experimental - Racing/Exhibition category.

The museum is one of two main ceramics museums in the city, with the other being the Pantaleon Panduro Museum . It was established in 1954 to preserve and promote indigenous handcrafts of Jalisco, especially the state‚Äôs ceramic tradition. The emphasis is still on ceramics but the museum also has a room dedicated to Huichol art and holds events related to various types of indigenous crafts and culture. History of institution and building Courtyard of the former hacienda house The museum was founded in 1954 by the Instituto Nacional Indigenista and the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia, to promote and preserve indigenous arts with emphasis on ceramics. The original collection was assembled by historian Isabel Marin de Pallen, working under the direction of Daniel F. Rubin de la Borbolla, one of the most important handcrafts and folk art collectors from Jalisco. The Instituto Nacional Indigenista is now the Instituto de la Artesania Jalisciense and the museum was reinaugurated in 1998 under state control. However, the museum still maintains active participation in the preservation of indigenous handcrafts and folk art along with newer ceramic traditions. In 2008, the museum held an event called ‚ÄúMexico Indigena en el Corazon de Jalisco‚Äù (Indigenous Mexico in the heart of Jalisco), which highlighted various indigenous peoples. It included exhibitions, workshops, conferences and more. In 2011, the la Comisi√≥n Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Ind√≠genas agreed to lend the museum 2,400 pieces from its rational indigenous arts collection for exhibition. The pieces in the collection was selected to represent the various indigenous cultures of Mexico. The museum offers guided tours and classes in painting, ceramics and other handcrafts. The building which contains the museum is located on the pedestrian only Independencia Street in what is now the center of Tlaquepaque. However, it began as the main house of a hacienda which dates from the colonial era. This main house itself was built in the 19th century and was the property of Jos√© Francisco Velvardo y de la Moro, who earned the nickname of ‚ÄúBurro de Oro‚Äù (Donkey of Gold) during his lifetime. His military service included that under General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna and he was executed for his support of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico . The house is now a historic monument. The house was converted into a museum in 1954, with the various rooms turned into exhibition halls. The main purpose of the museum is the rescue, preservation and promotion of the traditional handcrafts of Jalisco, especially ceramics. The state of Jalisco has an important ceramics tradition, especially that made in Tonal√° among the Nahua communities. The building surrounds a large courtyard which contains fifteen stands with vendors selling handcrafts. These vendors vary each weekend and usually are indigenous from the Nahua and Wixarika peoples. However, other cultures such has the Mixtec, the Triqui, the Pur√©pecha, Mazahua and Otomi have been invited to participate. The collection Two pots in Sala 1 The museum exhibits ceramic pieces and some other handcrafts from various parts of Mexico but focuses primarily on the primary ceramic producing areas of Jalisco such as Tonal√°, Santa Cruz de las Huertas, El Rosario, Tlaquepaque, Zalatitl√°n and Tateposco . These areas are mostly concentrated in the Valley of Atemajac except for some made in the nearby Sayula mountain range, which is included because of its quality. There are nine rooms dedicated to the exhibition of the permanent collection with a tenth set aside for temporary exhibits, mostly focused on Mexican handcrafts, folk art and folkclore. The museum‚Äôs permanent collection offers a view of the regional ceramics and the history of its development. It contains pieces from the 17th and 18th centuries along pieces from contemporary masters. The Valley of Atemajac area is known for a number of pottery styles including a number exclusive to it. These include bandera, canelo, petatillo, bru√±ido, betus, high fire and engretado, which are named decoration styles except for high fire, which is named for firing at high temperatures. Major artisans featured at the museum include Candelario Medrano, Salvador V√°zquez, Rodo Padilla, Juan Campechano, Margarito N√∫√±ez, Jes√∫s and √Ångel Carranza, Kent Edward, Jorge Wilmot, the Jim√≥n family, the Barnab√© family, the Pajarito family and the Panduro Family. The barro bru√±ido tradition is represented with flasks, pots, jars and storage containers from Tonal√°. This is the best known ceramic style from the area, probably descended from polychrome pottery produced from the 19th century. The name comes from the fact that these pieces are not glazed, but rather they are given a slip and then polished with a stone or pyrite. Many of these pieces are slender necked jugs or lamp bases, often decorated with animals, such as rabbits, with distorted characteristics, giving them a surreal look. The pieces are usually painted with delicate tones of rose, gray-blue and white on a background of a light coffee color, light gray and sometimes green or blue. Each piece is individually created. The attraction of this pottery is its appearance, as it is too porous to hold any liquid or food. One exception is a water container with a fat body and long neck, with a ceramic cup placed upside down over the neck. These are called botellones are carafes.Hopkins and Muller 100‚Äì102 Most of the pieces with the oldest designs are in barro bru√±ido, which include pieces with antique floral motifs in indigo and countryside scenes depicting the Valley. Also in the bru√±ido category are two very large plates by Amado Galvan, a potter from first half of the 20th century who gained fame for his designs which imitate the art of the 19th century. Two flasks by Carlos Villanueva The museum‚Äôs betus ceramic collection comes from the community of Santa Cruz de las Huertas. This pottery has a bone colored crystalline finish which is comparable to Japanese ceramics. It is also characterized by vibrant colors that give the ceramics a whimsical look. The name from the betus oil the clayware is immersed in before it is fired. The oil, which is made of a resin extracted from pine trees, gives the painted pottery its brilliant sheen. The main crafter of the barro betus on display is Candelario Medrano. There is one room dedicated to petatillo pottery, including some of the first pieces in this style ever made. Petatillo pieces are distinguished by tightly drawn lines or crosshatching in a red background. These lines are named after straw mats called petates, which they resemble. Above the lines stylized images of plants and animals, especially deer, rabbits, eagles, roosters and swans, are drawn. Often the main figures are banded in black and spare use of green completes the set. This ware is painted before firing, glazed, and then fired again. It is very labor-intensive and rare, mostly showing up on platters. A giant urn in this style can take up to three years to complete. The best known pieces have been made by the Lucano, Bernab√©, V√°zquez, Pajarito, Jim√≥n and other families. Canelo is named for the color the fired clay turns out, which is various shades of cinnamon (canela in Spanish). It is popular and used mainly for water jugs because it is good for keeping liquid cool. thumb Bandera, which means \\"flag\\" in Spanish, is so named because it has the green-red-and-white colors of the Mexican flag. Red is commonly used as the background color, while the green and white are used for the decorative details. It is also an unglazed burnished ware. For unknown reasons, this style of pottery is very rare.Hopkins and Muller 101 One uncommon ware is called engregado. These objects have a special varnish that make them useful for cooking, the varnish acting like a coating of Teflon that prevents food from slicking when heated. High fire ceramics are not endemic to Jalisco, but stoneware and other types were introduced to the area in the 1960s and developed by Jorge Wilmot and Ken Edwards. Works of both artisans are on display at the museum. Several rooms of the museum contain displays of toys, masks and various types of ceramic figures, such as charros, soldiers and more. These include popular figures made by Ponciano and Rosa de Panduro and miniature figures by √Ångel Carranza. Carranza‚Äôs work is mostly based on everyday figures such as El Nevero de Garrafa (ice cream seller), El Vendedor de Flores (flower seller] and El Carbonero (charcoal maker) . There is a group of Mexico‚Äôs past and present presidents made by Jos√© Luis N√∫√±ez and a rare set of figures related to the making of pottery including extraction of clay, kneading, shaping and firing done by Honorato Panduro. In the courtyard area, there is a collection of richly decorated ceramic bathtubs from the 19th century. A number of these are decorated with double headed eagles. One room is dedicated to the recreation of a late 19th century/early 20th century Mexican kitchen. The kitchen consists of a parapet of rubblestone masonry covered over in brick in which charcoal burning stoves are inlaid. The kitchen contains numerous pieces of ceramics similar to those used at the time. It also contains some of ceramics which have won the Premio Nacional de la Cer√°mica (National Ceramics Prize). Among the non ceramic displays at the museum, there is one room dedicated to Huichol art and a display dedicated to blown glass.

It was commemoratively built by Nawab Mohammad Ishak Khan [1860-1918] to serve as a memorial to Nawab Mustafa Khan Shefta, his father, [1804-1869] who was one of the most eminent and accomplished poets and critics of his era. Establishment The construction commenced in 1896/1897 and the building was completed in 1900. The first structure, the grandiose gate, was completed in 1899; following which was the Castle itself. The Castle was completed by 1900 after a span of 4‚Äì5 years of construction. The structure was built by Nawab Mohammad Ishak Khan in honour of his father, the Persian and Urdu poet Nawab Mustafa Khan Shefta. Nawab M. Ishak Khan designed the building himself, and the imposing project, upon 30 acres of land. It was designed with the help of assistants who possessed considerable experience in building barracks for the British Army. The Nawab amalgamated many styles of architecture in building Mustafa Castle. It offers facilities akin to British bungalows and shares prominent features with the buildings of the realm of Rajasthan and Oudh‚Äîmainly Lucknow. However, the amalgam meant that the edifice of Mustafa Castle was to be peerless amongst others seen in the cities of Delhi, Hyderabad, and Lahore. A hoard of antiques within can be attributed to Nawab M. Ishak Khan's epic tours around the world and his penchant for collecting artifacts. Historical accounts make mention of clay from Mecca being used in the construction procedure and the replacement of an inward gallows with an Islamic mosque. Mustafa Castle as at 2012. Muse Nawab Mustafa Khan Shefta was a close friend, admirer and, in times of need, a patron of Mirza Ghalib ‚Äì who was a classical Urdu and Persian poet from India during British colonial rule. A man of letters, he found himself in trouble after the British succeeded in regaining control of Delhi in 1857. Nawab Mustafa Khan's mother was the daughter of the Commander in Chief of the Mughal army, Ismail Baig Hamadani. Even after the surrender of the Mughal army, Ismail Baig continued his fight for liberation against the British and, as a result, retreated to Nepal. Nawab Mustafa Khan was tried for allegedly supporting the uprising which had emanated from Meerut. He was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and confined in a cell which had been improvised ‚Äì and later abandoned ‚Äì for the convicts of the 1857 uprising. This small jail happened to be the centre of the area which is now enclosed by Mustafa Castle. Nawab Mustafa Khan Shefta died in 1869 when Nawab M. Ishak Khan was 9 years of age. The spot of the poet's imprisonment was purchased by Nawab M. Ishak Khan along with the adjoining area, which comprised nearly 30 acres of land. He then had Mustafa Castle built as his homage to the memory and honour of his father. The cell, in which the poet was imprisoned, has been retained in its original form so as to keep the memory of the hardship faced by Nawab Mustafa Khan Shefta during his imprisonment. That particular chamber, therefore, had been left unaltered by Nawab M. Ishak Khan. The family, that had been previously based in Delhi and Jehangirabad, had established Mustafa Castle as its main home after the building's completion in the year 1900. A similar building to Mustafa Castle, originally belonging to the same family, exists in the erstwhile family capital of Jehangirabad. Post-War Political Headquarters Nawab Mohammad Ishak Khan died on 28 October 1918, leaving his eldest son, Nawab Mohammad Ismail Khan, at the helm. It was during Nawab M. Ismail Khan's career in the national struggle [1918‚Äì1958] that Mustafa Castle was markedly transformed into a hub of political activity. Mustafa Castle bore some of the greatest events in Meerut which were significant post-World War I/post-World War II political activities with regard to the prospective nations in question at the time‚Äîwhich were to be India and Pakistan. Nawab M. Ismail Khan was a highly accomplished politician and an independent activist of the Indian Subcontinent who presided as Chairman over the All-India Muslim League in the state of Uttar Pradesh [United Provinces]. In general, it was Nawab Mohammad Ismail Khan who transformed his home, Mustafa Castle, into a haven for political proceedings during his reign. Apart from being Chairman of the League, this 'transformation' ensued due to the numerous other roles that he upheld in politics. The stratum of obligations involved rendering his services as the Chairman of the All-India Muslim Civil Defense Association, Chairman of the All-India Muslim League Committee of Action, Chairman of the Parliamentary Board, President of the All-India Khilafat Committee, President of the All-Parties Muslim Conference, President of the Unity Board, and other political and academic affiliations. Albeit Nawab M. Ismail Khan is one of the founding fathers of Pakistan, he never migrated towards the 'promising land' due to his steadfast commitment towards the thousands of Muslims left behind in India itself. He, in all consciousness, decided to share the same fate despite being persistently enticed by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan. Some of the politicians who have visited and/or stayed in Mustafa Castle are as follows: * Mahatma Gandhi [three days during the Khilafat Movement] * Jawaher Lal Nehru [three days during the Khilafat Movement] * Mohammad Ali Jinnah [twice during the Pakistan Movement] * Sarojini Naidu * Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad * Maulana Mohammad Ali * Maulana Hasrat Mohani * Vijaya Lakshmi Pundit * Bahadur Yar Jang of Hyderabad * Vithalbhai Patel * Bhulabhai Desai * Govind Vallabh Pant * Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan * Nawab Muhammad Ahmad Khan The Inner Portion of the Castle Several chambers within the Castle are named after colours such as 'Basanti', 'Gulabi' and so forth. They are used distinctly in summer or winter months with the relevant color schemes. Some of the originality that remains in the Castle includes furniture that had been imported by Nawab Mohammad Ishak Khan from London, to various showpieces that the Castle displays with pride. Pendulum clocks, ornately designed lamps, antique chandeliers, carved wooden cabinets, chests, dressing tables, cupboards and drawers, antique lampshades, candle-stands, mirrors and historic portraits are amongst some of the rare artifacts that have been preserved throughout Mustafa Castle's century-old lifetime.

The region is inhabited by Assyrians and Kurds, and was formerly also home to a number of Jews prior to their emigration to Israel in 1951. It is divided between northern Barwari in Turkey, and southern Barwari in Iraq. 300px Etymology The name of the region is derived from \\"berwar\\" (\\"slope [of a hill]\\" in Kurdish). History The British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard visited Barwari Bala in 1846 and noted that some villages in the region were inhabited by both Assyrians and Kurds. Assyrians of Barwari Bala were rayah (subjects) of the Kurdish emirate of lower Barwari, whilst Assyrians in Barwari Shwa'uta were partly semi-independent and partly rayah. In the 1840s, a series of massacres of Assyrians in Barwari Bala were perpetrated by Kurdish tribes under the leadership of Bedir Khan Beg, Mir of Bohtan, resulting in the death or expulsion of half of the population. The region was estimated by American Presbyterian missionaries to contain 32 Assyrian villages, with 420 Nestorian families, in 1870. Amidst the Assyrian genocide in the First World War, in 1915, most Assyrian villages in Barwari Bala were destroyed and their inhabitants slaughtered by Turkish reservists and Kurdish tribesmen led by Rashid Bey, Mir of lower Barwari, whilst the survivors took refuge in the vicinity of Urmia and Salamas in Iran. Assyrian villages in northern Barwari were similarly pillaged and their inhabitants massacred. Until the genocide in 1915, northern Barwari was inhabited by approximately 9000 Assyrians, whilst there were c. 5000 Assyrians in southern Barwari. Survivors were transferred under British protection from Iran to the refugee camp at Baqubah in Iraq in 1918, where they remained until most families attempted to return to their villages in 1920. As a consequence of the partition of the Ottoman Empire, most of Hakkari was allocated to Turkey, which prevented Assyrians from returning, whilst Assyrians in southern Barwari in Iraq were permitted to return to their original villages. The Assyrians of southern Barwari suffered major upheaval with the eruption of the First Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War in 1961, forcing a sizeable number to flee and seek refuge in Iraqi towns until most returned at the war's conclusion in 1970, during which time a few Assyrian villages were seized and settled by Kurds. In accordance with the 1975 Algiers Agreement between Iraq and Iran, the Iraqi government carried out border clearings in 1977-1978, destroying a number of Assyrian and Kurdish villages, and displacing their population. Villages that had been spared in the late 1970s were destroyed by the Iraqi Army in the Al- Anfal campaign in 1987-1988, and all Assyrians in the region were moved to refugee camps, from which they moved to Iraqi towns or emigrated abroad to Europe, North America, or Australia. In total, all 82 villages in the sub- district of Barwari Bala were destroyed in the campaign, of which 35 villages were entirely inhabited by Assyrians. Assyrians returned to rebuild their villages after the establishment of the Iraqi no-fly zones in 1991, however, the majority have remained in the diaspora. Geography Iraq Southern or lower Barwari corresponds to the part of the region now located within northern Iraq, and encompasses Barwari Bala and Barwari ≈Ωƒìr. Barwari Bala (\\"upper Barwari\\" in Kurdish) is a sub-district in Amadiya District within the Dohuk Governorate, and is located alongside the Iraq‚ÄìTurkey border. The sub- region of Barwari Bala is separated from the Sapna valley to the south by the Matina mountains, and from the historical region of Lower Tyari in Hakk√¢ri Province in Turkey by the ≈†irani mountains to the north. Its eastern border is defined by the Great Zab, beyond which lies Nerwa Rekan, and the Khabur serves as the western boundary of Barwari Bala. Barwari ≈Ωƒìr (\\"lower Barwari\\" in Kurdish) is located further to the south of Barwari Bala. The following villages in Barwari Bala are currently inhabited by Assyrians: *Tarshƒ´sh *Jdƒ´dƒÅ *Be·πØ Kolke. *T≈´·πØƒÅ ShamƒÅyƒÅ *MƒÅyƒÅ *Derishke. *A√ØnƒÅ d'N≈´ne *Hayyat *Be·πØ ShmiyƒÅye *D≈´re *HelwƒÅ *Malak·πØƒÅ *Aqrƒ´. *Be·πØ Bal≈çkƒÅ *Hayyis *M≈´sƒÅkƒÅn *Merkaje *Qasrka *Baz *Betanure *Sardasht *Cham Dostina *Khwara. *Kani Balavi *Jelek *Iden *Chaqala The following villages in Barwari Bala were formerly inhabited by Assyrians: *Alq≈çshtƒÅ. *Avsarke. *Bazif. *Beluzan. *Butara. *Dargeli. *Maghribiya. *Tirwanish.

The park is owned jointly by the Cayman Islands Government and the National Trust for the Cayman Islands, a group dedicated to preserving natural environments and places of historic significance in the Cayman Islands. Opened in 1994 with only the Woodland Trail completed, the park now also contains the Floral Colour Garden, a Cayman Heritage Garden, a lake, an orchid boardwalk exhibit, and a Blue Iguana Habitat. Also inside the park is a gift shop and a visitor's interpretive center, the starting point from which visitors can enter the Woodland Trail and other garden grounds.Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park Park history and conservation Planning for the botanic park began in the late 1980s with master plans being drawn up by landscape and cultural heritage planner Carl Bray.Carl Bray, Landscape Architect The park was officially opened in 1994 by Queen Elizabeth II. At the time of the park's opening, only the Woodland Trail was completed; the remainder of the park was completed section by section in the ensuing years.Welcome to the Park! The park also serves the natural conservation needs of the Cayman Islands as a protected area. The forest surrounded by the Woodland Trail and south of the lake area is protected in order to assist in conserving flora and fauna native to the Cayman Islands. Plants unique to the Cayman Islands have been planted and cared throughout the managed areas of the park.QEII Botanic Park Conservation Programme The park forms part of the Botanic Park and Salina Reserve Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports populations of several threatened or restricted-range bird species. It is surrounded by the Frank Sound Forest Important Bird Area. Natural exhibits Woodland Trail and Blue Iguana Habitat The park's Woodland Trail was the first natural exhibit to open when the park was dedicated in 1994. It currently is estimated to hold more than 50% of flora native to the Cayman Islands. The trail was built to allow those visiting a unique and safe view of the natural landscape that takes up much of Grand Cayman Island. The four-fifths of a mile long trail encompasses approximately 40 acres and showcases several habitats that feature the rare and native Cockspur trees (Erythrina velutina) and Bull Thatch palms (Thrinax radiata). The trail winds through areas that contain swamp, dry soil, and areas where Mahogany trees can be seen reaching across the trail and overhead.Woodland Trail Blue Iguana on Wilderness Trail, Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park About halfway along the trail is the Blue Iguana Habitat, developed and run by National Trust of Cayman Islands Blue Iguana Recovery Program. Through the careful administration and stewardship of the program by the National Trust, repopulation is the program's focus as the Blue Iguana (Cyclura lewisi) is native to the Cayman Islands still considered an endangered reptile species. Breeding in captivity within the confines of the habitat has been successful since inception and the breeding goal has been set by the National Trust at 1000 and breeding in captivity with an ultimate repopulation goal of 1000. The reptile is frequently seen roaming in the wooded areas surrounding the Wilderness Trail as well as the grounds of the park.Blue Iguana Habitat Cayman Heritage Garden The Cayman Heritage Garden showcases plants that have been a part of Caymanian life since settlers first arrived. The garden includes several areas that represent historical agricultural significance in the Cayman Islands.Restored early 20th-century Caymanian home and surrounding sand garden at QEII Botanic Park, Grand Cayman Among these plants are: root crops and vegetables grown and harvested throughout Cayman history; the Silver Thatch Palm (Coccothrinax proctorii), an economically viable tree that provided the means for Caymanians to make thatch rope to use, sell, and trade; a medicinal garden that shows the types of plants Caymanians would utilize to homeopathically treat illness and injury; a sand garden surrounding a more-than-century-old Caymanian house, formerly owned by Julius Rankine, an East End settler; a fruit tree orchard containing banana, breadfruit, and mango trees. The Rankine home was restored after being brought to the park and the sand garden planted and developed to display traditional ornamental plants that would be found around such a home on Grand Cayman in the early 20th century.Heritage Garden Floral Colour Garden Wild Banana Orchid, QEII Botanic Park, Grand CaymanButterfly at QEII Botanical Park, Grand CaymanThe Floral Colour Garden includes a gravel pathway leading through large stands of wooded areas containing native trees along with open grassy spaces, gazebos, and arbors. The garden was designed to emphasize a specific colour layout beginning with pink and then moving into red, orange, yellow, white, blue, purple, and lavender. Arbors, trellises, and gazebos round out the garden and give it a serene, peaceful look and feel.Floral Colour Garden 56 different butterfly varieties‚Äî5 of which are endemic to the Cayman Islands‚Äîlive on Grand Cayman Island and are frequently seen on and around the colorful array of flora in the Colour Garden.Butterflies at QEII Botanic Park Orchid exhibit A recently completed Orchid Garden and boardwalk features ten varieties of orchids, with three of the ten varieties only being found in the Cayman Islands. One of the three is Cayman's national flower, the endemic Grand Cayman Wild Banana Orchid Myrmecophila thomsoniana var. thomsoniana;Banana orchid Banana Orchids at QEII Botanic Park it varies from the Little Cayman and Cayman Brac endemic Banana Orchid, Myrmecophila thomsoniana var. minor. Other native orchids on display and growing in the exhibit include the Tolumnia variegata.Orchid Exhibit and Boardwalk Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park Orchids Lake Lake and lily pads adjacent to Floral Colour Garden The lake adjoins the Floral Colour Garden and covers approximately three acres. Prior to the Botanic Park's current state of gardens, trails, and natural exhibits existed a natural wetland that was part of a Buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus) swamp. During the planning stage, park developers decided to develop the swampland into a small lake that would serve as an aquatic bird habitat for several species along with the threatened West Indian Whistling Duck (Dendrocygna arborea).West Indian Whistling Duck conservation effort This aquatic habitat at the Botanic Park has become increasingly important as the wetlands on Grand Cayman Island continue to be lost to development. With the birds that gather here as well the aquatic plant life, lake is a popular spot for photographers visiting the park. Because it is landlocked without any feeding tributaries, the lake varies in size throughout the year, depending on the rainy season to fill it up.Lake Maintenance Other attractions and events The botanic park also has a plant nursery available where plants seen inside the various natural exhibits can be purchased. As the various garden areas have been developed and completed, weddings have become a popular event at the park.Weddings at QEII Botanic Park - Cayman Bride Art exhibits are also a frequent event at the botanic park.Art in the Park Annually, the botanic park is host to the Orchid Show, hosted by the park and the Cayman Islands Orchid Society. An exhibition of locally grown orchids as well as a specialty orchid plant sale; the show also promotes the conservation of the native orchids found in the Cayman Islands.

Although it was successful in obtaining signatures to get on the ballot in a majority of states, the process set up by the organization did not select a candidate. History Incorporated on April 6, 2010, by Peter Ackerman and Kahlil Byrd, Americans Elect began recruiting delegates for its 2012 Presidential Primary in July 2011. Americans Elect was scheduled to host a national online primary in two phases, ending with a convention in June 2012. The resulting ticket, chosen by Americans Elect users, would have listed on the ballot nationwide under the Americans Elect line. The organization had an open membership, which allowed any U.S. voter to draft and support his or her candidate of choice. The drafting began on February 1, 2012, and in the first few hours the 360,000 delegates began draft efforts for 52 possible candidates including Michael Bloomberg, Warren Buffett, Hillary Clinton, Rahm Emanuel, Jon Huntsman, Ron Paul, Condoleezza Rice, and Buddy Roemer. Americans Elect was open to candidates from any party, as well as independents. Presidential candidates would have been required to choose a vice presidential running mate from a party different from their own to ensure a balanced ticket. In order to obtain ballot access nationwide, some states' guidelines required Americans Elect to register as a political party. For the 2012 elections, Americans Elect succeeded in ballot access status in 29 states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina,News & Observer: Americans Elect secures place on NC Ballot North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, WisconsinLowe, Diane, Lead Elections Specialist. \\"Partisan Primary Sample Ballot and Reminders for a Successful Primary\\" Wisconsin Government Accountability Board; June 7, 2012 and Wyoming. Any U.S. citizen thought to be constitutionally eligible was eligible to be drafted as a candidate. Americans Elect participants, referred to as delegates, could also propose and vote on the Platform of Questions, a list of questions that all candidates would have to answer before the June phase of the primary. Prior to delegate voting, the positions of various potential candidates on the Platform of Questions were inferred, using voting records and public statements compiled by OnTheIssues.org, and posted on the web site. Candidates, whether drafted or self-declared, were required to receive a minimum number of clicks of support from verified delegates to advance to the American Elect online primary ballot. Candidates who had served in any of the following positions, without having been removed from office, current criminal indictment, or conviction, needed 1,000 support clicks from each of 10 states to qualify: Vice President, United States Senator, member of Congress, Presidential Cabinet member, head of a Federal agency, governor, mayor of any of the largest 100 cities in the United States, chairman or chief executive officer or president of a corporation, nonprofit corporation, or philanthropic organization with 1,000 or more employees, president of a national labor union with 100,000 or more members, military officer who has attained flag rank, ambassador, or president of an American-based university with 4,000 or more students. All other candidates required 5,000 support clicks from each of 10 states to qualify for the primary ballot. The first phase of voting was intended to identify the six most popular certified candidates through three rounds of online balloting. The organization announced that it would hold a series of three primary ballots to narrow down its field of candidates on May 8, 15, and 22, 2012. The six finalists were expected to advance to the second phase of the primary after agreeing to the Americans Elect rules and selecting a Vice-Presidential running mate. Americans Elect planned to choose its final candidate in June 2012 through an Internet-based convention, a process open to all voters, regardless of party affiliation. The intent was to provide a more open nominating process, resulting in better choices during the election. However, on May 1, 2012, the first primary ballot (which had been scheduled for May 8) was cancelled, because no candidate had garnered sufficient support clicks to qualify for the ballot. Voting was then rescheduled to begin on May 15, 2012. However, with no candidate qualifying for the ballot to be held on that date, the primary was pushed off again. On May 17, the organization issued a statement that it was ending its nomination process because no candidate had achieved the required amount of support to qualify for its primary ballot. In July 2012, the remaining board members decided to officially end Americans Elect's presidential efforts and withdrew its name from most state ballots. The Americans Elect website is still accessible, but has not been updated since 2012. Americans Elect made no attempt to revive its process for the 2016 presidential election, despite widespread dissatisfaction with the two major parties and the lack of an incumbent running for reelection. Its founders, through an organization called \\"Level The Playing Field\\", focused on efforts to get independent and third-party candidates access to the 2016 general election debates.http://sers.fec.gov/fosers/showpdf.htm?docid=306278 Candidates in 2012 and 2014 In Arizona, several candidates ran under the Americans Elect Party banner in 2012 and 2014. In 2012, Richard Grayson and Stephen Dolgos ran on an Americans Elect ticket in Arizona's 4th and 8th Congressional Districts, respectively. In 2014, Rebecca DeWitt and Stephen Dolgos ran as Americans Elect candidates in the general election in Arizona's 7th and 8th Congressional Districts, respectively, and John Lewis Mealer was the Americans Elect party candidate for Arizona Governor. In addition, in 2014, Kelly Gneiting ran for the State Senate in Legislative District 7, and Suzie Easter ran for the State House of Representatives in Legislative District 22. Also in 2014, Alan Reynolds ran for California Lieutenant Governor in California's June 3, 2014 direct primary election as a candidate of the Americans Elect Party. He received 56,027 votes, or 1.3% of the total. Americans Elect also ran television ads supporting the U.S. Senate campaign of former Maine governor, Angus King. People Americans Elect was formed by many of the individuals who were responsible for a previous attempt to nominate an Internet candidate, Unity08, and had substantially identical goals for the 2012 presidential election cycle. Americans Elect's founder and Chairman was financier Peter Ackerman. Kahlil Byrd was the former CEO; he subsequently become the president of StudentsFirst by January 2013.StudentsFirst (2013-01-04). http://www.studentsfirst.org/press/entry/studentsfirst- announces-new-hires Other members of the Board of Directors included Eliot Cutler, Dennis Blair, Stephen W. Bosworth, Irvine Hockaday, and Christine Todd Whitman and Joshua S. Levine. Reception and impact Although it had a minor impact on the election, columnist Thomas Friedman initially saw promise in the organization, writing \\"Americans Elect. What Amazon.com did to books, what the blogosphere did to newspapers, what the iPod did to music, what drugstore.com did to pharmacies, Americans Elect plans to do to the two-party duopoly that has dominated American political life‚Äîremove the barriers to real competition, flatten the incumbents and let the people in.\\" Some commentators discussed the possibility of Americans Elect producing a spoiler candidate. Columnist Harold Meyerson predicted that an Americans Elect candidate \\"could well replicate the signally dubious achievement of Ralph Nader in the 2000 election: Throwing the election to one of the two major-party nominees who otherwise would not have won.\\" The group was criticized for failure to fully disclose its funding. The group was originally organized as a political organization and at that time tax documents show that Peter Ackerman, father of the Chief Operating Officer Elliot Ackerman, had contributed $1.55 million. In 2011, it changed its designation to a 501(c)4 social welfare group. Americans Elect claimed that none of its funding came from special interests, lobbyists, corporations or other groups. The group changed its bylaws in 2012 to provide that the wealthy donors who loaned the organization its initial funds would be repaid from donations to the organization. At the conclusion of the campaign, Garrett Quinn of Boston.com wrote, \\"This $35 million operation was doomed to fail from the beginning. How can you run a serious political organization aimed at winning elections without any kind of guiding ideology or real local organization? You can't. These guys, like so many compassless folks in politics, seriously misread the American electorate and recent third party history. Third parties do not work without a guiding ideology, be it left, right, libertarian, statist, whatever. These guys stood for something a thousand times worse than the bitter hyperpartisanship they whined about: a wish-washy just do something attitude towards governance rooted in the pipe dreams of 'radical centrists.'\\" At least one candidate was also critical of the long, complex, and unreliable verification process for delegates.

Reid before he relinquished his appointment in 1902, was a locomotive, the first known locomotive in the world to be designed and built as a Baltic type. G.W. Reid It was built for the NGR by Neilson, Reid and Company who delivered ten of them in 1902, numbered in the range from 1 to 10. In NGR service, they were known as the Neilson, Reid locomotives until a classification system was introduced at some stage between 1904 and 1908 and they were designated the NGR .The Railway Report for year ending 31 Dec. 1908, Natal Government Railways, p. 39, par 14. The NGR Class F was a larger version of the NGR Class H Stephenson-built loco¬≠mo¬≠tive, which Reid had rebuilt from a Class G locomotive in 1896 and which later became the sole Class C2 on the South African Railways (SAR). Many of the main dimensions were identical. They had plate frames, Stephenson valve gear and used saturated steam. South African Railways When the Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, the three Colonial government railways (Cape Government Railways, NGR and Central South African Railways) were united under a single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. Although the South African Railways and Harbours came into existence in 1910, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways were only implemented with effect from 1 January 1912.The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, p. 25. In 1912, these locomotives were designated Class E on the SAR roster and renumbered in the range from 87 to 96. During 1926, their boiler pressure setting was reduced to , which reduced their tractive effort to at 75% of boiler pressure. Service South Africa The locomotives were built specifically for use on the Natal South Coast and the Richmond branch, where reverse running was required due to the absence of turning facilities such as turntables or triangles. In SAR service, the Class E was mainly used for shunting work. First World War In 1915, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, the German South West Africa colony was occupied by the Union Defence Forces. Since a large part of the territory's railway infrastructure and rolling stock was destroyed or damaged by retreating German forces, an urgent need arose for locomotives for use on the Cape gauge lines in that territory. In 1917, numbers 87 and 92 were transferred to the Defence Department for service in South West Africa. Both locomotives are believed to have returned to South Africa after the war.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1947). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, December 1947. p. 1033. The locomotives were later transferred to the Cape Midland System, where they remained for the rest of their service lives. They were withdrawn from service and scrapped in 1937.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974. History City hall circa 1908 Up until 1893, the city of Marquette had no designated City Hall, and was indeed using, rent-free, a building owned by Peter White. However, when White informed the city that their lease had run out, civic pride prodded the government to plan the construction of a new city hall. The city held a special election to allow the issuance of bonds to pay for the building; on receiving an overwhelming approval, they hired local architects Andrew Lovejoy and Edward Demar to design the building. Contractor Emil Bruce constructed the building at a cost of slightly under $50,000. Part of the contract gave preference to locally sourced building material, and the demand for bricks and sandstone was great enough that the local economy was bolstered through the depression that lingered through the early 1890s. The cornerstone was laid in May 1894, and the building was completed later in the year and dedicated in early 1895. The city used the building until 1975, and it was then sold to a private developer who refurbished it into professional offices. Description Old Marquette City Hall in 2016 The Marquette City Hall is a three-story rectangular building, measuring , combining Richardsonian Romanesque, Second Empire, and Renaissance Revival architectural elements. It is constructed of red brick on a raised sandstone foundation, and surmounted by a tiled Mansard roof with a cupola. The front facade is divided by quoins into five bays. The central bay contains a recessed entrance, while the remaining front bays contain two-story arched windows. The remaining sides of the structure contain ribbon windows. Inside, a main hall runs the full depth of the building, with stairs rising to the second floor. The second floor contained a council chamber that rose two stories.

It manages almond orchards in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia, and is also involved in the manufacture of a variety of food snacks and muesli. The company, based in Melbourne, employs around 270 permanently, which peaks up to 500 people seasonally (2015). The business is divided into two divisions: an almond business which owns and manages orchards, including the harvest and initial processing of the crop, and a food business, which processes and markets a range of nut and fruit based products to retailers, distributors and food manufacturers. These are sold under the Lucky, Sunsol, Nu-Vit, Meriram, Soland, Allinga Farms and Renshaw brands.  History  Select Harvests was founded in 1978, its listed predecessors have existed since 1983. The company was formerly known as Defender Limited and Defender Australia Limited. Early Australian almond plantations were first made on the Adelaide Plains in the 19th century. This area was well suited to almond production by virtue of its climate, rainfall, and fertile soils. From here almond plantations spread to southern Adelaide (notably Willunga, South Australia). These areas, however, have been mostly built over following urban expansion. In the 1960s and 1970s the majority of the industry moved from the Willunga area further east, to along the Murray River with the major growing regions being the Riverland, Sunraysia and Riverina districts. These areas were favourable due to cheaper land, water availability for irrigation, and better suited climate for almond growing. This is where Select Harvests primarily now operates its orchards. Total Australian almond acreage has increased five-fold over the past eight years, from approximately 9,000 planted acres in 1999 to 62,000 acres in 2007; of which Select Harvests owns approximately 9,000 acres and leases an additional 4,500 acres.  Orchards  The company orchards are based in Robinvale (Northern Victoria), the Riverina, Hillston, and near Griffith in New South Wales, Paringa, South Australia and Loxton, South Australia. In 2014 the company purchased the Amaroo property in Renmark South Australia, which at the time was the largest independent almond orchard in Australia. In 2008, Select Harvests secured 4,300 acres on the Dandaragan Plateau in Western Australia. In early 2013, Select Harvests decided to exit the Dandaragan Almond project, placing its immature orchards, water rights and associated irrigation infrastructure on market for sale. In December 2015, Select Harvests announced that it would sell its WA orchards and land to an unnamed private Australian business for A$9.5 million after almost A$60 million of write-downs. Despite this, Select Harvest revenue and profits continued to increase. Select Harvests is one of Australia's largest almond exporters and has continued to expand in the fast-growing markets of India and China, as well as established routes to markets in Asia, Europe and the Middle East.  Processing  Select Harvests has significant almond processing capability which is delivered through its two almonds processing plants, both located in Victoria, Australia.  Thomastown  The first plant is located in Thomastown, Victoria. Since 2002 it has also been the location of the Select Harvests head office. The site consists of corporate offices, a production facility, laboratory and warehouse; it employs around 54 permanent staff, and 70‚Äì140 seasonal production staff. The plant annually produces approximately 13,000 metric tonnes of a range of packaged nuts and associated products.  Carina West  The second plant is located in vicinity of Carina West, which has a hulling and shelling capacity of 22,000t (6 months) or 10t per hour at peak. The Carina West plant was commissioned in 2008 at a cost of A$40 million, it also has significant storage, sorting, packing, warehousing and fumigation facilities. Select Harvests produces almond products according to Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, hazard analysis and critical control points, Global Food Safety Initiative (SQF2000), halal and kosher certifications. In 2015, Select Harvests was awarded a A$1.5 million grant towards the construction of a biomass electricity co-generation plant and almond production line at its processing plant in Carina West. The project will install a biomass boiler and steam turbine plant, fuelled by almond and orchard waste products, and converting it to heat and power, with excess fed into the electricity grid. It is estimated to consume 30,000 metric tonnes of almond and orchard waste and reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions for the company by more than 23,500 tonnes.

It was formed from the 6th Mechanized Corps created in 1940 and destroyed in 1941 in the beginning of Operation Barbarossa. The corps was reformed in November 1942 under the same name, but with a different organizational structure. In early 1943, the 6th Mechanized Corps was granted \\"Guards\\" status and became the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps. It was renamed the 5th Guards Mechanized Division in 1945, and subsequently the 5th Guards Motor Rifle Division in 1965.  Creation of 6th Mechanized Corps  The 6th Mechanised Corps was formed on 15 July 1940 at Bialystok in the Western Special Military District. It was attached to the 10th Army in the Bialystok areaDavid Porter, (2009), Soviet Tank Units 1939‚Äì1945, Amber Books, , p.34, and see Glantz, Stumbling Colossus, 120, for map of mechanised corps dispositions on 22 June 1941. and was under the command of Major General Mikhail Khatskilevich when Operation Barbarossa began in June 1941.David Glantz, Before Stalingrad: Barbarossa ‚Äì Hitler's Invasion of Russia 1941, 2003, p32 The Corps initially comprised the 4th and 7th Tank Divisions and the 29th Mechanized Division, as well as several smaller units.David Glantz, Stumbling Colossus, 1998, p 155 and p229 On 22 June 1941, the 6th Mechanized Corps consisted of 32,382 men, 1,131 tanks, 242 armored cars, 162 artillery pieces, 187 mortars, 4,779 vehicles, 294 tractors and 1042 motorcycles. It included light tanks such as the T-26, Bt-7 and Bt-5 and T-28, as well as 201 of the newer T-34 and KV-1 models in the 7th Tank Division and a further 151 in the 4th Tank Division. A report by Major General B.S. Vasil'evich, commander of 7th Tank Division, on 4 August 1941 said that the division had been at 98% enlisted strength and 60-80% officer strength. The division included 348 tanks, of which 51 were KVs and 150 T-34s.Glantz, Stumbling Colossus, 134. However, there was lack of supplies. It possessed only one to one and a half loads of 76 mm ammunition when it entered battle, no armor-piercing ammunition for its tanks, three refills of gasoline, and a single fill of diesel fuel. The fuel ran out quickly, partially due to unclear orders. The division had to move to three new assembly areas within the first two days of the war. The division was soon immobilized south of Grodno in Belarus. Similar to the 4th Mechanized Corps, the 6th Mechanized Corps stood out of the remaining mechanized corps of the Red Army. (the only English translations of Solonin's works seem to be, as of June 2011, these online chapters) On 22 June 1941 it was fully formed, and stationed 100-150 kilometers from the border.  Defeat in Operation Barbarossa  The 6th Mechanized Corps was heavily involved in the first battles with Germans. At 11:40pm on the day of German invasion, Pavlov ordered his Deputy Front Commander Lieutenant General Ivan Boldin to take command over what would be later called Boldin's group. The group's core was the 6th Mechanized Corps and the 6th Cavalry Corps, with 11th Mechanized Corps to be attached soon. Boldin's group first and last mission was against German armored forces of Hoth's 3rd Panzergruppe advancing at the vulnerable boundary line between Soviet Northwestern Front and Soviet Western Front at Merkinƒó. It is considered part of the larger Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk. KV-1 is inspected by German Troops in Russia in 1941 Historian David Glantz stated that the tank divisions of 6th Mechanized Corps on 24 June 1941 were inferior against the advancing German units often without infantry support and were relentlessly pounded by the German aircraft of the Luftflotte 2. Without adequate ammunition and with many tanks in a state of disrepair and sent to several different locations without fuel reserves, they were quickly immobilized.David Glantz, Stumbling Colossus, 1998, p 130Paul Carell, Hitler Moves East, 1971 p 70-71 A report from the Western Front on 27 June noted that 6th Mechanized Corps had lost 20‚Äì26% of its tank strength in its 4th and 7th tank Divisions. Solonin states that the only battle that 6th Mechanized Corps saw was an attack of 24 June, when it lost 2% of tanks.18 tanks of 7th Tank Division lost during an unsuccessful attack against either German 162nd or 256th Infantry Division; Solonin 2007 p. 144 The corps dissipated soon without any other combat, with negligible losses to aircraft, and with distance traveled that hardly necessitated any fuel tanking or repairs. The corps dispersed on 27 June near Krynki, with the personnel retreating east in small groups, and the equipment being abandoned or destroyed en masse. Communication with the headquarters of Boldin was lost and Major General Khatskilevich was killed on 25 June 1941. Hoth's panzers had reached Vilnius on the 23rd of June, then Grodno, and finally Minsk by 26 June. By 25 June 1941 General Heinz Guderian's 2nd Panzergruppe reached Slonim and Vawkavysk and cut off the retreat of the greater part of the 10th and 3rd Armies at Bia≈Çystok encirclement. The Soviet armies could not retreat across the Shchara River because Luftflotte 2 had destroyed the bridges. Guderian's \\"pincer\\" reached Minsk on the 27th June trapping the greater part of 13th and 4th Armies in another encirclement west of the city. The 6th Mechanized Corps was destroyed in the Bia≈Çystok encirclement. It was formally dissolved in late July 1941.David Glantz, Before Stalingrad Barbarossa ‚Äì Hitler's Invasion of Russia 1941, 2003, p32-p35  Second Formation  The idea of mechanized corps were revived in the spring of 1942. The second formation of 6th Mechanized Corps was assembled in November 1942. On the basis of Headquarters' 14th Tank Corps, the 6th Mechanized Corps was reformed on Nov. 26, 1942 at the station Kostereva in accordance with NKO directive number 11905907ss and GABTU number 1105723 dated November 26, 1942. Major General of Armored Forces Semyon Ilyich Bogdanov was appointed the commander of the 6th Mechanized Corps. On December 18, 1942, 6th Mechanized Corps was assigned to the 2nd Guards Army of the Southern Front, where it was involved in stopping the onset of Operation Winter Storm. The Manstein's attempted breakthrough to the Sixth Army stationed in Stalingrad. On January 8, 1943, the Corps ‚Äì participating in the counterattack ‚Äì captured the Zimovniki station (Rostov Oblast), a vital point of the Luftwaffe's munitions supply chain. For this reason the Corps was given the honorific Zimovnikovsky. Soon it was raised to the elite \\"Guards\\" status; thus it became the 5th Zimovnikovsky Guards Mechanised Corps. The Corps participated in the Battle of Kursk, as a part of 5th Guards Tank Army. On 1 August 1943, it comprised the 10th, 11th and 12th Guards Mechanised Brigades, 24th Guards Tank Brigade, and smaller supporting units. Alongside other units, it fought in the southern part of salient against the elite 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf and drove them out of Belgorod. In 1944, the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps took part in the elimination of the Korsun-Cherkasy Pocket. Later in 1944 the 5th Zimovnikovsky Guards Mechanized Corps fought in Moravia and Upper Silesia. As part of the 4th Guards Tank Army it crossed the Oder and Neisse. At the end of April 1945, it took part in the Battle of Berlin. After taking Berlin, the Corps was engaged from 6 to 11 May 1945 in the Prague Offensive. On May 8, 1945, the 10th Mechanized Brigade of the Corps was the first to enter the Czech capital, for which the unit received the Prague honorific.  Postwar  After the war, on 10 June 1945, the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps became the 5th Guards Mechanised Division. On 25 June 1957 it was renamed 53rd Guards Motor Rifle Division.Michael Holm, 5th Guards Zimovnikovskaya Red Banner order of Kutuzov Motorised Rifle Division imeni 60th Anniversary SSSR, 2015. On 11 January 1965, it became the 5th Guards Motor Rifle Division. On 17 December 1982 it was named \\"The 60th anniversary of the USSR\\". On 28 June 1945, the division was awarded the Order of Kutuzov of II degree. In 1946 the division relocated to the Turkestan Military District. From the time of its reassignment to the 53rd Guards MRD, it was based at Kushka, Mary Oblast in the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic. The division had the Military Unit Number (V/Ch) 11904 until the invasion of Afghanistan (December, 1979) upon which the V/Ch changed to 51852.Holm  Afghanistan War  On the night of 27 December, from Kushka, the 5th GMRD entered Afghanistan bound for Herat and Shindand. A battalion of the 56th Guards Air Assault Brigade had taken control of the Rabat Mirza pass on 26 December, between Kushkov and Herat.Source for this section is Site Veteran 5 Zimovnikovskoy Guards Red Banner ordena Kutuzov II degree Cavalry Division Name the 60th anniversary of the USSR. On December 26 at 7:20pm, the Commander of the 5th GMRD, Major-General Yuri Shatalin, gave orders to cross the Afghanistan border. The division was pulled out of the Kushka, Tahta-Bazaar, and Iolotan. At a set time one of the 5th GMRD units came out at the juncture near the towns: - Herat, Shindand, Kandahar, the division headquarters was located under the Shindand. The first casualties amounted to 2 people. The division commander, and future Commander in Chief of the Russian Internal Troops, Colonel-General Yuri Shatalin recalls: > \\"It happened at dawn on December 27th. Surprised: 5:00 am, and the streets > full of people with flowers. It turned out, meet the shuravi, as we were > called, the Soviet soldiers. A similar meeting was warm and in other towns > and villages in the north of Afghanistan.\\" At the beginning of 1980, the 5th GMRD began to participate in raids against the Afghan Mujahideen. During the period of the Afghan war, the division participated in 156 scheduled and unscheduled operations. On 1 March 1980 the division was reorganized. The 373rd Guards Red Banner Order of Kutuzov and Bogdan Khmelnitsky Motor Rifle Regiment, had formed part of the division on its arrival in the country. It had been stationed in Adraskan. On 1 March 1980, the regiment was reorganized as the 70th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, by reorganizing the staffing structure of departments and integrating the 2nd Battalion of the 56th Guards Air Assault Brigade. After the reorganization the brigade was relocated to the city of Kandahar. From 1980 to 1982 the division was commanded by the future commander of the famous 40th Combined Arms Army General Boris Gromov. In March 1985 the 12th Guards Motorized Rifle Regiment arrived from Kaliningrad and joined the division. On February 15, 1989, the last units of the 40th Combined Arms Army, along with Gromov, left Afghanistan to the west. Withdrawal was carried out by two methods: by air (5,142 people) and land (6,986 people). 10 colonies from 4 garrisons were withdrawn (Shindand, Adraskan, Herat, Turgundi). During the Afghan war, four soldiers from the division were awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union, and 12,825 in total were awarded orders and medals. From May 1988 the division, under the Geneva conventions, prepared to withdraw from Afghanistan. The withdrawal of the 5th GMRD began as scheduled on 29 January 1989, and ended 15 February 1989. The division was relocated permanently to the city of Kushka. Total number of killed in the division from 27 December 1979 to 15 February 1989 was 1135 (910 of them in combat). The division was absorbed into the 88th Motor Rifle Division in March 1989.

It is a large shrub to small tree with papery bark, lance-shaped leaves and sweet- smelling, creamy-coloured flowers in summer. It grows in near-coastal forest and swamps in New South Wales and Queensland. Description Melaleuca decora has brown or whitish papery bark and grows to the height of a small tree, usually to but exceptional specimens may exceed in height. The leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide, flat, narrow elliptic in shape and tapering to a point. The flowers are cream-coloured or white, arranged in spikes on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering, sometimes on the sides of the branches. The spikes are up to in diameter, long and have between 3 and 30 groups of flowers, usually in threes. The petals are roughly egg-shaped long and fall off as the flower ages. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers with 20 to 40 stamens in each bundle. The main flowering season is from November to January and is followed by fruit that are woody capsules long, well spaced along the stems. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1796 by Richard Anthony Salisbury, who named it Metrosideros decora. The reason he chose the specific epithet (decora) was not explained, but it is from the Latin decorus meaning \\"becoming\\", \\"fitting\\" or \\"beautiful\\". In 1916, James Britten moved it to the genus Melaleuca as Melaleuca decora. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca decora occurs in Queensland south from the Burnett River district and in New South Wales north from the Shoalhaven River growing in sand and heavy soils in open forest and swamps in coastal districts. Use in horticulture Melaleuca decora is a hardy plant that can be grown in a range of soil types, but needs plenty of water and will tolerate poorly drained sites. It is a useful screening plant and flowers profusely.

They are of unknown origin but are believed to date from the Middle Ages. A variety of purposes have been theorized, including that they were used as escape routes or hiding places, but the most prominent theory is that they served a religious or spiritual purpose. Etymology There are very few historic references ‚Äì a document from 1449 names the area above the tunnels as \\"auf den erdstelln\\". Although the modern term uses \\"Stall\\" (stable, shed) it is in fact related to \\"Stelle\\" (spot, location ‚Äì cognate to English \\"stead\\") along with \\"Erde\\" (soil, ground ‚Äì cognate to English \\"earth\\"). The German \\"Stollen\\" (tunnel in mining) has the same origin. Alternative regional names are \\"Schratzlloch\\" (Bavaria), \\"Zwergloch\\" and \\"Grufen\\" (Austria) that carry the regional names for dwarfs that folk belief has connected them to. Construction The erdstall tunnels are very low and narrow ‚Äì they have a height of and a maximum width of about . Additionally they feature very tight passages from one tunnel to a lower tunnel called \\"Schlupf\\" (slip out) that is too narrow for older or overweight persons ‚Äì a person needs to crawl under the slip hole, stand up thereby sliding the shoulders through the skin-tight hole, allowing to crawl onto the higher tunnel. Erdstall tunnels have only one narrow concealed entry point ‚Äì so there is no second exit tunnel as with an escape tunnel system. Some tunnel systems feature loop tunnels at the end of a tunnel. Most tunnel systems are not longer than .

In: Der Erdstall. Nr. 26. Roding 2000, S.54-56. *Type A has a single long gallery with slip passages and short side slopes. *Type B has multiple levels connected at multiple places by vertical slip passages. Auxiliary construction tunnels have been found that were closed after completion. At the end of each tunnel, seating niches have been cut out or the tunnel is widened with a longer seating bench. *Type C has multiple horizontal slip passages and there is a round trip tunnel at the end or in the middle that is high enough to walk through upright.. *Type D has multiple chambers that are connected through tunnels. The slip passages are mostly horizontal in this type. Archaeology There is almost no archaeological material to be found in the tunnels although erdstall tunnels exist in abundance in Central Europe (over 700 in Bavaria alone). This makes it highly unlikely that they were ever used as dwellings, such as a hiding place in times of war. The archaeological evidence is so slim that even age determination is difficult. Coal from a fire pit at Bad Zell has been dated between 1030 and 1210. Coal from a heading in H√∂cherlm√ºhle has been dated between the late 10th and mid-11th century. A slip passage at Rot am See has been enhanced with stones to make it narrower with the stone additions dated to between 1034 and 1268. Coal from Trebersdorf was dated 950 to 1050, coal from K√ºhlried was dated to 950 to 1160. Ceramics found in St. Agatha have been dated to the 12th century which seems to be the latest date of usage.

The main use is to control the growth of microorganisms on the dentures, especially Candida albicans, thereby preventing denture-related stomatitis. When dentures are worn in the mouth, a biofilm develops which may be similar to dental plaque. It may become hardened and mineralized as dental calculus. Denture cleansers are also used to remove stains and other debris that may be caused by diet, tobacco use, drinking coffee, drinking tea, etc. Some chemical denture cleaners can come in cream and liquid format. Others come in powder, paste, or tablet format. Some chemical denture cleaners are effervescent and others are not. There are also mechanical denture cleaners such as denture brushes and ultrasonic denture cleaners that use ultrasonic cleaning, some coupled with ultraviolet light.  Ingredients  Dilute sodium hypochlorite (i.e. a mild bleach) is the main constituent of several brands of denture cleanser. Other ingredients include such chemicals as: * sodium bicarbonate ‚Äì or baking soda, which alkalizes the water, cleaning the dentures * citric acid ‚Äì removes stains * sodium perborate * sodium polyphosphate * potassium monopersulfate ‚Äì cleaning and bleaching agent * EDTA Example commercial brands * Dentural (sodium hypochlorite solution) * Milton (sodium hypochlorite solution) * Mildent (sodium hypochlorite solution) * Steradent (alkaline peroxides) * Polident * Renew Denture Cleaner * Efferdent * Novadent  History  Dentures have been cleaned using water or mixtures of water/vinegar, water/lemon juice, water/baking soda for many years. In the 1930s, Alexander Block developed the Polident brand of denture cleaner at the Block Drug Company. Others have followed such as Warner-Lambert's introduction of Efferdent denture cleanser tablets in 1966 and Renew denture cleaner powder in 1986 by Mid-Continental Dental Supply Co. Ltd. Over time, orthodontic and sport dental appliance cleaners have also emerged on the market such as Renew Ortho & Sport with formulations that account for thermoplastics and a younger demographic of patients.  Clinical trials and evidence  Studies have found an association between denture stomatitis, colonization of yeasts and denture cleanliness . Another study found that immersing dentures in 0.5% NaOCl solution for 3 minutes only can be an effective synergic for denture cleaning in reducing the number of microorganism without affecting the denture colour or surface roughness , and when compared to alkaline peroxides, NaOCl was more efficient . Some clinicians recommended that the time of immersion, and the concentration of the NaOCl should be well considered so as not to degrade the acrylic resin of the denture.

It dates back to 330 BC, when Alexander the Great and his army arrived to what is now Afghanistan after the Battle of Gaugamela. Many empires have used it as a headquarters in the last 2,000 years, and was destroyed and rebuilt many times over the centuries. This historic citadel was saved from demolition in the 1950s, and was excavated and restored by UNESCO between 1976 and 1979. From decades of wars and neglect, the citadel began to crumble but in recent years several international organizations decided to completely rebuild it. The National Museum of Herat is also housed inside the citadel, while the Afghan Ministry of Information and Culture is the caretaker of the whole premises. History Herat, in the fertile valley of Hari River (Hari Rud), was settled as early as the sixth century BC. A mound located to the north of the Old City, known as Kuhandazh may have been the site of the fort that Alexander the Great built in 330 BC following his conquest of the Achaemenid city known as Artacoana or Aria. After the depart of Alexander, Herat was ruled by the Seleucids, Parthians, Kushans, Sasanians, Hephthalites, Umayyads, Tahirids, Saffarids, Samanids, Seljuk, Ghaznavids, and Ghurids. An 1879 painting of Herat, the citadel is visible. Located half a kilometer to the south of Kuhandaz and aligned with the cardinal axes, the walled city described by early Arab geographers had four gates leading into crossing commercial avenues and a square citadel (qal'a) adjoining the northern city wall. This citadel, which has been suggested as another possible site for Alexander's fort, is known today as the famous Citadel of Herat. Herat thrived with the Silk Road trade from the Levant to India and China, and became an important city of the Ghurid dynasty in 1175. The city was destroyed entirely in 1221 by the Mongol army and rebuilt by the Kartid governors who established their rule based in Herat by the mid-thirteenth century. Kartid Amir Fakhr al- Din (reg. 1295-1308) in 1299/1300 reinforced the citadel's towers, walls, ramparts and moat, and added a walled maidan to its west to serve as an open- air mosque (idgah). His successor Ghiyath al-Din (reg. 1308-1329) built two palaces inside the citadel to the east. The name Ikhtiyar al-Din, which refers to both the eastern and western enclosures, is thought to be the name or epithet of a Kartid amir or military commander. Destroyed a second time by Timur's army (1380), the citadel was rebuilt after Shah Rukh (reg. 1405-1444) moved his capital to Herat and began a building campaign. He reinforced the citadel in stone and fired brick and covered its exterior with glazed tiles. The citadel was used as a royal residence, treasury, prison and arsenal under the Hotaki dynasty/Durrani Empire in the 18th century. It suffered some damage during the Anglo-Afghan War in the 19th century. A modern citadel (Arg-e Herat) was built immediately to its north in the mid-19th century to take over its defensive function. The citadel was saved from demolition in the 1950s, and was excavated and restored by UNESCO between 1976 and 1979. It suffered more damages during the last decades of wars and neglect. Recent restoration A pathway inside the citadel in 2011 The citadel of Herat was completely renovated between 2006 and 2011. It consists of two walled enclosures. The latest restoration involved hundreds of Afghan craftsmen and funds from the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and about $2.4 million from the U.S. and German governments. The older compound to the east, found filled with debris, was partially excavated to reveal two courtyard structures. It has a roughly rectangular plan measuring about eighteen by forty-two meters, and it is protected with thirteen semi-circular towers, including two flanking a west-facing gate. It is also known as the Upper Citadel, based on its elevated site, and is built of fired bricks. The museum inside the citadel The Kartid addition to the west, known as the Lower Citadel, has lower walls of baked brick and includes Timurid period military structures. Its polygonal plan measures about twenty-five by sixty meters with nine circular towers, of which six survive along the south and west walls. The tall Malik Tower on its western wall is thought to be named after a Kartid malik and retains segments of its Timurid glazed tile decoration, including parts of a Kufic inscriptive band. An Ethnographic Museum, a Military Museum, Handicraft Workshops and an Archaeological Museum were set up inside the Lower Citadel after the 1970s restoration, while the Upper Citadel was opened to visitors as an Open Air Archaeological Museum, with a northern section reconstructed as a traditional residence. About 1,100 items from the Herat region are stored inside the museum at the citadel, of which 250 are on display currently.Restored citadel is symbol of hope in Afghanistan. Deb Riechmann.

The radar was a development of FuMG 80 Freya and was operated during World War II for long range detection. It was developed under the direction of Theodor Schultes, beginning in 1942. Wasserman was based on largely unchanged Freya electronics, but used an entirely new antenna array in order to improve range, height- finding and bearing precision.  Development  Wassermann L with steel lattice mast Seven different versions were developed. The two most important versions are: * The radio measurement equipment FuMG.41 Wassermann L (German: Leicht = light) was a constellation of four Freya antennas on top of each other, mounted on a rotatable steel lattice mast. * A later version was the FuMG.42 Wassermann S (German: Schwer = heavy). For this eight Freya antenna arrays were mounted on a pipe mast in two columns, each four antennae high. The combination of the antennae in this way resulted in a concentration of the radiated energy to a smaller beam, thus resulting in a higher radiated power in the main direction (Effective Radiated Power = ERP), without increasing the transmitter power. The result was a longer range. With the L-version the horizontal opening angle of the antenna array remained the same, but the vertical opening angle was reduced (so flatter radiation pattern). Because the horizontal opening angle was not changed, the bearing measuring performance was not changed. With the S-version also the horizontal opening angle was reduced, with a better bearing resolution as a result.

According to witnesses, the assailants were a group of 18 young Uyghur men who opposed the local government's campaign against the burqa, which had grown popular among older Hotan women in 2009 but were also used in a series of violent crimes. The men occupied a police station on Nuerbage Street at noon, killing two security guards with knives and bombs and taking eight hostages. The attackers then yelled religious slogans, including ones associated with Jihadism, as they replaced the Chinese flag on top of a police station with another flag, the identity of which is disputed. After a firefight with police around 1:30 p.m., 14 of the attackers were killed, and four were captured. Six of the hostages were rescued alive, while two were killed in the attack. Local and national governments said the attack was organized terrorism motivated by religious extremism, and found that two of the attackers have links to the militant East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM). A team from China's counter-terrorism office was sent to Hotan to investigate the attack. ETIM acknowledged responsibility for the attack on September 8, as well as for the attacks in Kashgar later that same July. Six men were handed prison or death sentences for their involvement in both attacks later in September. Background Hotan is a city of 360,000 people, 96% Uyghur and 3% Han, in Hotan Prefecture, China. Hotan Prefecture is a predominantly agricultural county and the poorest in Xinjiang, so it is a frequent source of migrant workers to wealthier Xinjiang cities like √úr√ºmqi. Uyghurs tend to have less wealth than their Han counterparts; as a result, many Uyghurs are unemployed and subsist on Chinese social welfare benefits. The city receives few domestic tourists because of terrorism fears, but southern Xinjiang officials are trying to integrate the region into the international economy by creating a special economic zone in nearby Kashgar. Hotan had recently celebrated the opening of the city's first passenger-train service in June. Xinjiang has been experiencing an Islamic revival, manifest in decreased alcohol consumption and increased beard length in Hotan. Most visibly, since the July 2009 √úr√ºmqi riots, many religious Hotan women of an older age began to wear a long face-concealing Islamic garment, which is more similar to the uniform of the female Chechen suicide bomber than to traditional Uyghur attire. Authorities became concerned with the fashion trend after a spate of murders and robberies outside Hotan where the perpetrators wore face-concealing veils, so they ineffectively campaigned to discourage women from wearing the veils, using slogans such as \\"show off your pretty looks and let your beautiful long hair fly\\". Uyghur terrorist attacks usually take the form of IEDs and vehicle-borne bombs in heavily-policed areas. Compared to the 1990s, such bombings from 2000 onward have tended to claim civilian as well as traditional police and bureaucratic targets. Attack According to a subsequent investigation, a group of 18 anti-government religious extremists arrived in Hotan from Kashgar on July 16, two days before the attack; they brought \\"several dozen different knives including cleavers, axes and switchblades\\" with them. The men, Uyghurs between the age of 20 and 35, prepared for the attack at the local bazaar, buying materials to create explosives. The attack was executed on July 18, around the Iktar Grand Bazaar in the center of Hotan, when the group entered a government building and took several hostages. According to witnesses, the men approached the gates of the Nuerbage (Naarburg) Street police station around noon with weapons concealed in cardboard boxes, stabbing a Uyghur security guard to death when they got close enough. The guard, Memet Eli, was 25 years old and engaged to be married in September. After killing Eli, the men shouted slogans in Uyghur denouncing the government's campaign against the Islamic veil, in what onlookers described as Kashgar and Aksu accents. Variously described as \\"terrorists\\", \\"rioters\\", or \\"thugs\\" in accounts, the men proceeded to storm the police building wielding molotov cocktails, knives, and grenades. Shouting jihadist slogans such as \\"Allah is the only god!\\" and \\"Holy war!\\" they broke into the police station, wherein they took police hostages, smashed computer hardware and furniture, and set fires. Two Uyghur women submitting forms inside the police office were trapped inside a smoky room before being rescued through the windows by street vendors. The men proceeded to take down the Chinese flag atop the police station to put up another flag, with conflicting reports about the new flag's design. The government says the flag was black with white Arabic lettering: the Black Standard commonly known as the \\"black flag of jihad\\". Residents interviewed by the Financial Times say it was the \\"blue half-moon flag\\" used by Xinjiang independence advocates, while a resident quoted in the South China Morning Post said it was black with a crescent. Nuerbage police station chief Abulaiti Maitiniyazi (Ablet Metniyaz) was a witness to the attack. He recalled shouting to the men in Uyghur for a peaceful settlement, but receiving molotov cocktails and rocks in return. A Han People's Armed Police paramilitary officer was killed by a molotov cocktail when his squad was forcibly entering the ground level. According to Maitiniyazi, it was when the attackers hacked at the civilian hostages' faces, noses and ears with knives with intent to kill that police fatally shot 14 of the assailants and captured the other four for questioning, ending the attack within 90 minutes of the initial break-in. Six of the eight hostages were rescued alive, while two Han women hostages were hacked to death during the operation, and four Uyghurs were hospitalized for non-life-threatening injuries. Reaction The Xinjiang regional government called the incident an organized, \\"long-planned\\" \\"terrorist attack\\", and a team from China's national counter-terrorism office was sent to Hotan to investigate the causes of the violence. Media called it \\"one of the most serious eruptions of violence\\" since the July 2009 √úr√ºmqi riots. An expert at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations said that the attack aimed to create fear in the public. On July 19, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Public Security announced that two of the 18 attackers had links to ETIM. Citing the deaths of Uyghur civilians in the attack, a government spokesperson said that the attack was apparently not ethnically motivated. But the environment in the city after the attack bore signs of ethnic tension. Many Han residents of the city feared for their lives, recalling a spate recent violent crimes against Han people by Uyghurs in Hotan. Many businesses owned by Han shut down, and both local and visiting Han are said to have \\"almost disappeared in the Uygur- dominated areas\\". On August 13, the elite counterterrorist Snow Leopard Commando Unit was deployed to Hotan and Kashgar to secure the cities ahead of the China-Eurasia Expo in September. The anti-China pro-Uyghur independence World Uyghur Congress (WUC) in Germany claimed that the attack was preceded by the violent suppression of a peaceful protest two hours earlier. However, the Financial Times interviewed local Han and Uyghur residents, and none of them had any knowledge of a demonstration before the attack. A local government spokesperson also denied that there was a mass protest before the attack. WUC spokesperson Dilxadi Rexiti (, also known as Dilxat Raxi) accused the authorities of lying, rhetorically asking \\"If the attack was premeditated, why didn't the police take precautions\\". Several Indian security analysts claimed that Pakistani-based terror groups were linked to the attack. Both the director of the Institute of Central Asia at the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences and Chinese counter-terrorist expert Li Wei alluded to the influence of foreign terrorist organizations in the attack without mentioning any specific country, which the Times of India claimed referred to Pakistan. However, the Chinese government, which has good relations with Pakistan, and the WUC, did not give any remarks on the alleged connection to terrorists based in Pakistan. On September 8, the US-based terrorist monitoring group SITE reported on a video made by ETIM leader Abdul Shakoor Damla claiming responsibility for the July Hotan and Kashgar attacks on behalf of his group. On September 14, the Xinjiang Legal Daily reported that six men were tried for their involvement in the Hotan and Kashgar attacks. Four were given death sentences, and two were given 19-year jail terms, for charges including \\"leading and organizing a terror group, manufacturing illegal explosives, intentional homicide, [and] arson\\". Xinjiang authorities have unveiled a package of policy responses to the attacks to placate Muslim Uyghurs, which include increasing quotas for Uyghur participation in local government and increasing government subsidies for religious schools.

The United States Department of State added Gaziyev to its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists on 29 September 2015. Rebel activity Gaziyev was born on 11 November 1965 in the small village of Pozh-Poroy in the mountainous Itum-Kale district of the former Chechen‚ÄìIngush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. During the Second Chechen War, Gaziyev held a number of top military positions in Chechnya's armed underground resistance, commanding a squad of several dozen militants that operated mainly in the Achkoi-Martan district. Officially wanted by federal authorities since 14 May 2004, Gaziyev has established his rebel credentials by carrying out an array of attacks on Russian security forces and local pro-Moscow authorities, including: *The murder of the Chairman of the Council of Elders of the Itum-Kale district in the village of Abugroi. *An attack on both a school building and the house of the school's head of administration in the village of Gukhoy in the Itum-Kale district; the administration head's nephew was killed and four policemen were wounded in the attack. *Leading twenty militants in an assault on the village of Alkhazurovo which killed four police officers and one soldier on 19 March 2008. *A series of armed raids in several villages within the Achkoi-Martan and Urus-Martan districts on 20‚Äì21 April 2008. Virtually every insurgent operation conducted in the Itum-Kale district from 2002‚Äì2011, as well as all operations undertaken in the Achkoi-Martan district from 2007-2011 are alleged to be attributable to Gaziyev; altogether, he has led sub-units on dozens of missions in the past decade. He was said to be held in great respect by fellow fighters for his courage, military skills and depth of faith. Gaziyev was named commander of the Southwest Front of the Armed Forces of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria by rebel leader Dokka Umarov on 24 September 2006, and was later appointed head of the National Security Service at the beginning of March 2007. Following the formation of the Caucasus Emirate in the fall of 2007, the entity was renamed \\"Raisa Mukhabarat\\" (security service), and Gaziyev retained his post; however, Umarov revoked Gaziyev's title following a summer 2010 leadership dispute. Split with Dokka Umarov The first public disagreement between Gaziyev and Umarov occurred in 2008 when Gaziyev refused to carry out an order to assassinate respected Chechen commander and Islamic scholar Arbi Yovmirzaev (Emir Mansur), who had publicly condemned Umarov's pronouncement of the Caucasus Emirate. Later, in September 2010, Gaziyev appeared on video alongside fellow field commanders Khuseyn Gakayev and Aslambek Vadalov; in the clip, they denounced Umarov and declared Gakayev the leader of the re-organized Chechen resistance. The genesis of the dispute was over the precise vision of an independent state in the North Caucasus as well as Umarov's allegedly autocratic leadership style; in siding with Gakayev and Vadalov, as well as the Saudi-born Muhannad (whom Umarov would accuse of fomenting dissent within the insurgency ranks in tandem with Gaziyev), Gaziyev had \\"opted for moderate radicals with views closer to traditional Chechen nationalists.\\" The fact that Gaziyev had sided with the Chechen nationalists was considered a huge blow to Umarov's power and credibility; numerous middle- and lower-ranking militant leaders departed with the four veteran field commanders, putting Umarov in an increasingly isolated position. In response, Umarov stripped Gakayev, Vadalov, Gaziyev, and Muhannad of their titles and appointments. A July 2011 Sharia Court proceeding about the discord conducted by the Caucasus Emirate in Chechnya would lead to a ruling in favor of Umarov; as a result of the trial, numerous Chechen commanders who withdrew their oaths of allegiance to him instead re-affirmed their loyalty to the Emir of the Caucasus Emirate. Among them were Gakayev and Vadalov, but apparently not Gaziyev. In video statements released in October 2010, Gakayev, Vadalov and Gaziyev explained their motives for breaking away from Umarov, with Gaziyev noting that \\"there is no one who has been at his side longer than we have, or who knows him better than we do.... We thought about this for a long time, we prayed to Allah so as not to destroy the accord among fighters.\\" Gaziyev would also define the goals of the Chechen nationalists as \\"cleansing our country of the enemies of Allah, establishing Sharia law to defend the poor and disadvantaged, and bringing up our future generation in the Muslim faith.\\" On 23 July 2011, the rebel website Kavkaz Center stated that a ruling by the Caucasus Emirate's Sharia Court had resolved the nearly year-long dispute between the transnational Islamists led by Umarov and a significant segment of the more localized, traditional anti-Russian Chechen irredentists led by Gakayev. Following the month-long court proceedings, Umarov re-appointed Gakayev his naib (deputy) in the eastern sector of Chechnya, while Vadalov and \\"a number\\" of Chechen field commanders who had earlier renounced their bayat (allegiance) instead renewed their loyalty to Umarov. Noticeably absent from the gathering was Gaziyev, and an appeal from Umarov to \\"mujaheds in the North Caucasus and Chechnya...to put behind [you] all the disagreements that existed between us and direct all your strength, all your will toward elevating the word of Allah and [against] our enemy the unbelievers,\\" implied that some Chechen fighters, possibly including Gaziyev and the men he commands, still refuse to acknowledge Umarov's title of supreme commander. In naming Aslan Byutukaev (Emir Khamzat) commander of the western sector of Chechnya, Umarov also abolished the southwestern front previously run by Gaziyev until his dismissal in the fall of 2010, further evidence that Gaziyev is not presently a part of the reconciliation. On 23 April 2012, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty speculated that the most logical reason for Gazyiev's absence from the meeting was that his fighters staged 14 or 15 attacks in the uplands southwest of Grozny between mid-April and late-June 2011. Gazyiev gave an interview with the Chechen service of Radio Liberty in mid 2014, where he confirmed rumours that he had left Chechnya, however he expressed a desire to return to Chechnya's mountains. In October 2016, Gaziyev was reportedly arrested in Turkey.

The album marked the returns of the original front man Mark Olson, who had left the group in 1995 after the release of Tomorrow the Green Grass, and long-time keyboard player Karen Grotberg. Mockingbird Time was the first new studio album by The Jayhawks since 2003's Rainy Day Music. The album entered the Billboard 200 album chart at #38, becoming the highest-charting release of their career to date. It also charted at #2 on Billboard's Folk Albums chart, #6 on the Tastemaker Albums chart, and #11 on the Rock Albums chart. History In late 1995, founding member Mark Olson abruptly left The Jayhawks, in order to spend more time with wife Victoria Williams.Rolling Stone Editors. The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll: Revised and Updated for the 21st Century. New York: Fireside, 2001. With Gary Louris assuming principal singing and songwriting responsibilities, the band released three further albums‚ÄîSound of Lies in 1997, Smile in 1999, and Rainy Day Music in 2003‚Äîbefore recessing indefinitely. Louris and Olson first began speaking to each other again in 2001, when they were requested to pen a track for the 2002 film The Rookie. In the group's time off, the two reunited as an acoustic duo, touring, writing, and recording together sporadically from 2005 to 2009. They released the acoustic album Ready for the Flood in 2009. According to Louris, the two were billed as \\"'Mark and Gary from the Jayhawks,' and people would always ask us, 'When is the band getting back together?'\\" The two revived the Tomorrow the Green Grass-lineup of The Jayhawks, consisting of original bassist Marc Perlman, drummer Tim O'Reagan, and keyboardist Karen Grotberg, for two festival dates in Spain. According to O'Reagan, playing together again for the first time in 14 years \\"was like riding a bike for all of us.\\" Afterwards the band began touring again. Both Olson and Louris later said that recording the album was a negative experience and Olson left the band once again after the tour promoting the album. Olson complained about money and the songwriting credits on the album and Louris called it \\"a fiasco [that] left a bad taste in my mouth.\\" Recording As the group's activity began increasing, Louris claimed he and Olson felt there was \\"some business left undone.\\" The members decided to record a new studio album, which Olson described as \\"a natural thing\\" to do. Louris and Olson penned the songs for Mockingbird Time in Louris' apartment in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Olson's residence in Joshua Tree, California, and Olson's sister's cabin in the woods of northern Minnesota. The album was recorded at Terrarium Studios in Minneapolis with Gary Louris assuming role of producer. Reception In his review for Allmusic, critic Mark Deming praised the album and called it \\"easily the group's strongest and most cleanly focused album since their 1992 masterpiece Hollywood Town Hall.\\" and \\"a simple but richly rewarding example of what the Jayhawks do better than anyone, and serves as a potent reminder that they're one of the finest American bands of their time.\\" Spin reviewer Nate Cavalieri wrote, \\"Ignore the mouth-breathing rock bangers, and Mockingbird is as comfortable as well-worn denim.\\" Songs The first single from the album, \\"She Walks In So Many Ways,\\" was released on July 25, 2011.

He was granted the rank of Pilot Officer in October 1939 and Flying Officer in July 1940. Battle of Britain 41 Sqn joined the Battle of Britain in August 1940. On 8 August Wallens claimed 2 Bf 109s destroyed, and one shared destroyed. He shared a Ju 88 on 11 August. On 5 September 1940 Wallens was shot down by a Messerschmitt Me 109 of JG 54 and seriously wounded in action over the Thames Estuary. Wallens's flight was ordered to make a head-on attack on a large formation of Dornier 17 bombers with 50 plus Bf 109 escorts over Gravesend. Wallens considered the head-on assault \\"a desperate manoeuvre that could age one very prematurely\\". Within seconds ‚ÄòB‚Äô Flight's six Spitfires were overwhelmed. Two collided and were lost; another was shot up with the pilot bailing out. Wallens broke away. Seeing two Bf 109‚Äôs below him he dived and destroyed one. He was lining up the second in his sights when he was attacked from above: > The din was indescribable as the Bf 109's cannon and machine-gun fire tore > great chunks out of my wings and blasted the cockpit. With his leg shattered by a shell, Wallens tried to bail out but his canopy had jammed. He crash-landed four miles from his base at Hornchurch, smashing through a fence and hurdling a ditch before coming to rest in a hayfield. He found that one bullet had removed his helmet's right radio earphone and another the face from his wristwatch. Wallens had five confirmed kills to his credit before he was shot down. Wallens was hospitalised until April 1941. During his prolonged convalescence at the RAF Rehabilitation Unit, Torquay, Wallens was much assisted by Dan Maskell, later known as a BBC tennis commentator, who ran the gymnasium. Wallens returned to 41 Squadron in April 1943 but ordered to undertake further convalescence; he was posted on promotion to Flight Lieutenant in July 1943 to No 1 Aircraft Delivery Flight at RAF Hendon, a squadron he went on to command in 1943. Air Sea Rescue Wallens was classified \\"Unfit for operational flying\\" in 1943 he was posted to No. 277 Air Sea Rescue Squadron at RAF Hawkinge, Kent. He assumed command of the squadron in 1944. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in July 1944. The citation read: > In the early phases of the war, Squadron Leader Wallens took part in a large > number of sorties during which he destroyed at least 4 enemy aircraft. In > combat in September, 1940, he was wounded in the leg by a cannon shell. > Since his return to operational duties he has undertaken many air/sea rescue > sorties and has been responsible for saving a number of personnel from the > sea. He has set a splendid example of gallantry and devotion to duty. In October 1946, Wallens transferred to the Administrative and Special Duties Branch. He left the RAF in 1949. Post war After the war he worked in the motor trade and ran pubs and hotels. In 1990, Wallens published his autobiography Flying Made My Arms Ache. It contains an evocative account of the Battle of Britain. > (The day) started off well, but was to end in a terrible shambles. I was > petrified but had to grin, six Spitfires against so many 109‚Äôs was a bloody > tall order... we were literally flying above the backs of the Jerry > bombers... I had been petrified earlier but now I was s******* blue lights > at the sight of so many swastikas and black crosses... wishing to hell the > CO would call it off and come back tomorrow. Wallens married Violet Bate in 1961 and their daughter Karen was born that year. He died at Banbury, Oxfordshire, in November 1995, at the age of 79.

The mall is located at the intersection of PR-2, PR-23, and PR-20, and has over 120 stores with its anchors being Kmart (closed), T.J. Maxx, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Capri, Walgreens, PetSmart, Caribbean Cinemas and Office Depot.  History Pueblo Viejo barrio in Guaynabo During the Spanish Colonial period, Tom√°s O'Daly was granted land in the vicinity of Guaynabo and O'Daly developed it into a thriving sugar hacienda. O'Daly and fellow Irishman Miguel Kirwan became business partners in the \\"Hacienda San Patricio\\" which they named after the chief patron saint of Ireland, Saint Patrick. The plantation no longer exists. The land on which it was located is now a suburb called San Patricio with a shopping mall, San Patricio Plaza.SAN PATRICIO PLAZA EXPANDS; All Business News, Retrieved December 2, 2008 San Patricio Plaza was designed and built by Interstate General, who leased the land to the Gonzalez Giusti family during 1964. By the early seventies, because of the high interest rates and oil costs, Interstate General decided to sell certain properties, including San Patricio Plaza, to the Giusti family. At that time San Patricio Plaza was a strip mall with four large buildings with shops in each of them, all united by common hallways. The main shops were Kmart, Pueblo Supermarket, Walgreens and New York Department Store. During the night of December 31, 1968, a fire consumed the building where Kmart was located. As a result, the mall's management decided to enclose the facilities becoming one of the first enclosed malls in Puerto Rico. In 1989, the mall changed its logo for the first time ever, for its 25th anniversary. In 1994, the mall changed its logo once again; also, the mall was given a $43 million renovation and expansion. A Food Court opened the same year. Also, the mall's first St. Patrick's Day celebrations were held in March 1995. The mall also introduced its \\"Patrick\\" character. A Caribbean Cinemas location opened in 1997. In 2003, the access control system was added to the mall. Also, a Bed Bath and Beyond location was opened. In late 2008, San Patricio Plaza was expanded once again, and some signage was replaced. On August 28, 2012, San Patricio Plaza announced a renovation of its Food Court, pedestrian bridge and multifloor parking. By January 2013, the remodelation was completed. On October 22, 2014, the mall changed its logo again for its 50th anniversary. The mall was also given a repainting that began in early 2014, replacing the old beige, pink and green color scheme that had been used since 1994, with a new green, yellow and white color scheme. The rest of the mall's 2nd floor, that had remained unremodeled in 2012, was remodeled as well On January 12, 2017, it was announced that the mall would undergo a $4 million renovation in order to look more modern. It included a new fountain, a new central atrium, new stairs, replacement of flooring and ceiling, and more It was originally expected to be completed in November 2017; however it was completed in March 2018 due to Hurricane Maria. In July 2018, the Caribbean Cinemas location was being remodeled. The details were announced in November. It was originally expected to reopen in December 2018, but it actually opened in February 2019. The new location is a Caribbean Cinemas VIP, with reclining seats and a hall sponsored by Alfa Romeo. The mall's Kmart store closed in February 2019. On December 5, 2019, it was announced that Kmart's former space would be remodeled into an area called \\"The Square @ San Patricio Plaza\\", with an inversion of $12 million. The rest of the mall will remain the same. Construction is expected to begin in early 2020 and end in late 2020. Several enhancements will be made to the Village as well. Feliciliandia Opened in 1972, Felicilandia, an amusement park, was located on the grounds of the San Patricio Plaza for about two decades. In 1991, a storage building behind Felicilandia was bought by the owners of San Patricio Plaza and converted into another part of the mall, a two story building right by the amusement park which added eight stores and offices to the mall. Felicilandia was a year- round attraction which remained open for two decades. When it closed in the mid 1990s, some of the amusement rides were relocated for use elsewhere. An exhibit at the San Patricio Plaza created in 2014 included pictures and a little history of when Felicilandia was there.http://www.lisasemidey.com/portfolio/san-patricio-plaza/ Located in Guaynabo, a highly populated municipality, Felicilandia is a place steeped in nostalgia for some residents of Puerto Rico. The park had a ferris wheel, bumper cars, mini-planes, a main roller coaster, a children's roller coaster, a children's ride where kids could drive cars up and down a play mountain, with a bridge included.

Hammarstrom was a Finnish architect who worked with Alvar Aalto and later with Eero Saarinen and The Architects' Collaborative.(finding aid for the Hammarstrom papers indicates that the papers include project files for projects including Chapel of St. James the Fisherman (1957) and St. Anselm's Episcopal Church (1960)) Hammarstrom worked with the San Francisco architectural firm of Marquis and Stoller on St. Anselm's. The concept for St. Anselm's was based on the Chapel of St. James the Fisherman in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, also designed by Hammarstrom. The church's interior features exposed redwood and cedar beams and columns. Using a \\"church-in-the-round\\" approach, the square sanctuary is in the center of the structure surrounded by redwood pews. The church seats approximately 450 parishioners in an octagonal space with everyone seated within seven rows from the altar.

The system is owned by the municipalities of Boston, Cambridge, Everett, Somerville, and Brookline, and is operated by Motivate. The system uses technology provided by 8D Technologies, as well as PBSC Urban Solutions for bikes, parts, and docking stations. The bike share program officially launched in Boston as Hubway on July 28, 2011 with 61 stations and 600 bicycles. In the spring of 2012, more stations were added in Boston and neighboring municipalities of Brookline, Cambridge, and Somerville joined the system. As of December 2019, the system had deployed 325 stations with a fleet of over 3,500 bikes. In 2018, total members exceeded 19,000, with 8 million total system rides.Getting Around Cambridge, City of Cambridge, 2019 Expansion continued in 2019, with the neighboring City of Everett joining the system. In March 2018, the municipal owners announced a six-year marketing deal with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and relaunch under the name of Bluebikes. The name change took effect on May 9, 2018, with the release of the newly re-branded blue bicycles.  History  Logo of Hubway On Earth Day, April 21, 2011, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino signed an operating contract with Alta Bicycle Share, officially announcing the launch of a bike share system in Boston. Planned as a regional system, Hubway was initiated under Mayor Menino's Boston Bikes Program, which aimed to build Boston into one of the world's premier cycling cities. The program was fully funded by $4.5 million in grants from the Federal Transit Administration and local organizations. Within the City of Boston, the system was sponsored by Boston-based New Balance. Hubway became operational on July 28, 2011, with an event in which members could ride bicycles from City Hall Plaza to a designated bicycle station. The event featured Mayor Menino, representatives from various sponsors, and related agencies. In November 2011, Hubway was shut down and disassembled for the winter as a preventive measure to counter New England winter weather. On March 15, 2012, Hubway was relaunched for the season with the abutting communities of Brookline, Cambridge, and Somerville also joining. By the end of the 2012 season on November 28, the system had 105 stations and 1,050 bikes. While a majority of the stations continued to be shut down for the winter season over the first years of the program, 25 stations in Cambridge remained open during a successful winter pilot program which became permanent. After the full system relaunched on April 2, 2014, it grew to 140 stations and over 1,300 bikes. On December 4, 2014, Hubway's non-management employees voted 23‚Äì8, 74%, in favor of joining Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) Local 100. The unionization effort came after employees of CitiBike in NYC, owned by the same parent company Motivate (formerly named Alta Bicycle Share), joined TWU Local 100 in September 2014 and was closely followed by similar efforts by employees of Alta Bicycle Share in Washington, D.C. and Chicago. Full system operations for 2014 concluded on November 26, though the system expanded its winter operations. For the second year, almost all Cambridge-based stations remained open year-round, and those stations were joined by 62 Boston-based stations that remained open through December 31, 2014. Inclement weather pushed back the full system reopening until April 17, 2015, and during the 2015 season the system grew to 155 stations and over 1,500 bicycles. In 2015, regular season operations concluded on November 25, though again Hubway expanded its winter operations further, with 110 stations remaining open through December 7, 2015; of those, 107 stayed open through December 31; and of those, the 37 Cambridge-based stations once again remain open year-round. In May 2017, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced a planned two-year expansion, adding 70 new stations and offering year-round service. On March 7, 2018, Hubway announced a six-year partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, which included a system-wide re-branding as Blue Bikes, along with expanding the system to 3,000 bikes and adding over 100 new stations by the end of 2019. From its inception, the Boston portion of the system had been sponsored by Boston-based athletic company New Balance. The new sponsorship with Blue Cross covers all four municipalities. The name change took effect on May 9, 2018, with the release of new and re-branded bicycles. On June 4, 2019, Bluebikes set a single-day ridership record with users taking 10,035 trips, the first time the ride-share has ever exceeded the 10,000-rider mark for a single day. The system continued to surpass its ridership records throughout summer 2019, hitting 13,642 trips in a single day in September. On September 19, 2019 Bluebikes passed 10 million total rides.  Income-Eligible Program  In the spring of 2018, as Motivate worked towards expanding the bike share program, attention was also focused on increasing membership opportunities for folks who may not have been able to pay the full price. Bluebikes offered an expanded Income-Eligible Program that offers membership rates of $5 per month or $50 per year, which are discounted from the standard prices of $20 per month or $99 per year. Residents can qualify for these discounted rates via their participation in any one of eleven different assistance programs, the likes of which range from EBT cards, Pell Grants, MassHealth, and Public housing initiatives. Additionally, the Bluebikes program offers a subsidized yearly membership fee of $5 for guests or clients of transitional housing options and homeless shelters located within the city of Boston. Those who qualify for these discounted rates have access to unlimited 60 minute trips, which is an increase from the standard 45 minute rides, which provides additional incentive to increase membership among a subset of the population that previously may not have had access. Mayor Marty Walsh has said that these changes to the Bluebikes initiative are in line with the goals of Boston‚Äôs Go Boston 2030 transportation plan, which focuses on promoting transportation equity. Jay Walder, who was the CEO and President of Motivate at the time, stated that the Income-Eligible Program would make Bluebikes accessible for thousands of Bostonians who were previously unable to participate, and that these efforts to provide access regardless of income should serve as a model for Sustainable transport initiatives across the country. Starting on October 5th, 2019, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts began to sponsor $1 single rides on weekends until the end of 2019 to help combat transportation challenges arising from MBTA shutdowns. Blue Cross has also donated $10,000 to the Bluebikes Income-Eligibility Program to increase affordability. These initiatives have helped to establish Bluebikes as an affordable, healthy, and consistent alternative to more traditional public transportation options in Boston.  Equipment  Bicycles at a Hubway station, before the rebranding. Bluebikes at Ruggles station, 2019 The system uses bicycles designed and manufactured by Montreal-based PBSC.

Oxford University Press (1951), pp. 138, 491. is a socialist and black nationalist movement founded in 1972 and led by the African People's Socialist Party (APSP), whose chairman is Omali Yeshitela. It is centered on the theory of African internationalism, which it says provides a historical materialist explanation for the social and economic conditions of African people worldwide. The APSP has formed several organizations, each with specific tasks and purpose. Affiliated organizations include The International People's Democratic Uhuru Movement (InPDUM), African Socialist International (ASI), UhuruNews.com, African People's Solidarity Committee (APSC), Uhuru Solidarity Movement (USM), Burning Spear Productions, Uhuru Foods, Uhuru Furniture,Uhuru profile, sct.temple.edu; accessed September 18, 2015. All African People's Development and Empowerment Project (AAPDEP), and African People's Education and Defense Foundation (APEDF).  Political views and history  The Uhuru Movement's political ideology is African internationalism, which states that capitalism was born parasitic through the attack on Africa and its people. African Internationalism holds that capitalism is imperialism developed to its highest stage, not the other way around, as theorized by Vladimir Lenin. This belief derives from Karl Marx's 1867 book Capital, in which Marx wrote of the condition essential to the emergence of capitalism which he called the \\"primitive accumulation\\" of capital. African Internationalism is not a static theory that only refers to past conditions, it refers also to the conditions that African people are faced with today. It refers to African people who live inside what it views as imperialist centers, such as the United States and Europe, as an \\"internal colony\\". The Movement has called for the release of all African American prisoners in U.S. prisons, described as \\"concentration camps\\", and has described U.S. police forces as an \\"illegitimate standing army\\". They have called for the withdrawal of police forces from exploited and oppressed African American communities. In the 1990s, tensions between the police in St. Petersburg, Florida and the Uhuru Movement were high. Members of the Uhuru Movement frequently protested against the police's treatment of African Americans, usually after the murders of African Americans by police. On October 25, 1996, violence erupted after a white police officer shot and killed a young black man driving a stolen car. Cars and buildings were torched, protestors shouted, and rocks, along with other items, were tossed at the police officers at the scene of the shooting. At least 20 protestors were arrested. The next day, a large group of Uhuru members went back to the scene and called for the release of the arrested protestors. Sobukwe Bambaata, one of the Uhuru members, stated that the rioting would have never occurred \\"if the police did not come into our community and treat us like dogs.\\" Although violence broke out in 1996, most of the protests organized by the movement remained peaceful.  Areas of work  The Uhuru Movement is a collective of organizations and institutions that were formed by the African People's Socialist Party. Each organization was created to deal with specific issues related to the conditions faced by African people under colonialism:  Political organizations  * The African People's Socialist Party is an African-only political party. Its leading body is the National Central Committee (NCC) which makes up the leadership of the Uhuru Movement. * The African Socialist International is the international manifestation of the African People's Socialist Party. Its job is to build Party organizations around the world and network with other revolutionary African organizations who unite with the principles of the African People's Socialist Party. Party members and institutions have been created in several European countries, the Caribbean and South America. * International People's Democratic Uhuru Movement (InPDUM) \\"is the leading mass organization in the struggle for Bread, Peace and Black Power in the 21st Century.\\" Now located in three continents around the world, INPDUM has always demanded reparations, state power and self-government for African people worldwide! * African National Women's Organization (ANWO) is the leading mass organization for African women who struggle against the colonial conditions that remove them from political life.  Community organizations  * All African People's Development and Empowerment Project (AAPDEP) is an international organization establishing development projects in African communities worldwide. Its main work is in the areas of agriculture, education and healthcare. It recently completed a project to help Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone. * African People's Education and Defense Fund (APEDF) strives to develop and institutionalize programs to defend the human and civil rights of the African community, and to address the grave disparities in education, health, healthcare, and economic development faced by the African community.  Solidarity non-African political organizations  * African People Solidarity Committee (APSC) was founded in 1976 by the African People's Socialist Party (APSP) as a way for Euro-American and European (white) people to join the African liberation struggle, working directly under the leadership of the APSP. * Uhuru Solidarity Movement (USM) is an organization of white people created by and working directly under the leadership of the African People's Socialist Party.  Economic institutions  * The Black Power Blueprint in St Louis, MO is a Black Community Economic Development project led by and for the Black working class in St Louis and Ferguson. It is a project of APEDF. It will result in a new Uhuru House African cultural center, One Africa, One Nation Marketplace, a community garden, and Uhuru Jiko Community Commercial Kitchen & Bakery Cafe and home of the Africans Independence Workforce Program. * Uhuru Furniture Philadelphia represents people in Philadelphia who donate, shop and/or volunteer at the Uhuru Movement's second-hand furniture store in that city. * Uhuru Furniture Oakland represents people in Oakland who donate, shop and/or volunteer at the Uhuru Movement's second-hand furniture store in that city. * Uhuru Foods and Pies' mission is to produce and sell the freshest foods to build self- sustaining economic development, designed for the prosperity and self- determination of present and future generations of African people worldwide. * Akwaaba Hall in Oakland, St. Louis, and St. Petersburg are located event rental spaces offered at a low cost to the community. * The Burning Spear Newspaper is the Uhuru Movement's newspaper. They call it \\"the voice of the international African Revolution.\\"  Media  * The Burning Spear Newspaper * Burning Spear Publications * UhuruNews.com * Black Power 96.3 St. Petersburg  Controversy and criticism  In 2004, Uhuru Movement's leader Omali Yeshitela tore down a Halloween display in St. Petersburg which depicted \\"a stuffed figure hung by the neck on a homemade gallows\\". Subsequent opinions and letters to the St. Petersburg Times regarding the incident were critical of both the Uhuru Movement and Yeshitela's conduct. The Uhuru Movement came to national attention during the 2008 Presidential campaign season when they interrupted Barack Obama at a town hall meeting in St. Petersburg, Florida, and questioned the candidate with the question, \\"What about the black community?\\" alleging that he was not speaking out for Africans on issues such as police brutality, high unemployment, predatory lending, and Hurricane Katrina. The group was criticized by the Anti-Defamation League for engaging in demonstrations on January 3, 2009 in St. Petersburg, Florida which the ADL claims encouraged anti-Israel and anti-Zionist rallies. In 2009, the International People's Democratic Uhuru Movement organized a march in support of Lovelle Mixon and against the Oakland Police. Mixon, an Oakland, California resident, had been accused of killing four Oakland police officers and died during a shootout after a traffic stop, coincidentally just blocks away from the local Uhuru headquarters.\\"Dozens march for Mixon, against police\\", San Francisco Chronicle, March 26, 2009.\\"Calling him a 'true hero', mourners hold vigil for suspected Oakland cop killer Lovelle Mixon\\", New York Daily News; accessed June 13, 2016. On the other hand, many black Oaklanders, as well as those belonging to other racial groups, seemed largely opposed to such sentiments,Woman says she pointed police to Oakland killer, San Francisco Chronicle, March 23, 2009. a clear majority of those who regularly campaign against abuses of police power also rejected any attempt to attach legitimacy to Mixon's murder rampage and Caroline Mixon, a cousin of Lovelle Mixon, paid a public tribute to the Oakland police, thanking them for serving and protecting the people of Oakland. At the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, the General Students' Committee (AStA) broke apart in April 2015 as a consequence of internal dispute over purported antisemitism after having organized an Information event about the Uhuru Movement on JGU campus in January. The AStA distanced itself both from the Uhuru Movement, African People's Socialist Party and its leader Omali Yeshitela stating that \\"the struggle against racism and the consequences of colonialism should not blind us to other reactionary ideologies\\" and regretted providing a platform for this movement.

They are primarily attended by Malaysian Indians of Tamil descent. Within the framework of the Malaysian educational system, Tamil primary schools are referred to as \\"National-type (Tamil) Schools\\" (Malay: Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (Tamil)). As with other government schools, they follow the unified national curriculum, with the teaching of the Malay and English languages as compulsory subjects. All other subjects are taught in Tamil, except Science and Mathematics which are in either Tamil or English depending on the school and school grade. There are six year-long school grades, referred to as Year 1 to 6. Typically, students enter Year 1 at age six, in the calendar year they turn seven. In Year 6, students sit for a standardised test called Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah (UPSR, Primary School Assessment Test). After completing their studies in Tamil primary schools, most students continue studying at national secondary schools which uses Malay as medium of instruction. Besides providing education in the Tamil language, the schools also play a part in imparting Indian cultural and religious values to young Malaysian Indians to maintain a distinct Indian identity while fostering national unity in multiethnic Malaysia. Currently there are 523 Tamil primary schools in Malaysia. Tamil school in Malaysia was formed by an Tamilar association in Malaysia and it was established first as Saraswathy Tamil school in Old Klang Road, Petaling Jaya. History During the British colonial period in Malaya, Indians especially the Tamils from Southern India came to Malaya as migrant workers in rubber, tea, coffee and sugar plantations. Tamil education in Malaysia started when first Tamil primary school was established in Penang in 1816. This school was operational for few years. Later in 1870 more Tamil schools were started in Province Wellesley, North Johor, Negeri Sembilan state. As the rubber estates grew up in numbers by the end of the nineteenth century, the estate managements and the British government opened more Tamil primary schools. In addition, Christian missionaries in Malaya set up schools as a mean to proselytising Christianity. By 1905, there were 13 government and Christian mission Tamil schools in Malaya. In the beginning, most of the schools did not last long due to lack of support and commitment from the estate managements and the government, and there was no continuous effort from the Indian community to sustain these schools. To attract more labourers and make them stay longer, the government passed a labour ordinance in 1912 requiring that the estate managements had to set up Tamil schools if there were more than 10 school-going children in the estate. However many estates owners refused to build new buildings for schools, causing the children to study in dilapidated buildings and former smoke houses. Furthermore, the government in those days had not allocated funds to build Tamil schools. Tamil schools at that time used the school curriculum from India and did not have teaching of the Malay and English languages. Emphasis was given only to reading, writing and arithmetic skills in the lower primary level and writing composition and geography was taught in the higher primary level. The children, on leaving the Tamil primary school, were absorbed into the working milieu of the plantations. Parents themselves, mostly illiterate, did not see the value or purpose of seeking out a secondary education. Furthermore, the colonial government was intending to keep the Indians in the plantations and had no interest in providing education beyond the primary level. As a result, Tamil secondary schools were not established in Malaya. Between 1930 and 1937, there were some developments in Tamil education when the British Indian government was concerned about the mistreatment of Indian labourers in Malaya. As a result, the Malayan government set up a special committee to provide financial assistance to Tamil schools, appointed inspectors for Tamil schools and also started teachers' training. The number of Tamil schools had also increased tremendously. By 1938, there were 13 government, 511 estate and 23 mission Tamil primary schools in Malaya. After World War II, the government started to give serious attention to vernacular education by enforcing Education Ordinance 1946. The law emphasised on free mother tongue education and increased the grant provision to Tamil schools. This move paved the way to the increase of students in Tamil schools. Number of students increased gradually from 29,800 in 1946 to 38,700 in 1949. In 1951, the Indian Education Committee reviewed Tamil education and proposed teaching of English in Year 4 and Malay in Year 5. As Malaya began to move towards self-government and eventual independence, efforts were made to develop a national education policy. The Barnes Report, published in 1951 and enacted as the Education Ordinance of 1952, proposed a national school system with Malay and English as mediums of instruction, with the exclusion of Chinese and Tamil schools, which the Chinese and Indians protested. The Fenn-Wu Report, which allowed the retention of Chinese and Tamil schools, elicited protest from the Malays. In 1956, the Razak Report was published as a compromise; it established a national school system with Malay, English, Chinese and Tamil schools at the primary level, and Malay and English schools at the secondary level. Malay schools would be known as National Schools, and non-Malay schools as National-type schools. The report was accepted and enacted as Education Ordinance of 1956, which formed the basis of the education policy of independent Malaya. After independence of the Federation of Malaya, Tamil schools accepted government funding and became National-type (Tamil) Schools. Under a set of arrangements, the government is responsible for funding, teachers‚Äô training and setting the school curriculum, while the school buildings and assets remained the property of the local Indian community. Schools under these arrangements elect a board of directors to oversee and safeguard the school properties. However, due to the eventual objective of using Malay as the medium of instruction in all schools as envisioned in the Razak Report, National-Type Schools receive relatively small proportion of education funding compared to the Malay-medium National Schools. In 2003, the government introduced the policy of teaching Science and Mathematics subjects in English in all schools. This was protested by education groups that advocate the use of mother tongues as mediums of instruction in schools. In 2009, the government announced a return to the previous mediums of instruction starting in 2012. This in turn was met with opposition from parents that support the 2003 policy. In 2011, the government released details of reimplementation of the previous mediums of instruction. While new Year 1 students would be taught in the previous language, students that had already started learning Science and Mathematics in English can choose whether to continue in English or switch to the previous language.

He argues that far from suppressing Greek philosophy, Christianity integrated the more authoritarian aspects of Platonism at the expense of the Aristotelian tradition. He explores the contribution of the Roman emperors to the definition of Christian doctrine, an argument followed up in his 2009 book AD 381. He dates \\"the reopening of the western mind\\" to the integration of Aristotle's thought into Christian doctrine by Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century. Academic criticism David C. Lindberg, a historian of science, in his The Beginnings of Western Science, after having explained the history of science's role in the Middle Ages where it was preserved by the Christians and monks, and that the hoary myth that the early Christians should have destroyed science is an outdated teaching, he explained that even today some tends to perpetuate these outdated myths despite the conventional scholarship refutes it. Then Lindberg wrote about Charles Freeman: ‚ÄúFinally, to demonstrate that such views are alive and well, I quote Charles Freeman in his Closing of the Western Mind: The Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason (2003): By the fifth century of the Christian era, he argues, ‚Äúnot only has rational thought been suppressed, but there has been a substitution for it of ‚Äòmystery, magic, and authority‚Äô. It is little wonder, given this kind of scholarly backing, that the ignorance and degradation of the Middle Ages has become an article of faith among the general public, achieving the status of invulnerability merely by virtue of endless repetition.‚Äù In Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths about Science and Religion by Ronald Numbers, another historian of science, it states that ‚ÄúThe misleading accounts of Hypatia‚Äôs death and Freeman‚Äôs Closing of the Western Mind, quoted above, are attempts to keep alive an old myth: the portrayal of early Christianity as a haven of anti- intellectualism, a fountainhead of antiscientific sentiment, and one of the primary agents responsible for Europe‚Äôs descent into what are popularly referred to as the 'dark ages.' Supporting evidence is available, if not plentiful.‚Äù John Morreall, a Doctor of Philosophy and Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies, also mentioned Freeman as one who has misperception about ‚Äúthe fate of scientific inquiry at the hands of Christianity in the Middle Ages\\". Mary Beard, a Professor of Classics at the University of Cambridge, notes: \\"for most of Freeman's book, this argument takes a back seat\\". She then notes that most of his book is a general overview \\"of the rise of Christianity through antiquity and the early middle ages, set against its classical background\\" and is, as such, not remarkable and actually well written, but she notes also: \\"To make pagan antiquity a bastion of scientific rationality demands ignoring the Dodds effect and skating very lightly over a whole range of decidedly \\"irrational\\" features.\\" - She ends her review: \\"The real problem is in Freeman's stark opposition between the classical and Christian worlds. The truth is that we are only able to read most of the scientific triumphs of pagan antiquity because the hard-working monks of Christian monasteries chose to copy and study them. Thomas Aquinas may have \\"re-discovered\\" his Aristotle through Arab translations. But, by and large, we have Freeman's \\"irrational\\" Christians to thank for preserving classical \\"rationality\\" ‚Äì and, for that matter, irrationality.\\"Beard, Mary. ‚ÄùThe Closing of the Western Mind, by Charles Freeman‚Äù. independent.co.uk. 14 September 2002.

Freeman writes fluently and summarizes his various authorities more or less accurately, but his argumentation is superficial. To assert, as he does in his Introduction, that Christian orthodoxy stifled independent reasoning would imply that Socrates had not been tried for impiety in the golden age of Athens or that books had not been burned in the reign of Augustus.‚ÄùBowersock, Glen. ‚ÄùThe classics, Christianity and the closing mind‚Äù. latimes.com.

C 14.01), is a work thought to be by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart for oboe, clarinet, horn, bassoon, and orchestra. He originally wrote a work for flute, oboe, horn, bassoon, and orchestra, K. Anh. 9 (297B), in Paris in April 1778. This original work is now lost. The lost Mozart Sinfonia Concertante In April 1778 Mozart wrote to his father from Paris about the sinfonia concertante he was writing for performance at the Concert Spirituel naming the four virtuoso soloists who were to play. They were Johan Wendling (flute), Friedrich Ramm (Oboe), Giovanni Punto (horn) and Georg Wenzl Ritter (bassoon). Mozart knew the three woodwind players from a previous visit to Mannheim. He wrote that the four soloists were \\"in love with\\" the work and that Legros, the Concert Spirituel director, had kept the score to have it copied. However at the last minute Mozart's piece was displaced from the concert program by a piece for similar forces by Giuseppe Cambini and the Mozart work was never played.. From this point the original Mozart work became lost. The Sinfonia Concertante as it is played today The work as it is performed today came to light in 1869 as an anonymous copy manuscript in the collection of Otto Jahn. Jahn wrote the first scholarly biography of Mozart and had amassed a large quantity of Mozart letters, original manuscripts and score copies. These he made available to K√∂chel to assist with the creation of the K√∂chel catalogue of Mozart's work. There is considerable debate about the relation of this work as it is performed today to the lost original work, in part because the Jahn score has a somewhat different lineup of soloists from the lost Mozart work, but also because it contains errors both of copying and composition. Instrumentation The Sinfonia Concertante is scored for solo oboe, solo clarinet, solo horn, solo bassoon, and an orchestra of two horns, two oboes, and strings. A typical performance lasts about 28 minutes. Movements The work consists of three movements: #Allegro, in common time. This movement is in sonata form with three expositions rather than two ‚Äì one played by the orchestra, the other two by the soloists. It contains a written cadenza before the coda. #Adagio in common time, with \\"gentle exchanges of thematic material\\". #Andante con variazioni, a theme with ten variations and a coda. Each variation is separated by \\"identical, basically decorative orchestral ritornelli\\". This movement is in 2/4 time until the end of the last variation, where 6 adagio bars in common time lead to a coda in 6/8 time. Authenticity Mozart is known through letters and concert announcements to have written a sinfonia concertante for flute, oboe, horn, and bassoon, the original score of which is lost. There is considerable debate about the authenticity of what is performed today, and whether the extant piece is even related to the original work. Various scholars have conflicting opinions, and some say the composition is currently in a corrupt form. Initially the Sinfonia Concertante seems to have been accepted uncritically as a slightly different version of Mozart's lost work. However in the 1930s Donald Tovey described it as \\"blundering\\" and \\"inept\\". Alfred Einstein however considered it genuine. He considered the work to be an arrangement which retained the essential nature of the original and he identified a recurring mozartean \\"motto\\" in the slow movement. Stanley Sadie was dismissive in particular noting that the solo clarinet cannot be directly back-transcribed to a supposed oboe part. Martin Staehelin considered that it was inconceivable that Mozart wrote a homotonal concerto (i.e. with all three movements in the same key; here E-flat major). No other attested Mozart concerto is homotonal though several of his symphonies and divertimenti are. Sadie thought that a sufficient reason for the homotonal character of the work might be to avoid a natural horn crook change and retune between movements. Staehelin has written a book about the work which argues that it cannot be by Mozart. The Mozart Project considers this piece as \\"spurious or doubtful\\", and it does not appear on the project's listing of concertos. Robert Levin analysed the Sinfonia Concertante and compared the structure of the work with known Mozart concertos. From this analysis he concluded that while the orchestral part and the first movement cadenza were spurious, the soloists' roles were based on the Mozart originals but had been modified by an unknown hand to substitute a clarinet for the oboe part and to change the flute for an oboe. This transcription process would have required the music for the three woodwind instruments to have been redistributed to accommodate the substitution of the clarinet for the original oboe part. Levin theorised that the unknown arranger had only the four original Mozart solo parts for reference so had composed the orchestral parts and cadenzas afresh. Levin wrote a book about the work and then went on to make a reconstruction of the supposed original Mozart work based on his research. Levin's reconstruction was recorded by the Academy of St Martin in the Fields under Neville Marriner. Mozart displayed affection and prominence for the wind instruments in his operas and concertos. Noteworthy wind passages are in the fifteenth and seventeenth piano concertos, with memorable dialogues with the soloist; flute, oboe and bassoon. In opera there are many arias with similar woodwind and French Horn passages, such as Fiordiligi's \\"Per piet√†, ben mio, perdona\\" from Cos√¨ fan tutte. The aria Se il padre perdei from Idomeneo uses the same four wind instruments as the lost Paris work, is in E-flat and was written for the same Mannheim soloists. A passage from the Mozart Oboe Quartet first movement (bars 85-87 and 88-90) appears to quote the Sinfonia Concertante. Both works were written for the same player Friedrich Ramm. The Sinfonia Concertante remains popular today, and is regularly performed.

The 2014 season was the 96th season that the University of New Mexico has field a baseball team (the team did not play 17 seasons: 1902, 1903, 1909, 1918, 1924‚Äì1926, 1928, 1930‚Äì1938, 1944, and 1945). In 1951, the Lobos began play in the Skyline Eight Conference, recording a first place regular season finish in the Eastern Division in 1953, 1958, and their final season in the conference in 1962.

After spending nine and a half seasons across the street at Isotopes Park, UNM returned to Santa Ana Star Field for good on March 24, 2013, as the Lobos hosted a doubleheader against the Nevada Wolf Pack. \\"We need to have our own place to play,\\" said head coach Ray Birmingham. \\"The kids deserve their own field to practice and play on, and now we have that. They've earned it.\\" Santa Ana Star Field received a major upgrade that started before the 2013 season. It received a FieldTurf playing surface, upgraded scoreboard, dugouts, bullpens, and bleachers as a part of the first phase of the Lobo Field renovation. Further renovations and phases will enhance the concessions areas, the fan plaza between Lobo Field and the softball field, the press box and the bleachers. Lights were installed in the fall of 2013, and construction on a new clubhouse should begin in the summer of 2014. \\"We have lights because of (former Lobo) Dee Dennis and a bunch of guys who chipped in to help me and Dee do this,\\" Birmingham said. \\"This is Lobo Field. This is (the state of) New Mexico‚Äôs baseball field, at least that‚Äôs how I feel about it. ... There will not only be Lobo games on here, but there will also be state championship games here. We hope to bring in some great big tournaments over the years to this city and let our kids experience the world.

The school is one of nine high schools within Horry County Schools. The school serves the city of Myrtle Beach. MBHS has over 1,500 students and is home to the Myrtle Beach High School Seahawks.  History  Myrtle Beach High School originally shared a facility with all the lower grades in Myrtle Beach's public schools in a building occupying a city block bounded by N. Kings Highway, Oak Street, 5th Avenue North, and 6th Avenue North. In middle of the 1946-47 school year, a fire destroyed the school building; classes for the remainder of the school year were held in The Seaside Inn, which occupied the plot of land which the Myrtle Beach Pavilion amusement park was eventually built. Shortly after the fire, Myrtle Beach High School was rebuilt on a tract of land west of North Kings's Highway, northwest of the present intersection of U.S. 17 Business and 14th Avenue North in Myrtle Beach. In 1965, MBHS was one of the first public schools in its area to integrate both black and white students. 1990, the school building and athletic fields were sold by Horry County Schools and was redeveloped to the Kings Festival shopping center. MBHS was relocated to its present site on Robert Grissom Parkway between 29th and 38th Avenues North.  Sports  Myrtle Beach High School offers the following sports: baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, football, golf, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball, lacrosse, and wrestling.

It is located in an architecturally distinguished building, built in 1903-04 with funding support from Andrew Carnegie. The library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for its architecture. The library is one of the only libraries in Maine designated as a \\"Star Library\\" by Library Journal.http://www.maine.gov/msl/news/display.shtml?id=318495 Architecture and history The Rockland Public Library is located on the west side of Rockland's commercial downtown, at the western end of a parcel bounded by Union, White, and Beech Streets, with St. Peter's Episcopal Church next door to the south. Although it carries a Union Street address, it is separated from that street by a small park, and it has entrances facing the park and White Street. It is a single-story masonry structure, built out of cut granite, with a full basement and a cross-gabled roof configuration. It is roughly H-shaped, with the original 1903-04 building facing east, joined via a wide hyphen to a modern wing facing west. The original main block has Romanesque and Beaux Arts styling, including Doric columns flanking the recessed Union Street entrance, and an apsoidal southern reading area, its windows articulated by pilasters. The library was built in 1903-04, and was funded in part by a $20,000 grant from Andrew Carnegie. It is the city's only major example of Beaux Arts architecture, a style that is also uncommon in the state. It was designed by Maine native George Clough, then in partnership with Herbert Wardner. In July 1910, President William Taft gave a speech to a large audience assembled on the library lawn. In 1915, the building was wired for electricity.

He played defensive tackle in the National Football League, and was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the fourth round of the 1988 NFL Draft. He was also a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers and San Francisco 49ers, winning Super Bowl XXIV with the 49ers, and played in the World League of American Football with the Montreal Machine and London Monarchs. Early career Born and raised in northern Idaho, he graduated from Post Falls High School in 1984 and played college football for Oregon. After his senior season, Putzier was named co-team MVP with Anthony Newman. He participated in the Senior Bowl and NFL Scouting Combine at the conclusion of his college career. Professional career Green Bay Packers Putzier was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the fourth round (88th overall) of the 1988 NFL Draft, and signed a three-year contract with the team. He was cut at the end of training camp and heard the news from a friend before the team informed him. Pittsburgh Steelers On September 7, 1988, Putzier was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers to a one-year contract. He was cut the following day after failing a physical exam, likely due to a broken foot suffered in training camp with the Packers. He re-signed with the team on November 2, and played in five games during the latter portion of the season. Putzier was waived on July 28, 1989 after security personnel found two unloaded pistols at his training camp residence. San Francisco 49ers Shortly after his release from the Steelers, Putzier signed with the San Francisco 49ers. On August 29, 1989, Putzier was suspended four games by the NFL for steroid usage. He was reinstated by the league on September 26. He played in twelve regular season games, but did not make the team's playoff roster and did not participate in Super Bowl XXIV, which the 49ers won. He was waived by the 49ers during final roster cuts on September 3, 1990. Denver Broncos Putzier spent part of the 1991 training camp with the Denver Broncos before being cut. Montreal Machine (WLAF) Putzier spent the 1991 season with the Montreal Machine of the World League of American Football. He was drafted in the third round (26th overall) by the team. He played with the team the following year, but then the league went on hiatus. London Monarchs (WLAF) Putzier was drafted by the London Monarchs in the 1995 WLAF draft. Post-football life After his football career ended, Putzier moved to Huntsville, Alabama, married, had children, divorced, and worked as a bouncer. His Super Bowl XXIV ring was stolen when Putzier was shot trying to break up a 2008 fight in the parking lot of the apartment complex he was living in. He was in the intensive care unit for three weeks after the shooting, including time spent in an induced coma and on a ventilator. He died in Huntsville on April 25, 2018, at the age of 52.

It is named for the city of Fayetteville, Arkansas, and requires hydraulic fracturing to release the natural gas contained within. Nomenclature Photograph of the Wedington Sandstone Member (mistaken as Batesville Sandstone) circa 1891 Named by Frederick Willard Simonds in 1891, Simonds recognized what is now the Fayetteville Shale as three separate formations overlying the now abandoned Wyman Sandstone: the Fayetteville Shale, the Batesville Sandstone, and the Marshall Shale. In 1904, the name \\"Fayetteville Shale\\" replaced all three of these names. The Fayetteville Shale that Simonds recognized is now considered as the lower Fayetteville Shale. Simonds' Batesville Sandstone was found to be the same as the Wyman Sandstone, and replaced the name \\"Wyman Sandstone\\", while Simonds' Batesville Sandstone became known as the \\"Wedington Sandstone Member\\" presumably after Wedington Mountain. The name Marshall Shale was abandoned and is now known as the upper Fayetteville Shale.  Natural gas  Gas production from Fayetteville Shale The formation holds natural gas in a fine-grained rock matrix which requires hydraulic fracturing to release the gas. This process became cost-effective in some shales such as the Fayetteville after years of experimentation in the Barnett Shale in North Texas, especially when combined with horizontal drilling. The Fayetteville Shale play began in July 2004 by Southwestern Energy Company in north-central Arkansas with the Thomas #1-9 vertical well in Conway County, Arkansas. In February 2005, Southwestern Energy drilled the first horizontal well, the Seeco-Vaughan #4-22H, also in Conway County. The US Energy Information Administration estimated that the shale play held 13,240 billion cubic ft (375 billion cubic meters) of unproved, technically recoverable gas. The average well was estimated to produce 1.3 billion cubic feet of gas.US Energy Information Administration, Annual Energy outlook 2012, accessed 14 Sept. 2013. As of 2018, new drilling in the Fayetteville Shale had ceased and almost 1/5 of wells were abandoned. Paleontology Flora Because the Fayetteville Formation is a marine unit, most of the plants found in the black shales must have been washed into the Carboniferous sea from a landmass. However one unit within the formation, the Weddington Sandstone Member, is a series of river deposited sand beds. Fossil plants from this unit were probably deposited closer to their source.

The mazurkas were written in 1830 ‚Äì 1832. A typical performance of all five mazurkas takes a little over eleven minutes. No. 1 in B-flat major The first mazurka is marked Vivace and is perhaps the most well-known mazurka of the set. No. 2 in A minor Despite the Vivo, ma non troppo marking, the mazurka is usually slowly performed, and the main theme is relatively mild. No. 3 in F minor The third mazurka is the only one in the set to feature no repeats. No. 4 in A-flat major This mazurka was originally composed in 1824; Chopin revised it and put it as the fourth mazurka of the set. No. 5 in C major The final mazurka is the shortest of the five, taking less than a minute to perform.

Tomlin recorded the album live before an audience at The Ice House in Pasadena, California. The album features Tomlin as one of her most celebrated characters, five-and-a-half-year old Edith Ann, who hounds a new neighbor (also played by Tomlin) with her little dramas real and imagined, as well as sage advice and tales of her family's private life. The album was Tomlin's second record release, following her Grammy-winning This Is A Recording. And That's The Truth earned Tomlin a second Grammy nomination as Best Comedy Recording and peaked at #41 on the Billboard Hot 200 album chart, the third highest ranking album ever on the chart by a female comedian, behind Tomlin's debut album and Joan Rivers's 1983 \\"What Becomes A Semi-Legend Most\\" (which peaked at #23). The album was produced by Irene M. Pinn and conceived and written by Lily Tomlin and Jane Wagner with additional material by Jim Abell & Chet Dowling, Betty Beaird, Marian Brayton, Warren Burton, Susan Perkis Haven, Edward Morris, Richard Tomlin, and Bill Weeden & David Finkle. Track listing Each side of the album runs approximately 20 minutes and is an ongoing monologue between Edith Ann and her neighbor \\"Lady\\", although the story passages on each side of the record are named individually.

After Herbert Duckworth's death, Julia Duckworth married secondly the author Leslie Stephen, and Duckworth was thus a half-brother of the painter Vanessa Bell and the writer Virginia Woolf, leading members of the Bloomsbury Group, and of Thoby and Adrian Stephen. Both sisters, Vanessa Bell and Virginia Woolf later accused their two Duckworth half-brothers of sexually molesting them for many years as children and adolescents.Roger Poole, The Unknown Virginia Woolf (Cambridge University Press, 1978), Both had unconventional love lives. pp. 27-34 Duckworth was educated at Eton, where in 1886 he was a member of the First XI for cricket, and then at Trinity College, Cambridge.'DUCKWORTH, Sir George Herbert', in Who Was Who (London: A. & C.

From 1906 to 1908 Duckworth was secretary to the Treasury Committee on War Risks of Shipping, and from 1908 to 1933 Secretary to the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments. During the First World War he was appointed deputy Director of Munitions Finance, serving from 1915 to 1918, and in 1918 as Controller of Labour Finance. In 1919 he became a Companion of the Order of the Bath. After the war, from 1919 to 1920, he was Controller of Munitions Housing Schemes. In 1924 he became a Trustee and first Chairman of the Irish Land Trust, which had the aim of providing houses and land for ex-service men in Ireland.

Members of the genus are found worldwide. Biology Urothods are long and live on the sea bed or in shallow burrows in gravelly substrates or muddy sand. They can swim for short distances. They are vulnerable to dredging but are able to recover afterwards and re-establish their burrows. They are deposit feeders and also selectively scrape microorganisms from grains of sand. Reproduction Urothoe reaches sexual maturity at five months and may live for about a year. The sexes are distinct and breeding takes place in the summer months. Fertilisation is internal and there are about fifteen eggs per brood, produced in a cycle of about fifteen days. Fecundity is high and the juveniles grow fast but biological dispersal is very limited.
