He is a former head of composition and contemporary music at the London College of Music and Media.Bone, Lloyd E.; Paull, Eric R.; Morris, Winston. Guide to the Euphonium Repertoire. Indiana University Press, 2007, p. 452. Clarke began his career as a military bandsman, then studied composition at the Royal Academy of Music with composer Paul Patterson.Clarke, Nigel. Biography, Nigel-clarke.co.uk, accessed 5 April 2010. While at the Royal Academy, he was awarded the Queen's Commendation for Excellence. He was previously Young Composer in Residence at The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, Composition and Contemporary Music Tutor at the Royal Academy of Music, London, Head of Composition at the London College of Music and Media, a visiting tutor at the Royal Northern College of Music and Associate Composer to the world-famous Black Dyke Mills Band , Associate Composer to the Band of the Grenadier Guards, Composer-in-Residence to the Marinierskapel der Koninklijke Marine (Marine Band of the Royal Netherlands Navy) and Associate Composer to Brass Band Buizingen in Belgium. He has also been guest professor at the Xinjiang Arts Institute in China and Associate Composer to the Royal Military School of Music, Kneller Hall. More recently he has been Visiting Composer to Middle Tennessee State University Bands and International Composer in Association to the world-famous Grimethorpe Colliery Band in the UK. In 1997, Clarke visited the United States as part of the country's International Visitor Leadership Program, and the President's Own Marine Band performed one of his pieces, \\"Samurai\\", conducted by Colonel Timothy Foley. The Winnipeg Fress Press described the piece as a throbbing, raucous work influenced by Japanese drumming.Nemerofsky, Gwenda. Unexpected percussion discussion bang on, Winnipeg Free Press, 2 May 2009. Clarke is an Associate of the Royal Academy of Music. In 2015 he collaborated with Danish writer Malene Sheppard Sk√¶rved on his first symphony (\\"A Richer Dust\\") for Speaker and Symphonic Wind Orchestra. Using music and words, ‚ÄòA Richer Dust‚Äô explores what it means to live with violence and extremism, the constant companions of human history. The intertwined text and music, ideas and images, weave together voices ranging from those of historically significant figures through to the voiceless, ordinary people living in extraordinary times. \\"A Richer Dust\\" was commissioned by Dr Reed Thomas and the Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) Wind Ensemble. It was premiered on 14 April 2015 by Dr Reed Thomas (Conductor), H. Stephen Smith (Speaker) and the MTSU Wind Ensemble in the T. Earl Music Hall, Wright Music Building, Murfreesboro, Tennessee, USA. The European Premiere was given by the Regimental Band of the Irish Guards on 6 November in the Guards Chapel, London, under the baton of the composer with WO1 Andrew Porter as Speaker. A number of Clarke's works have been recorded on the Naxos Record label most recently with the Grimethorpe Colliery Band. Early life After failing the 11plus (school exam) Clarke attended St. John's Secondary Modern School, Margate, UK, a school aimed at children that would probably not go on to higher education. This could have been an early setback for a musical career, however the school had a strong emphasis on music and in particular brass playing. He went on to be a junior musician (bandsman) at the Royal Marines School of Music in Deal, Kent in 1977, but was unable to complete the course successfully for musical reasons. In 1979 he joined the Staff Band of the Royal Army Medical under the direction of Major Peter Parkes and attended the Royal Military School of Music (Kneller Hall) the same year. In 1982 Clarke started his studies as a composition student at the Royal Academy of Music and also joined the Band of the Irish Guards which he served with until 1986. Clarke feels that some of his early setbacks in life, both at school, and as a junior bandsman in the Royal Marines Band Service are down to the fact that he has dyslexia. He said \\"I was very disruptive at school and music use to calm me down\\".

They were well known in Dallas and instrumental in the revival of the Deep Ellum, Dallas, Texas arts scene of the 1980s where they opened Club Dada as a performance venue. The group was founded in 70s by Joe Stanco and Gary Deen, who began experimentation with performance pieces by banging pots and pans in their living room while they recited poetry. Farley Scott was also a member who joined the group later. The group's original name, \\"Victor Dada and the Ten O'clock Kaon,\\" which came from the street co-founder Joe Stanco lived on in Dallas and the influence of the Dada art movement on the overall irreverent tone of their work. Some of Victor Dada's popular works included the titles His & Herpes, Ranch Style Beans from Outer Space, Monotony, (Take Me Up Your) Love Canal and No Jacuzzi, among many other more serious Dada and nonsense works. Joe Stanco, one of the founding members of the group, died of malignant melanoma on June 5, 2002 bringing an end to Victor Dada's reign as one of Dallas' top performance poetry groups.

It is headed by Dr. Thomas G. Mahnken. According to its website, CSBA's mission is > to promote innovative thinking and debate about national security strategy, > defense planning and military investment options ... [and] to enable > policymakers to make informed decisions in matters of strategy, security > policy and resource allocation. CSBA emphasizes initiatives the United States and its allies can take to wisely invest in the future, even during periods of fiscal austerity and uncertainty. CSBA evaluates its policy proposals through the net assessment methodology, wargaming, and by estimated impact on the Department of Defense budget over multiple Future Years Defense Programs. Background CSBA traces its origins to the Defense Budget Project, which was established by Gordon Adams in 1983 at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in order to \\"fill a vital information gap in the policy debate\\" during the Reagan Administration's defense buildup.\\" In May 1995, the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments was incorporated in its current form. Over the next two decades, CSBA played a prominent role in the debate over the revolution in military affairs (RMA) and the transformation of the US military. Since September 11, 2001, CSBA has focused its analysis on linking near-term requirements to longer term challenges. According to the group's website, CSBA \\"looks out two to three decades to identify emerging security challenges and opportunities.\\" CSBA describes its current efforts as \\"drawing attention to a set of worrisome and profound emerging areas of concern: a rising China threat in the Pacific Theater; a nuclear-armed Iran; maintaining the US defense industrial base; and realigning the defense budget.\\" Over the past few years, CSBA has played a prominent role in the ongoing development of an AirSea Battle concept by the U.S. Air Force and Navy. Following cuts to U.S. defense spending and accelerating foreign military modernization, CSBA has also taken a lead role in highlighting the need to rebalance the Department of Defense's force structure and invest wisely for future challenges. CSBA is a 501(c)(3) non-profit educational organization. The group's public education and research program is funded by grants and contributions from a range of foundations and corporations. The majority of CSBA's income comes from research support under contract with the Department of Defense, military Services, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

Peace Park is the colloquial name for Place de la Paix, which directly translates to \\"Place of Peace\\". Often, even in French newspapers, Place de la Paix is referred to as \\"Parc de la Paix\\".Le VM - Media Transcontinental It is on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and, as such, it follows different by-laws than parks. For example, Peace Park is open to the public at all times, unlike parks with visiting hours.  History  The decision to build Peace Park came during Jean Dor√©‚Äôs administration after he helped Montreal become a Nuclear Free Zone in 1986. With Montr√©al‚Äôs new commitment to peace the mayor Jean Dor√© announced in 1989King, M. (30 October 1989), \\"City will build peace park, Dor√© says\\", Montreal: The Gazette that he would build a place of peace in remembrance of the tragedies of nuclear warfare, located on Saint-Laurent Boulevard in front of the Monument-National and the Montreal Pool Room.

It is largely constructed of granite with grass around granite tiles in the middle, and with trees contouring the park. The park originally had green metal benches under the trees that surrounded the park, but they were removed in 2005 to help with the gentrification of the area. Montreal‚Äôs city officials are trying to \\"clean up\\" Peace Park, meaning that they want to decrease the amount of alcoholics, homeless, drugs, and prostitutes who are there due to its location at the center of the red light district in the heart of Montreal.  Skateboarding  Peace Park has appeared in many skateboard videos, magazine, and books because of its design, which embodies long, high, and wide granite ledges, and stairs. The layout allows for good flow when rolling around the park. Being centrally located in the city of Montreal the park also serves as a meeting place for many skateboarders.MacFarlane, J.(Saturday 25 May 2002. pg. A.1). \\"Cramping their style: City's skateboarders hemmed in by city by law, police;\\" In 2014, the city allowed skateboarding in the park temporarily and in 2015 skateboarding was permanently legalized in the park.Serebrin, J.(Saturday 18 June 2017). \\"Street ride celebrates skateboarding's increasing legitimacy\\", Montreal: The Gazette Previously, skateboarding was not legal in the park; city by-laws were enforced with hefty tickets.Ravensbergen, J.(Thursday 5 March 2009). \\"His Wheel dilemma- a $628 fine\\", Montreal: The Gazette In 2004 the Soci√©t√© des arts technologiques,Soci√©t√© des arts technologiques which is across the street from the Peace Park put together a project with the aim of legalizing skateboarding, by incorporating it with the Quartier des spectacles, but the proposal was initially refused by the city.

In the spring of 2009, he disappeared while apparently on a pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. On 27 September 2009, Tehran Bureau noted conflicting information regarding the date of his disappearance: the Tehran Times claimed that Amiri disappeared on 31 May, but Press TV claimed he disappeared in June. In the same announcement by Tehran Bureau, it was claimed that Amiri conducted research on particle physics at the Malek-Ashtar University of Technology in Tehran and that this institution was controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp. About a year after his disappearance, two videos appeared, each purporting to be declarations by Amiri, but with contradictory stories. One showed him (or the person claiming to be him), stating that he had been kidnapped and tortured by Saudis and Americans; the other that he was in America of his own free will. In July 2010, Shahram Amiri reappeared in Washington, D.C. at the Iran interests section of the Embassy of Pakistan, seeking help to return to Tehran. Shortly thereafter he spoke at a press conference in Tehran, telling journalists he had been kidnapped, tortured and bribed to cooperate with the CIA, but had refused. In 2009, the Iranian government accused the US government of kidnapping him. Later, the Iranian state media reported that he was working as a double agent for Iranian intelligence. After his return to Iran, American sources confirmed he had arrived in, or was taken to, the United States with the help of the CIA, but insisted he had not been taken or kept against his will.\\"Exclusive: Iranian Nuke Scientist Is En Route to Iran\\".

Nevertheless, he was sentenced to ten years in prison after returning. Despite this sentence, he was reported as executed in August 2016, and his body was returned to his family with rope marks around his neck.\\"Amiri hanged?\\", BBC News; accessed 7 August 2016.

In October 2009, Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki suggested the United States may have been involved in his disappearance. On 7 October 2009, Iran's Press TV reported that Mottaki stated, \\"we have evidence of a U.S. role in disappearance of the Iranian national ... in Saudi Arabia. ... There is evidence to suggest the United States was involved\\" in Amiri's disappearance. \\"We hold Saudi Arabia responsible and consider the US to be involved in his arrest.\\"Catherine Philp,\\"Iran says US took nuclear scientist Shahram Amiri\\" The Australian, 9 October 2009. In response, a United States Department of State spokesperson said only that \\"the case is not familiar to us\\". Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hasan Qashqavi stated a day or two earlier that \\"Amiri's fate is Saudi Arabia's responsibility.\\" Saudi Arabia \\"deplored\\" Tehran's charge that he was kidnapped while on pilgrimage. On the other hand, in December 2009, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), Ali Akbar Salehi, denied that Amiri had any links with the AEOI or was ever employed by it. The disappearance is thought by some to be connected to the revelation of a second uranium-enrichment facility near the city of Qom, as his disappearance came three months before the facility was revealed in the news, raising the possibility that Amiri \\"may have given the West information on it or other parts of the nuclear program.\\" The New York Times said \\"sources\\" in Washington confirmed he was an American spy in Iran for several years, even aiding the \\"National Intelligence\\" report in 2007. He then traveled to Saudi Arabia, where the CIA smuggled him out of the country. The Obama administration said that his decision to return to Iran was an embarrassment, and it was concerned that it may undermine efforts to convince other Iranian scientists to work against the country. One official said, > His safety depends on him sticking to that fairy tale about pressure and > torture. His challenge is to try to convince the Iranian security forces > that he never cooperated with the United States. The Iranian Foreign Ministry stated, > We first have to see what has not happened in these two years and then we > will determine if he's a hero or not. Iran must determine if his claims > about being kidnapped were correct or not. The Associated Press also reported American officials saying he has been paid $5 million for \\"significant original information.\\" According to the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat, Mottaki made a formal complaint to U.N. Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon about \\"the disappearances of Amiri and three other Iranians in recent years, some of whom they feared may have provided nuclear information to the West.\\"Iran FM accuses US in nuke scientist disappearance, Associated Press, 7 October 2009. One of these was Ali Reza Asgari, a former deputy defense minister and Revolutionary Guards general who vanished in Turkey in 2007, and may have defected to the US according to \\"subsequent press reports\\". According to The Sunday Telegraph, both Asgari and Amiri were part of a CIA defection program against Iran called \\"the Brain Drain\\", which began in 2005. On 30 March 2010, ABC News reported that Amiri was initially approached via an intermediary, agreeing to defect in a \\"long-planned CIA operation\\" and was then living in the United States. On 13 July 2010, Amiri went to the Embassy of Pakistan (where Iran has an Interests Section) in Washington, D.C. and asked to return to Iran. Senior American officials claimed that Iranian government authorities threatened to hurt Amiri's family in Iran if he did not return to Iran, so he returned home. Amiri claimed he was drugged and kidnapped by American agents in Saudi Arabia, tortured and held for years against his will.\\"Iranian scientist emerges in DC but mystery only deepens\\", The New York Times, 14 July 2010.

He further said that after being carried to the U.S., he had been tortured and pressured to publicly state that he had willfully defected and that Iran had a secret nuclear weapon program. He called on international organizations and human rights groups to pressure U.S. for his release and expressed his wish to return to Iran. A second video was released hours later on YouTube, in which a person who appears to be Amiri without stating whether he was initially abducted, said that \\"I am free here and I assure everyone that I am safe\\", and denied taking action against Iran. He stated that he was safe and wished to continue his education in the U.S., and that \\"I am not involved in weapons research and have no experience and knowledge in this field.\\" A correspondent from the BBC speculated that he may have been reading from a script. The BBC published English-language transcripts of the two videos. \\"Within days, the CIA learned that Amiri had given the Iranians a video and moved quickly to produce a version of its own. The second video shows Amiri well-dressed and manicured with a globe ‚Äì turned to North America ‚Äì and chess set behind him as he appears to read from a teleprompter. He says, in Persian, that he is happily living in the U.S. and going to school. He also denied having worked in the Iranian nuclear program and made a plea to his wife and son. 'I want them to know that I never abandoned then, and that I will always love them.' According to one U.S. official, the CIA intended to produce the video and launch it on the internet before the Iranians had a chance to air their version. Instead, the video languished at CIA headquarters for weeks, according to a senior intelligence official. Then, earlier this month, Iranian state television aired the Amiri video. Within a day, the CIA posted their Amiri video on YouTube, with a user identification of \\"shahramamiri2010\\". Later in June, IRIB interviewed Amiri's wife, in which she expressed serious doubt that Amiri had gone to the U.S. of his own volition. The interview also made clear that despite more than one year of disappearance, Amiri had not contacted his wife and their seven-year-old son. She further called on human rights organizations to pressure the U.S. for Amiri's release.Interview with Amiri's wife and son, part one (in Persian) IRIB News, 23 June 2010Interview with Amiri's wife and son, part two (in Persian) IRIB News, 23 June 2010 On 29 June 2010, the BBC reported that Iranian state TV had shown a video of a \\"man who says he is an Iranian nuclear scientist\\" and \\"claims to have escaped after being abducted by US agents.\\" In the video, the man states \\"I, Shahram Amiri, am a national of the Islamic Republic of Iran and a few minutes ago I succeeded in escaping US security agents in Virginia. Presently, I am producing this video in a safe place. I could be re-arrested at any time.\\" The BBC quotes him as saying he is not free, is not permitted to contact his family, that human rights organizations should pressure the U.S. for his release, and asserting that \\"The second video which was published on YouTube by the US government, where I have said that I am free and want to continue my education here, is not true and is a complete fabrication. If something happens and I do not return home alive, the US government will be responsible.\\" A US official told the AFP news agency the allegations were \\"ludicrous\\", although its state department has refused to say whether Amiri is in the US. Reuters reported on 29 June that earlier that month, Iran, which has no direct diplomatic relations with the United States, summoned the Swiss ambassador in Tehran and handed over documents which Tehran said showed Amiri had been kidnapped by the U.S. On 4 July, the BBC reported on this development, adding that the nature of the documents had not been disclosed. Return to Iran and execution On 13 July 2010, Amiri was unexpectedly dropped off at the Iranian interests section of the Pakistani Embassy seeking assistance returning to Iran. On 14 July, the BBC reported that Amiri was \\"heading home\\" to Iran after asking to be repatriated.BBC NEWS 14 July 2010 He returned to Iran via Turkey, as the United States has no direct flights to Iran. After learning of the developments in the case, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, \\"Mr Amiri has been in the United States of his own free will and he is free to go.\\"Black, Ian. \\"Iranian nuclear scientist Shahram Amiri heads home\\", The Guardian, 14 July 2010 According to the Wall Street Journal, an unnamed Iranian who is familiar with Amiri's case said that Iranian authorities had threatened to hurt Amiri's family if he did not return to Iran. \\"His family has been under tremendous pressure, they even threatened to kill his son. He had no choice but to play the script the regime has given him and return to Iran.\\" A spokesman at Iran's United Nations' mission in New York did not answer requests for comment.

On 15 July 2010, he returned to Iran and was welcomed by Iranian officials, including Foreign Affairs Ministry officials and his family. At a special press conference in Tehran, he said that he had been psychologically mistreated by the US intelligence Agency (CIA) after his kidnapping. \\"They offered me $50 million to cooperate with them and tell the media that I am a very important person in Iran's nuclear programme and have escaped from Iran and politically that I'm a refugee to the US. They wanted me to show a laptop on the TV and say we have obtained very important information on Iran's nuclear weapon programme.

It was reported that he gathered information regarding CIA plans to gather intelligence on the Iranian Nuclear capabilities. U.S. officials disputed this claim, saying that he never had access to classified information.Fassihi, Farnaz.\\"Iran Says Amiri Spied on U.S.\\", The Wall Street Journal, 21 July 2010 Yusuf bin Alawai bin Abdullah, an Omani official involved in the September 2010 release on bail of Sarah Shourd, stated that Iran had been prepared to discuss an exchange of Shourd for Amiri but that \\"at the White House 'not everyone was on board.'\\" Bin Alawai avoided saying that Shourd's release was part of an exchange, but allowed \\"it may have helped\\" that Amiri had returned to Iran.\\"Omani minister discusses talks to release hiker\\" CNN, 17 September 2010 According to NPR news, Amiri was jailed after his arrival in Iran and in May 2011 was \\"on trial for treason.\\"Shuster, Mike. \\"Covert War With Iran: A 'Wilderness Of Mirrors'\\", NPR, 10 May 2011 He was sentenced to ten years in prison. Though others say that he was sentenced to death. On July 6, 2014, Amiri appeared in court, and could tell his relatives that he was then on hunger strike. Some of Hillary Clinton's emails, released in 2016, appear to support claims that he was a defector. On August 2, 2016, there was a last visit, where Shahram Amiri himself informed his parents of his forthcoming death; the next day, his body was returned to the family. Amiri was executed on 3 August 2016, for allegedly providing US Intelligence with vital information about Iran's nuclear program. The news of his execution was first announced by his mother, and later confirmed by the spokesperson for the Iranian judiciary. In 2010, an Iranian film studio said it would produce a telefilm about the Shahram Amiri saga.

Left to right: Susan Test, Gil, Dukey (foreground), Hugh Test, Mr. White, Johnny Test, Mr. Black, ;Lila Test, Sissy Blakely, Mary Test. This is a list of the many characters from the animated television series Johnny Test.  Main characters  Johnny Test Jonathan Xavier \\"Johnny\\" Test (voiced by James Arnold Taylor, PJ Giovani in the web-series): The main protagonist of the show, the brother of Susan and Mary and the son of Hugh and Lila. His best friend is his dog, Dukey, with whom he spends nearly all his time. A troublesome, unpredictable, and widely iconic 11-year-old boy, he is often called the \\"kid with the flaming hair\\" due to having scarlet red highlights in his yellow hair. He is most often seen wearing green cargo pants, a navy blue dress shirt- under which he wears a black shirt emblazoned with a trefoil symbol- a watch that he rarely uses and black hi-tops. Because he has Susan and Mary by his side, Johnny can live any kid's dream, only to find that some dreams aren't worth living: He is very hyperactive, impulsively throwing himself into situations without considering or even flat-out ignoring potential consequences. He often messes with his sisters' inventions, causing trouble and mayhem for the town, but just as often proves himself to be extremely clever, either by convincing his genius sisters to help him solve the problems that he creates or by carrying the day from whatever goodness happens to show up. Johnny is also quite spoiled and stubborn, resorting to deceit, manipulation and blackmail to satisfy his constant desires- such as his addiction to video games- and dramatically or angrily bemoaning when things don't work out to his liking. His catchphrase is \\"Whoa, didn't see that coming\\" during an unexpected event. Despite being generally repulsed by girls, he has nurtured attraction towards his classmates Janet and Sissy, the latter born out of hostile rivalry. Johnny does not like school and typically goes to great lengths to avoid doing work, both at school and around the house, often using his sisters' inventions to do so and putting himself and/or others in danger as a result. He has a superhero alter ego that he calls \\"Johnny X\\", whose superpowers include hurricane hands (speeding wind from his hands), shapeshifting, fire-powered transformation, teleportation, ESP, and \\"Power Poots\\". A running gag for this form is that his hurricane hands never work, either due to the target being immune to it or other factors. Dukey Dukeson \\"Dukey\\" Test (voiced by Louis Chirillo in Season 1‚Äì4, Trevor Devall in Season 5‚Äì6, Tom Wayland in the web-series): Johnny's anthropomorphic 4-year- old talking pet dog and best friend. He is also the voice of reason of the Test Family. The cause of Dukey's anthropomorphism is because of one of Susan and Mary's inventions, thus giving him human-like abilities. When Mrs. and Mr. Test aren't around, Dukey will stand on his hind legs rather than all fours. The reason for this is that Hugh banned Susan and Mary from DNA experiments, which was how they gave Dukey human-like intelligence. There have been a few \\"close calls\\" around the series, such as when Mr. Test got trapped inside of one of Johnny's video games and Johnny and Dukey also went inside the game to rescue him, and Dukey accidentally spoke in front of him, causing Hugh ask, \\"Did Dukey just talk?\\" Every time one of his parents asks this question after Dukey just spoke in front of them, either Johnny, Susan, or Mary answers \\"no\\" and their parents immediately believe them. Sometimes Dukey dresses as a human being when going out in public, and he is addressed by others as Johnny's \\"hairy friend\\" or \\"the kid with the rare hair disorder\\". Dukey can easily be bribed into assisting Johnny in his manipulations with steak. His superhero name was \\"Super Pooch\\" at first, but then changed it to Super Dukey. Super Dukey has superpowers like flight, shapeshifting, power poots, K-9 oral force field, ESP, and teleportation. He usually crashes while flying. Just like Johnny, Intentionally or not, He has a tendency to destroy Susan's and Mary's Inventions. His TinyMon name is \\"Mymuttdog\\" and he evolves into \\"Dukandra.\\" Susan and Mary Test Susan and Mary Test (also known as The Test Twins) ‚Äì Johnny's genius twin sisters and daughters of Hugh and Lila, who frequently use him as a lab rat for various inventions, most of which to impress their neighbor, Gil. Though they generally refuse to help Johnny in his antics, they generally end up doing so anyway due to Johnny blackmailing or manipulating them, or in exchange for Johnny allowing them to use him as a guinea pig. Their hard-headed demeanor makes them gullible, and they have been tricked by Johnny on various occasions. They have a habit of speaking in unison especially when reciting their catchphrase \\"We're such geniuses\\". Both twins wear traditional lab coats and harbor a deep love and obsession for the Tests' next door neighbor, Gil, although their attempts to attract his attention always end in failure. Both girls attend school at the Porkbelly (formally Mega) Institution of Technology. Susan Test Susan Test (voiced by Maryke Hendrikse, Laurie Hymes in the web-series): A 13-year-old girl who is the sister of Mary and Johnny and the daughter of Hugh and Lila. She has navy blue eyes and wears a black skirt, knee-high socks and a pair of Mary Janes, and a light blue shirt depicting a star. She has straight red hair, held with a yellow star-shaped clip, and wears glasses. She tends to be more irritable than Mary is, which often leads to her downfall. In the episode \\"Johnnymon\\", Susan claims she never feels bad for anyone. Thus Susan's emotions are more extreme than her twin's. Eugene/Bling-Bling expresses fond interest in Susan, often causing her to be used as a \\"bargaining chip\\" in his negotiations. When Susan is being pursued by Bling-Bling (despite having no interest at all for him), she tries to bribe Johnny into protecting her. Her Catchphrases are \\"too much?\\" and \\"got carried away.\\" Mary Test Mary Test (voiced by Brittney Wilson in Seasons 1 & 5, Ashleigh Ball in Seasons 2‚Äì4 & 6, Laurie Hymes in the web-series): A 13-year-old girl who is the sister of Susan and Johnny and also the daughter of Hugh and Lila. She has greenish blue eyes and often wears baggy blue jeans and green sneakers with her trademark yellow moon shirt. She has curly red hair, held with a light moon-shaped clip, and wears moon-shaped glasses. Mary has been shown to be more warm-hearted than Susan. She believes less in science and more in science fiction, which proves to be correct, despite Susan's scorn. She is more level-headed and conservative than Susan, and speaks her mind much less often.  Secondary characters  Hugh Test Hubert \\"Hugh\\" Test (voiced by Ian James Corlett): The uptight, obsessive-compulsive stay-at-home father of Johnny, Susan and Mary, and the husband of Lila. He has blond hair, blue eyes, and wears a green sweater over a yellow shirt with brown pants and loafers. He is apparently not very smart, because Dark Vegan is able to perform a mind trick on him, and they only work on dumb people. Hugh's two biggest obsessions are cleaning and cooking meatloaf (which in one instance he's shown to value more than the safety and well-being of his own children), which the rest of the Test family openly despises. He also gets distracted if he loses his shoe, and can't focus on anything if he does, something that Johnny occasionally exploits. He often wants his children to come back before dinner or risk being grounded. He also always grounds them for a month at a time for even the smallest offense or for ridiculous reasons. He will force (including his wife) or trick anyone to get his way;in one instance, He forced his wife to give up all her phones due to vacationing reasons. He outlaws genetic experiments by Susan and Mary in the house, which is mentioned rarely, though frequently defied. In \\"The Return of Johnny'Mon\\", he was mistook as a Tiny'Mon called \\"I'mhisdad\\" (I'm His Dad) and evolves into \\"Dadoomerang\\". Lila Test Lila Test (voiced by Kathleen Barr): The mother of Johnny, Susan and Mary and wife of Hugh. She has brownish- reddish hair, green eyes, and wears a typical women's work suit, pearl necklace and heels. She is a businesswoman, though her specific profession is never explained aside from the fact she works in financing. Due to the demands of her job and the fact she's an workaholic, she isn't seen at home as often as the rest of the family, but her family always comes first and she never misses out on vacations and family events. Being an Workaholic and an great multitasker, she always manages to take her work with her in one way or another. She also possesses great martial arts skills and shown to not be as strict as her husband. Despite not being as strict as her husband and has been sometimes forced against her will to take off work to relax, She has a scary/crazy side that even her husband has shown fear from when he makes mistakes in front of her. Gil Nexdor Gil Nexdor (voiced by Andrew Francis): A pretty boy teenager and Susan and Mary's crush, who doesn't even know they exist, despite having lived next door to him since they were born and even having met them face to face on several occasions. He is continuously depicted as intellectually lacking, although his handsome looks seem to compensate for this most of the time. Much to the great ire of Susan and Mary, Gil considers Johnny his friend (whenever Gil appears when Johnny is around, he shouts, \\"Hey, Johnny!\\"). Due to Susan and Mary's crush, many of their experiments often revolve around him, on some occasions even affecting him directly. However he can never seem to remember their names save for certain occasions. His surname \\"Nexdor\\" is a pun on \\"next door\\", alluding to the fact that he is Johnny's next door neighbor. Mr. Black and Mr. White Mr. Black and Mr. White (voiced by Bill Mondy and Scott McNeil respectively): Secret Agents who ask Johnny, Mary, Susan, and Dukey for help whenever they can not handle a crisis alone, which is most of the time. They seem to be highly incompetent and somewhat slackers at their job. They claim they are not afraid of anything and in their first appearance could shoot ropes from their wrists. Ironically, Mr. White is African American and Mr. Black is Caucasian (likely of Germanic ethnic origin). Despite first appearing as villains, they're now friends to the Test kids on most occasions. They also have a hidden passion for cooking. They also dream of vacation in Fiji and says so in a singsong voice(\\"we are going to Fiji\\") General General (voiced by Lee Tockar): Mr. White and Black's Boss, the General is leader of the area 51.1 army base. Loud, slightly incompetent and forgetful, he frequently takes action whenever the situation becomes too large for the Tests to maintain, although his efforts never fare any better. He is prone to overkill and rarely considers what result his actions may have on civilians, to the point he fired at a forest, an inhabited area, and even a place were the Test kids were playing all in an attempt to destroy a monster. A running gag in the series involves him forgetting something and hesitating to remember. Sissy Blakely Elisabeth \\"Sissy\\" Blakely (voiced by Brittney Wilson in Seasons 1 & 5, Ashleigh Ball in Seasons 2‚Äì4 & 6): An 11-year-old girl who tends to hide her crush for Johnny through bullying and asserting superiority over him. Johnny also has a crush on her, although he doesn't seem to be aware of it or denies it. However, the two are constantly competing against each other. If Sissy beats him, she will brag about it. If Johnny wins, he'll either get caught into a situation because of it, or brag as much as her. In most cases she is seen to be Johnny's equal, if not better than him in certain cases(leading Johnny to cheat to gain the upper hand in most episodes). In one episode, Johnny pretends to be nice and to be used to being bullied by Sissy. They ended up falling in love with each other along with Dukey and Missy. She seems to be the victim to the show's twists, adventures; her misfortune seen at the end of the episode. She has blonde hair with a red lightning bolt pattern, with multiple ear piercings and a plaid skirt with pants underneath. Bumper Randalls Mitchell \\"Bumper\\" Randalls (voiced by Scott McNeil): A local bully who regularly tortures the kids at Johnny's school, though Johnny is his favorite victim; he tortures Johnny more than anyone else. However, he has a sensitive side as he loves roses and even has a rose garden. He has two cats: a white cat called \\"Cuddles\\" and an orange tomcat. He also has a lizard named Mr. Muncher and a dog. His father seems to want him to be a wrestler, but he just wants to grow flowers so he takes his anger out on Johnny. This leads to why he probably bullies all the time. In \\"Johnny X Strikes Back\\" he gains the power to turn to stone and flight. Mr. Henry Teacherman Mr. Henry Joseph Teacherman (voiced by Louis Chirillo (Seasons 1‚Äì4), Trevor Devall (Seasons 5 & 6): Johnny's school teacher, who Johnny believes \\"has it out for him\\" (which he sometimes does). He seems to not believe that any of his students really tries hard enough (and once told his class they might want to learn a trade when passing out an important exam). It is shown that he really likes it if a student fails a test (rarely, he gives his students assignments on topics they never learn), and at times, he has even shown to get sadistic pleasure out of punishing Johnny. Mr. Teacherman is always very tough, but not always to be mean. He believes that deep down, there is a great student inside of everyone, including Johnny. It has shown that even Johnny can't reason or bribe him out of an difficult assignment by him, showing that He can be stubborn and strict.  Recurring characters  Janet Nelson Jr. Janet Nelson Jr. (voiced by Kathleen Barr): Johnny's former crush. She is a shallow and self-centered popular girl that is usually mean and inconsiderate to Johnny and appoints him as a loser. She has a love-hate relationship with him, but she is too popular to express the love part. She appears in the first season, though she does make cameos in the second and third seasons. Hank Anchorman Hank Anchorman (voiced by James Arnold Taylor): An anchorman for Porkbelly News. In his first appearance, he had blond hair, was thinner and younger, but later on, he had brown hair (which was a wig), was older and had a different face. He often reports about the Test family. Mayor Howard Mayor Howard (voiced by Lee Tockar): The Mayor of Porkbelly is a short bald man who still lives with his mother. He easily panics at the first sign of trouble, and will not hesitate to cave into pressure. Whenever a supervillain appears, he would always agree to swear allegiance with the villain and change the name of the city before the villain even says anything. Principal Jules Harm Principal Jules Harm (voiced by James Arnold Taylor): is the principal of Johnny's middle school, and likes Johnny, despite his antics, which have caused large-scale destruction on more than one occasion. He always cuts Johnny some slack (like giving him extra credit to avoid summer school, making Johnny Hall monitor, etc.) and even denies Henry's constant pleas of punishment for Johnny. However, there is always a catch to the deal when he bails Johnny out of trouble; Johnny gotta hold his end of the bargain when he does or he'll reverse the decision (which he rarely does because he always gives Johnny another chance). There are times when Johnny and Henry got on his bad side; leading him no choice but to punish them, much to their dismay. Professor Slopsink Professor Slopsink (voiced by Richard Newman): The German head professor at the Mega (later Porkbelly) Institute of Technology (M.I.T./P.I.T). Due to a mishap with one of Eugene's theses, he lacks a left hand, so now he uses a robotic hand (though Repto-slicer ate that as well).  Mrs. Hamilton  Mrs. Hamilton (voiced by Lee Tockar): is the Mother of Bling-Bling Boy and Mr. Hamilton's Wife. She is very harsh with her son, and is always screaming but is calmed by smooth talk. Tim Burnout Timothy \\"Tim\\" Burnout: A classmate of Susan and Mary and the former owner of Mr. Mittens. He copied the modified genetic structure used by Susan and Mary to create Dukey and used it on Mr. Mittens and his bunny rabbit, which turned him into an evil villain seeking world domination. Despite his lazy personality, he is apparently very intelligent, as he was able to alter Mr. Mittens (despite stealing the idea). His last name refers to the way he acts. Lolo Lolo (voiced by Ashleigh Ball): Susan and Mary's midnight blue lab monkey who they sometimes test their experiments on. She loves bananas and is somewhat intelligent possibly due to the sister's tests. She has a strange metal hatpiece on her head, the reason for which is not explained. Missy Missy (voiced by Ashleigh Ball in Seasons 2, 4, and 6,and Brittney Wilson in Season 5): Sissy's pink labradoodle dog, who seems to show the same amount of dislike to Dukey as Sissy does to Johnny. Despite this Dukey has a crush on her, but often shows the hatred Johnny shows to Sissy. Repto-Slicer Repto-Slicer (voiced by Andrew Francis): A blue-green mutant lizard. He was originally owned and created by Eugene, but decided to stay with Johnny after he tamed him. He earned his name from his ability to have razors protrude from his entire body; he even has a chainsaw for a tongue. He excels at salsa- making. Jillian Vegan Jillian Vegan (voiced by Maryke Hendrikse): Dark Vegan's daughter who doesn't approve of her father's evil ways. She makes friends with Johnny and helps him save his world twice. As of the fourth season she is living comfortably on Earth, having successfully integrated into its culture. Mrs. Vegan Mrs. Vegan (voiced by Ashleigh Ball): Dark Vegan's wife and Jillian's mother who constantly nags about Vegan's plans to take over the world. The Turbo Toy Force The Turbo Toy Force: A group of toys that were animated and given superpowers by Johnny, Dukey, Mary, and Susan to battle Nasteria. The group consists of: Stacy, Nice Sweatered Ben, a toy bunny rabbit, a toy dragon, a chew toy, and formerly Mega Roboticle. Speed McCool Speed McCool (voiced by Lee Tockar): A famous actor. In the movies he is in, he can be seen with a chimpanzee. Johnny is a fan of him and once used a virtual reality machine to get inside one of his films. Montague Montague (voiced by Lee Tockar): An anarchist talking mouse bent on world domination but in actuality, He just wants cheese. He appears in two episodes: in Johnny's Big Dumb Sisters, he makes brief cameos, but in Tom and Johnny, he has a larger role, eventually helping out the Test siblings and Dukey. He becomes an antagonist in one episode where he tries to live in Johnny's house. According to the show, He is a Wild Card to the Tests due to his randomness and his \\"goals\\" Dog Catcher The Dog Catcher (voiced by James Arnold Taylor): The owner of Porkbelly's Animal Control. His first appearance was in the episode \\"Here Johnny, Here Boy!\\" He captured Johnny, Susan, and Mary after using the Animal Machine, which turned them into animals (Johnny into a dog and Susan and Mary into lions). He made minor appearances such as \\"Johnny's 100th Episode\\" where we see that Johnny first adopted Dukey. Fillmore Fillmore (voiced by Lee Tockar): The main clerk in the video game store, Game Galaxy. He made his first appearance in the episode \\"Phat Johnny\\". Johnny sometimes makes fun of him because he's fat (although Fillmore says he has a glandular problem). Villains Bling Bling Boy Eugene Kenneth \\"Bling-Bling Boy\\" Hamilton (voiced by Lee Tockar): A major antagonist and friendly enemy of Johnny and Dukey, preferring to go by name of \\"Bling- Bling Boy\\" (because of his gold jewelry and watches). Most characters usually call him by his real name instead of Bling-Bling Boy because of his immense amount of wealth and ice on his wrists and neck, which annoys him greatly. He is a multi-millionaire with unlimited funds at his disposal. He is also somewhat of a god to the rest of the characters despite having fears of being punished by his mother and being despised by the rest of the characters (Mostly Susan). He has a big crush on Susan, who doesn't reciprocate his feelings, and often resorts to evil plots or blackmail to try and force her to be his girlfriend which mostly fails or backfires due to either by Johnny and the family foiling his plans or his own doing. He occasionally teams up with Johnny and Dukey to defeat the other villains when the situation demands it. He seems to be good friends with Johnny and Dukey, despite being the main antagonist of the series. Similar to his sisters, he occasionally tricks Johnny into testing some of his inventions. Deep down Bling-Bling Boy is insecure due to being fat and having buck teeth although in Phat Johnny his weight and buck teeth actually help Bling-Bling Boy become successful as a hip hop star. He has a mother who punishes him for \\"embarrassing her\\" by plotting his evil schemes and at one point he considers going to jail rather than being in trouble with his mother. He used to also attend the Mega Institution of Technology, but left the school after his thesis ate Professor Slopsink's hand. He later was allowed to return to the Institute in exchange for aiding in preventing a nuclear crisis, finally admitting to missing human interaction. In \\"Johnny X Strikes Back\\" he gains the power of gold vision and flight. Miss X and Miss Z Miss X and Miss Z (voiced by Brittney Wilson in Season 1, Maryke Hendrikse in Season 2): These girls are actually two cyborgs created by Bling Bling Boy to work at their disposal. They can operate and have a mind of their own when Bling-Bling is not around or Bling-Bling is in need. They have high intelligence, capable to study at the Institute Of Porkbelly and avoiding attention. Throughout the seasons, they are more robotic and shown to have more than one pair of them. They only appeared in the first two seasons of the show. Mr. Whack-O Mr. Whack-O (voiced by Colin Murdock): One of the first major villains. Despite being a toymaker, he deeply loathes kids and makes incredibly destructive toys in order to rid the world of them. He seems quite intelligent and quite wealthy; despite of his appearance, behavior, and the bad publicity he brings to his company. He is the leader of the Johnny Stopping Evil Force 5. He has shown to be obsessed of defeating and destroying Johnny and the Tests due to Johnny foiling his plans in the past causing him to go mentally insane. He is so obsessed of Johnny, he'll risk his own safety or other people just to gain an advantage over The Tests. He is somewhat similar to Toyman in \\"Superman.\\" His name is a spoof of Wham-o, a real life toy company, and Whacko, fittingly, means \\"a crazy person.\\" Brain Freezer Brain Freezer (voiced by Louis Chirillo in seasons 1‚Äì4, Bill Mondy in seasons 5 & 6): The former janitor and coffee guy of Susan and Mary's school. He is a self-proclaimed genius, with his inventions typically involving both coffee and ice. He has a \\"Chillachino Machine\\" that can freeze anything including creating armor made of ice. It appears he is immune to the blasts from his freeze gun, as he uses them to transform into his supervillain form by blasting himself but his 'Chillachino' will still freeze him solid if he drinks it. He often makes ice-related puns. In one episode, the reason for villainy is that he's just lonely and that girls rejects him. His personality is similar to that of Mr. Freeze from Batman. The Beekeeper The Beekeeper (voiced by James Arnold Taylor): The Beekeeper is a man in a beekeeper's suit that can control bees. His secret identity is Doc Beebles, maker of Piles 'O Honey Bars. His debut plot was to use his bees to eat all other candy in the world so his Piles 'O Honey Bars would finally sell (none bought his bars because they were naturally sweet and healthy), though he really wanted the kids to be healthier. However, he does help out the Test siblings and Dukey save a holiday that they created. Due to this, he is currently reformed and likes the Tests, and has dropped out of the force to be replaced by Zizrar. He loves saying \\"bee\\" as \\"be\\" as a pun when he's wearing his bee suit. Mr. Mittens Mr. Mittens (voiced by James Arnold Taylor): An evil cat with the same modified genetic structure as Dukey by Susan and Mary's classmate Tim Burnout who owned Mr. Mittens. He once tried to turn the entire world into cats. In an ending of an episode, he claims to want revenge on Johnny. But in reality, he's just lonely like Brain Freezer. Like Dukey, he is highly intelligent but seems to lack Dukey's fighting skills. He also has a butler named Albert.  Albert  Albert (voiced by Lee Tockar): Mr. Mitten's aforementioned butler. Albert isn't seen hating Johnny, but he was forced into the squad because he has to take care of Mr. Mittens all the time (it is debated if he's actually a villain). He is quite calm and down to earth. He has shown that he can't be tickled even by the best inventions (in fact, he broke and overloaded a machine in the process of being tickled). He has also shown to be quite intelligent as well as his master. Zizrar Zizrar (voiced by Scott McNeil): King of the Mole People who often attempts to take over the world only to fail due to his intense aversion to light. He is the first villain Johnny ever fought, but he rarely makes any appearances. He later became Beekeeper's replacement on the Johnny Stopping Evil Force 5 after Beekeeper reformed. Dark Vegan Dark Vegan (voiced by James Arnold Taylor): A rival of Johnny. He is the ruler of Vegandon, a seemingly utopian planet composed completely of the Vegans, which at first appear peaceful and well-meaning, but in reality, they go to other planets and sap them of their resources, which is what he tried to do to Earth on two occasions and nearly succeeded. After his second attack on Earth, he and his family were left stranded on Earth, much to the ire of Vegan and the pleasure of his family. Although Johnny eventually helped him to return to Vegandon, he later returned to Earth and became a regular resident after discovering his planet was incapable of producing his new favorite food: toast. He has a mind- control power which works only on dumb people. He was Jillian's father. Later in the series, He appears as an ally and rare enemy of The Tests(only if they intervene of his plans or Johnny Harms/hurts his daughter in any way). He appears to be a parody of Darth Vader from the Star Wars movies. Lunch Lady Lunch Lady (voiced by Kathleen Barr): The lunch lady at Porkbelly Middle School who has greenish skin and speaks in a German accent. She can be very cruel when students don't eat her disgusting (albeit sometimes healthy) food. She even becomes a nemesis to Johnny in an episode where she tries to destroy him for giving kids applesauce. Minor Characters Extreme Teen Team: Appeared in the episode \\"Johnny Test: Extreme Crime Stopper\\". They stole all the drinks and snacks at a store at night without paying (like all of the other teens they do anything for sugar). At the end of the episode, they were caught and sent to jail. They also made minor appearances throughout the series. Super Smarty Pants: A pair of pants that allow the user to gain higher intellectual abilities. It first appeared in the episode \\"Johnny's Super Smarty Pants\\". It has artificial intelligence and surprisingly, strong obsessive emotions for Johnny. It also has a strong hate for Dukey and The Smarty Pants will harm Dukey every chance it gets. It reappeared in \\"The Return of Johnny Super Smarty Pants\\" all the way from Antarctica to get back Johnny and take control of his brain. Construction Drones: Robots created by Susan and Mary who are used to aid them in building their inventions. Johnny, however, uses them whenever he can to his advantage. They can build everything that they were commanded to do. From tables, benches and pancakes, to giant and advanced tree houses or a houses referencing a horror show. They have the ability to turn their hands to brushes and tools and transform their feet to wheels. They're intelligent, fast and handy. but they do have some weaknesses, such as working so fast and hard makes them to get short-circuited. Mega Roboticle: Johnny's red hero robot action figure that he used Susan and Mary's 'Static Animator' to bring to life. Mega Roboticle is the former leader of The Turbo Toy Force. Moon Fiends (also called Moonsies): the idiotic and evil blue aliens that live on the moon who made their first and only appearance in the episode \\"Johnny Gets Mooned\\". A bunch of evil Moon Fiends attacked Johnny and Dukey in outer space when they came to the moon to do research for Johnny's paper. The army of Moon Fiends ate a lot of spice cheese nachos, which gave them stink gas and fart on Johnny and Dukey. The leader sent all moon fiends, and later mega fiends, to attack the duo, only for Johnny to use the knowledge from his report (and the report itself) to defeat them all and escape. Road Burn: A white and yellow monster truck built by Bling-Bling Boy, he has a golden chassis,diamond rims, and diamond lights; he uses it to impress Susan. But she wasn't interested in it, Bling-Bling Boy then kicks it for not winning Susan's heart, Road Burn suddenly becomes alive and knocks Bling-Bling Boy away. After seeing a poster of a monster truck rally, he follows Johnny And Dukey to the Porkbelly stadium. He is more powerful than any normal monster truck, he can crush monster trucks, withstand flame throwers and missiles, and can even push back monster trucks. He is able to breathe fire out of his mouth and chomp through vehicles. Road Burn later reforms and lets his son go play with Johnny and Dukey. He only appeared in the episode \\"Johnny And The Attack Of The Monster Truck\\". Boyborgs: Robotic machines designed to look like Gil Nexdor, built by Susan and Mary Test. They are the main antagonists of \\"Johnny vs. Super Soaking Cyborgs\\", after they learn that the Twins love Gil more than them and attempt to eliminate him. The Caveman: Appeared on the episode \\"Stinkin Johnny\\". Johnny wants to enter a wrestling competition so that he can win a new HDTV. Before wrestling, Susan and Mary make a costume for Johnny which allows him to spray gas out of his costume. Before the competition, Johnny sprays gas at Bumper, the evil dogs, and his dad. When Johnny was about to spray The Caveman with his costume, he realized that he ran out of perfume and gets chased by The Caveman. Later, Johnny gets kidnapped by the Caveman and Dukey, Susan, and Mary try to rescue Johnny but they get kicked out. Johnny's dad shows up but he gets thrown out as well. When Johnny was about to be beaten up the Caveman, his mom appears to save him. After Johnny's mom beats the Caveman, she saves Johnny and wins $10,000. At the end, Johnny and Dukey both get grounded from TV and Susan and Mary both get grounded from the lab. When Johnny plays baseball with Dukey, he accidentally breaks the new TV and he will be punished again. Blast Ketchup (voiced by Kathleen Barr): The main character of the Tiny'Mon games, Blast Ketchup has dreams of becoming the World's Greatest Tiny'Mon Master. Ever since Johnny was trapped in their world and Blast was defeated by Johnny, it became his goal to defeat Johnny in Tiny'Mon to become the Tiny'Mon champion he self-proclaims deserves. It is easy for him to detect tricks and is not under using dirty tactics to win like kidnapping. He always takes the first words of what people say, mistaking them as Tiny'Mon. He is a parody of Ash Ketchum from the Pok√©mon series. Ed: Blast Ketchup's friend and cheerleader. He always considered everyone as a loser despite showing lack of social skills and experience in Tiny'Mon. Screechereen: Evolved from the almost completely weak Cuddlebuns. She is a legendary Tiny'mon that many believed didn't exist and is incredibly strong. In Return of Johnny'mon, she is brought up as female. She resembles Lugia from the Pok√©mon series. Cuddlebuns: A cute but weak Tiny'mon. In fact, it is the weakest Tiny'mon ever. In Johnny'mon, it is revealed that it can evolve into Screechereen. Baboomerang and Badias: Blast Ketchup's Tiny'Mon. Baboomerang (formerly Kadoomerang) is listed with 1000 Power Point's, while Badias has 1100. Baboomerang appeared as an anthropomorphic baboon he wore armor a belt and a diaper.

He was first thought to be a villain but near the end of the episode, it is discovered that his daughter, Claire, was the real villain. Since he spends most of his time working, he barely has time for her. He is a parody of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, a James Bond supervillain, as they both hold and cuddle a cat while they are planning something nafarious. Claire Nefarius (voiced by Kathleen Barr): A character who appeared in the episode \\"The Quantum of Johnny\\". She is the daughter of Larius Nefarius. In the episode, she had a birthday party and hid to launch missiles into her father's factory (which was nearby) in order to get her dad to spend more time with her. Johnny constantly mentions that she is hot. At the end of the episode, Larius Nefarius learned of his mistake and promised to spend more time with her and act like a father. He started by forbidding her from dating Johnny because she is too young. Mrs. Crabapple (voiced by Maryke Hendrikse): A character who first appeared in the episode \\"Who's Johnny\\". She teaches the \\"special classes\\". Students who appear in her class, like Bumper, are called \\"Bad Apples\\". She made another appearance in \\"Johnny Susan Susan Johnny\\". King Fufassel (voiced by Bill Mondy): A character who appeared in the episode \\"Princess Johnny\\". He is the ruler of Schmuldavia. He was at war with Muldavia's Princess Maribel over corn dog production rights, but Johnny managed to end the war when he pretended to be Princess Maribel and forced him to have a treaty/truce. Princess Maribel (voiced by Ashleigh Ball): A character who appeared in the episode \\"Princess Johnny\\". She looks very identical to Johnny; except she is a girl,(which ironically Johnny finds unattractive) lacks Johnny's hair highlights, and wears a dress. She is the princess of Muldavia. It was at war with Schmuldavia led by King Fufassel. She goes missing and Johnny is recruited by Black & White to masquerade as her until she is found. She's eventually found in the hotel's arcade, dressed like Johnny. Johnny empathizes with her and after finding her after she ran away, threatened her guardian in order to give her more leisure time.

He made several cameo appearances in later episodes. Tyler (voiced by Kathleen Barr): An overweight boy who enjoys eating his boogers. He made his first appearance in \\"Johnny Mint Chip\\". He used to be gross and immature (as seen in the episode \\"Johnny's New BFF\\"), but then became a teenager. He made several cameo appearances throughout the rest of the series. Wendell (voiced by Ashleigh Ball): An boy who enjoys insects. He made his first and only appearance in the episode \\"Johnny's New BFF\\". Dawg & Bone (voiced by James Arnold Taylor and Louis Chirillo respectively): The two characters that came from the TV in Johnny's house, with Susan and Mary's invention. Dawg & Bone try to destroy Johnny and Porkbelly due to the fact that they think they are zombies. Since they live in a cartoon world in a cartoon, their cartoon rules are stronger than Johnny and Dukey, they also can give punishment as much they can take. Johhny and Dukey claims to dislike this show, despite having strong similarities to the show's main characters. In fact, Johnny and Dukey broke the Fourth Wall few times realizing how similar they are but can't put their finger on how or not realizing the simliarities. High-Pitched Hal (voiced by Andrew Francis): A character who appeared in the episode \\"Johnny Tube\\". He is a popular star on Snoobtube (a parody of YouTube) and received a movie deal in Hollywood. Warty (voiced by James Arnold Taylor): Johnny's talking wart who appeared in the episode \\"Johnny's Got a Wart!\\". He started out as a regular wart until he was brought to life. Although Johnny was unsure how, he obtained a wart on his left wrist. Worried, Dukey took him to the Lab, hoping Susan and Mary get rid of it. They shot it with a \\"laser\\", though it failed. Later at school, the wart came to life and became helpful to Johnny: he helped him remember his locker combination, got him an \\"A\\" in math, confronted Bumper by revealing his inner soft side and got Johnny an invite to a party with cheerleaders. After school, Warty grew eyes that Johnny thought was creepy. Warty became evil and took over Johnny's body (by controlling his brain and nerves) and then the world though was stalled since he struggled to control Johnny and couldn't do so until he had complete control of Johnny's brain. Truant Officer (voiced by James Arnold Taylor): A character who appeared in \\"Johnny Test's Day Off\\". Johnny decides to ditch his school after a rough week, until he sees the officer driving by. Johnny and Dukey hid in Lila's car until they were at the Test Sisters' school. Susan & Mary come outside and tell Johnny that they don't want to help him, but the truant officer catches up and puts Susan and Mary into the back of his truck in an attempt to take them to Johnny's school since he doesn't think that they should be in college but Johnny distracts him and Dukey helps them out. The officer chases the 4 throughout the city. Kirk Kirkland (voiced by Scott McNeil): A character who appeared in the episode \\"Johnny Boat Racing\\". Kirk and his team are national champions in boat racing. They challenged Johnny, Dukey, and their friends in a boat race after Johnny questioning why their rowing when nowadays we have motor boats. Willy Keller (voiced by James Arnold Taylor): A minor character who appeared in the episode \\"Johnny Daddy Day\\". He used to be Hugh's best friend when he was 10 years old, until they hated each other after Hugh stole Willy's girlfriend in high school. He made another cameo /appearance in \\"Black & White & Johnny All Over\\" Xeandra (voiced by Maryke Hendrikse): A character who appeared in the episode \\"Fangs A Lot Johnny\\". She is a movie star who appears in a vampire movie in the Porkbelly Movie Theater. Gil Nextor is a huge fan of her. She is a caricature of Kristen Stewart who portrays the fictional character Bella Swan in the Twilight novel series. Joni West (voiced by Kathleen Barr): The female counterpart of Johnny Test. She made her first appearance in \\"Johnny Alternative\\" along with her best friend and female counterpart of Dukey, Dutchy. She and Dutchy teamed up with Johnny and Dukey to get rid of the counterparts of Albert and Mr. Mittens. In the episode, she seemed to like or have a crush on Johnny. Her first thought was disgusting, then later on he ended saving her from being turned into a kitten, she was touched and they almost ended up kissing but Johnny went back to his world. She made another appearance in the web series, starting with the episode \\"The League of Johnnys\\". Dutchy (voiced by Maryke Hendrikse): The female counterpart of Dukey. She made her first appearance in \\"Johnny Alternative\\". She's the pet and the best friend of Joni and has the same personality as Dukey. She has a brief crush on Dukey. Simon and Mark West (voiced by Ian James Corlett and Trevor Devall respectively): The male counterparts of Susan and Mary Test. They made their first appearances on the episode \\"Johnny Alternative\\" when Johnny Test and Dukey were sucked into a portal that sent to them into Simon and Mark's world. Simon and Mark's parents might look exactly the same as Susan and Mary's parents because there is a picture in their house that looks exactly like Lila Test. Betty Crumper (voiced by Brittney Wilson): A minor character that appears in \\"Johnny Alternative\\". She is the female counterpart of Bumper. Eugenia \\"Glam-Glam Girl\\" (voiced by Lee Tockar): The female counterpart of Bling-Bling Boy who makes her only appearance in the episode \\"Johnny Alternative\\". She has a huge crush on Simon, just like the way Bling-Bling Boy has a crush on Susan Test. Phobious McPhobe (voiced by Trevor Devall): A character appearing in \\"Johnny Germ Fighter\\". McPhobe is a famous Hygienist and a scientist who loves to get rid of germs at anytime (he even made bathroom cleaning foams) and wishes to make world a cleaner place. Hugh once (when he was a kid in a camp) got a badge from him for being a clean and careful scout (Hugh explained that after that no body has ever saw him) but it appeared that he quit his job when he sneezed once while he was cleaning the bathroom when he was younger. (McPhobe said that his cleanness got under doubt and he decided to never get back to his work again) after that he built a foam making laboratory, becoming an alone scientist. He first refused to help Johnny and Dukey about getting rid of the germs (telling that he doesn't do this anymore) but finally decided to help them by making an ingredient that can kill the germs but after Johnny accidentally poured down an \\"attracting ingredient\\", it made the germs attack the lab, forcing McPhobe, Johnny and Dukey to escape from the lab and McPhobe destroy the lab with all of the Germs in in. After that, with Hugh's suggestion, he lived with the Test family until his lab was rebuilt. Monty Butterworth (voiced by Ian James Corlett): A spoiled rich kid and an enemy of Bling-Bling Boy and Johnny, who was first seen in \\"Mush, Johnny, Mush\\". The Tickler (voiced by Colin Murdock): is Wacko's twin brother. He has red hair and mechanical arms that he uses to tickle people who threaten him into submission. Unlike his brother, he was more evil and serious and was able to weaken Johnny's chances of defeating him by kidnapping Susan and Mary and taking their weapons so Johnny and Dukey couldn't fight back. However, they succeeded in defeating the Tickler after receiving help from Zizrar (who advices them to use the element of surprise), Dark Vegan (who lends Johnny and Dukey helmets to deepen their voices so they sound more intimidating), Mr. Mittens (who tells Johnny to use amusing and well fitting catchphrases) and Albert (who is the only one who is not ticklish). Jeffy (voiced by Ashleigh Ball): A character first appearing in the episode \\"Johnny's No. 1 Fan\\". He is Johnny's Number 1 fan. At first he was nice to Johnny, but then he goes a little too far. He becomes Dark Vegan's Number 1 Fan at the end of the episode. Clyde (voiced by Scott McNeil): Susan and Mary's pet orangutan. He first appeared in \\"Johnny and Clyde\\". Since he's an orangutan, he copies everything that people do on TV, which causes a lot of trouble for Johnny and Dukey when he learned how to rob banks from watching TV (which is why Susan and Mary told Johnny NOT to let him watch TV).

Cossƒ±o and Miguel A. Sierra Chem. Rev. 2009, Article ASAP The reaction type is of some relevance to organic chemistry because it can explain how certain reactions occur and because it is a synthetic tool in the synthesis of organic molecules for example in total synthesis. It was first described by Manfred T. Reetz in 1971 Dyotropic Rearrangements, a New Class of Orbital-Symmetry Controlled Reactions. Type I Manfred T. Reetz Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English 1971 Volume 11 Issue 2, Pages 129 - 130 Dyotropic Rearrangements, a New Class of Orbital-Symmetry Controlled Reactions. Type II Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English 1971 Volume 11, Issue 2, Date: February 1972, Pages: 130-131 Manfred T. Reetz In a type I reaction two migrating groups interchange their relative positions and a type II reaction involves migration to new bonding sites without positional interchange. Type I rearrangements In type I rearrangements (Y-A-B-X conversion to X-A-B-Y) the two migrating groups are oriented trans to each other and as a result of the rearrangement they migrate to opposite sides. The first example of a dyotropic rearrangement involving a carbon-carbon bond was reported by Cyril A. Grob and Saul Winstein.Organische und biologische Chemie Mechanismus der Mutarotation von 5,6-Dibromcholestan C.A. Grob, S. Winstein Helvetica Chimica Acta Volume 35 Issue 3, Pages 782 - 802 1952 They observed the interconversion of 2 bromine atoms in a certain steroid.

D, 1970, (21),1437-1438 In the transition state both bromine atoms connect symmetrically to both carbon atoms on opposite sides and the reaction is concerted. Stepwise mechanisms in dyotropic reactions have also been investigated. :Dyotropic reaction Barili 1970 In organic synthesis an important application is the conversion of 4-substituted-gamma-lactones to butyrolactones. Type I dyotropic rearrangements also occur around carbon-oxygen bonds, such as the thermal equilibration of RRSi1R3C-O-Si2R3 to RRSi2R3C-O-Si1R3. The 1,2-Wittig rearrangement can also be considered an example of this reaction type. More dyotropic reactions are found involving N-O bonds and N-N bonds. Type II rearrangements Type II rearrangements often involve double hydrogen migration in a carbon skeleton. This reaction type can be found in certain transfer hydrogenations. An example is hydrogen transfer in syn- sesquinorbornene disulfones.Quantitation of proximity effects on rate.

The novel falls into the genre of crime fiction, and was preceded by Koko and followed by The Throat. The book was published by Dutton, won the 1993 Bram Stoker Award and was a 1994 WFA nominee Synopsis In Mill Walk, a caribbean island mostly inhabited by wealthy American and German expats, a little boy named Tom Pasmore views an article about a woman named Jeanine Thielman who was murdered and then dumped in a lake. A few years later, in 1957, Tom takes a ride on a milk cart from his palatial home to a slum street called Calle Burleigh. There he hears the crying of an animal and, searching for this animal, finds a teenaged boy slightly older than him named Jerry and his older sister Robyn. When Tom says that he wants to go home, Jerry attacks him. Tom escapes, but is followed by two boys, Robbie and Nappy, who threaten him with knives. They chase Tom into the street, where he is hit by a car and severely injured. He spends the summer at Shady Mount Hospital in Mill Walk where he lives. He is visited by Lamont von Heilitz, an elderly neighbor; who has taken an odd interest in him, and is rumored to have been a celebrated detective in the 1930s. Tom leaves the hospital at the end of the summer, and spends a year at home, reading, while he recovers. He attends school again and proves to be a rather brilliant, albeit socially awkward student. Five years pass, and by early 1962, Tom has become obsessed with recent homicides in Mill Walk and makes a scrapbook profiling each one. Gloria Pasmore, his mother, finds the scrapbook and is disturbed. She asks Tom's favorite teacher to speak to him on the subject of the notebook. Dennis takes Tom driving, and they talk about the death of a woman named Marita Hasselgard, in full awareness of Dennis' motives for driving him around. Under Tom's orders, Dennis stumbles upon the car in which Marita was shot and killed. Tom sees Lamont von Heilitz at the scene and then leaves. Tom writes a letter to Captain Fulton Bishop, a detective involved in the case of Marita's murder. Victor Pasmore warns Tom to stay away from Lamont, though Tom does not and visits Lamont's house that same day, mailing the letter on the way there. Lamont and Tom both share a passion for solving murders without the aid of policemen, and Tom correctly deduces that Friedrich Hasselgard, Marita's brother, was, in fact, Marita's murderer. Lamont then shares with Tom a case of his own- that of Jeanine Thielman, who Lamont believes was murdered by a man named Anton Goetz, her lover, when she refused to continue seeing him. After getting to know each other, Tom departs from Lamont's house, taking Lamont's journal with him. Using the journal, Tom finds out that Lamont has been following the careers of those involved with the Thielman case. Over the next few days, Gloria Pasmore begins to show signs of mental illness. Friedrich Hasselgard, Marita's never-suspected murderer, is lost at sea while boating. Foxhall Edwardes, a suspect in Marita's murder, is killed in a shootout with two police officers, Mendenhall and Klink, at almost the same time. Mendenhall and Klink are both seriously injured and are committed to Shady Mount. Tom then learns that his own grandfather, Glendenning Upshaw, heard the gunshots that killed Marita on the night it happened. Dennis Handley begins to show concern for Tom at school, and Tom begins to grow closer to Sarah Spence, the classmate who visited him in the hospital. However, she is dating Buddy Redwing, another student at the school. Tom and Gloria visit Glen at his house and are greeted by Glen and his two butlers, Mr. and Mrs. Kingsley. Dr. Bonaventure Milton is also there, though he departs soon after Tom and Gloria arrive, speaking of a problem at the hospital where he works concerning Nancy Vetiver, one of the nurses who used to visit Tom when he was incapacitated. Glen prompts Tom to go to Eagle Lake for the summer, where Jeanine was killed, as it is a beautiful camping site and tourist attraction. Tom agrees to go. Sarah Spence grows distant from her boyfriend Buddy. Tom learns that Lamont doesn't want him to go to Eagle Lake, but Tom doesn't listen to him. Sarah and Tom walk together, and Sarah acts oddly nervous in front of Tom. After the walk, Tom sees a commotion at the hospital and enters, finding out that Mendenhall, one of the officers injured by Foxhall, has died. Tom discusses his theories with Dr. Bonaventure Milton, who disregards them. Tom invites Sarah to go with him and speak to Hattie Bascombe, who he thinks might live at the old slave house across town. He and Sarah drive there, and on the way, he admits that he was the one who wrote the letter to Fulton Bishop. Tom and Sarah see Milton exit Hattie's home, and go inside to talk to her. She says that Milton was talking about Tom himself and telling her not to talk to him. Hattie takes the two of them to see Nancy a few blocks away, who says that she was suspended from her job at Shady Mount because she wouldn't stay away from Mendenhall while he healed, as her nursing style involves a personal connection with one's patients. Sarah and Tom return home. At the Pasmore household, Tom becomes further detached from his parents. Tom hears on the news that Klink, the only surviving officer of the Foxhall Edwardes incident, was killed by a group of criminals when he tried to prevent them from robbing a bank. Tom visits Lamont and shares the recent events with him. Lamont informs him that he was there on Calle Burleigh the day Tom almost died. Tom gets invited to Eagle Lake, Wisconsin, a resort for the founding families of Mill Walk. He flies there along with Sarah Spence, now engaged to Buddy, and her status-conscious parents, by private jet. After an awkward conversation between the four of them, Sarah and Tom go to the back of the plane and have sex for the first time. Tom and the Spences touch down in Grand Forks, a town near Eagle Lake. Their chauffeur is Jerry Hasek, the boy who attacked Tom when he was younger. Tom recognizes and outs him in front of the astonished Spences. The five of them drive into the lodge complex and meet up with the Redwing clan. Tom is to stay in Glen's old cabin with his housekeeper, Barbara Deane, who used to be a nurse at Shady Mount. Tom goes into town and looks at old news articles at the library, searching for more evidence on the Jeanine Thielman case he is working on. He meets a man named Joe Truehart, and gives him a letter for Lamont. Joe doesn't mail the letter, but in fact hands it to Lamont personally, as Lamont is staying nearby to keep an eye on Tom, who is oblivious to Lamont's presence. Tom is deliberately pushed off the sidewalk and into traffic and almost killed by a speeding car, though he does not catch his attacker. He goes back to the lodge complex, and Sarah tells him that she doesn't have feelings for Buddy anymore. The next day, Tom attends dinner with all lodge guests, including dowager Kate Redwing whom Tom asks about Jeanine Thielman. Kate tells him that she can speak about Jeanine later, but refuses to say another word on the subject during dinner. That night, Tom sees somebody creeping around Lamont's lodge with a flashlight. Unbeknownst to Tom, this person is Lamont himself. The next morning, upon returning from his walk, Barbara Deane tells him that Ralph Redwing's bodyguards came by under Buddy's orders to deliver a message to Tom: Stay away from Sarah. Barbara drives Tom into town and tells him that Anton Goetz wasn't Jeanine's killer, because Anton had a limp. Gloria Pasmore saw a man running away from the scene the night Jeanine was killed, and the man she saw did not have a limp. While Tom is walking in town, Jerry, Robbie, and Nappy pick him up in their car. Jerry tells Tom not to mention the howling, crying dog he heard on the day Tom was hit by a car years ago. They bring Tom to Buddy, who warns him once more to stay away from Sarah. The two struggle, and Tom incapacitates Buddy before escaping. Tom talks to Sarah about Jerry and she is displeased. He then sends another letter to Lamont via Joe Truehart, and goes to see Kate Redwing at her lodge. Kate tells Tom that the man Gloria saw was not Anton Goetz, clearing Anton's name, though Tom remarks that it doesn't really matter- shortly after Jeanine's death, Anton was found hanging by his neck from a rafter in his house. Tom has dinner with the guests again, and they treat him coldly on account of the happenings between Tom and Buddy. At the lodge, Tom calls his grandfather, Glen, and their phone call is interrupted when a bullet smashes his window and nearly kills him. Glen and the investigating officer, Spychalla (the deputy chief of police), both agree that it was a wild shot from a hunter. The next day, Tim Truehart (the chief of police), rules out Buddy Redwing as the shooter, though Tim believes that the shot wasn't wild. The summer passes rather uneventfully after that. Tom finds countless letters from Sarah in his mailbox, as her parents have forbidden her to speak to him. Tom tries to call Sarah but Mr. and Mrs. Spence hang up on him. Their next group dinner is stressful and awkward. Later, Tom's schoolyard friend, Fritz Redwing, arrives in Grand Forks. Tom talks with Fritz and tells him about his relationship with Sarah. Despite familial pressure, Fritz supports him. Tom goes to Barbara's house. Entering to search for her, he finds several notes from Jeanine Thielman accusing the reader of murder: \\"I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE... YOU MUST BE STOPPED... YOU WILL PAY FOR YOUR SIN.\\" He also finds many newspapers accusing Barbara of several homicides over the past few years. Tom realizes that Barbara is the murderer- she killed Jeanine and then, when Anton confronted her after Lamont accused Anton of the crime, Barbara killed Anton as well and made it look like a suicide. Tom also believes that Barbara murdered Mendenhall by slipping him the wrong medication while she was on her shift at Shady Mount. Tom, Sarah, and Fritz drive to an out-of-business shed leased by the Redwings and find Nappy surrounded by many stolen items before returning anxiously back to the lodge complex. Tom is unable to reach Glen or Lamont by phone. He calls the police station about the stolen items and they turn him down. Lamont finally makes himself known to Tom at the end of the day, and he tells Tom that Tim Truehart arrested Nappy and returned the stolen items. He also reveals to Tom that Lamont is his real father and that Gloria Upshaw, his mother, was forced to marry Victor Pasmore to suppress scandal. Tom meets Sarah at his house after speaking with Lamont, and he tells her that she must keep his and Lamont's meeting a secret. That night, Tom and Sarah sleep together in the basement of Tom's lodge. When they wake up, the lodge is ablaze, and Tom saves Sarah from the blaze, however he is too late to save Barbara Deane, who burns to death in the inferno. He is committed to the hospital with severe burns. Lamont tells him that Sarah is okay, and that Ralph Redwing and his wife left for Venezuela, as well as that Jerry and Robbie, the arsonists, had stolen a car and crashed it into a ditch before being arrested. Tom is discharged from the hospital but fakes his own death so that he's no longer under the control of Victor, Gloria, and Glen. Lamont tells Tom of a string of murders involving the words BLUE ROSE written near those killed. Attacked were 4 major characters: A prostitute, a gay piano player, a gay doctor, and a butcher. The doctor survived, and Tom is surprised to learn that the doctor is Buzz, Roddy's partner. The man who was investigating these cases killed himself soon after the butcher's death. In Tom and Lamont's hotel, Tom finds a newspaper detailing his own death. He realizes then that Glen Upshaw is the killer, not Barbara. He killed Jeanine after she threatened to expose his political corruption and the fact that he had made Gloria, his daughter, then a little girl, his sex slave. When Anton was blamed for the crime, Magda, Tom's grandmother, found out what a horrible person Glen was, and in a depressive state, waded into the lake and drowned herself. Tom and Lamont write I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE over and over on pieces of paper, copying Barbara Deane's notes, and mail them to Glen in order to \\"rattle his cage\\". Lamont lends Tom \\"The Divided Man\\", a novelization of the Blue Rose murders written by Timothy Underhill. Andr√©s, Lamont's helper, drives Tom and Lamont to Glen's house and they watch his shocked expression as he opens their letters. They see him argue briefly with Fulton Bishop before they leave. The two learn that Jerry hired his friend, a man named Schilling, to shoot at Tom when he looked out the window. Tom calls Sarah, but he hangs up without saying anything. He then tries to call his mother, but the phone is answered by Dr. Milton, so he hangs up again. Lamont goes to meet Officer Natchez at a coffeeshop while Tom remains in the hotel room. When he doesn't return, Andr√©s drives Tom to Lamont's house, where Tom finds a huge mess as well as Lamont's corpse. Tom and Andr√©s smell cigars at the crime scene, proving that Glen was Lamont's killer. They speak with Natchez, who goes with them to Glen's house. The Kingsleys tell them that Glen departed after taking a call from Deputy Spychalla. It turns out that when Spychalla told Glen that they had caught the men who set Tom's lodge on fire, Glen believed he had nothing to hide from anymore and went to see Carmen Bishop, Fulton's sister, not far from where Nancy Vetiver lives. The three of them (Tom, Natchez, and Andr√©s) travel to the Third Court in search of Glen, who they discover was a lover of both Barbara Deane and Carmen Bishop to make himself blend in. His relationship with Carmen allowed him to corrupt Fulton and indirectly take control of the police force. In the Third Court, Natchez provokes Glen by shouting the text from Jeanine's notes. Glen fires at Tom with a pistol but misses. Natchez shoots Glen in the head, killing him as Carmen Bishop watches from the sidelines. Glen's body is taken back to his house. He had placed all filed evidence of his crimes at the house of Jerry Hasek. The three make Glen's death look like a suicide by placing his body in a position with the gun against his temple, where Natchez shot him. The Redwings travel to Switzerland and Ralph Redwing gives Fulton Bishop (who apparently escaped punishment) a job overseas. Buddy and Sarah are no longer engaged. The final scene of the book shows Tom and Sarah reuniting at the Mill Walk Zoo, and beginning their relationship together. Blue Rose Together with Koko and The Throat, Mystery forms a series of novels often referred to as the \\"Blue Rose Trilogy.\\" Though the novels feature similar themes and many of the same characters, they do not take place in strict continuity with each other; for instance, the main character of Mystery, Tom Pasmore, goes on to appear in The Throat and two other novels, but a major element of Tom's backstory- a childhood accident that left him hospitalized and incapacitated for several months- is transplanted to the main character of those novels, a writer and Vietnam veteran named Tim Underhill. A similar accident actually happened to the author himself as a child. The title \\"Blue Rose\\" refers to the signature of a serial killer who committed a series of murders in Underhill's hometown (the words Blue Rose were written on walls near the bodies of each victim). The murders are only briefly mentioned in Koko and Mystery, but become the central focus of The Throat.

The episode premiered on the Fox network on October 7, 2009. It was written by series creator Ryan Murphy and directed by Elodie Keene. In the episode, glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) pits the male and female club members against each other for a mash-up competition. Will's wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) takes a job as the school nurse to stop him becoming closer to guidance counsellor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), but is fired after giving the students performance-enhancing pseudoephedrine tablets. The episode features mash-up covers of \\"It's My Life\\" by Bon Jovi and \\"Confessions Part II\\" by Usher, and \\"Halo\\" by Beyonc√© Knowles and \\"Walking on Sunshine\\" by Katrina and the Waves. Both tracks were released as singles, available for digital download. \\"Vitamin D\\" was watched by 7.30 million US viewers, and received generally positive reviews from critics. Performances by Morrison, Mays and Jane Lynch as cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester attracted praise, as did the staging of the musical mash-ups. However, Aly Semigran of MTV and Mandi Bierly of Entertainment Weekly both noted critically that dramatic storylines in the episode dominated over the musical performances. Plot Believing the glee club members are becoming complacent ahead of the forthcoming sectionals, director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) divides the club into boys against girls for a mash-up competition. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) observes that head cheerleader Quinn Fabray's (Dianna Agron) performance standards are slipping. When Quinn blames her tiredness on her glee club participation, Sue renews her resolve to destroy the club, planning to sabotage Will's personal life. Sue tells Will's wife Terri Schuester (Jessalyn Gilsig) that guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) has romantic feelings for Will. Determined to stay close to her husband, Terri takes a job as the school nurse, despite having no medical qualifications. She encourages Emma's boyfriend, football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) to propose to her, which he does. After asking Will if there is any reason she should not marry Ken, and being warned off Will by Terri, Emma accepts his proposal. Terri is still hiding the fact she experienced a hysterical pregnancy from Will, and upon realizing how much her life is changing due to her pregnancy, Quinn agrees to let Terri secretly adopt her baby. Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) is exhausted by his extra- curricular activities, so Terri gives him pseudoephedrine tablets, which Finn shares with the rest of the males in the glee club. The effects of the tablets enhance their performance, and they give an energetic mash-up of \\"It's My Life and \\"Confessions Part II\\". When Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) tells the girls the secret behind the boys' performance, they, too, request the tablets from Terri, and give a high-spirited mash-up of \\"Halo\\" and \\"Walking On Sunshine\\". Finn and Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) feel guilty for cheating, however, and agree to nullify the competition. When Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) learns what has happened, he fires Terri and, angry with Will, appoints Sue as co- director of the glee club. Production Before filming \\"Vitamin D\\", Michele practiced speaking \\"manically\\" for several days in order to convey the effects of pseudoephedrine on Rachel. Recurring characters who appear in \\"Vitamin D\\" are glee club members Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton), former glee club director Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky), Principal Figgins (Theba), football coach Ken Tanaka (Gallagher), Terri's co-worker Howard Bamboo (Kent Avenido), and local news anchors Rod Remington (Bill A. Jones) and Andrea Carmichael (Earlene Davis). Joe Hursley guest stars as Joe. The episode features mash-up covers of \\"It's My Life\\" by Bon Jovi and \\"Confessions Part II\\" by Usher, and \\"Halo\\" by Beyonc√© Knowles and \\"Walking on Sunshine\\" by Katrina and the Waves. Both tracks were released as singles, available for digital download. \\"It's My Life / Confessions Part II\\" charted at number 7 in Ireland, 14 in the UK, 22 in Australia, 25 in Canada and 30 in America, while \\"Halo / Walking on Sunshine\\" charted at number 4 in Ireland, 9 in the UK, 10 in Australia, 28 in Canada and 40 in America. Michele has revealed that she practiced talking \\"manically\\" for several days in order to convey the effects of pseudoephedrine on Rachel. In order to portray the character in her altered state, she questioned: \\"How manic is the right amount of manic? What would Rachel be like on uppers? What would she sound like?\\" She deemed performing the mash-up piece in that state \\"so much fun\\". Reception The episode was watched by 7.30 million U.S. viewers and attained a 3.2/8 rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Glee maintained its ratings from the previous week, despite all of the other new Wednesday night shows of the season declining by double-digit percentages. It was the eighteenth most watched show in Canada for the week of broadcast, with 1.61 million viewers. In the UK, the episode was watched by 2.008 million viewers (1.608 million on E4, and 400,000 on E4+1), becoming the most-watched show on E4 and E4 +1 for the week, and the most-watched show on cable for the week, as well as the most-watched episode of the series at the time. \\"Vitamin D\\" was nominated for the best \\"Comedy Series Episode\\" award at the 2010 PRISM Awards. It received generally positive reviews from critics. Shawna Malcom of the Los Angeles Times noted that she preferred the boys' performance to the girls', commenting: \\"Their number had the same heart-soaring power as \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" [performed in the pilot episode].\\" Malcom enjoyed Sue's character development in the episode, claiming that, \\"In less skilled hands, there‚Äôs no doubt Sue would be an over-the-top disaster. But thanks to the incomparable Jane Lynch, I can‚Äôt wait to see what trouble the character stirs up next.\\" Aly Semigran of MTV also enjoyed the boys' performance more than the girls', and gave the episode a mostly positive review, writing that it moved the series' storylines to \\"a whole new level\\". She felt, however, that the episode \\"didn't have nearly enough singing\\". Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly similarly noted that: \\"So much happened in this hour that the musical numbers, though enjoyable, were almost an afterthought.\\" Bierly favoured the girls' performance, and praised Morrison's acting, commenting: \\"Matthew Morrison communicates so much with his eyes. There‚Äôs a softness and a longing in them that I‚Äôm always surprised Emma (Jayma Mays) matches.\\" Mike Hale for the New York Times praised Mays' performance, noting: \\"Jayma Mays registered Emma‚Äôs devastation with just the slightest widening of those enormous eyes. In fact all the best non-singing moments in the episode were hers.\\" Hale was less impressed with the rest of the episode, deeming the pregnancy storyline \\"so boring that it hardly mattered\\". He noted that: \\"For many viewers, the best moments in the episode probably came very early on and involved Jane Lynch‚Äôs Sue Sylvester, who still got all the best lines.\\" Jarett Wieselman for the New York Post agreed with this assessment, opining that although the episode was \\"filled with more brilliant moments than ever before\\", the stand-out scene was Sue writing in her journal, which Wieselman deemed \\"jam-packed with so many one liners, it acted as a vacuum, sucking the smart out of everything else on TV from 9:05 to 9:07 pm.\\" Fellow New York Post critic Maxine Shen deemed the episode her favorite of the series so far. Anna Pickard of The Guardian called the pseudoephedrine storyline \\"relentlessly silly [...] but joyfully so\\", preferring the boys' performance to the girls' as \\"some excellent comedy helped me forget about Finn's dodgy autotuned vocals for once\\".

Fredericks Sculpture Museum is an art museum that focuses on the life and works of sculptor Marshall Fredericks. The museum is affiliated with Saginaw Valley State University, and is located in university's Arbury Fine Arts Center in University Center, Michigan. Admission is free. History Mrs. Dorothy (Honey) Arbury of Midland, Michigan studied with sculptor Marshall Fredericks when she attended Kingswood School at the Cranbrook Educational Community in Bloomfield Hills in the 1930s. She also knew him through her uncle, Alden B. Dow, a prominent Midland architect with whom Fredericks worked on architectural sculpture projects. Honey Arbury was on the founding Board of Control at Saginaw Valley College in 1965 and remained active on that Board and the SVSU Foundation Board into the 1990s. Honey Arbury and her husband Ned Arbury and Mr. and Mrs. Fredericks generated the idea to have a permanent exhibit of Fredericks' work at the College. The Board of Control, the College and the Arburys worked together on an agreement to have the Marshall M. Fredericks Sculpture Gallery built within and adjacent to the new facilities for the art, music, and theatre departments. The Gallery, renamed Marshall M. Fredericks Sculpture Museum in 1999, opened to the public in the new Arbury Fine Arts Center in May 1988. Features Main Exhibit Gallery The Main Exhibit Gallery includes about 200 works, mostly plaster models, which span a career of over 70 years. The centerpiece is a 28-foot tall Christ statue on the south wall of the museum. Special Exhibitions The temporary exhibition galleries feature changing exhibitions of international, national, regional and Michigan artists and showcase works from the Museum collection. Exhibitions change every few months, and have included paintings, prints, sculpture, ceramics, quilts, drawings, photography and fine craft. Sculptor‚Äôs Studio The Sculptor‚Äôs Studio is a permanent exhibit of Fredericks‚Äô authentic objects, tools, and equipment arranged in a sequence to explain the casting process in a sculptor‚Äôs studio environment. Archives The Archives project was initiated in 2005, following receipt of the business and personal records from Fredericks‚Äô Birmingham home and Royal Oak studio in 2000. Saginaw Valley State University and the Marshall M. Fredericks Sculpture Museum are proud to be the recipient of this important archival collection. Sculpture Garden The Sculpture Garden, adjacent to the Museum, includes a growing collection of more than 20 bronze casts of Fredericks‚Äô sculptures.

The search for extremum principles for non-equilibrium thermodynamics follows their successful use in other branches of physics.Ziegler, H., (1983).

According to Glansdorff and Prigogine (1971, page 16), irreversible processes usually are not governed by global extremal principles because description of their evolution requires differential equations which are not self-adjoint, but local extremal principles can be used for local solutions.

(1997). The Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Continuous Media, Springer, Berlin, , page 209. offers the opinion that \\"... the extremum principles of thermodynamics ... do not have any counterpart for [non-equilibrium] steady states (despite many claims in the literature).\\" It follows that any general extremal principle for a non-equilibrium problem will need to refer in some detail to the constraints that are specific for the structure of the system considered in the problem. Fluctuations, entropy, 'thermodynamics forces', and reproducible dynamical structure Apparent 'fluctuations', which appear to arise when initial conditions are inexactly specified, are the drivers of the formation of non-equilibrium dynamical structures. There is no special force of nature involved in the generation of such fluctuations. Exact specification of initial conditions would require statements of the positions and velocities of all particles in the system, obviously not a remotely practical possibility for a macroscopic system. This is the nature of thermodynamic fluctuations. They cannot be predicted in particular by the scientist, but they are determined by the laws of nature and they are the singular causes of the natural development of dynamical structure. It is pointed outGrandy, W.T., Jr (2004). Time evolution in macroscopic systems. I: Equations of motion. Found. Phys. 34: 1-20. See .Grandy, W.T., Jr (2004). Time evolution in macroscopic systems.

Grandy Jr that entropy, though it may be defined for a non-equilibrium system, is when strictly considered, only a macroscopic quantity that refers to the whole system, and is not a dynamical variable and in general does not act as a local potential that describes local physical forces. Under special circumstances, however, one can metaphorically think as if the thermal variables behaved like local physical forces. The approximation that constitutes classical irreversible thermodynamics is built on this metaphoric thinking. As indicated by the \\" \\" marks of Onsager (1931), such a metaphorical but not categorically mechanical force, the thermal \\"force\\", X_{th}, 'drives' the conduction of heat. For this so-called \\"thermodynamic force\\", we can write :::::X_{th} = - \\\\frac{1}{T} abla T. Actually this thermal \\"thermodynamic force\\" is a manifestation of the degree of inexact specification of the microscopic initial conditions for the system, expressed in the thermodynamic variable known as temperature, T. Temperature is only one example, and all the thermodynamic macroscopic variables constitute inexact specifications of the initial conditions, and have their respective \\"thermodynamic forces\\". These inexactitudes of specification are the source of the apparent fluctuations that drive the generation of dynamical structure, of the very precise but still less than perfect reproducibility of non-equilibrium experiments, and of the place of entropy in thermodynamics. If one did not know of such inexactitude of specification, one might find the origin of the fluctuations mysterious. What is meant here by \\"inexactitude of specification\\" is not that the mean values of the macroscopic variables are inexactly specified, but that the use of macroscopic variables to describe processes that actually occur by the motions and interactions of microscopic objects such as molecules is necessarily lacking in the molecular detail of the processes, and is thus inexact. There are many microscopic states compatible with a single macroscopic state, but only the latter is specified, and that is specified exactly for the purposes of the theory. It is reproducibility in repeated observations that identifies dynamical structure in a system. E.T. JaynesJaynes, E.T. (1985). Macroscopic prediction, in Complex Systems - Operational Approaches in Neurobiology, edited by H. Haken, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, pp. 254-269 . explains how this reproducibility is why entropy is so important in this topic: entropy is a measure of experimental reproducibility. The entropy tells how many times one would have to repeat the experiment in order to expect to see a departure from the usual reproducible result. When the process goes on in a system with less than a 'practically infinite' number (much much less than Avogadro's or Loschmidt's numbers) of molecules, the thermodynamic reproducibility fades, and fluctuations become easier to see.Wang, G.M., Sevick, E.M., Mittag, E., Searles, D.J., Evans, D.J. (2002) Experimental demonstration of violations of the Second Law of Thermodynamics for small systems and short time scales, Physical Review Letters 89: 050601-1 - 050601-4. According to this view of Jaynes, it is a common and mystificatory abuse of language, that one often sees reproducibility of dynamical structure called \\"order\\".Dewar, R.C. (2005). Maximum entropy production and non- equilibrium statistical mechanics, pp. 41-55 in Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics and the Production of Entropy, edited by A. Kleidon, R.D. Lorenz, Springer, Berlin. . Dewar writes \\"Jaynes considered reproducibility - rather than disorder - to be the key idea behind the second law of thermodynamics (Jaynes 1963,Jaynes, E.T. (1963). pp. 181-218 in Brandeis Summer Institute 1962, Statistical Physics, edited by K.W. Ford, Benjamin, New York. 1965, 1988,Jaynes, E.T. (1988).

Smith, Kluwer, Dordrecht, volume 1 . 1989Jaynes, E.T. (1989). Clearing up mysteries, the original goal, pp. 1-27 in Maximum entropy and Bayesian methods, Kluwer, Dordrecht.).\\" Grandy (2008) in section 4.3 on page 55 clarifies the distinction between the idea that entropy is related to order (which he considers to be an \\"unfortunate\\" \\"mischaracterization\\" that needs \\"debunking\\"), and the aforementioned idea of Jaynes that entropy is a measure of experimental reproducibility of process (which Grandy regards as correct). According to this view, even the admirable book of Glansdorff and Prigogine (1971) is guilty of this unfortunate abuse of language. Local thermodynamic equilibrium Various principles have been proposed by diverse authors for over a century. According to Glansdorff and Prigogine (1971, page 15),Glansdorff, P., Prigogine, I. (1971). Thermodynamic Theory of Structure, Stability and Fluctuations, Wiley-Interscience, London. in general, these principles apply only to systems that can be described by thermodynamical variables, in which dissipative processes dominate by excluding large deviations from statistical equilibrium. The thermodynamical variables are defined subject to the kinematical requirement of local thermodynamic equilibrium. This means that collisions between molecules are so frequent that chemical and radiative processes do not disrupt the local Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of molecular velocities. Linear and non-linear processes Dissipative structures can depend on the presence of non-linearity in their dynamical r√©gimes. Autocatalytic reactions provide examples of non-linear dynamics, and may lead to the natural evolution of self-organized dissipative structures. Continuous and discontinuous motions of fluids Much of the theory of classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics is concerned with the spatially continuous motion of fluids, but fluids can also move with spatial discontinuities. Helmholtz (1868)Helmholtz, H. (1868). On discontinuous movements of fluids, Philosophical Magazine series 4, vol. 36: 337-346, translated by F. Guthrie from Monatsbericht der koeniglich preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin April 1868, page 215 et seq. wrote about how in a flowing fluid, there can arise a zero fluid pressure, which sees the fluid broken asunder. This arises from the momentum of the fluid flow, showing a different kind of dynamical structure from that of the conduction of heat or electricity. Thus for example: water from a nozzle can form a shower of droplets (Rayleigh 1878, and in section 357 et seq. of Rayleigh (1896/1926)Strutt, J.W. (Baron Rayleigh) (1896/1926). Section 357 et seq. The Theory of Sound, Macmillan, London, reprinted by Dover, New York, 1945.); waves on the surface of the sea break discontinuously when they reach the shore (Thom 1975Thom, R. (1975). Structural Stability and Morphogenesis: An outline of a general theory of models, translated from the French by D.H. Fowler, W.A. Benjamin, Reading Ma, ). Helmholtz pointed out that the sounds of organ pipes must arise from such discontinuity of flow, occasioned by the passage of air past a sharp-edged obstacle; otherwise the oscillatory character of the sound wave would be damped away to nothing. The definition of the rate of entropy production of such a flow is not covered by the usual theory of classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics. There are many other commonly observed discontinuities of fluid flow that also lie beyond the scope of the classical theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, such as: bubbles in boiling liquids and in effervescent drinks; also protected towers of deep tropical convection (Riehl, Malkus 1958), also called penetrative convection (Lindzen 1977Lindzen, R.S. (1977). Some aspects of convection in meteorology, pp. 128-141 in Problems of Stellar Convection, volume 71 of Lecture Notes in Physics, Springer, Berlin, .). Historical development W. Thomson, Baron Kelvin William Thomson, later Baron Kelvin, (1852 a,Thomson, William (1852 a). \\"On a Universal Tendency in Nature to the Dissipation of Mechanical Energy\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for April 19, 1852 [This version from Mathematical and Physical Papers, vol. i, art. 59, pp. 511.] 1852 b) wrote \\"II. When heat is created by any unreversible process (such as friction), there is a dissipation of mechanical energy, and a full restoration of it to its primitive condition is impossible. III. When heat is diffused by conduction, there is a dissipation of mechanical energy, and perfect restoration is impossible. IV. When radiant heat or light is absorbed, otherwise than in vegetation, or in a chemical reaction, there is a dissipation of mechanical energy, and perfect restoration is impossible.\\" In 1854, Thomson wrote about the relation between two previously known non- equilibrium effects. In the Peltier effect, an electric current driven by an external electric field across a bimetallic junction will cause heat to be carried across the junction when the temperature gradient is constrained to zero. In the Seebeck effect, a flow of heat driven by a temperature gradient across such a junction will cause an electromotive force across the junction when the electric current is constrained to zero. Thus thermal and electric effects are said to be coupled. Thomson (1854)Thomson, W. (1854). On a mechanical theory of thermo-electric currents, Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh pp. 91-98. proposed a theoretical argument, partly based on the work of Carnot and Clausius, and in those days partly simply speculative, that the coupling constants of these two effects would be found experimentally to be equal. Experiment later confirmed this proposal. It was later one of the ideas that led Onsager to his results as noted below. Helmholtz In 1869, Hermann von Helmholtz stated his Helmholtz minimum dissipation theorem,Helmholtz, H. (1869/1871). Zur Theorie der station√§ren Str√∂me in reibenden Fl√ºssigkeiten, Verhandlungen des naturhistorisch- medizinischen Vereins zu Heidelberg, Band V: 1-7. Reprinted in Helmholtz, H. (1882), Wissenschaftliche Abhandlungen, volume 1, Johann Ambrosius Barth, Leipzig, pages 223-230 subject to a certain kind of boundary condition, a principle of least viscous dissipation of kinetic energy: \\"For a steady flow in a viscous liquid, with the speeds of flow on the boundaries of the fluid being given steady, in the limit of small speeds, the currents in the liquid so distribute themselves that the dissipation of kinetic energy by friction is minimum.\\"from page 2 of Helmholtz 1869/1871, translated by Wikipedia editor. In 1878, Helmholtz, like Thomson also citing Carnot and Clausius, wrote about electric current in an electrolyte solution with a concentration gradient. This shows a non-equilibrium coupling, between electric effects and concentration-driven diffusion. Like Thomson (Kelvin) as noted above, Helmholtz also found a reciprocal relation, and this was another of the ideas noted by Onsager. J. W. Strutt, Baron Rayleigh Rayleigh (1873) (and in Sections 81 and 345 of Rayleigh (1896/1926)) introduced the dissipation function for the description of dissipative processes involving viscosity. More general versions of this function have been used by many subsequent investigators of the nature of dissipative processes and dynamical structures. Rayleigh's dissipation function was conceived of from a mechanical viewpoint, and it did not refer in its definition to temperature, and it needed to be 'generalized' to make a dissipation function suitable for use in non- equilibrium thermodynamics. Studying jets of water from a nozzle, Rayleigh (1878, 1896/1926) noted that when a jet is in a state of conditionally stable dynamical structure, the mode of fluctuation most likely to grow to its full extent and lead to another state of conditionally stable dynamical structure is the one with the fastest growth rate. In other words, a jet can settle into a conditionally stable state, but it is likely to suffer fluctuation so as to pass to another, less unstable, conditionally stable state. He used like reasoning in a study of B√©nard convection.Strutt, J.W. (Baron Rayleigh) (1916). On convection currents in a horizontal layer of fluids, when the higher temperature is on the under side, The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine series 6, volume 32: 529-546. These physically lucid considerations of Rayleigh seem to contain the heart of the distinction between the principles of minimum and maximum rates of dissipation of energy and entropy production, which have been developed in the course of physical investigations by later authors. Korteweg Korteweg (1883) gave a proof \\"that in any simply connected region, when the velocities along the boundaries are given, there exists, as far as the squares and products of the velocities may be neglected, only one solution of the equations for the steady motion of an incompressible viscous fluid, and that this solution is always stable.\\" He attributed the first part of this theorem to Helmholtz, who had shown that it is a simple consequence of a theorem that \\"if the motion be steady, the currents in a viscous [incompressible] fluid are so distributed that the loss of [kinetic] energy due to viscosity is a minimum, on the supposition that the velocities along boundaries of the fluid are given.\\" Because of the restriction to cases in which the squares and products of the velocities can be neglected, these motions are below the threshold for turbulence. Onsager Great theoretical progress was made by Onsager in 1931 and in 1953. Prigogine Further progress was made by Prigogine in 1945 and later.Prigogine, I. (1947). √âtude thermodynamique des Phenom√®nes Irr√©versibles, Desoer, Li√®ge. Prigogine (1947) cites Onsager (1931). Casimir Casimir (1945) extended the theory of Onsager. Ziman Ziman (1956) gave very readable account. He proposed the following as a general principle of the thermodynamics of irreversible processes: \\"Consider all distributions of currents such that the intrinsic entropy production equals the extrinsic entropy production for the given set of forces. Then, of all current distributions satisfying this condition, the steady state distribution makes the entropy production a maximum.\\" He commented that this was a known general principle, discovered by Onsager, but was \\"not quoted in any of the books on the subject\\". He notes the difference between this principle and \\"Prigogine's theorem, which states, crudely speaking, that if not all the forces acting on a system are fixed the free forces will take such values as to make the entropy production a minimum.\\" Prigogine was present when this paper was read and he is reported by the journal editor to have given \\"notice that he doubted the validity of part of Ziman's thermodynamic interpretation\\". Ziegler Hans Ziegler extended the Melan-Prager non-equilibrium theory of materials to the non-isothermal case.T. Inoue (2002). Metallo-Thermo- Mechanics‚ÄìApplication to Quenching. In G. Totten, M. Howes, and T. Inoue (eds.), Handbook of Residual Stress. pp. 296-311, ASM International, Ohio. Gyarmati Gyarmati (1967/1970)Gyarmati, I. (1970). Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics: Field Theory and Variational Principles, Springer, Berlin; translated, by E. Gyarmati and W.F. Heinz, from the original 1967 Hungarian Nemegyensulyi Termodinamika, Muszaki Konyvkiado, Budapest. gives a systematic presentation, and extends Onsager's principle of least dissipation of energy, to give a more symmetric form known as Gyarmati's principle. Gyarmati (1967/1970) cites 11 papers or books authored or co-authored by Prigogine. Gyarmati (1967/1970) also gives in Section III 5 a very helpful precis of the subtleties of Casimir (1945)). He explains that the Onsager reciprocal relations concern variables which are even functions of the velocities of the molecules, and notes that Casimir went on to derive anti-symmetric relations concerning variables which are odd functions of the velocities of the molecules. Paltridge The physics of the earth's atmosphere includes dramatic events like lightning and the effects of volcanic eruptions, with discontinuities of motion such as noted by Helmholtz (1868). Turbulence is prominent in atmospheric convection. Other discontinuities include the formation of raindrops, hailstones, and snowflakes. The usual theory of classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics will need some extension to cover atmospheric physics. According to Tuck (2008),Tuck, Adrian F. (2008) Atmospheric Turbulence: a molecular dynamics perspective, Oxford University Press. . See page 33. \\"On the macroscopic level, the way has been pioneered by a meteorologist (Paltridge 1975,Paltridge, G.W. (1975). Global dynamics and climate - a system of minimum entropy exchange, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society 101:475-484. 2001). Initially Paltridge (1975) used the terminology \\"minimum entropy exchange\\", but after that, for example in Paltridge (1978), and in Paltridge (1979)), he used the now current terminology \\"maximum entropy production\\" to describe the same thing. This point is clarified in the review by Ozawa, Ohmura, Lorenz, Pujol (2003). Paltridge (1978) cited Busse's (1967) fluid mechanical work concerning an extremum principle. Nicolis and Nicolis (1980) discuss Paltridge's work, and they comment that the behaviour of the entropy production is far from simple and universal. This seems natural in the context of the requirement of some classical theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics that the threshold of turbulence not be crossed. Paltridge himself nowadays tends to prefer to think in terms of the dissipation function rather than in terms of rate of entropy production. Speculated thermodynamic extremum principles for energy dissipation and entropy production Jou, Casas-Vazquez, Lebon (1993)Jou, D., Casas-V√°zquez, J., Lebon, G. (1993). Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics, Springer, Berlin, , . note that classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics \\"has seen an extraordinary expansion since the second world war\\", and they refer to the Nobel prizes for work in the field awarded to Lars Onsager and Ilya Prigogine. Martyushev and Seleznev (2006) note the importance of entropy in the evolution of natural dynamical structures: \\"Great contribution has been done in this respect by two scientists, namely Clausius, ... , and Prigogine.\\" Prigogine in his 1977 Nobel LecturePrigogine, I. (1977). Time, Structure and Fluctuations, Nobel Lecture. said: \\"... non-equilibrium may be a source of order. Irreversible processes may lead to a new type of dynamic states of matter which I have called ‚Äúdissipative structures‚Äù.\\" Glansdorff and Prigogine (1971) wrote on page xx: \\"Such 'symmetry breaking instabilities' are of special interest as they lead to a spontaneous 'self-organization' of the system both from the point of view of its space order and its function.\\" Analyzing the Rayleigh‚ÄìB√©nard convection cell phenomenon, Chandrasekhar (1961)Chandrasekhar, S. (1961). Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability, Clarendon Press, Oxford. wrote \\"Instability occurs at the minimum temperature gradient at which a balance can be maintained between the kinetic energy dissipated by viscosity and the internal energy released by the buoyancy force.\\" With a temperature gradient greater than the minimum, viscosity can dissipate kinetic energy as fast as it is released by convection due to buoyancy, and a steady state with convection is stable. The steady state with convection is often a pattern of macroscopically visible hexagonal cells with convection up or down in the middle or at the 'walls' of each cell, depending on the temperature dependence of the quantities; in the atmosphere under various conditions it seems that either is possible. (Some details are discussed by Lebon, Jou, and Casas-V√°squez (2008) on pages 143‚Äì158.) With a temperature gradient less than the minimum, viscosity and heat conduction are so effective that convection cannot keep going. Glansdorff and Prigogine (1971) on page xv wrote \\"Dissipative structures have a quite different [from equilibrium structures] status: they are formed and maintained through the effect of exchange of energy and matter in non-equilibrium conditions.\\" They were referring to the dissipation function of Rayleigh (1873) that was used also by Onsager (1931, I, 1931, II). On pages 78‚Äì80 of their book Glansdorff and Prigogine (1971) consider the stability of laminar flow that was pioneered by Helmholtz; they concluded that at a stable steady state of sufficiently slow laminar flow, the dissipation function was minimum. These advances have led to proposals for various extremal principles for the \\"self-organized\\" r√©gimes that are possible for systems governed by classical linear and non- linear non-equilibrium thermodynamical laws, with stable stationary r√©gimes being particularly investigated. Convection introduces effects of momentum which appear as non-linearity in the dynamical equations. In the more restricted case of no convective motion, Prigogine wrote of \\"dissipative structures\\". ≈†ilhav√Ω (1997) offers the opinion that \\"... the extremum principles of [equilibrium] thermodynamics ... do not have any counterpart for [non-equilibrium] steady states (despite many claims in the literature).\\" Prigogine's proposed theorem of minimum entropy production for very slow purely diffusive transfer In 1945 Prigogine (see also Prigogine (1947)Prigogine, I. (1947). √âtude thermodynamique des Phenom√®nes Irreversibles, Desoer, Liege.) proposed a ‚ÄúTheorem of Minimum Entropy Production‚Äù which applies only to the purely diffusive linear regime, with negligible inertial terms, near a stationary thermodynamically non-equilibrium state. Prigogine's proposal is that the rate of entropy production is locally minimum at every point. The proof offered by Prigogine is open to serious criticism.Lavenda, B.H. (1978). Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes, Macmillan, London, . A critical and unsupportive discussion of Prigogine's proposal is offered by Grandy (2008). It has been shown by Barbera that the total whole body entropy production cannot be minimum, but this paper did not consider the pointwise minimum proposal of Prigogine. A proposal closely related to Prigogine's is that the pointwise rate of entropy production should have its maximum value minimized at the steady state. This is compatible, but not identical, with the Prigogine proposal. Moreover, N. W. Tschoegl proposes a proof, perhaps more physically motivated than Prigogine's, that would if valid support the conclusion of Helmholtz and of Prigogine, that under these restricted conditions, the entropy production is at a pointwise minimum.Tschoegl, N.W. (2000). Fundamentals of Equilibrium and Steady-State Thermodynamics, Elsevier, Amsterdam, , Chapter 30, pp. 213‚Äì215. Faster transfer with convective circulation: second entropy In contrast to the case of sufficiently slow transfer with linearity between flux and generalized force with negligible inertial terms, there can be heat transfer that is not very slow. Then there is consequent non-linearity, and heat flow can develop into phases of convective circulation. In these cases, the time rate of entropy production has been shown to be a non-monotonic function of time during the approach to steady state heat convection. This makes these cases different from the near-thermodynamic-equilibrium regime of very-slow-transfer with linearity. Accordingly, the local time rate of entropy production, defined according to the local thermodynamic equilibrium hypothesis, is not an adequate variable for prediction of the time course of far-from-thermodynamic equilibrium processes. The principle of minimum entropy production is not applicable to these cases. To cover these cases, there is needed at least one further state variable, a non-equilibrium quantity, the so-called second entropy. This appears to be a step towards generalization beyond the classical second law of thermodynamics, to cover non-equilibrium states or processes. The classical law refers only to states of thermodynamic equilibrium, and local thermodynamic equilibrium theory is an approximation that relies upon it. Still it is invoked to deal with phenomena near but not at thermodynamic equilibrium, and has some uses then. But the classical law is inadequate for description of the time course of processes far from thermodynamic equilibrium. For such processes, a more powerful theory is needed, and the second entropy is part of such a theory.Attard, P. (2012). Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics: Foundations and Applications, Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, . Speculated principles of maximum entropy production and minimum energy dissipation Onsager (1931, I) wrote: \\"Thus the vector field J of the heat flow is described by the condition that the rate of increase of entropy, less the dissipation function, be a maximum.\\" Careful note needs to be taken of the opposite signs of the rate of entropy production and of the dissipation function, appearing in the left-hand side of Onsager's equation (5.13) on Onsager's page 423. Although largely unnoticed at the time, Ziegler proposed an idea early with his work in the mechanics of plastics in 1961, and later in his book on thermomechanics revised in 1983, and in various papers (e.g., Ziegler (1987),). Ziegler never stated his principle as a universal law but he may have intuited this. He demonstrated his principle using vector space geometry based on an ‚Äúorthogonality condition‚Äù which only worked in systems where the velocities were defined as a single vector or tensor, and thus, as he wrote at p. 347, was ‚Äúimpossible to test by means of macroscopic mechanical models‚Äù, and was, as he pointed out, invalid in ‚Äúcompound systems where several elementary processes take place simultaneously‚Äù. In relation to the earth's atmospheric energy transport process, according to Tuck (2008), \\"On the macroscopic level, the way has been pioneered by a meteorologist (Paltridge 1975, 2001).\\" Initially Paltridge (1975) used the terminology \\"minimum entropy exchange\\", but after that, for example in Paltridge (1978), and in Paltridge (1979), he used the now current terminology \\"maximum entropy production\\" to describe the same thing. The logic of Paltridge's earlier work is open to serious criticism. Nicolis and Nicolis (1980) discuss Paltridge's work, and they comment that the behaviour of the entropy production is far from simple and universal. Later work by Paltridge focuses more on the idea of a dissipation function than on the idea of rate of production of entropy. Sawada (1981), also in relation to the Earth's atmospheric energy transport process, postulating a principle of largest amount of entropy increment per unit time, cites work in fluid mechanics by Malkus and Veronis (1958) as having \\"proven a principle of maximum heat current, which in turn is a maximum entropy production for a given boundary condition\\", but this inference is not logically valid. Again investigating planetary atmospheric dynamics, Shutts (1981) used an approach to the definition of entropy production, different from Paltridge's, to investigate a more abstract way to check the principle of maximum entropy production, and reported a good fit. Prospects Until recently, prospects for useful extremal principles in this area have seemed clouded. C. Nicolis (1999) concludes that one model of atmospheric dynamics has an attractor which is not a regime of maximum or minimum dissipation; she says this seems to rule out the existence of a global organizing principle, and comments that this is to some extent disappointing; she also points to the difficulty of finding a thermodynamically consistent form of entropy production. Another top expert offers an extensive discussion of the possibilities for principles of extrema of entropy production and of dissipation of energy: Chapter 12 of Grandy (2008) is very cautious, and finds difficulty in defining the 'rate of internal entropy production' in many cases, and finds that sometimes for the prediction of the course of a process, an extremum of the quantity called the rate of dissipation of energy may be more useful than that of the rate of entropy production; this quantity appeared in Onsager's 1931 origination of this subject. Other writers have also felt that prospects for general global extremal principles are clouded. Such writers include Glansdorff and Prigogine (1971), Lebon, Jou and Casas-V√°squez (2008), and ≈†ilhav√Ω (1997). It has been shown that heat convection does not obey extremal principles for entropy production and chemical reactions do not obey extremal principles for the secondary differential of entropy production, hence the development of a general extremal principle seems infeasible.

Although accounts vary, the audience has been estimated at between 75,000 and 100,000 people. A three-day ticket for the festival sold for $15.00. History  Connection to Toronto Peace Festival  John Brower along with John Lennon and Yoko Ono had originally planned to host the \\"Toronto Peace Festival\\" at Mosport Park in July 1970 but they ran into numerous roadblocks and their plans were dashed when their application for the necessary permits were denied. In de-classified documents released in 2007 it was revealed in an RCMP report dated December 30, 1969, that the Canadian security service began spying on ex-Beatle John and Yoko after they announced their plans for the Peace Festival.  Selection of the venue and promotion  Without John and Yoko, Brower moved forward with plans to host a festival at Shediac, near Moncton, New Brunswick, named the \\"Strawberry Fields Festival\\".Ken Kelley, Why Did New Brunswick Pull The Plug On An Epic Rock Concert In August 1970?, Music Nerd, August 7, 2016 Again, local politicians intervened and revoked various permits so Brower shifted the location back to Mosport Park in Ontario only this time he thinly disguised the event as a championship motorcycle race featuring \\"some contemporary entertainment\\". The festival was advertised in Canada as the \\"First Annual Strawberry Cup Trophy Race\\". To avoid public and political scrutiny, the musical entertainment aspect of the event was downplayed in advertisements and the festival was not promoted heavily in Canada. When it was discovered that the primary focus of the event was not motorcycle racing but instead a rock music festival, the Attorney General of Ontario, Arthur Wishart, filed for an injunction to stop the festival from taking place citing health and public safety concerns. On August 6, with only hours to go before the opening act was scheduled to take the stage, Supreme Court Justice D. A. Keith refused to grant the injunction and the festival was allowed to proceed. Unlike in Canada, the \\"Strawberry Fields Festival\\" was promoted heavily in the U.S. as a three-day rock music festival with the slogan, \\"Love, Sun and Sound\\". As a result, a large percentage of the attendees were from the American northeast. Others travelled from as far away as California and Florida. In the end, the sanctioning body for the racing series withdrew its drivers from the event so an actual race never occurred although an obligatory lap by a few motorcyclists did occur in order to comply with the local ordinance. Border troubles  Several thousand more young American music fans were turned back at the Canada‚ÄìUS border by Canadian border agents. The fans were unable to provide proof they had sufficient funds to look after themselves while visiting Canada or produce adequate identification. Forty US dollars were required to be shown to officials (at the Thousand Islands Bridge crossing checkpoint). If one could not show cash they were told they could not enter Canada. Cash was sometimes borrowed from person to person at the lineup. One person turned away at the Canadian border crossing at Prescott, Ontario, drowned while attempting to swim into Canada across the St. Lawrence River near Watertown, New York. Several arrests related to the attempted importation of narcotics and banned substances were made.  The park  Mosport is a auto racing venue. Strawberry Fields was the first of three major music festivals held at Mosport Park Raceway, between 1970 and 1980. The other two were Canada Jam held August 26, 1978 and the punk and new wave themed Heatwave Festival held August 23, 1980.

Other performers who also appeared at the 1969 Woodstock Festival in Bethel, New York included Melanie, Ten Years After and Mountain. Chip Monck, who designed the stage lighting for Woodstock and became the impromptu emcee of that event, had planned to emcee Strawberry Fields, but the various changes in dates and venues pushed the festival into August and Monck was bound to honour a previous commitment to work the Rolling Stones European tour at that time.

Life He was born about 1651 in the parish of St. George, Southwark, the son of Richard Manningham, rector of Michelmersh, Hampshire. He was admitted in 1661 scholar of Winchester College, then going with a scholarship to New College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 12 August 1669. He was fellow from 1671 till 1681, and graduated B.A. in 1673, M.A. on 15 January 1676-7. He was for some time tutor to Sir John Robinson, bart., eldest son of Sir John Robinson, sometime Lieutenant of the Tower of London. In 1681 he was presented to the rectory of East Tisted, Hampshire. The king, who admired his preaching, promised him the prebend of Winchester, vacated by the promotion of Thomas Ken to the bishopric of Bath and Wells; it proved, however, to be in the gift of the lord keeper, and Thomas Fox obtained it. In November 1684 Manningham was made preacher at the Rolls Chapel, and from about 1689 to 1692 was head-master of Westerham grammar school, Kent. He subsequently became rector of St. Andrew, Holborn, on 8 September 1691; chaplain in ordinary to William III and Mary II; canon at St George's Chapel, Windsor on 28 January 1692-3 (until 1709); rector of Great Haseley, Oxfordshire, 1708; and dean of Windsor on 26 February 1709. On 21 December 1691 John Tillotson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, created him D.D. He was consecrated bishop of Chichester on 13 November 1709, and dying on 25 August 1722 at his house in Greville Street, Holborn, was buried in St. Andrew's, Holborn. Works Manningham printed many sermons between 1680 and his death, and was author of Two Discourses, London, 1681, and The Value of Church and College Leases consider'd in Sir Isaac Newton's Tables, 1742.

Vickers Transonic Research Rocket was developed from the Miles M.52 a British research supersonic aircraft a project which was undertaken in top secrecy between 1942 and 1945 to a Ministry of Supply specification E.24/43. The project was cancelled because the Government of the day was persuaded that with the accumulation of data it was felt that the E.24/43 aircraft was unlikely to reach sonic speed. Wind tunnel model tests apparently indicated serious loss of longitudinal stability at high subsonic speed as was then characteristic of existing aircraft. The decision was reached to acquire preliminary experience of flight under transonic conditions using rocket-driven pilotless scale models. The Ministry of Supply (MOS) formed the Guided Projectile Establishment under W. P. Cooke at Westcott, Buckinghamshire, and the Rocket Propulsion Group under A. D. Baxter at RAE, Farnborough. Work commenced in applying German technology, with the Halstead Experimental Centre of the MOS monitoring commercial exploitation. Development A contract was placed in 1945 with Vickers Armstrong Limited for the design and construction of several test vehicles. Early in 1946 the contract for the E.24/43 was cancelled, since it was felt impossible to ensure safe escape for the pilot in the event of an emergency ejection at high speed. The difficulties surrounding flight at sonic speeds appeared to increase with increasing knowledge. In those circumstances, consideration of an improved version of the E.24/43 was discarded in favour of pilotless models which for the initial tryout were to be 3/10-scale versions of the Miles M.52 design. For drag and stress reasons the operational altitude had to be in the stratosphere, to which altitude the test vehicles would be carried by a parent aircraft, a De havilland Mosquito One of the Vickers models undergoing supersonic wind tunnel testing at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) c.1943 Powerplant The design was to be powered by a 362 kg (800 lbs.) thrust hydrogen peroxide 'hot' motor evolved at Westcott with characteristics drawn from the Walter RI 2031209 ATO unit. This initiated the Beta- and the subsequent Gamma MOS-inspired engines. In October 1948 the Vickers Transonic model flew at 930 mph in level flight at 35,000 ft. Design The test vehicle was a 3/10-scale model of the Miles E.24/43 design except for the omission of the distinctive annular air intake of the full-scale aircraft.Flight Trials of a Rocket-propelled Transonic Research Model :The R.A.E.-Vickers Rocket Model(HMSO 1954) To maintain the center of gravity (c.g.) it was necessary to include a large balance weight (a!most 1/10 of total all-up weight) in the foremost section of the nose. The layout was further restricted by the need to maintain a constant c.g. position during the consumption of the fuels. This was achieved by placing a small tank ahead of the wing holding one third of the total oxidant (as well as the fuel in the shaped nose tank) and locating the main oxidant tank aft of the wing. Other large components were placed fore and aft of the wing. In the space below and above the wing centre section were located the air, fuel, oxidant and warm-air pipes, telemetering transmitter, instruments and batteries as well as the autopilot, timing clock, wiring terminal fuses and the connections by which the test vehicle was carried on the parent aircraft. The rear section housed the combustion chamber, radar transponder, smoke-producing fluid, instruments and oscillators for combustion chamber pressure and tailplane angle, servos and dive mechanism for the tailplane which together with the fixed directional fin were fitted to the lower body prior. The single-piece wing was of mahogany with Dural inserts at the leading and trailing edges; it was of biconvex section and of tapered planform with an unswept half-chord line. The Dural inserts formed a convenient dipole-aerial system for the telemetering unit. (A similar arrangement on the tailplane served the radar transponder.) Operational history A1: On the last check flight before live firing the parent aircraft descended into a storm at 22,000 ft. When smooth conditions were regained at about 8,000 ft altitude the test vehicle A1 carrying all the prototype examples of instruments and equipment was found to have parted from the aircraft and disappeared beneath the waters of the Bristol Channel.

He was an all-rounder, scoring six centuries and taking ten wickets in a match on two occasions by the end of his career. He was killed on active service with the British Army during the Second World War. Cricket career Early career Lee was a Londoner and played one match in 1923 for Middlesex, where his brother, Harry, 12 years his senior, was an opening batsman and off-break bowler from 1911 to 1934. The Middlesex match was against Somerset at Taunton, and Lee failed to take a wicket with his leg-breaks and, batting at number ten, was run out without scoring. Unable to win a place in the Middlesex side, he moved to Somerset from the 1925 season, starting his career with his new county in almost identical circumstances, with just one wicket for his bowling and two scoreless innings in the match against Cambridge University at Bath. That was his only first-class match in his first two seasons at Somerset: without a residential or birth qualification, he was forced to wait for two years before he could appear in County Championship matches. While waiting, he played club cricket for the Lansdown Cricket Club in Bath.Foot (1986), p13. Two years after Jack Lee moved from Middlesex to Somerset, his younger brother Frank, who had made two appearances for Middlesex, made the same move: he also played for Lansdown and his qualification for Somerset proceeded two years behind Jack's. Jack Lee was qualified for Somerset in 1927 and immediately became a regular player in the side. In his first County Championship match, he was used as an opening batsman, and he stayed at or near the top of the batting order for most the season, moving down only when one of Somerset's amateur irregulars arrived to claim one of the opening slots. In his first season, he made 759 runs at an average of 17.25 runs per innings and a highest score of 65. He also took 41 wickets, including five for 23 in an innings in the match against Warwickshire when, in Wisden's report, \\"he bowled an excellent length and with some variety of pace made the ball turn quickly\\". In its review of Somerset's season, Wisden added that Lee had made \\"an encouraging start\\" and \\"may develop into a thoroughly good all-round player\\". That promise was slow to develop, however. In the 1928 season, Lee made only 376 first-class runs at an average of 14.46 and took only 19 wickets. He played in only 17 of Somerset's matches, with the team often containing eight or nine amateur players. He was back as a regular in 1929, and took 59 wickets, including a new career-best of six for 57 in the match against Northamptonshire at Taunton. In that match, though, Lee batted at number eleven, and though he also opened the innings in other matches, his season's batting average in 1929 was just 12.90. There was little change in 1930, and although Wisden noted that Lee on occasion offered \\"batting to some purpose\\", he was now not used higher than number seven in the batting order, and he missed several matches in August when the amateurs were available. As a bowler in 1930, he had one outstanding match: against Essex at Colchester, he took five wickets for 38 in the first Essex innings, catching three of the other Essex batsmen, and then followed that with seven for 101, his best innings figures so far, to finish with 12 for 139 in the match, the best match figures of his career. It was perhaps significant that Somerset captain (and England off-spin bowler) Jack White was not playing in this game: in the 1930 season as a whole, White bowled 500 more overs for Somerset than Lee, who was the number two spin bowler for as long as White was in the side. All-round cricketer The transition to all-rounder happened in the 1931 season. From early in the season, Lee was promoted to open the innings or to bat at number three, and though the move was not an instant success, it paid off from June. In the match against Middlesex at Lord's, he finally overhauled the highest score of 65 he had made in 1927 by scoring 71 in a very heavy defeat. In the very next match, against the New Zealanders at Bath, he improved that score again, making 98 in three hours. And then at the end of the same month of June 1931, opening the innings alongside his brother Frank, he made 113, his first century, in the game against Northamptonshire at Northampton. In the season as a whole, Lee made 994 runs at an average of 21.60, six runs per innings higher than his average in 1930. Alongside that, he took 53 wickets in the season, though with no five-wicket innings. Wisden was more impressed by the improvement in the batting of Lee's younger brother, Frank, but noted: \\"J. W. Lee, if unenterprising, batted consistently,\\" and added, a paragraph further on: \\"J. W. Lee, if often expensive with his slows, proved effective at times.\\" The praise from Wisden for Lee's performance in 1932 was rather less grudging: \\"Jack Lee fully maintained his ability as a batsman,\\" it said. Lee's overall figures were similar to those of 1931, with 949 runs at 21.56. There was again a single century, this time in the match against Essex at Leyton, and Lee put on 234 for the first wicket with his brother, Frank, an opening partnership somewhat overshadowed by the record 555-run first-wicket partnership by Yorkshire's Percy Holmes and Herbert Sutcliffe on the same ground just two weeks earlier. There was an advance, though, in Lee's bowling: White had retired from the Somerset captaincy after the 1931 season and played in only half the county's matches, and Lee had more bowling to do, responding with 67 wickets at, for him, the low average of 25.88 runs per wicket. Lee's bowling was less successful in 1933, and he took just 45 wickets at the much higher average of 41.15. But that decline was offset by a further advance in batting, and he passed 1000 runs for the season for the first time, finishing with 1122 and an average of 27.36. In the match against Worcestershire at Weston-super- Mare, he made an unbeaten 193 in six hours and 40 minutes: the match was finished by a heavy storm when Somerset had lost seven wickets, with Lee still batting. This was the highest score of Lee's first-class cricket career. During the Middlesex v Somerset match at Lord's in 1933, he was involved in one of the curiosities of first-class cricket. He claimed the wicket of his elder brother Harry, with the catch being taken by younger brother Frank. The 1934 season was Lee's most successful in first-class cricket in terms of runs scored, batting average and wickets taken. Wisden said he was \\"far and away the best all-rounder in the side\\". His aggregate of runs increased to 1465 and his average to 31.17, and there were three centuries, as many as he had made in his career before the season began. In Somerset's first home match of the season, against Kent at Taunton, he carried his bat for 135 out of a Somerset total of 352, an innings described by Wisden as \\"watchful\\" and that featured a 10th wicket partnership with wicket-keeper Wally Luckes of 112. Later in the season he shared century opening partnerships with his brother Frank in three consecutive matches, who also enjoyed his most successful season so far. Wisden noted: \\"Between them, they made seven of the eleven individual centuries registered for the county... It cannot be said that they were, as a rule, attractive to watch, but extra care could be excused in view of the knowledge that failure on their part probably--and usually--meant the cheap dismissal of the side.\\" As a bowler, he took 77 wickets at an average of 28.74, and was Somerset's leading wicket-taker. In the match against Essex at Colchester, he achieved his best innings and match bowling figures, his five for 75 in the first Essex innings being followed by seven for 45 in the second - though Somerset still managed to lose the game. Both the Lee brothers were less successful as batsmen in the 1935 season, and Jack only just completed 1000 runs for the season, finishing with 1011 at an average of 22.46 and failing to score a single century. With fast bowler Arthur Wellard, who had been badly out of form in 1934, taking more than 100 wickets, there was less reliance on Lee's bowling, but he still finished with 72 wickets and his bowling average of 24.38 was the best for a single season of his first-class career. In Harold Gimblett's sensational debut match at Frome in May 1935, Lee was Somerset's most successful bowler, taking nine Essex wickets to win the game. End of first-class career After the 1935 season Lee accepted the position of head cricket coach at Mill Hill School in north London. His departure was controversial: the biography of Harold Gimblett, written by the historian of Somerset County Cricket Club, David Foot, reported more than 40 years after the event that \\"old players still grumble about the way Jack Lee departed\\". Gimblett told Foot, in tape recordings that form the basis of the biography, that Lee had been vocal about the disparities in treatment between the amateurs who still formed a large percentage of the Somerset side and the half dozen professional cricketers the county employed; Gimblett also said that Lee felt he was due a benefit match. When Lee approached the Somerset secretary, the former captain John Daniell, to say he had been offered the job at Mill Hill, in reality \\"he wanted to remain with Somerset... Should he take the job? Yes, he was apparently advised.\\"Foot (1986), p137. To Gimblett and other Somerset professionals, Foot wrote, this indicated that the county officials were \\"offhanded in their treatment of the pros\\", and particularly of one with a history of being disrespectful of the amateurs. Daniell's son Nigel, however, gave Foot a different perspective on Lee's departure. \\"In fairness to him, they thought he should seriously consider the job at Mill Hill,\\" he is quoted in Foot's Somerset history as saying. \\"They felt the school appointment would long outlast his career as a county cricketer.\\"Quoted in Foot (1986), p137. Either way, Lee reappeared for Somerset in five matches in the school holidays in August 1936, and his appearance along with that of some \\"more experienced amateurs\\" was deemed responsible by Wisden for a \\"transformation\\" in Somerset's fortunes late in the season that led to seventh place in the County Championship, the highest for four years. In Lee's final match for Somerset, he top-scored with 57 out of a total of 132 in a heavy defeat by Essex. He did not return to play for Somerset in the three other seasons leading up to the Second World War, and did not appear in first-class cricket again. Second World War During the Second World War Lee joined the British Army, serving as a private with the Pioneer Corps. On 20 June 1944, a fortnight after D-Day, he was a member of 208 Company when he was killed in France during the Invasion of Normandy. He is buried in Ryes War Cemetery, Bazenville. He left a widow, Agnes, who was living in Highgate, London. During the early part of the war he played for the London Counties, when this closed down on the resumption of the County Championship in 1946, the club's remaining funds were given to Agnes.

He has established and repeated several bouldering problems at the V15 difficulty rating, in such areas as Hueco Tanks, the Buttermilks, and Magic Wood. In 2007, Robinson became the second climber in history to successfully climb a V13 boulder problem in one attempt.  Competitions  In 2007, Paul Robinson took second place at the 8th Annual American Bouldering Series (ABS) National Championships. The following year, Robinson took first place at the competition, beating Chris Sharma and Sean McColl. Later that year, he took third place at the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) Bouldering World Cup in Vail, Colorado. In 2009, Robinson competed once again in the ABS National Championships, this time taking second place behind Daniel Woods. At the IFSC Bouldering World Cup in Vail, he completed three of the four finals problems, placing him in fourth behind Kilian Fischhuber. In January 2013, Robinson took third place in the finals of the Dark Horse Series IV bouldering competition. The following June, Robinson reached the finals of the IFSC Bouldering World Cup in Vail, but was unable to finish any of the final boulders and took sixth place.  Notable ascents  In August 2007, Robinson made the third ascent of Jade, a V14 bouldering problem in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. Later that year, he climbed the V13 Nagual boulder in one attempt, an accomplishment known as a \\"flash\\". This made Robinson the second person to have flashed a V13, after James Pearson. The following January, Robinson claimed the second ascent of Terremer, a V15 boulder in Hueco Tanks, Texas. The problem was established by Swiss climber Fred Nicole two years earlier. At the time, it was regarded as the most challenging problem at Hueco Tanks, and Robinson described it as \\"the hardest boulder I have ever done so far.\\" On 30 March 2010, Robinson claimed the first ascent of Lucid Dreaming, a highball bouldering problem in the Buttermilks near Bishop, California. He originally proposed a grade of V16, the highest bouldering grade that had yet been assigned to a problem, but he later suggested Lucid Dreaming might be a V15. The boulder is from ground to top, beginning with a steep overhang and ending with a slab traversal. Much of the difficulty of the climb comes from two consecutive V12 moves near the beginning, both featuring small, technical holds. The problem was not repeated until January 2014. During the summer of 2010, Robinson spent two months climbing in Rocklands, South Africa. His main project was the second ascent of Monkey Wedding, a V15 boulder problem first established in 2002 by Fred Nicole. Other achievements included a flash of The Amphitheater (V12), and two V14 first ascents: The Big Short and Black Eagle. Later that year, Robinson visited Magic Wood in Switzerland, where he established Il Trill, a boulder problem rated 8c on the Fontainebleau scale. In February 2011, Robinson took the third ascent of Trip Hop, a V15 problem established by S√©bastien Frigault in 2003. The following month, he claimed two V15 second ascents in Europe: The Story of Two Worlds, established in 2005 by Dave Graham, and Angama, established in 2006 by Dai Koyamada. In January 2012, Robinson established Meadowlark Lemon, a V14 sit-start variation of the V13 Meadowlark problem in Red Rock Canyon, Nevada. Later that year, he claimed the second ascent of Paint it Black, a V15 problem established in Rocky Mountain National Park by Daniel Woods.

The tradition was started in the city in 1924 by the J.L. Hudson Company department store. It shares the title for the second-oldest Thanksgiving parade in the United States with the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City, New York and is four years younger than the 6abc Dunkin' Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. History The idea came from Hudson's display director Charles Wendel after the success of the Canadian Eaton's Santa Claus Parade in Toronto, Ontario. In addition to the usual floats and bands, Wendel obtained large papier-m√¢ch√© heads similar to those he saw during a recent trip to Europe. The heads are made in Viareggio, Italy, and remain a fixture of the parade to the present. The parade was suspended in 1943 and 1944 due to material shortages caused by World War II, but Hudson's resumed the event in 1945 and continued sponsorship of the parade until 1979, when the costs became burdensome. It turned the parade over to the Detroit Renaissance Foundation, who produced it for four years. In 1983, Detroit Renaissance transferred control of the parade to the newly created Michigan Thanksgiving Parade Foundation. \\"America's Thanksgiving Parade\\" is a registered trademark of the foundation. In 2020, this parade is modified as the COVID-19 pandemic persists; with no crowds. As of July 2020, the parade organisers still plan on holding the parade in some form, with Gardner-White buying presenting sponsor rights. Parade details The parade features a variety of floats, marching bands and balloons, with the climax being the arrival of Santa Claus, who appears at the end to herald the arrival of the Christmas season. Unique to the parade are the Big Head Corps, featuring a large collection of papier-m√¢ch√© heads, and the Distinguished Clown Corps, which features local corporate and community leaders dressed as clowns. The parade is made possible through the efforts of more than 4,500 volunteers. Broadcasts The parade was first broadcast in 1931 on radio station WWJ. In 1959, the parade came to television on local stations WWJ-TV and WXYZ-TV. The WXYZ program was hosted by ventriloquist and puppeteer Shari Lewis and her sock puppet Lamb Chop and carried nationally on the ABC broadcast network. In 1960, the CBS broadcast network began to air portions of the parade and continued to do so for the next 25 parades. After a brief break in the mid-1980s, CBS returned to cover the parade through 2002 as part of its All- American Thanksgiving Day Parade compilation show. Over the years, several other well-known personalities were commentators for the Detroit parades, including John Amos, Ned Beatty, Kathy Garver, Captain Kangaroo host Bob Keeshan, Linda Lavin, Esther Rolle and Andrew Stevens. After being broadcast on WWJ, later WDIV, for over 20 years, local coverage switched to WXYZ for several years in the 1980s before returning to NBC-affiliate WDIV in the mid-1990s. It is televised on other stations around Michigan and across the U.S., as well as through Internet television. The coverage of the parade typically includes a preshow featuring a variety of musical acts, often with celebrity performers. The coverage concludes with the Mayor of Detroit giving Santa Claus the key to the city. Parade route Since 2014, the parade has started just north of Warren, at Kirby and Woodward Avenue in front of the Detroit Historical Museum and the Park Shelton.http://www.theparade.org/americas-thanksgiving-parade/parade-info/ You can see the current parade route on The Parade Company's website. Prior to 2014, since 2006, the parade began at Woodward and Mack Avenues. The parade ends at Congress Street. The Mack to Congress route is the route the first parade followed in 1924. The parade travels toward downtown from Mack Avenue, and after crossing over Interstate 75 I-75), it enters Foxtown, near Detroit's Fox Theatre, the Hockeytown Cafe, and Comerica Park. From Foxtown, the parade passes through Grand Circus Park then into the business district, where it then enters the television coverage area near Grand River and Gratiot avenues. The route was from this route for several years during the construction of Campus Martius Park and the realignment of Woodward Avenue and other adjacent streets. The construction was completed in 2004. For many years, ending with Hudson's withdrawal in 1979, the parade began at Woodward and Putnam near the Detroit Public Library and ended at Hudson's Marquee near Gratiot Avenue, where Santa alighted his sleigh and received the key to the hearts of children of Detroit from the mayor. In 1979, the route was moved several blocks north, beginning at Antoinette Street and ending at Adams Street, near Grand Circus Park. During this period, Santa alighted on the steps of the Detroit Institute of Arts to be welcomed by the mayor, then remounted to travel the remainder of the parade route. For a period, the parade route was moved to Second Avenue because electrical wires that powered the Woodward Avenue streetcars posed a hazard to floats and their riders. Streetcars ceased operating on Woodward Avenue in 1956 when the Detroit Department of Street Railways converted to an all-motor-bus fleet. Parade foundation The Michigan Thanksgiving Parade Foundation began in 1982 to manage, organize and raise funds for the parade. In 1990, The Parade Company was founded as a foundation division to oversee operations and marketing activities. In addition to the parade, The Parade Company assumed responsibility for organizing the annual Windsor-Detroit International Freedom Festival in 1989 and helped to plan Stanley Cup victory parades for the Detroit Red Wings in 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2008.

The park is located in the city's north end near the downtown north core. Aside from pleasure craft docks and a fueling facility, the park also has walking paths and a boardwalk, playground equipment, picnic tables, a Mariner's Monument and the historic CN Rail Station (now home to gift shops and ice-cream parlor, restaurant and other amenities). The marina also known as \\"Prince Arthur's Landing\\" is in the first phase of a 130 million dollar upgrade. This is a private‚Äìpublic coalition to make the park tourist friendly and provide a new tax base for the city. The private company is in the process of building two seven-story condos, an art gallery and a hotel with a water park onto the marina. The current area is being infilled by an average of between each pier to create enough room for the new buildings. One feature that is the mainstay for the public half of the construction is a splash pad‚Äìrink which will be accessible all year long by tourists and the public. The project has continued throughout the winter season and has completed the infill and other basic features. Tenders are currently out to start the construction of the public buildings and the condo‚Äìhotel should not be far behind. The project was funded by all levels of government through many different stimulus projects. Construction is to be completed in the fall of 2010 with minor landscaping being finished in 2011. Phase 2 is currently in the design phases which will see the area expanded onto an old industrial area. This area will hold a cruise ship docking and possibly a convention center and create a large area which will be accessible to everyone in the public. The costs are not yet known for a project like this. This project is expected to start in 2011 or 2012 and is part of a much larger project to eventually develop all 52 km of the city's waterfront. The park also hosts numerous events during the summer season, including the \\"Summer in the Parks\\" concert series, the Thunder Bay Blues Festival, kite festival, Canada Day celebrations and many other annual events. Many celebrations are held on the waterfront and it is the mainstay for the north core. Prince Arthur's Landing waterfront district The Prince Arthur's Landing waterfront district is a mixed-used waterfront redevelopment district incorporating the city's Marina Park, with parkland and trails, a sculpture garden, restored heritage buildings and a future hotel. Structures include the Baggage Building Arts Centre public gallery, a restored circa-1900 building, the Water Garden Pavilion, a skateboard park, running and cycling trails, as well as public art.

He developed a philosophy of dialogue, in connection with the pragmatic theory of action of the Erlangen constructivist school. Lorenz is married to the literary scholar Karin Lorenz-Lindemann.  Career  After studying mathematics and physics in T√ºbingen, Hamburg, Bonn and Princeton, Lorenz earned his Ph.D. in 1961 under Paul Lorenzen in Kiel with a thesis about Arithmetic and Logic as Games. In 1969 he received his habilitation degree in philosophy also under Lorenzen but this time in Erlangen. In 1970 he was offered the chair of philosophy at the University of Hamburg to succeed Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker. From 1974 till his retirement in 1997 he taught at the University of Saarland in Saarbr√ºcken. Among his former students is Arno Ros.  Dialogue and predication  Lorenz developed (along with Paul Lorenzen) an approach to arithmetic and logic as dialogue games. In dialogical logic (game semantics), tree calculations (generally, of Gentzen type calculus) are written upside down, so that the initial assertion of a proponent stays above and is defended against an opponent as in a game. This is a linguistically more congenial approach to logic which is more suitable as a model for argumentation than the formal derivation in a calculus or truth tables. Lorenz presented for the first time a simple demonstration of Gentzen's consistency proof on this game-theoretic basis. If one regards logic and mathematics in this way as a game, an intuitionist approach becomes a more plausible option.  Dialogical constructivism  Not only logic, but the whole of philosophy is given a dialogical treatment by Lorenz. Only in the mirror of a relative Other is it possible to reflect upon oneself. Lorenz developed a dialogical constructivism from the focus on the dialogical principle (Martin Buber) and the process of language games of the later Ludwig Wittgenstein. In addition, the pragmatism of Charles Sanders Peirce and the historicism of Wilhelm Dilthey are complementary juxtaposed.

In 1674 he built a Shikara-style Shiva temple with a gilded repousse mask of the God on each side in Bhaktapur. In 1682 he built near the Durbar the two-storied Dharmasala Palace in which there is a golden Mahadeva.

To the east of this he erected the temple and statue of Narayana, along with the temples of Dattatrikasa and Pashupati. An inscription in 1678 states that he built the royal palace Thanathu Dubar and its gardens and courtyard. Jitamitra was also credited with restoring Kumari Chowk, the images of Astamatrikas and in 1690, donated two large cooper kettledrums (nagara) or bells to his favourite deity, the goddess Taleju for the gilded roof of Taleju.

Nine of the tracks are new and composed by Stefanos Korkolis, with lyrics by Rebecca Roussi, while there are two covers: the classic Korkolis tracks \\"Fovithikes\\" with lyrics by Rebecca Roussi and \\"Parakseni Agapi\\" with lyrics by Anta Douka. Style The album has a noticeably different style than those preceding with adult sounding and developed vocals. In a February 2009 interview with Espresso Magazine, Chrispa stated that people would see another her and that she was at the most creative phase of her life. She added that the new album would be a surprising change from her previous releases. After seeing the photos from the album's shoot, Espresso Magazine wrote that Chrispa had transformed into a perfectly sexy female, markedly emaciated, with long brown hair and an incredibly bold figure. She posed with little mannerism in revealing clothes and looked ready to put the fire back in the nightlife of Athens. Release Mehri Edo was released on October 6, 2009 and is Chrispa's fifth studio album.

Upon the album's release, Chrispa's record company Minos EMI received complaints regarding the content.

Rower womanAllan Pred: Lost words and lost worlds Cambridge University Press 1990, page 69. Retrieved 2011-12-13 (in Swedish called Roddarmadam, literally: \\"Rower Madam\\") was a female profession in Stockholm, Sweden, from the 15th century until the early 20th century. It consisted of women who ran a form of early water taxi; rowing people between the islands of Stockholm, to and from the islands of the Stockholm archipelago, as well as to and from places around Lake M√§laren on the other side of Stockholm.  History  The Stockholm rower women are mentioned in text from the 15th century, and in 1638 they formed a special group within the Swedish ferrymen guild. They handled most of the traffic over the waters of the capital, working in teams of two, taking passengers between its islands, into Lake M√§laren, and to and from islands in the Stockholm archipelago. They could be either married or unmarried, and they inherited their boats from mother to daughter, or bought them from retired colleagues. They were businesswomen famed for their blunt manner and coarse language. So much so, that in 1759, a law was introduced which specified that they must be sober and maintain a civil language. They were very visible because of their large \\"weather hoods\\", a special hat very suited when rowing in bad weather. In the 1690s, a visiting Italian was impressed by the strength and great speed of the rower women in Stockholm. In 1763, Carl Michael Bellman attracted attention when he came to conflict with one of the rower women and managed to win the argument.Niklas Ericsson, Magnus Hansson, Christer J√∂rgensson (2002) Stockholm- historien om den stolta staden (Stockholm - history of the proud city) B. Wahlstr√∂ms. (Swedish) During his visit to Sweden in 1787, Francisco de Miranda described the rower women as: \\"Good women who row like devils!\\" During the 19th century, the rower women found increasing competition. Following Fabriks och Handtwerksordning in 1846, which abolished all guild privileges and allowed anyone to start business in any sector of society, a private company acquired a license in 1848 for ferry traffic in Stockholm with boats propelled by hand-operated paddle wheels instead of oars, worked by employed women from Dalarna, who were dressed in their local folk costumes and taught to be nice and courteous to their customers.Rolf S√∂derberg, Stockholmsspegel, Liber f√∂rlag (1984), ] A few years later steam boats started to take over the business from both types of boats and women. In 1856, there were 96 rowing boats run by women, with the capacity of transporting 20-25 people in each boat. In 1875, when the rower woman profession was formally abolished (although they were allowed to continue their trade), there were five rowing boat stations in Stockholm, with a total of 23 rowing boats run by women. The number continued to diminish thereafter, and nobody knows exactly when the last rower woman retired herself. However, according to the Stockholm history author Per Anders Fogelstr√∂m, the activity may very well have continued up to World War I.Christine Bladh, Rodderskor p√• Stockholms vatten, Stockholmia f√∂rlag (2008),  See also  * Gondola * Water taxi  References  Category:History of Stockholm Category:History of rowing Category:Obsolete occupations Category:Rowing in Sweden Category:Women's rowing Category:Swedish women's history Category:Women's history Category:Social history of Sweden Category:Historical legal occupations ","title":"Rower woman"},{"id":"24623282","text":"Seion Darrell (born January 16, 1986) is a Bermudian football player who currently plays for local side Dandy Town Hornets.

Specialising in horror and science-fiction, his work often includes elements inspired by vintage tales of monsters and madmen, dark futures, post apocalyptic genres including cyberpunk and industrial wastelands and classic literature including H.P.Lovecraft's The Call of Cthulhu, Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray and the modern classics Clive Barker's Hellraiser and the Books of Blood all of which he has fully illustrated. Shearon's main influences stem from ancient cultures, the occult, industrial/art/revolution-eras, the supernatural, the paranormal, cryptozoology and the unexplained. Shearon has created covers for comic books and graphic novels including Clive Barker's HELLRAISER, Judge Dredd, The X-Files, Mars Attacks, 30 Days of Night, Angel, KISS, and Clive Barker's Books of Blood, Stan Lee's 'Lucky Man' and album sleeve artwork and merchandise designs for some of the biggest names in rock, metal and industrial music, such as Godhead, Ministry, Rob Zombie, Iron Maiden, Slayer, H.I.M, KISS, Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein, A Pale Horse Named Death, Powerman 5000, Biohazard, American Head Charge, Rammstein, Jason Charles Miller, Fear Factory, orgy (band) and Kill Devil Hill.

Gameplay One main difference between this game and the rest of the Darius games is that the player can choose one of three Silver Hawks to play. The green one is the Silver Hawk of Darius. The blue one is the Silver Hawk of Darius II. The red one is a new prototype of Silver Hawk that exists only in this game. There are three power-ups in this game, which can be obtained in three ways: * Destroying a complete formation of ships like in Darius II and Darius Twin or amoebas. * Destroying a flashing meteor during a meteor rain. * Destroying a futuristic cage on the floor and/or ceiling of an area. The power-ups for this game are the red bubble (shot and bomb power up), the blue bubble (shield regenerate and level up), and the green bubble (randomly gives a bonus point or an extra ship). There is also a special power up that can destroy all enemies on screen if it's destroyed (like Darius II) or can make the Silver Hawk shoot a powerful laser beam if its grabbed by the player. There is no power up bar, which means that if a Silver Hawk is destroyed, the shots and bombs are powered down to the minimum level. Also, when the player loses a ship on a stage, it is returned to the 'check point' (not identify in game) of that stage, if the ship has lost during a boss also return the last 'check point' before the boss appear. Like Darius Twin, the player uses (by default) the Y button for shot and the B button for dropping bombs. As long as the player keeps pressed both buttons, the shots are powered down one level. The player can switch between bombs and side laser guns by pressing the R button. The stages map for this game is very different of the rest of the Darius games. This map contains 15 stages, but only allows the player to take the forward or up paths, until the player reaches the L, N or O stage. Each one of those three stages contains its own boss and ending.

Hopewell Interaction Sphere The Hopewell Exchange system began in the Ohio and Illinois River Valleys around 300 BCE. The culture is referred to more as a system of interaction among a variety of societies than as a single society or culture. The central Illinois River Valley was home to one particular complex, the Havana Hopewell culture. Havana Hopewell sites have been found in Illinois, northwest Indiana, southwest Michigan, southern Wisconsin, and Minnesota and northeast Iowa. Hopewell trading networks were quite extensive, with obsidian from the Yellowstone area, copper from Lake Superior, and shells from the Gulf Coast. Havana Hopewell sites Rockwell Mound, a major site at Havana Toolesboro Mound Group The Toolesboro Mound Group in Louisa County, Iowa included a large octagonal earthen enclosure that covered several acres; earthworks of this style are reminiscent of the monumental construction seen in Chillicothe and Newark, Ohio. It also has a group of seven burial mounds on a bluff overlooking the Iowa River near where it joins the Mississippi River. The conical mounds were constructed between 100 BCE and 200 CE. At one time, there may have been as many as twelve mounds. Mound 2, the largest remaining, measures 100 feet in diameter and 8 feet in height. This mound was possibly the largest Hopewell mound in Iowa.

Samuel White's Ground (also known as Plessey Ground) is a sports ground in Park Road, Cowes, Isle of Wight, England. The ground is owned by the Isle of Wight Council and is surrounded by residential housing. A multitude of sports have been played at the ground, including cricket, football and bowls. History The ground was originally owned by J. Samuel White & Co. Ltd., a ship builders based in Cowes. The company constructed the ground in 1953, with construction being funded by subscriptions from employees of the company. Hampshire first played first-class cricket there three years later in 1956, when Worcestershire were the visitors in the County Championship, with Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie scoring the maiden century on the ground in Hampshire's first-innings, followed by Laddy Outschoorn in Worcestershire's second- innings. The match ended in a draw. Hampshire played a match there each year until 1962, playing seven first-class matches there. However, J.Samuel White & Co. Ltd. fell on hard times, with the company's Cowes shipyard closing in 1963, bringing to an end Hampshire's use of the ground. The ground was sought after for development, but planning was refused, with the ground falling into disuse. The ground was later bought in 1978 by the Isle of Wight Council. The council sought to offload the ground to a community-based organisation in 1984, with a lease being agreed with the Plessey Club. The Milne Memorial Sports Ground Co. Ltd was formed to acquire the lease and manage the day-to- day running of the club. When first acquired, the clubs membership was only open to employees and ex-employees of Plessey's and J. Samuel White & Co. Having been disused by until 1984, the cricket ground and football grounds had been used for hay making, the tennis courts and bowling greens were in a state of disrepair, as was the pavilion. The club borrowed ¬£65,000 to extend the pavilion and ¬£10,000 to building a new clubhouse for the bowling greens. Hampshire returned there for a match in 1987 in aid of Malcolm Marshall's benefit, though the game didn't carry first-class or List A status. Today, the cricket ground is used by Cowes Cricket Club. More recently, the club was able to acquire Lottery funding to the tune of ¬£330,000 for an indoor bowls facility, though this was only possible by club members lending ¬£100,000 themselves. The club is today open to membership for all residents of the Isle of Wight.

Wyoming native Tom Bell founded the group in 1967, along with Carrol R. Noble, Margaret E. ‚ÄúMardy‚Äù Murie, Dr. Harold McCracken, Ann Lindahl and others.Wyoming State Journal, Thursday, March 2, 1967. Link to story The group was originally called the Wyoming Outdoor Coordinating Council. The Outdoor Council is a non-profit environmental advocacy organization with roughly 1,400 members, and offices in Lander and Laramie, Wyoming. The group's slogan is ‚ÄúWorking to protect public lands and wildlife since 1967‚Äù.See any of various Wyoming Outdoor Council publications, including the most recent Annual Report On its website, the group states: ‚ÄúThe Outdoor Council has worked for more than four decades to protect Wyoming‚Äôs iconic western landscapes, its world-renowned wildlife, and its clean air and water.‚Äù The Wyoming Outdoor Council's stated mission since 2008 is to ‚Äúprotect Wyoming‚Äôs environment and quality of life for future generations.‚ÄùWyoming Outdoor Council strategic plan, adopted by board in December 2008. Wyoming Outdoor Council strategic plan. In December 2008, the Outdoor Council's board of directors adopted a new strategic plan, which puts an emphasis on making sure energy development is undertaken in Wyoming with the ‚Äúbest available technology‚Äù and with minimum environmental impact. The new plan also focuses on ensuring good stewardship for Wyoming's of federal public lands, with a particular emphasis on protecting the state's iconic landscapes, as identified by the Council. These landscapes, which the group calls Wyoming's ‚Äúheritage landscapes‚Äù, are all on public lands, and they have ‚Äúsignificant environmental, historic, cultural, or social values‚Äù, according to the Wyoming Outdoor Council. Because of this, the group believes energy development should be off-limits in these heritage landscapes (see list of heritage landscapes below). Wyoming‚Äôs heritage landscapes The Wyoming Outdoor Council has identified the following areas as Wyoming's heritage landscapes: :* All national forests in Wyoming :* National parks, national monuments, and national wildlife refuges :* Bureau of Land Management areas of critical environmental concern :* The Wyoming Range :* The Wind River Front :* Jack Morrow Hills :* Adobe Town :* Fortification Creek :* Beartooth Front :* Shirley Basin :* Citizens‚Äô proposed wilderness areas on BLM lands Conserving Wyoming‚Äôs endemic species The Wyoming Outdoor Council also works to preserve wildlife whose home ranges are located primarily in Wyoming. These animals are referred to by the group as Wyoming's endemic species, and they include the Wyoming toad, three subspecies of pika, white-tailed prairie dog, the dwarf shrew, the Uinta ground squirrel, the Uinta chipmunk and the Wyoming pocket gopher.The organization's information on Wyoming's endemic species Tom Bell, founder Tom Bell, founder of the Wyoming Outdoor Council, grew up on a ranch outside Lander during the Great Depression. He was born on April 12, 1924, descended from Civil War soldier Edward Alton, who moved to Milford, Wyoming, in 1878.Lander Journal, July 3‚Äì5, 2003, ‚ÄúTom Bell‚Äôs mother was a teenage horse wrangler,‚Äù page 6. Bell is a decorated World War II veteran, who flew with the 15th of the US Army's Air Forces on bombing missions throughout central and southern Europe.High Country News, March 13, 2000. He successfully completed 32 combat sorties and earned the rank of 1st Lieutenant with the 455 Bombardment Group.Murphy, Victoria. Wyoming: A 20th Century History of its Citizens, Businesses & Institutions, p. 72. Heritage Media Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A., 1999 He was awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in action on 2 May 1944. On May 10, 1944, Lieutenant Bell was bombardier of a B-24 on a mission to bomb an enemy aircraft factory in Austria, when he was severely wounded by a burst of flak, causing him to lose his right eye and suffer shock and loss of blood.General order number 1846 by Major General Twining, July 14, 1944 When he returned home he said he found sanctuary in Wyoming's wide-open spaces.Wyoming Outdoor Council, page 1. Frontline, Fall 2007, page 1 Bell attended the University of Wyoming where he earned a bachelor's and then a master's degree in wildlife conservation and game management. His course of study emphasized ecology and zoology. Bell said he founded the Wyoming Outdoor Council because, by the mid-1960s, he could no longer ignore the threats facing his ‚Äúbeloved homeland‚Äù. His vision, he said, was to bring together various organizations in the state to speak as one voice on conservation issues. ‚ÄúThe first meeting was held in Casper,‚Äù Bell said. ‚ÄúI remember a sense of excitement. Maybe we could all pull together to work on some of these issues and get something accomplished. And we did.‚Äù He resigned as director of the Wyoming Outdoor Council in the early 1970s to found the High Country News a paper that started as a small local camping magazine that he built into an award-winning national news journal on Western environmental issues. Although he resigned as director of the Wyoming Outdoor Council, he later returned as a board member, and today continues to serve as a board member emeritus.Wyoming Outdoor Council board Bell was featured in the 2006 documentary A Land Out of TimeA Land Out of Time which describes the effects of energy development on the western landscape and the people that live there. Bell has won many awards for his conservation work, including the National Wildlife Federation's Jay N. ‚ÄúDing‚Äù Darling Award, for Conservationist of the Year in 2002. The award was established ‚Äúto honor individuals who have made exceptional lifetime contributions to the cause of conservation‚Äù, according to the National Wildlife Federation.

John Chafee.National Wildlife Federation Bell also received the Greater Yellowstone Coalition's Sargent Award for Lifetime Achievement in Conservation in 2007, and the Wyoming Citizen of the Century from the University of Wyoming's American Heritage Center in 2000Wyoming Outdoor Council, [href=\\"http://wyomingoutdoorcouncil.org/html/press_room/pdfs/Newsletters/2007Fall- FL.pdf Frontline, Fall 2007], page 1. The early days The Wyoming Outdoor Council's early work in the late 1960s and early 1970s included public opposition to two major plans ‚Äî one was to dam the Upper Green River near Pinedale, and the other to clear-cut large sections of the Bridger-Teton National Forest and Shoshone National Forest near Dubois. Both proposals were ultimately quashed. The group also fought to eliminate illegal and/or excessive fencing on public lands, in order to allow for freer movement of wildlife.Wyoming Outdoor Council archives, 1954-1983, Acc. #8958, University of Wyoming American Heritage Center, Environmental and Natural Resource Collection. The Wyoming Outdoor Council also strenuously opposed and campaigned against the so-called Wagon Wheel project ‚Äî a federal proposal to explode nuclear bombs underground in the Upper Green River Valley to release natural gas that was trapped in the rocks. Regional residents protested the project vigorously, and the plan was ultimately abandoned. The Wyoming Outdoor Council also laid the groundwork ‚Äî through surveys and catalogs ‚Äî for future designations of wilderness areas in the state, including those areas eventually identified in the Wyoming Wilderness Act of 1984 (see ‚ÄúThe 1980s and 1990s‚Äù below). In 1975, the Council joined with the Sierra Club to create a ‚Äúcitizen‚Äôs lobby‚Äù that would have a presence in the state capital, Cheyenne, during Wyoming's legislative session. That year the citizen's lobby helped secure the passage of the Industrial Development, Information and Siting Act, which strengthened the state's clean air and water regulations and bolstered its regulatory power. The Wyoming Outdoor Council, through Tom Bell's advocacy in the 1960s, helped lay the groundwork for this Industrial Siting Bill. The group also advocated for the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act, which passed in 1973, and which created the Wyoming Environmental Quality Council, the state's environmental rulemaking body. The 1980s and 1990s The Wyoming Wilderness Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in October 1984, was arguably the biggest victory for Wyoming conservationists in the 1980s. To this day, the bill protects nearly , more than , of wilderness in the state. The Wyoming Wilderness Association, once an affiliate of the Wyoming Outdoor Council, led the grassroots effort to build broad-based local support to help ensure passage of the measure. Wyoming's congressional delegation ‚Äî Senators Alan Simpson and Malcolm Wallop and then-Representative Dick Cheney ‚Äî used that overwhelming public support to win approval in Congress. Cheney, the former vice president, called it one of his \\"proudest achievements\\".\\"Wyo Range, Snake River bills were populist efforts.\\" Casper Star-Tribune, March 29, 2009 In the early 1990s, the Wyoming Outdoor Council challenged the validity of the Pathfinder Mine's bond for uranium pit reclamation in southern Wyoming. The Council sued, and the state ultimately supported the Council's case. The Wyoming Outdoor Council won the lawsuit, ensuring the company would properly fund the environmental reclamation of the mine. The Outdoor Council also fought against legislation in the early 1990s that would have created a site in central Wyoming for storing America's radioactive waste, called the Monitored Retrievable Storage project. The Wyoming Outdoor Council mounted a statewide campaign against the initiative, and in 1992 helped convince Governor Mike Sullivan to veto the bill.See: Kessler, Stephanie.

The Wyoming Outdoor Council also played critical roles in protecting the Shoshone National Forest from oil and gas development and in stopping the proposed Noranda gold mine on the border of Yellowstone National Park in the name of safeguarding the environment.Hearing before the SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES of the COMMITTEE ON RESOURCES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, ONE HUNDRED FIFTH CONGRESS, FIRST SESSION, MAY 20, 1997, WASHINGTON, DC, 1997, see the testimony of Michael Clark, executive director of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, a Bozeman, Montana-based group with field offices in Cody, Wyoming and Idaho Falls, Idaho. Link to 1997 hearing. The 21st century Wyoming's latest energy boom started in the late 1990s and exploded in the early 21st century. In response, the Wyoming Outdoor Council has shifted much of its focus toward watchdogging the unprecedented, fast-paced development of natural gas fields, coal-bed methane operations, utility-scale wind farms, a proposed coal-to-liquids plant and four proposed new coal-fired power plants in the state.Wyomin Outdoor Council 2007 and 2008 annual reports, as well as the Summer 2009, Spring 2008, and Fall 2007 Frontlines. ‚ÄúThe boom that began in the 1990s now influences all aspects of our work to protect Wyoming‚Äôs public lands and wildlife, as basin after basin fills with drill rigs,‚Äù the group wrote in its Fall 2007 newsletter.The Wyoming Outdoor Council Fall Frontline, the organization's newsletter. The Wyoming Outdoor Council's most recent work has included an effort to bring national attention to Wyoming's Red Desert, which, the group argues, contains extremely rare, National Park-worthy sites and landscapes that deserve protection. The group has also worked to raise awareness of the state's Upper Green River Valley, where high levels of air pollution caused by energy development have led Wyoming to recommend the Environmental Protection Agency designate the area ‚Äúnonattainment‚Äù for national ambient air quality standards for ground-level ozone levels.News Stories: Sublette Examiner: http://www.subletteexaminer.com/V2_news_articles.php?heading=0&page;=72&story;_id=1089; Sublette County Commission News: http://sublettewyo.wordpress.com/2009/03/12/ozone-non-attainment-area/; Billings Gazette: http://www.billingsgazette.com/news/state-and- regional/wyoming/article_8b103f94-8ba7-11de-a04b-001cc4c03286.html; Casper Star-Tribune: http://www.trib.com/news/state-and- regional/article_b2cd508c-5173-5a3c-bf63-a05e82dd10cd.html, http://www.trib.com/editorial/forum/article_e884d681-bc5e-5b15-8ce4-1b76bba7e7d6.html, http://www.trib.com/news/state-and-regional/article_d94bab00-170f-5259-a9ec- ba00e3a0ffff.html, http://www.trib.com/news/state-and- regional/article_249a329b-925b-5bf8-8331-f826fb672207.html; Official Documentation from the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality: http://deq.state.wy.us/eqc/orders/Air%20Closed%20Cases/09-1101%20Crumpley%20et%20al.Citizen%20Petition.AQ%20Rulemaking/Crumpley%20et%20al.%20Ozone%20Petition%20for%20Rulemaking.pdf The Outdoor Council has also worked on issues related to massive water production and documented contamination resulting from coal-bed methane development in northeast Wyoming's Powder River Basin.News Stories: Associated Press: \\"Wyoming watershed initiative targets permit process\\" http://trib.com/news/state-and- regional/article_277e0a99-1da5-5b6c-bb77-4d23bb1a213e.html; U.S. Water News Online: \\"Environmental groups file suit over coal bed methane ponds\\" http://www.uswaternews.com/archives/arcrights/2envgro2.html; Casper Star- Tribune: \\"Groups appeal BLM's CBM document\\" http://www.trib.com/news/state- and-regional/article_10e9daf0-afde-5c04-b613-4e6817c225c5.html; EarthJustice: \\"Environmental Groups File Suit over Coalbed Methane Damage\\" http://www.earthjustice.org/news/press/002/environmental_groups_file_suit_over_coalbed_methane_damage.html The Wyoming Outdoor Council was also part of a broad coalition that worked to ensure passage of the Wyoming Range Legacy Act, a bill modeled after legislation that Wyoming Republican Senator Craig Thomas had intended to introduce before his death, and which was later introduced by his successor, John Barrasso. The legislation safeguards the Wyoming Range in western Wyoming from future oil and gas leases while creating a mechanism for the buy-back and retiring of existing oil and gas leases.

Biography Born in New Jersey, Garrison began his career as an actor, and appeared in Robert E. Sherwood's play There Shall Be No Night in London in 1943. After the war, he had bit parts in several 20th Century Fox films, including \\"Dragonwyck\\" (1946) and \\"Are You with It?\\" (1948). In 1954, Garrison and Gregory Ratoff purchased the movie rights to Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel, Casino Royale, for $600. CBS, meanwhile, bought the TV rights, and on October 21, 1954 broadcast an hour-long adaptation on its Climax! series, with Barry Nelson playing American agent 'Jimmy Bond' and Peter Lorre playing the villain, Le Chiffre. CBS also approached Fleming about developing Bond as a TV series. In 1955 Ratoff and Garrison bought the rights to the novel in perpetuity for an additional $6,000. They pitched the idea for a motion picture to 20th Century Fox, but were turned down. After Ratoff died in 1960, his widow and Garrison sold the film rights to Charles K. Feldman for $75,000. Feldman eventually produced the spoof Casino Royale in 1967. Garrison was in the casting department at 20th Century Fox before becoming an associate producer under Jerry Wald. He worked on four Wald pictures, including Peyton Place (1957), The Long Hot Summer, The Sound and the Fury, and An Affair to Remember. In the fall of 1958 he moved to Warner Bros. as an assistant to Steve Trilling. Garrison produced The Dark at the Top of the Stairs (1960) and The Crowded Sky. He also produced the short-lived 1961 CBS television series The Investigators. In the mid-1960s, Garrison pitched The Wild Wild West to CBS as \\"James Bond on horseback\\"‚Äîlinking the television western to the popular spy genre. During its first season, the series had difficulties and CBS rotated nine producers in and out of the show. The network tried to fire Garrison, but he was reinstated at the end of the season. The series was in production on its second season when, while preparing for a party at his new Bel Air home on August 17, 1966, Garrison slipped in some water on a flight of stairs, falling and fatally fracturing his skull. According to Variety,Variety, Aug. 24, 1966 he had three TV shows in development at the time of his death: \\"The Pickle Brothers,\\" starring Don Rickles; \\"Happy Valley\\" for Warner Bros.; and \\"Kelly's Country.\\" In 1955 Garrison married Barbara Silverstone, daughter of Murray Silverstone, president of 20th Century-Fox International. They later divorced. He was survived by his mother, son and brother. His mausoleum is in Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery.

One of 16 refuges in Alaska, it was established in 1980 when Congress passed The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). At , Kanuti Refuge is about the size of the state of Delaware. Located at the Arctic Circle, the refuge is a prime example of Alaska's boreal ecosystem. It is dominated by black and white spruce, with some white birch and poplars. Description and species The region's short, hot summers are marked by numerous thunderstorms and lightning strikes, leading to a continuous cycle of burn and recovery. Natural wildfires create diverse habitats with the different plant species supporting a variety of wildlife. The refuge's boreal forest is home to 37 species of mammals, including two species of fox, Canadian lynx, brown and black bear species, wolf packs, moose, mink, coyote, muskrat, beaver, marten, river otter, muskoxen, and wolverine. Caribou from the Western Arctic and Ray Mountain herds occasionally winter on Kanuti, as well. The refuge's migratory fish, chinook, chum and coho salmon, as well as sheefish, are creatures of extremes. Its sheefish make the longest spawning journey of any of their species, while Kanuti's salmon have to swim more than up the Yukon River before entering the Koyukuk River system to spawn. Refuge waters support twelve other fish species, including arctic grayling and northern pike. Protecting breeding habitat for migratory birds is central to the mission of Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Nearly 130 species of birds spend part or all of the year on refuge lands. With the loss of wetlands in regions outside Alaska, the importance of Kanuti as a nesting area for birds is likely to increase. Certain lands within the Kanuti Refuge boundary are now under Native Alaskan ownership. Subsistence hunting is permitted within the refuge. Permafrost inhibits drainage of the surface water, leaving a soggy landscape that can make hiking difficult, if not impossible, in certain parts of the refuge. No designated trails, campsites, or public use cabins exist within refuge boundaries.

Roma's planned stadium in the Tor di Valle neighborhood of Rome. A formal name for the stadium will be decided after naming rights are awarded, but is still uncertain over how long it will take to open the stadium. The planned location is along the Tiber River and accessible via the main highway connecting the city with Leonardo da Vinci‚ÄìFiumicino Airport. Seating capacity is planned for 52,500 spectators. The stadium is being designed by American architect Dan Meis in collaboration with the multidisciplinary engineering firm SCE Project, and is said to be inspired by the ancient Colosseum. Features of the stadium include luxury boxes, and a 14,000-seat section designated for the Ultras of the Curva Sud in the Stadio Olimpico, the 72,698-seat facility Roma currently shares with their crosstown rival, S.S. Lazio. Background The stadium and its facilities will replace the current Tor di Valle Racecourse, which is served by the Tor di Valle train stop on the Rome‚ÄìLido railway. Plans additionally call for service on Rome's Line B subway to be extended to the station, and on to Muratella, a train station on the FR1 railway that is across the river from the proposed development. Besides the main stadium, plans call for additional venues for music, entertainment, shopping, and training facilities, as well as bars, restaurants, and a Nike SuperStore. The stadium, the fifth in Italy to be privately owned and financed, is estimated to cost ‚Ç¨300 million, but the total cost for all the facilities and venues, including infrastructure improvement, is close to ‚Ç¨1 billion. Development In 2016 Goldman Sachs made a ‚Ç¨30 million loan to Stadio TDV S.p.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of NEEP Roma Holding, for the pre-development cost of the stadium. On 2 February 2017, the Region of Lazio and the mayor of Rome rejected the proposal to build a new stadium, however, the proposal was later approved on 24 February after final review of the stadium's design adjustments. In August 2017, the stadium hit another delay, with a new planning process beginning in September. Roma subsequently renewed their lease with the Stadio Olimpico until 2020. In December 2017, the stadium plans were approved, with the stadium expected to be ready to open for the 2020‚Äì21 season.

In his early career, he was credited as lead developer on several console games. He also was an early bitcoin contributor and received the first bitcoin transaction from bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto.  Early life and education  Finney was born in Coalinga, California on May 4, 1956, to Virginia and Harold Thomas Finney. His father was a petroleum engineer. He attended the California Institute of Technology, graduating with a BS in engineering in 1979.  Career  After graduation from Caltech, he went to work in the computer gaming field for a company that developed video games such as Adventures of Tron, Armor Ambush, Astrosmash and Space Attack. He later went to work for the PGP Corporation with whom he remained until his retirement in 2011. Finney was a noted cryptographic activist.\\"For instance, many ACLU members do not share the generalized antipathy toward government that is a common premise of \\"cypherpunk\\" activists like Hal Finney and Tim May.\\" David Brin, The Transparent Society ch2 During the early 1990s, in addition to being a regular poster on the cypherpunks listserv, Finney ran two anonymous remailers. Further cryptographic activism included running a (successful) contest to break the export-grade encryption Netscape used.\\"Give Us Some Credit: Your Card is Safe\\" , The Washington Post, 1996 In 2004, Finney created the first reusable proof of work system before bitcoin. In January 2009, Finney was the Bitcoin network's first transaction recipient. Bitcoin Finney was a cypherpunk and said: He was an early Bitcoin user and received the first bitcoin transaction from Bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Finney lived in the same town for 10 years that Dorian Nakamoto lived (Temple City, California), adding to speculation that he may have been Bitcoin's creator. Finney denied that he was Satoshi Nakamoto. In March 2013, Finney posted on a Bitcoin forum BitcoinTalk that he was essentially paralyzed, but continued to program. He continued to program until his death; he was working on experimental software called bcflick, which uses Trusted Computing to strengthen Bitcoin wallets. During the last year of his life, the Finneys received anonymous calls demanding an extortion fee of 1,000 bitcoin. They became victims of swatting ‚Äì a hoax \\"where the perpetrator calls up emergency dispatch using a spoofed telephone number and pretends to have committed a heinous crime in the hopes of provoking an armed police response to the victim's home\\". Extortionists have demanded fees of more bitcoins than Finney had left after using the majority of them to cover medical expenses in 2013. Personal life In October 2009, Finney announced in an essay on the blog Less Wrong that he had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, a/k/a \\"Lou Gehrig's disease\\") in August 2009. Prior to his illness, Finney had been an active runner. Finney and his wife raised money for ALS research with the Santa Barbara International Marathon.

It lies within the floodplain of the Koyukuk River, in a basin that extends from the Yukon River to the Purcell Mountains and the foothills of the Brooks Range. This region of wetlands is home to fish, waterfowl, beaver and Alaskan moose, and wooded lowlands where two species of fox, bears, wolf packs, Canadian lynx and marten prowl. The Northern Unit of the Innoko National Wildlife Refuge, commonly known as Kaiyuh Flats, is managed as part of the Koyukuk/Nowitna Refuge Complex. Rich in wetlands, the Northern Innoko is an extremely productive breeding area for migratory waterfowl and fish. The streams and rivers of the refuge complex support three species of salmon, Arctic grayling, sheefish, and many other fish species. Northern pike, especially those that winter in the shallow lakes of the Northern Innoko National Wildlife Refuge, sometimes grow to record size. In the Koyukuk's wetlands, breeding waterfowl feast upon water plants and abundant protein-rich invertebrates. Young birds grow quickly in the short, lush summer, and prepare for the fall migration. As many as 100,000 ducks are hatched and raised on refuge lands during a single nesting season. Migratory songbirds and raptors also depend on the rich resources of the Koyukuk Refuge for breeding and raising young. Koyukuk Refuge's Three-Day Slough area, part of the Koyukuk Wilderness, has some of the most productive moose habitat in Alaska. This region has, at times, supported more than 10 moose per square mile. Recent counts indicate that some areas still contain densities of five moose or more per square mile. As with much of the refuge big game work, these moose counts are cooperative efforts between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Caribou from the migratory Western Arctic Herd, which numbers more than 450,000, often move into the northernmost reaches of the refuge in winter months in search of lichens that lie beneath the snow. The Koyukuk also supports a resident non-migratory caribou population, the Galena Mountain Herd, which numbers about 300. Wolf packs, Canadian lynx and other furbearers, as well as black and grizzly bears, are found on the refuge year around.

Concept The record is a satire of the 1973 energy crisis in the United States, and was moderately successful; it peaked at #33 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became the first Top 40 hit for Goodman as a solo artist (Goodman's other records throughout the 1960s had mostly fallen just short of the top 40 and his 1950s works were all collaborations). The record is structured as a series of interviews with various public and political figures of the day with regard to the energy crisis. Questions were asked by an interviewer (Goodman), and their \\"responses\\" were snippets of various hit records of the day. The record ends with Goodman saying, \\"we have just run out of en-er-gyyyyy\\" as his speech slows to a halt, as if the turntable playing the record had just been shut off. \\"The Mistake\\" The intended B-side of the record was an instrumental by guitarist John White called \\"Ruthie's Theme\\", named for a friend's daughter and credited only to \\"P.D.\\" (Goodman often placed such throwaways on the backs of his 45s, and in fact had already used \\"Ruthie's Theme\\" on the B-side of his version of \\"The Purple People Eater\\", released the previous year.) However, the record plant sent Goodman a number of discs that had only a few seconds of \\"Energy Crisis '74\\" (\\"Mr. President, the cri--\\"), followed by two minutes of silence.\\"The Mistake\\" on YouTube Rather than throw them away or demand a refund, Goodman gave the botched recording the name \\"The Mistake\\" and had the plant cut the proper version of \\"Energy Crisis '74\\" onto the other side, making \\"The Mistake\\" perhaps the most unlikely B-side ever to grace a hit record. (Later pressings correctly featured \\"Ruthie's Theme\\" on the flip.) White had previously included \\"Ruthie's Theme\\" under the name \\"City\\" on his own eponymous album in 1971.https://www.discogs.com/John-White-John- White/release/2938390 Goodman would return to this topic with \\"Energy Crisis '79\\" five years later, but it was not a hit. Portions of Goodman's dialogue would later be used on his son Jon Goodman's recording \\"Economy Crisis\\" in 2008. Songs Many big hits of the day (including from three of the four ex- Beatles) were sampled on the record: * \\"Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress)\\" by Helen Reddy * \\"Smokin' in the Boys Room\\" by Brownsville Station * \\"Living for the City\\" by Stevie Wonder * \\"Helen Wheels\\" by Paul McCartney and Wings * \\"Mind Games\\" by John Lennon * \\"The Joker\\" by Steve Miller Band * \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" by Elton John * \\"Hello It's Me\\" by Todd Rundgren * \\"You're Sixteen\\" by Ringo Starr * \\"The Most Beautiful Girl\\" by Charlie Rich * \\"Top of the World\\" by The Carpenters Presumably for music rights reasons, \\"Energy Crisis '74\\" was heavily edited on Goodman's \\"Greatest Fables\\" compilation, released in 1997. Fake re-recorded snippets were used for all but two of the above tracks (except \\"Smokin' in the Boys Room\\" and \\"Living for the City\\"), with the segments for \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" and \\"Top of the World\\" completely removed.

Location  The Planetarium of Nantes is located on the right bank of the Loire, on the \\"Butte Sainte-Anne\\", at the number 8 of the \\"Rue des Acadiens\\", in the Square Moisan, in the neighborhood \\"Bellevue - Chantenay - Sainte-Anne\\", near the Jules Verne Museum.  Characteristics  The Planetarium of Nantes can not be visited as a museum, it offers commented sessions of about an hour (as in the cinema but live). Each session, scheduled according to a schedule established in advance, is adapted to a certain type of public, according to the age or the level of knowledge. Under a dome 8 meters (26 ft) in diameter, it can accommodate 51 spectators and accommodate about 50,000 visitors per year, school or the general public. In the lobby, there are three large meteorites (36 kg or 79 lbs for the heaviest) that the public can touch, showcases exposing several fragments of various types of meteorites, models putting various robots in situation on the soil of Mars, Venus, the Moon, Titan (moon of Saturn) and on a comet, planetary globes, rockets, the International Space Station, probes like Juno (around Jupiter) or Hubble (the space telescope) and James Webb Telescope ( his replacement) and other rovers. The planetarium of Nantes also has a shop offering models of rockets, postcards in \\"3D\\", mobile maps of the sky, real meteorites, some introductory books and various gadgets. The planetarium of Nantes is also equipped with a mobile planetarium (inflatable structure 5 to 6 meters in diameter and 3 meters high) designed especially for the introduction to astronomy for use in schools, colleges and high schools. and associations. It also offers rental of various exhibitions and models. The Planetarium of Nantes also weaves a network among the local actors like the Laboratory of planetology of the University of Nantes, the Museum of natural history, the science and environment pole Sequoia, the Society of Astronomy of Nantes, the association \\"Meridienne\\" , and many others, all working in the field of research or scientific mediation including astronomy.  History  In 1979, the City of Nantes decided to build a planetarium. At that time, in France, there is only one large planetarium: that of Paris (at the \\"Palais de la d√©couverte\\"), and 3 small 6 meters: Reims, ENAC Toulouse and Cholet. That of Nantes will be built on the upper part of Square Moisan (abandoned at this time). Opened to the public on June 18, 1981, the planetarium is equipped with a Carl Zeiss projector, model ZKP2 identical to that of Reims, Nimes (which will open a year later) and Marseille (which will burn quickly). Between 1999 and 2000, the City of Nantes expanded the premises with two offices of 9m2 (97 ft2), which allows to expand the lobby and install some models and collections of meteorites. 5 years later, in the autumn of 2005, for approximately 480,000 euros, the opto-mechanical projector Zeiss is replaced by a digital type installation and the City of Nantes has offered its former planetary Zeiss at the National University of C√≥rdoba (Argentina ). At that time, there were only 3 planetariums in France using Evans & Sutherland's Digistar II fisheye (Vaulx-en-Velin, Pleumeur-Bodou and Toulouse), and Saint-√âtienne experimenting with multi-video projectors. Nantes is the first planetarium in the world, to install five video projectors (to cover the entire vault) DLP type in a medium dome. Since the 1990s, some pioneers have been developing digital installations to replace opto-mechanical star projectors. Digital installations consist of installing video projectors in the dome, computers and software (astronomical simulator) to reconstruct the observable Universe from astronomical catalogs constructed by astronomers, such as Hipparcos (about 120,000 positioned stars). This makes it possible to move in a universe volume in three dimensions, in real time or to \\"travel\\" in time. If the simulator is well built, it can also travel from planets to planets and land there. In the fall of 2013, the Nantes Planetarium closed for refurbishment work: change of video projectors, computers and software for around 500,000 euros. These two months of closure to the public have refreshed the chairs, redo the painting of the dome and re-arrange the lobby of the public. As a result of the transformation of the urban community into Metropole, it becomes a metropolitan facility between January 2015 and January 2016. Almost 40 years after its opening and despite a new dynamic instilled by its new director: a third scientific mediation position, opening 7 days a week, about 1900 sessions per year, the Planetarium of Nantes has doubled its attendance in 6 years (from 25,000 to more than 50,000 people) but it is impossible to increase the gauge and declines about 15,000 people a year. It arrives at saturation. The M√©tropole of Nantes is therefore considering a study (at the next mandate), to decide whether or not the opportunity of a large planetarium project, like those of Rennes, Dunkirk, or Lyon, at the scale of its population basin.  Square Marcel-Moisan  coordinates = This small municipal square of 690 m2 (7427 sq ft) located between the back of the planetarium and the Rue de l'Hermitage, has in its center a set of sculptures, including a giant sundial, made by Jean-Michel Ansel, sundial maker, entitled Structures astronomiques , representing the movement of the Earth around the Sun, eclipses of the Moon and the Sun, the retrograde movement of Mars, the sunshine of the Earth in real time, the planets scaled to each other etc. This square is accessible either by the staircase located between Misery street and Hermitage street, or from the Acadiens street bypassing the planetarium.

History  Abraham Griffith (1822 - 1893)  Abraham (Abram) Griffith, 1822-1893. Builder of the Griffith Mansion (1886). Original Portrait. A native of Newcastle, Staffordshire, England, Abraham Griffith was born September 17, 1822. At the age of 22, Griffith came to America in 1844, arriving in New York, where he resided until 1849. News of the California Gold Rush excitement had spread and Mr. Griffith was introduced to one of the Aspinwall's, a founder of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and given a position as stoker on the steamship Panama. Leaving New York December 1, 1848, they were out only five days when the ship suffered mechanical difficulty and was forced to set sail back to New York. That winter, Mr. Griffith worked as a clerk in a store until July 15, 1849, when he again was given the opportunity to work for his passage to California, this time on the steamer Empire City to the Isthmus of Panama, then aboard the steamer Oregon, arriving in San Francisco September 16, 1849. On the night of October 2 he camped on the bank of Cache Creek (Sacramento River) where Cacheville was situated. He and his friend helped an old man by the name of Thomas Cochran build a hut for a country tavern and soon after proceeded on their way to the northern mines. During the next summer he worked in the Trinity mines, saving about $500, soon stolen from him by a deceitful fellow traveler. He returned to Cacheville, repulsed with mining, and worked as a cook for Mr. Cochran he had earlier met. In the fall of 1851 Mr. Cochran left for Australia, owing Mr. Griffith and others a significant amount of money, and was never since heard from ‚Äî except in a letter from San Francisco to Mr. Griffith. Griffith then managed a hotel along with a man by the name of William Hammack until the autumn of 1852, when J. A. Hutton, who owned land nearby, came with his wife and they and Hammack became proprietors. In the fall of 1853 they opened a store and hired Mr. Griffith as clerk, for a salary of $75 a month with board. In December, 1854, Mr. Griffith married Mary Rush, who had crossed the plains that year. Soon after, in 1855, Mr. Griffith bought out Mr. Hammack and the firm became Hutton & Griffith. In 1857 the county-seat was removed from Washington to Cacheville. Hutton & Griffith sold out, and in 1859 Griffith bought out the store of White & Weaver, at Cacheville; there were then several mercantile establishments in the place. In 1861 Mr. Griffith purchased the store of H. C. Yerby, the first brick store in the town, if not in the county, and he succeeded J. A. Hutton (who had been county judge of Yolo many years) as Postmaster. Mr. Griffith also became agent for the Wells Fargo Express Company, a position he held for about sixteen years. He had a family of three daughters and five sons, with little Jennie laid to rest in the cemetery at the age of three, in 1868. Griffith retired in 1880 and in September 1885, while in San Francisco with his wife and four youngest boys, his house burned down with no insurance. Front. Earliest known photo of residence.

The Griffith Residence  In 1886, Abram Griffith built a fine Victorian residence of Italianate architecture upon of land in Cacheville, CA (now Yolo). This High Victorian Italianate residence exists as the grand dame of the homes in the town, sitting on the edge of the commercial district on a large spacious lot on the bank of the Cache Creek, just outside Woodland. The residence boasts prominent bay windows, keystone arched, sash windows throughout, scrolled brackets at the eaves and classical corinthian columns complete the ornamentation. What came to be known as the Griffith Mansion, the residence was built upon the ancient site of an Indian burial ground. While digging to lay the foundation for the chimneys, the bones of an Indian buried in sitting position were discovered. There was a hole in the top of the skull, the brains had been removed and hand-made Indian money put in its place when he was buried. He was probably a Digger of note among his tribe as a financier, and perhaps thought money would be of more use than brains in the hunting grounds. The residence remained a home to the Griffith family until 1935, then sold to the Hugo Maassen family, who were said to never have occupied the upper levels. The property was then purchased by Greg & Marie Tornincasa, who were searching for a historic estate after involvement in the restoration of the Snowball Mansion in neighboring Knights Landing. The residence underwent extensive restoration during a 15 year span, restoring the home to its original charm as well as adding up-to-date necessities and luxuries. The home, a never-ending project, is still owned and cared for by Greg & Marie today. In May 1998, Greg & Marie were in the process of having an in-ground pool excavated on the property grounds, when contractors uncovered a 400- to 500-year-old Native American village or burial ground, likely inhabited by the Patwin tribe. The coroner and Native American Heritage Commission were contacted, and the anthropology department of UC Davis was called in to recover the unearthed artifacts. For six days, volunteers, UC Davis undergraduate students and professors, spent 240 hours on-site collecting materials and studying the dig. Along with arrowheads, spear points, cutting tools, beads, animal and human skeletal remains, excavators uncovered delicate chert drills - an important discovery because they are believed to have been used to perforate marine clam shells to make beads, which became their currency. The anthropology department was responsible for finding the most likely descendants of the remains found. They then brought Greg & Marie who discovered the remains into contact with the descendant. In this case, the most likely descendant had allowed the excavation of the pool after studies were complete and also allowed UC Davis to study the artifacts for an additional year, after which time the skeletal remains and associated grave possessions would have to be reburied on the property in a secluded area where they would be left untouched.

Sheed and Ward, 1928 As Richelieu and P√®re Joseph were attempting to establish a colonial policy, Razilly suggested them to occupy Mogador in Morocco in 1626. The objective was to create a base against the Sultan of Marrakesh, and asphyxiate the harbor of Safi. He departed for Sal√© on 20 July 1629 with a fleet composed of the ships Licorne, Saint-Louis, Griffon, Catherine, Hambourg, Sainte-Anne, Saint-Jean. He bombarded the city the Sal√© and destroyed 3 corsair ships, and then sent the Griffon under Treillebois to Mogador. The men of Razilly saw the fortress of Castelo Real in Mogador, and landed 100 men with wood and supplies on Mogador island, with the agreement of Richelieu. After a few days however, the Griffon reembarked the colonists, and departed to rejoin the fleet in Sal√©.E.J.

There was cooperation in several fields. French officers trained the Moroccan army and advised the Moroccans in the building of public works. French Consuls in Morocco were assigned, such as Jean-Baptiste Estelle. The French ambassador Fran√ßois Pidou de Saint Olon, was sent by Louis XIV visited Moulai Ismael in 1693. The Ambassador of Morocco Abdallah bin Aisha also visited Paris in 1699. Collaboration After the end of the Seven Years' War, France turned its attention to Barbaresque pirates, especially those of Morocco, who had taken advantage of the conflict to attack Western shipping.Admiral de Grasse and American independence by Charles A. Lewis, Charles Lee Lewis p.41ff The French fleet failed in the Larache expedition in 1765. Some contacts continued during the 18th century, as when the French engineer Th√©odore Cornut designed the new harbour of Essaouira for King Mohammed ben Abdallah from 1760. In 1767, France established a treaty with Morocco, which gave her consular and diplomatic protection. This treaty would become a model for other European powers for the following years. In 1777, Mohammed ben Abdallah further sent an embassy to Louis XVI, led by Tahar Fennich and Haj Abdallah. The embassy brought as presents 20 French slaves previously captured in Provence by the pirates of Sal√©, as well as 6 magnificent horses. The two ambassadors remained in France for 6 months.In the lands of the Christians: Arabic travel writing in the seventeenth century by Nabil I. Matar p.191 Note 4 Another Moroccan embassy to France in 1781 was sent, but failed to be recognized on the pretext that the title of the king of France had not been properly rendered. Industrial era First Franco-Moroccan War Theater of the First Franco-Moroccan War (1844). After the troubled periods of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, France again showed a strong interest in Morocco in the 1830s, as a possible extension of her sphere of influence in the Maghreb, after Algeria and Tunisia. The First Franco-Moroccan War took place in 1844, as a consequence of Morocco's alliance with Algeria's Abd-El-Kader against France. Following several incidents at the border between Algeria and Morocco, and the refusal of Morocco to abandon its support to Algeria, France faced Morocco victoriously in the Bombardment of Tangiers (August 6, 1844), the Battle of Isly (August 14, 1844), and the Bombardment of Mogador (August 15‚Äì17, 1844).Navies in modern world history Lawrence Sondhaus p.71ff The war was formally ended September 10 with the signing of the Treaty of Tangiers, in which Morocco agreed to arrest and outlaw Abd-El-Kader, reduce the size of its garrison at Oujda, and establish a commission to demarcate the border. The border, which is essentially the modern border between Morocco and Algeria, was agreed in the Treaty of Lalla Maghnia. French Conquest of Morocco The United Kingdom recognized France's \\"sphere of influence\\" in Morocco in the 1904 Entente Cordiale, provoking a German reaction. The First Moroccan Crisis of 1905-1906 was resolved at the Algeciras Conference in 1906. The Treaty of Algeciras formalized France's preeminence among European powers in Morocco, and gave France a number of colonial privileges: control over duties at Moroccan ports, a contract to develop the ports of Casablanca and Asfi, and joint control with Spain over policing in Morocco. The French military conquest of Morocco began in March 1907 when General Lyautey occupied Oujda, ostensibly in response to the murder of the French doctor √âmile Mauchamp in Marrakesh. A western front was opened in August 1907 with the Bombardment of Casablanca and the following \\"pacification of the Chawiya.\\" The Second Moroccan Crisis, or the Agadir Crisis‚Äîin which France sent a large number of troops to Fes and Germany responded by sending a gunboat to Agadir and threatening with war‚Äîincreased European Great Power tensions. It was resolved with the Franco-Germany Treaty of November 4, 1911.  Colonial Period  The Treaty of Fes, signed March 30, 1912, formally established the French Protectorate over Morocco, and led to the Intifada of Fes. The Treaty of Fes (March 30, 1912) made Morocco a French protectorate. From a strictly legal point of view, the treaty did not deprive Morocco of its status as a sovereign state. Even after the Treaty of Fes, France waged wars of conquest in Morocco, notably the Zaian War in the Atlas and the Rif War in the north.  World War I  France recruited infantry from its colony in Morocco to join its troupes coloniales, as it did in its other colonies in Africa and around the world. Throughout World War I, a total of 37,300-45,000 Moroccans fought for France, forming a \\"Moroccan Brigade.\\" Moroccan colonial troops first served France in the First Battle of the Marne, September 1914, and participated in every major battle in the war, including in Artois, Champagne, and Verdun. Brahim El Kadiri Boutchich identified the participation of Moroccan soldiers in the service of France in WWI as \\"one of the most important moments in the shared history of Morocco and France.\\"  Independence  In late 1955, King Mohammed V successfully negotiated the gradual restoration of Moroccan independence within a framework of French-Moroccan interdependence.  Post independence  Mehdi Ben Barka was a Moroccan politician, head of the left- wing National Union of Popular Forces (UNPF) and secretary of the Tricontinental Conference. An opponent of King Hassan II, he \\"disappeared\\" in Paris in 1965. On March 3, 1973, King Hassan II announced the policy of Moroccanization, in which state-held assets, agricultural lands, and businesses that were more than 50 percent foreign-owned‚Äîand especially French- owned‚Äîwere transferred to political loyalists and high-ranking military officers. The Moroccanization of the economy affected thousands of businesses and the proportion of industrial businesses in Morocco that were Moroccan- owned immediately increased from 18% to 55%. Current Relations Current relations between France and Morocco have been characterized as neocolonial. As a francophone former colony (that nominally kept its independence) of France, Morocco falls into the cadre of Fran√ßafrique, a term used to refer to often neocolonial relations between France and its former colonies in Africa. These relations between the French Republic and the Kingdom of Morocco exist mainly in the domains of trade, investment, infrastructure, education, and tourism.  Economy  Morocco is the main recipient of French investment on the African continent, and France remains Morocco's primary foreign investor, primary trade partner, and primary creditor‚Äîby far. French foreign direct investment is present in every sector of the Moroccan economy, including the national airline, Royal Air Maroc, and the national rail network, ONCF. Moroccans do also invest in France; for example, the Royal Moroccan Air Force depends on French aeronautical technologies. Over 750 subsidiaries of French companies‚Äîsuch as Orange, Total, and Lydec‚Äîare present in Morocco, employing around 80,000 people. As the kingdom's primary trade partner, France benefits from Morocco's lack of energy reserves and food security‚Äîwhich create a constant dependency on foreign trade and a permanent trade deficit in Morocco. In 2008, Morocco exported $15 billion of goods and services while it imported $35 billion‚Äîprimarily from France.  Education  Morocco also imports education from France. To this day, French schools, which are colloquially referred to as la mission‚Äîwhether they‚Äôre actually related to Mission La√Øque Fran√ßaise or not‚Äîand in which French is the language of instruction and Arabic is only taught as a second language, still have a major presence in Morocco. The schools are certified by the Agency for French Education Abroad, and administered by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the student body is typically composed of the children of Morocco‚Äôs elite and well-to-do classes. These schools, such as Lyc√©e Lyautey in Casablanca, are typically located in big cities such as Casablanca, Rabat, Fes, Marrakesh, Meknes, and Oujda. France is the number 1 destination for Moroccan students leaving the country to study abroad, receiving 57.7% of all Moroccans studying outside of Morocco. Moroccan students also represent the largest group of foreign students in France, at 11.7% of all international students at universities in France, according to a 2015 UNESCO study. According to a study published in 2019, 35% of Moroccans speak French‚Äîmore than Algeria at 33%, and Mauretania at 13%. There are approximately 1,514,000 Moroccans living in France, representing the largest community of Moroccans outside of Morocco.Fiches th√©matiques - Population immigr√©e - Immigr√©s - Insee R√©f√©rences - √âdition 2012, Insee 2012 The INSEE announced that there are approximately 755,400 Moroccan nationals residing in France as of October 2019, representing 20% of France's immigrant population.

Born in Nova Scotia, she came west to Alberta to accept a job as a teacher. She later moved to Calgary where she encountered evangelist William Aberhart and became a convert to his social credit economic theories. After advocating these theories across the province, she was elected in the 1935 provincial election as a candidate of Aberhart's newly formed Social Credit League. Left out of cabinet despite her loyalty to Aberhart, she sided with the insurgents during the 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt, rejoining Aberhart's followers once a settlement was reached. She was defeated in the 1940 election. After her defeat, she abandoned Social Credit for the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, moved to Edmonton, and served for fifteen years as a school trustee. Edith Rogers died in 1985. Early life Born in Eastville, Nova Scotia, to Samuel G. and Mahala (n√©e Graham) Cox, Rogers was raised on a farm and attended Eastville High School and Normal School. She worked as a teacher in Nova Scotia until 1913, when she visited her aunt, Margaret Redmond, in Edgerton, Alberta. While there, she accepted an offer to teach at Bloomington School. She attended Camrose Normal School in 1914, after which she taught in Edgerton and near Tofield until 1918. Disillusioned with teaching in rural schoolhouses, she took a business course and began work as a bank teller for the Merchants Bank of Canada, which later merged with the Bank of Montreal, in Edgerton;Cavanaugh 506Byrne 93 this was an unusual career choice for a woman at the time. In 1922 she moved to Tofield, where she continued to work as a teller. The next year she moved to Killam, where she married William Rogers, the local high school principal, October 12, 1923. In 1929, the couple moved to Calgary, where they became friends with William Aberhart and his family. Rogers' first foray into politics took place during the 1930 federal election, when she assisted with R. B. Bennett's successful Calgary West campaign. Governments' inability to end or alleviate the effects of the Great Depression soon disillusioned her with conventional politics. Upon hearing that Aberhart was beginning to incorporate politics and economics into his weekly gospel radio addresses, she began to listen and soon became a convert to his version of social credit. Early involvement in social credit In 1932 Rogers convinced Aberhart to hold public meetings on social credit in Calgary; she subsequently organized neighbourhood study groups on the theory. In 1933 the Central Council of Social Credit in Calgary, which coordinated the city's sixty social credit study groups, named her women's organizer, in which capacity she held mass meetings designed to recruit women to social credit. In 1934 she embarked on a sixteen-month speaking tour of Alberta. At the same time, she organized social credit study groups around the province, including seventy-two in Edmonton. She concluded her tour by organizing a mass meeting there in the spring of 1935, where Aberhart spoke before 9,000 people.Byrne 94 When fissures appeared between Aberhart and people who supported the more orthodox version of social credit proposed by C. H. Douglas, the movement's British founder, Rogers remained steadfastly loyal to Aberhart. In the assessment of T. C. Byrne, her loyalty to Aberhart was second only to that of Ernest Manning, Aberhart's young prot√©g√©.Byrne 94‚Äì95 When Aberhart decided to run Social Credit candidates in the 1935 provincial election, he adopted an unusual system of candidate nomination: each constituency would nominate three or four candidates, with a committee headed by Aberhart deciding which one would actually run.Elliott 174 Six different constituencies nominated Rogers as one of their candidates, and Aberhart decided that she should run in Ponoka. Her opponent from the governing United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) was John Edward Brownlee, who had resigned as Premier of Alberta (but not as Member of the Legislative Assembly) the previous year in the wake of a sex scandal in which he was sued for the seduction of a young woman. Brownlee biographer Franklin Foster speculates that the selection of a female candidate to run against the so-called \\"sober faced seducer\\" was a deliberate strategic decision by Aberhart, and noted further that \\"aside from Aberhart himself, [Social Credit] could not have fielded a stronger candidate\\" in Ponoka.Foster 270 Member of the Legislative Assembly Rogers won the riding with 2,295 votes, more than 1,400 ahead of Brownlee. In fact, the UFA lost every seat it contested, and Social Credit candidates won 56 of Alberta's 63 seats. Aberhart became premier. He did not appoint Rogers (or any other woman) to his cabinet, and Athabasca University historian Alvin Finkel has suggested that her gender cost her such an appointment. Female cabinet ministers were not unprecedented in Alberta (Irene Parlby was a cabinet minister throughout the UFA's time in office) and Finkel argues, given that Rogers was \\"recognized as sharp, articulate, and hard-working\\", that she could reasonably have expected a cabinet portfolio.Finkel 97 Despite her loyalty to Aberhart, Rogers became frustrated with his delay in implementing the social credit economic reforms he had promised. During the 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt she sided with the insurgents who threatened to bring down the government unless it took concrete steps to implement social credit. Once the insurgents reached a settlement with Aberhart, she returned to her former position of loyalty, and sought re-election as a Social Crediter in the 1940 election. Prior to this election, Social Credit's opponents, including Liberals, Conservatives, and those elements of the UFA that had not moved to Social Credit, formed the People's League, which ran nominally independent candidates. One of these candidates, Percy McKelvey, led Rogers by 13 votes on the first count. The Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF)'s C. A. Johnson was in a distant third. When Johnson's votes were redistributed, in accordance with Alberta's electoral laws at the time, McKelvey's margin increased to nearly two hundred votes, and he was declared the victor. Later life After her defeat, Rogers and her husband moved to Edmonton. She disapproved of the Social Credit government's move to the right under new premier Ernest Manning, and joined the socialist CCF. Finkel considers this surprising, in light of her long-time devotion to the ideals of social credit, the role the CCF played in her 1940 election defeat, and his assessment that she \\"seemed more interested in monetary reform than in the general social critique put forward by the CCF.\\" She served as a member of the CCF's Edmonton membership and organization committee.Finkel 79 Rogers was elected to the board of Edmonton Public Schools in the 1959 Edmonton election as a candidate of the left-leaning Civic Reform Association (CRA). She was re-elected in 1961, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1968, and 1971. When the CRA dissolved in advance of the 1961 election, she joined the newly formed Quality Education Council; when that too dissolved, she ran as an independent in the 1971 election. She did not seek re-election in the 1974 election. The next year, Edith Rogers Junior High School in Edmonton was named in her honour. William Rogers died November 7, 1968. Edith Rogers died July 17, 1985.

Point Peninsula ceramics were first introduced into Canada around 600 BCE then spread south into parts of New England around 200 BCE. Some time between 300 BCE and 1 CE, Point Peninsula pottery first appeared in Maine, and \\"over the entire Maritime Peninsula.\\" Little evidence exists to show that it was derived from the earlier, thicker pottery, known as Vinette I, Adena Thick, etc... Point Peninsula pottery represented a new kind of technology in North America and has also been called Vinette II. Compared to existing ceramics that were thicker and less decorated, this new pottery has been characterized by \\"superior modeling of the clay with vessels being thinner, better fired and containing finer grit temper.\\" Where this new pottery technology originated is not known for sure. The origin of this pottery is \\"somewhat of a problem.\\" The people are thought to have been influenced by the Hopewell traditions of the Ohio River valley. This influence seems to have ended about 250 CE, after which they no longer practiced burial ceremonialism. Hopewell interaction sphere The Hopewell exchange system began in the Ohio and Illinois River valleys about 300 BCE. The culture is referred to more as a system of interaction among a variety of societies than as a single society or culture. Hopewell trading networks were quite extensive, with obsidian from the Yellowstone area, copper from Lake Superior, and shells from the Gulf Coast. In some areas Point Peninsula people buried some of their dead in mortuary mounds. Interred with the dead were exotic grave goods, including copper and silver pan pipes, marine shell gorgets, and exotic cherts. The exotic goods among the burials may provide evidence for inherited status differentiation among Point Peninsula groups. Pan pipes, which have been found in burial mounds from Florida to Minnesota, considered to be a diagnostic trait within the Hopewell inventory, appear suddenly in North America around 200 BCE, then disappear as do certain other Hopewell traits, around 400 CE. Found mostly in the United States, nine pan pipes curiously appear in the LeVesconte mound, a Point Peninsula site located in Campbellford, Ontario. Though the Hopewell interaction sphere generally is confined to the United States, much of the silver found in mound artifacts, such as pan pipes, actually comes from Cobalt, Ontario, far up the Ottawa River. Point Peninsula Complex The Point Peninsula people of the Middle Woodland period lived by hunting and gathering, supplemented by agriculture. Around 900 CE, Point Peninsula artifacts in New York were replaced by Owasco culture artifacts. However, a 2011 paper by archaeologist Dr. John P. Hart argues there was no definable Owasco culture. Archaeologists believe these indicated the presence of Clemson Island peoples' spreading northward and intermingling with the Point Peninsula complex through the years of 1300. The Owasco peoples practiced different pottery techniques and were more sedentary agriculturalists than the Point Peninsula people. They cultivated a variety of types of maize, squash, and eventually beans, and lived in larger villages of several hundred to a thousand people. Warfare was prevalent, as is shown by archeology. The people built fortified villages, but many still died violently. Gradually, smaller bands and tribes formed into larger groups.

Then on April 17, 1915 a group of 58 News Photographers of the various news organizations in New York gathered at the Castle Cave Restaurant at 271 7th Ave., near 26th St and formed a fraternal organization where news photographers could meet on social occasions and exchange ideas and get to know one another better, instead of always meeting on the run at fires and breaking news stories. In those days the city was served by eleven daily newspapers and was the headquarters of numerous wire services and syndicates. Newspaper Row was along Park Row just across from City Hall. There papers like New York World, The Journal, The Herald, The Telegram, New York Tribune, Evening World, The American and syndicates like Brown Brothers, Acme, Gideon Service, Bain and Central News all tried to out scoop each other. Although these organizations are now long gone, New York is still the media capital of the world and the New York Press Photographers Association is the oldest press organization in the world, still existing to serve working photographers as a professional and social organization. The Association members work for news organizations in the print and electronic media based within a seventy-five mile radius of Manhattan. The organization is made up of over 250 active members. The Association: Sponsors regular meetings for social and educational purposes. It maintains a liaison with Governmental agencies whose actions directly affect the Media. Maintains a committee to work out credentialing and working conditions with the various college and professional sports teams. Holds an annual contest with an exhibit and an awards dinner and dance. Holds an annual Holiday Party (which benefits under privileged children). Holds other social events such as boat rides, fishing trips, and picnics.

He appeared in 197 La Liga games during eight seasons, scoring 65 goals combined for Castell√≥n, Barcelona and Rayo Vallecano. Club career Born in Madrid, Clares played lower league football until the age of 23, representing Getafe Deportivo and CF Gand√≠a. In March 1971 he signed with CD Castell√≥n, scoring 13 goals in 36 games in his first full season to help the club return to La Liga after a 25-year absence. Clares made his debut in the Spanish top flight on 17 September 1972, in a 1‚Äì4 home loss against Athletic Bilbao. During the campaign, he contributed with 11 goals from 30 appearances to help the Valencians to a best-ever fifth position, as well as the final of the Copa del Rey; subsequently, he caught the eye of both FC Barcelona and Real Madrid, but as the former had practically secured his services, manager Lucien Muller opposed to the transfer citing his team's lack of attacking options. In late May 1974, after Castell√≥n's relegation, Clares finally joined Barcelona, as a direct replacement for Johan Cruyff as the foreign players were not allowed to participate in the Spanish Cup. During the knock-out competition, he finished as top scorer with five successful strikes in only six matches, but the final ended 4‚Äì0 in favour of Real Madrid. During his four-year spell at the Camp Nou, Clares was regarded as a highly inconsistent player, capable of scoring wonderful goals but also of missing clear chances. On 28 November 1976, he netted five of the Blaugrana goals in a 6‚Äì1 home demolition of Valencia CF, for a total of 22 during the season. In July 1978, after the arrival of president Josep Llu√≠s N√∫√±ez, and with him former coach Muller, Clares was transferlisted. He moved to Rayo Vallecano in October, going on to be relatively played during his two-year tenure and retiring at the age of 32, even though he later returned for a spell in the lower divisions. International career Clares won one cap for Spain: on 17 October 1973, he played 67 minutes in a 0‚Äì0 away friendly draw with Turkey.

Accident On the afternoon of Sunday, October 8, 1989, the members of the McGraw and Leger families were participating in a hayride, travelling in a wagon pulled by a farm tractor, as well as two following pickup trucks, along the shoulder of Route 945. They were approximately from the end of the ride at a community hall in Cormier-Village where they had planned a family reunion as part of their celebration of Thanksgiving Weekend. The driver of a tractor trailer (logging truck) hauling a 6-tonne load of hardwood logs cut into lengths lost control as he passed, resulting in the entire load of logs tipping onto the tractor/wagon and pickup trucks. 13 people were killed and 45 injured with many victims pinned and crushed; five children were among those who died. Emergency responders from the RCMP in Shediac, volunteer fire fighters from Cap-Pel√© and numerous ambulance paramedics from across Westmorland County responded to the graphic accident scene. Victims were transported to tertiary care hospitals in Moncton, approximately away.  Response  The horror of this accident, both for survivors and emergency responders, resulted in the Government of New Brunswick forming a provincial Critical Incident Stress Management Team.

The crossover had a speed limit of 15 mph but the train hit it at 60 mph. The locomotive, a of the Precedent class turned on its side and travelled some distance, striking the pier of an overbridge (partially demolishing it) and breaking in two. The six carriages following ploughed over the engine and were all destroyed - forming a heap of wreckage between the station platforms. Punctured gaslighting cylinders ignited, turning the scene into an inferno. The driver, fireman and 13 passengers were killed. Blame was attributed to the driver for not applying for a pilot at Chester. The confusing signalling at the junction was also criticised.

Aesthetically inspired by German Weimar-era cabarets and burlesque shows, the band also chose a name of German origin that literally translates to \\"cat's wail cabaret\\" with Katzenjammer also generally meaning \\"discordant sound\\" and being used as a synonym for a hangover. Other stylistic influences range from Dadaism, Futurism and Symbolism to Postmodernism. History The band was founded in 2004 by vocalist Mary Komplikated, guitarist Herr Katz, keyboardist Klischee and bass player Mr. Guillotine. In 2005 they released a self-titled EP which was freely distributed on their website. It was followed by their likewise self-titled debut album in 2006. Hence the band received critical acclaim and performed on several festivals, including the Wave-Gotik- Treffen 2006 in Leipzig, the Amphi Festival 2007 in Cologne and the Summer Darkness festival 2009 in Utrecht. They also performed as a supporting act for the American dark cabaret band The Dresden Dolls, to whom they are often compared. In January 2009, they released their second studio album, Grand Guignol & Vari√©t√©s on America's Projekt Records. The band split up in 2009. Klischee and Mr Guillotine formed in 2011 a new band called Katzkab. Style The band's musical style is a mixture of different genres including post-punk, deathrock, electropunk, gothic rock, new wave music, electronic music, classical music and German \\"Lieder\\" (Romantic-era art songs). Referring to themselves as \\"death rock cabaret\\", \\"multireferential post-punk\\" and \\"baroque krautpop\\", the band also cites early New and Dark Wave bands like Bauhaus, Christian Death and Siouxsie and the Banshees as influences.

The film was also nominated for a Young Artist Award in 2003, in the category of \\"Best Family Feature Film - Animation\\". Plot War and famine have destroyed the glory of an old kingdom. The story of how a princess was discovered by a pea was lost in the process. Sebastian, a raven, tries to restore the story using an old tapestry found by a young Prince Rollo, but it is partially torn. It is written that if the legend of the pea is lost, the kingdom will fall at the reign of the 18th king who unfortunately happens to be Prince Laird, the primary candidate for the throne, who is selfish and greedy and believes that greed is what it takes to rule. With the help of Sebastian & Rollo, Laird‚Äôs noble and kind younger brother Prince Heath is crowned King in accordance to the law of being the \\"first\\" son to enter the throne room during the ceremony, much to the chagrin of Laird. Heath proves to be a far kinder and fairer ruler, sentencing Laird to become Ruler of the Pig Kingdom where he vows revenge. Nine months later, Heath's wife Mariana delivers a daughter, but she dies during childbirth. Laird's greedy and gluttonous wife Helsa also gives birth to a daughter simultaneously. Laird conceives an evil plan to regain the crown. He sends Helsa to take care of Heath's daughter, making the King believe Helsa lost her baby. During the night, Laird swaps his and Helsa‚Äôs daughter with Heath‚Äôs, intending to give her away so his daughter can rule. Helsa, who feels sympathetic towards her niece as she too lost her mother at a young age, remorsefully begs Laird to give the baby to a loving family. Years later, Heath's daughter, named Daria, has grown into a beautiful, kind and gentle young woman. Laird is revealed to have broken his promise to Helsa, for he has instead placed Daria in the care of lazy pig herders who are hired to watch after her. Daria is forced to work for her lazy stepfamily, who treat her cruelly and lay around all day while she does all of her chores. In the meantime, her cousin Hildegarde (Laird's daughter) has matured to be cruel, wicked, selfish and vain, as intended by Laird and Helsa. She fills in Daria‚Äôs place as the princess, although she treats everyone around her cruelly and acts selfishly, which does not help the Kingdom or Heath, who (believing her to be his daughter) struggles to raise her properly. She also has no idea that she is really Laird‚Äôs daughter and therefore not the rightful heir to the throne. Prince Rollo, now a young man, returns to Heath's castle, dreaming of romance and happiness. However, he misinterprets the concept as he believes that the perfect woman for him must be kind and gentle, but, most importantly, must also be born into nobility. Hildegarde, upon seeing him and hearing about his wealth, decides to marry him. Rollo, repulsed by her greediness and selfishness, refuses and flees. Hildegarde sets foot to pursue him, but loses his trail. During her pursuit, Helsa encounters Laird. He ‚Äî who is impressed with how his daughter turned out to be & her immediate claim for Rollo ‚Äî informs Helsa that the time has come to tell Hildegarde of her true lineage (although she responds to this in anger and disgust). Meanwhile, Rollo, on his quest to find a bride, meets Daria, and her trusted pig companions; Princess, Hungry, and Fearless. She brings him to her ‚Äúsecret place‚Äù, where Rollo is charmed by her beauty and kindness. The two fall in love, but are forced to separate. Despite having feelings for Daria, Rollo rejects the idea of marrying her since she isn‚Äôt a princess. Rollo continues in his search for a real princess to marry, desiring a woman of proper lineage, beauty, grace, and class. Unfortunately, while he does encounter beautiful princesses, they all sadly disappoint him due to their spoiled personalities and pampered lifestyles. Rollo realizes he shouldn't love someone because of their titles, but because of who they are. Upon this realization, he realizes that Daria is the right person for him and rushes to confess his rekindled feelings for her. Meanwhile, Sebastian has been searching for a lost prophecy that dictates: ‚Äúto discover true nobility, one must place a pea beneath twenty mattresses‚Äù. Unfortunately, his search to discover the mystery of peas always ends in vain. Meanwhile, King Heath admits that he is greatly disappointed with Hildegarde‚Äôs upbringing. Nonetheless, he finds solace in knowing that Rollo has found the girl of his dreams, as her personality bears a striking resemblance to his late wife. He then decides to disinherit Hildegarde and leaves his kingdom to Rollo and his chosen bride-to-be. He asks Sebastian to deliver the important message to Rollo. Learning about Heath's plan, Helsa has her and Laird‚Äôs pet falcon, Plague, intercept the message and bring it to Laird's attention. Laird turns the entire Pig Kingdom against Daria, claiming she is a witch who can talk to animals. A mob pursues her through the forest and burn down her hiding place, where she and Rollo first met. Rollo returns to the kingdom in an attempt to save Daria, not knowing she had already escaped with the help of her animal companions. Sebastian finally discovers the full prophecy in the ballroom of Daria's hiding place, which turns out to be the original palace from where the prophecy originated from. Above the prophecy is a stained glass window that bears the image of an unnamed queen, Daria's ancestor, who brought about the Golden Age of the Kingdom before it was overtaken by its Dark Age. The prophecy reads: \\"To Reveal the Heart of True Nobility Place the Pea Twenty Mattresses Deep The Princess True is Love and Sensitivity Upon Such, She Can Never Sleep\\" Delighted at solving the obstinate mystery, Sebastian celebrates, not aware that the building has caught on fire. Rollo rescues him and the pair exit the smoldering structure. Weak from smoke inhalation, he cries out for Daria before passing out in front of the mob. Laird lies to the crowd, telling them that he cried for Hildegarde and wants to marry her. Rollo is taken to the castle and treated for his injuries. Upon hearing the speculation of his wish to marry Hildegarde, Heath plans the wedding. Hildegarde's orders dictate that the wedding is to take place the moment Rollo heals. While mourning Daria, whom he believes to be dead, he decides to go through with the wedding, disheartened and believing that he has nothing left to lose. Daria, determined to find Rollo and fed up with the abuse she was put through, finally leaves her stepfamily. She tries to find Rollo and is rudely pushed aside by the people. She helps Sasha, a servant who fell and hurt herself and lets her into the castle. Sebastian appears after awakening from a head injury and is informed of the impending wedding. Seeing Sebastian's twenty feather beds, Daria decides to lie down for a moment. Desperate for a solution to their predicament, Sebastian allows her to test the pea within the mattresses. It seems all hope is lost when she appears to be able to sleep peacefully, but soon Daria finds that she is unable to sleep, as there is something hard underneath them. Seeing this, Sebastian deduces that Daria is the Princess true for she felt the pea through twenty mattresses. He then sees Daria's birthmark, a heart on her foot, which he remembers the Princess having when he saw her many years ago as a baby, finally realizing that Daria is Heath‚Äôs real daughter and the true heir to the throne. He plans to tell everyone of the birthmark, but is intercepted when Laird and Helsa capture and imprison him. He escapes with the help of Fearless and interrupts the wedding, revealing the truth. Hildegarde is forced to show her foot at the behest of everyone as evidence, which shows a birthmark similar to Daria‚Äôs, but before the wedding can continue, Rollo's dog; Winthrop licks her foot, revealing the birthmark to be paint. Before telling everyone of the real claimant to the title, Laird shows up, holding Daria hostage. He tries to eliminate Rollo by throwing a chandelier on top of him, but he is rescued by Heath, who is seemingly killed. Miraculously, he regains consciousness and demands the release of his daughter, angering Laird. Laird, along with Helsa and Hildegarde, flee with Daria accompanying them. He sets up a trap to get rid of Rollo, whom he knows to be following him. Thanks to Fearless setting off traps, Rollo confronts Laird and survives another attempt to kill him. Atop the castle‚Äôs tower, Rollo finds Hildegarde holding Daria hostage, threatening to toss her over the side. Laird knocks Rollo off the edge, causing him to dangle for life and orders Plague to end him. Thankfully, Rollo is saved by Sebastian and Daria. Together, they defeat Laird by throwing him into the moat below, just before he is about to attack Rollo yet again. When Hildegarde attempts to kill Daria and nearly falls to her death, Rollo saves Daria. Fearless scares Hildegarde, who also falls in the moat. Laird, Helsa, and Hildegarde are then arrested for their transgressions. Fearless (who was initially cowardly in the beginning of the film) finally lives up to his name by helping the crew defeat Hildegarde. Rollo and Daria are reunited. He introduces her to Heath, not having seen her since her infancy. Heath is delighted to see that Daria grew up to be just like Mariana, and not at all like Hildegarde, and celebrates having been reunited with his daughter at last. The couple marry in the ancient kingdom and live happily ever after.

It was a State located on the central Italian Peninsula (present-day Italy), reporting to the needs of Napoleonic France. Formation The state was the result of the annexation of the Principality of Lucca (est. 22 June 1805), the former Republic of Lucca and occupied by France since late 1799, and the ancient Principality of Piombino, with Elisa the Princess of Piombino since that March. The combined principalities then were ruled as a single monarchy. Elisa was the ruling Princess of Piombino and Lucca. Her husband Felice Pasquale Baciocchi became the titular Prince of Piombino. Rule The Constitution of the principality was written by Napoleon on 22 June (1805), establishing a Council of State to assist the Princess and a legislative Senate. The Principality adopted the French franc as its currency, though few special local coins were minted. On 3 March 1809, as part of the Treaty of Fontainebleau, her brother Napoleon created the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, with Elisa ruling as Grand Duchess of all Tuscany from Florence. The region had been annexed to the French Empire two years before, from the former Kingdom of Etruria (1801-1807). Henceforth the Principality of Lucca and Piombino became part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and consequently a territory of the First French Empire. It did have special status, and a prefect was appointed (Antoine-Marie-Pierre de Hautmesnil). However, the territory was never named a Department of France. End In 1814, the Imperial Austrian Army occupied Lucca, ending French control with the fall of Napoleon. Under the Congress of Vienna Piombino was given to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and Elba to the exiled Napoleon. Lucca was restored to separate state status as the Duchy of Lucca (1815‚Äì1847). The Congress of Vienna (1814‚Äì1815) gave the Duchy to exiled Spanish Borb√≥n Maria Louisa (1782-1824), who became the Duchess of Lucca and disregarded the constitution imposed on her by the Congress and governed in an absolutist fashion.

The term \\"morphological\\" here is in the anatomical context. Both the morphology and ecology exhibited by an organism are directly or indirectly influenced by their environment, and ecomorphology aims to identify the differences Current research places emphasis on linking morphology and ecological niche by measuring the performance of traits (i.e. sprint speed, bite force, etc.) associated behaviours, and fitness outcomes of the relationships. Current ecomorphological research focuses on a functional approach and application to the science. A broadening of this field welcomes further research in the debate regarding differences between both the ecological and morphological makeup of an organism. Development of ecomorphology The roots of ecomorphology date back to the late 19th century.Bock, W. J. 1994. Concepts and methods in ecomorphology. Journal of Biosciences 19:403‚Äì413. Then, description and comparison of morphological form, primarily for use in avian classification, was focal point of morphological research. However, during the 1930s and 40s morphology as a field shrank. This was likely due to the emergence of new areas of biological inquiry enabled by new techniques. The 1950s brought about not only a change in the approach of morphological studies, resulting in the development of evolutionary morphology in the form of theoretical questions, and a resurgence of interest in the field.Beer, G. 1954. Archaeopteryx and evolution. The Advancement of Science 11: 160‚Äì170. High-speed cinematography and x-ray cinematography began to allow for observations of movements of parts while electromyography allowed for observation of the integration of muscle activities. Together, these methodologies allowed morphologists to better delve into the intricacies of their study. It was then, in the 1950s and 60s, that ecologists began to use morphological measures to study evolutionary and ecological questions. This culminated in Karr and James coining the term \\"ecomorphology\\" in 1975.Karr, J.R. and James, F.C. 1975. Eco-morphological configurations and convergent evolution of species and communities; in Ecology and Evolution of Communities (eds). M.L. Cody and J.M. Diamond. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. 258‚Äì291 The following year the links between vertebrate morphology and ecology were finally established creating the foundations of modern ecomorphology.Bock, W. 1977. Toward an ecological morphology. Vogelwarte 29: 127‚Äì135Leisler, B. 1977. Morphological Aspects of Ecological Specializations in Bird Genera. American Zoologist 19(3): 1014‚Äì1014. Ecomorphology Ecomorphology and functional morphology alt= Ecomorphological relationships have been demonstrated between jaw structure and the feeding biology of sunfish. Functional morphology differs from ecomorphology in that it deals with the features arising from form at varying levels of organisation.Bock, W. Van Walhert, J. 1965. The role of adaptive mechanisms in the origin of higher levels of organisation. Systematic Biology 14(4): 272‚Äì287. Ecomorphology, on the other hand, refers to those features which can be shown to derive from the ecology surrounding the species. In other words, functional morphology focuses heavily on the relationship between form and function whereas ecomorphology is interested in the form and the influences from which it arises. Functional morphology studies often investigate relationships between the form of Skeletal muscle and physical properties such as force generation and joint mobility.Bock, W., G. Lanzavecchia, and R. Valvassori. 1991. Levels of complexity and organismal organization. Selected Symposia and Monographs UZI. Vol 5 181‚Äì212. This means that functional morphology experiments may be done under laboratory conditions whereas ecomorphological experiments may not. Moreover, studies of functional morphology themselves provide insufficient data upon which to make conclusions regarding environmental adaptations of a species. The data provided from these studies can, however, support and enrich the understanding of a species' ecomorphological adaptations. For instance, the relationship between the organization of the jaw lever-arm system, mouth size, and jaw muscle force generation and the feeding behaviour of sunfish has been investigated. Work of this variety lends scientific support to seemingly intuitive concepts. For instance, increases in mouth size correspond to an increase in prey size. However, less obvious trends also exist. The prey-size of fish does not seem to correlate so much to body size as to the characteristics of the feeding apparatus. Behavioural studies The work above is just one example of an ecomorphology based behavioural study. Studies of this variety are becoming increasingly important in the field. Behavioural studies interrelate functional and eco-morphology. Features such as locomotory ability in foraging birds have been shown to affect dietary preferences by studies of this type.Moermond, T., and J. Denslow. 1983. Fruit choice in neotropical birds: effects of fruit type and accessibility on selectivity. The Journal of Animal Ecology 52(2): 407‚Äì420. Behavioural studies are particularly common in fisheries and in studying birds.Sibbing, F., L. Nagelkerke, and J. Osse. 1994. Ecomorphology as a tool in fisheries-Identification and ecotyping of Lake Tana Barbs (Barbus-Intermedius COmplex), Ethiopia. Netherlands Journal of Agricultural Science 42:77‚Äì85. Royal Netherlands Soc Agr Sci. Other studies attempt to relate ecomorphological findings with the dietary habits of species. Griffen and Mosblack (2011) investigated differences in diet and consumption rate as a function of gut ecomorphology.Griffen, B. D., and H. Mosblack. 2011. Predicting diet and consumption rate differences between and within species using gut ecomorphology. The Journal of animal ecology 80:854‚Äì63. Indeed, gut volume was found to correlate positively to increasing metabolic rate. Ecomorphological studies can often be used to determine to presence of parasites in a given temporospatial context as parasite presence can alter host habitat use.Goodman, B. A., and P. T. J. Johnson. 2011. Ecomorphology and disease: cryptic effects of parasitism on host habitat use, thermoregulation, and predator avoidance. Ecology 92:542‚Äì548. Other current work within ecomorphology focuses on broadening the knowledge base to allow for ecomorphological studies to incorporate a wider range of habitats, taxa, and systems. Much current work also focuses on the integration of ecomorphology with other comparative fields such as phylogenetics and ontogenetics to better understand evolutionary morphology.Norton, S. F., J. J. Luczkovich, and P. J. Motta. 1995. The role of ecomorphological studies in the comparative biology of fishes. Environmental Biology of Fishes 44:287‚Äì304. Applications of ecomorphology Simplified representation of an ecological niche where A and B show the fundamental niches of species 1 and species 2 respectively. Z the realised niche of species 2 and X the niche overlap, where competition occurs among species. An understanding of ecomorphology is necessary when investigating both the origins of and reasons for biodiversity within a species. Ecomorphology is fundamental for understanding changes in the morphology of a species in which subsets occupy different ecological niches, demonstrate different reproductive techniques, and have various sensory modalities. Studies conducted on species with high biodiversity frequently investigate the extent to which species morphology is influenced by their ecology. Bony fishes are often used to study ecomorphology due to their long evolutionary history, high biodiversity, and multi-stage life cycle. Studies on the morphological diversity of African cichlids conducted by Fryer and Iles were some of the first to demonstrate ecomorphology, . This is largely due to cichlids having great biodiversity, wide distribution, the ability to occupy various ecological niches, and obvious morphological differences.Fryer, G. T. and Iles, T. D. The cichlid fishes of the great lakes of Africa: their biology and evolution. 1972. Oliver and Boyd, Cornell University. Ecomorphology is also often used to study the paleohabitat of a species and/or its evolutionary morphology. Paleohabitat determination from ecomorphology The history of how a species has undergone morphological adaptations to better suit its ecological role can be used to draw conclusions about its paleohabitat. The morphologies of paleo-species found at a location help to make inferences about the previous appearance and properties of that habitat. Research using this approach has been widely conducted using bovid fossils due to their large skeletons and extensive species radiation.Scott, R. S., and W. A. Barr. 2014. Ecomorphology and phylogenetic risk: Implications for habitat reconstruction using fossil bovids. Journal of human evolution 73:47‚Äì57 Plummer and Bishop conducted a study using extant African bovids to investigate the animal‚Äôs paleoenvironment based on their habitat preference.Plummer, T. W., Bishop, L. C., Hertel, F. 2008. Habitat preference of extant African bovids based on astragalus morphology: operationalizing ecomorphology for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Journal of Archaeological Science 35(11): 3016‚Äì3027 The strong correlation found between bovid phylogeny and habitat preference suggests that linking morphology and habitat is taxon dependent. Evidence also suggests that further study of the ecomorphology of previously existing habitats may be useful in determining the phylogenetic risk associated with species living in a specific habitat. Evolutionary morphology The study of evolutionary morphology concerns changes in species morphology over time in order to become better suited to their environment. These studies are conducted by comparing the features of species groups to provide a historical narrative of the changes in morphology observed with changes in habitat. A background history of a species features and homology must first be known before a history of evolutionary morphology can be observed. This area of biology serves only to provide a nominal explanation of evolutionary biology, as a more in depth explanation of species history is required to provide a thorough explanation of evolution within a species. Ecomorphology versus habitat preference Suggestions have been made that the correlations between species biodiversity and particular environments may not necessarily be due to ecomorphology, but rather a conscious decision made by species to relocate to an ecosystem to which their morphologies are better suited. However, there are currently no studies that provide concrete evidence to support this theory. Studies have been conducted to predict fish habitat preference based on body morphology, but no definitive distinction could be made between correlation and causation of fish habitat preference.Chan, M. D. 2001. Fish ecomorphology: predicting habitat preferences of stream fishes from their body shape. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. References Betz, O.

There are two types of light chains: kappa and lambda, each composed of a constant domain (CL) and a variable domain (VL). There are five types of heavy chains: alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma and mu, all consisting of a variable domain (VH) and three (in alpha, delta and gamma) or four (in epsilon and mu) constant domains (CH1 to CH4). Ig molecules are highly modular proteins, in which the variable and constant domains have clear, conserved sequence patterns.

Spending money on entertainment was out of the question for most people. The United States put the nation back to work, including artists and entertainers in its assistance programs. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_board_game_Monopolyhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry!_(game) Movies Many films still highly cherished today were created during the 1920s. During that period, Walt Disney, the pioneer animator, produced films Americans loved to see. One of his best-known animations was the tale of the Three Little Pigs, originally produced in 1933. This is another of his that became a part of American culture. Half a century later, his productions are still famous and frequently viewed by children and adults. Many flicks were created during this time, including, 42nd Street, The Wizard of Oz, Gone With the Wind and King Kong. Comedies were popular films in the 1930s. A good laugh eased the mind and brought joy in a time of adversity. Towards the late 1930s, films that showed how America was fighting against the Great Depression became popular as well. Radio Listening to radio broadcasting became a source of nearly free entertainment for one single American. The radio stations had a little bit of everything for all ages, young and old. One of the most common radio shows for young children was Little Orphan Annie. The show is about an adventurous young girl who had an equally adventurous dog named Sandy. Together, Annie and Sandy would try to solve mysteries. The show was so loved by children that they soon began to purchase small items of merchandise such as pins of Annie. Later, an actual film was released to the public. Adults listened to newscasts, radio theater, the Grand Ole Opry, soap operas, and sermons as well. Board Games The board game Monopoly, published by the Parker brother in 1935, was a popular favorite. It cost 1 U.S dollar during the time. With calculation of inflation, that would be 15.45 dollars in 2020. Another popular game was Sorry! which was adopted by the Parker brothers in 1934.

The Danmark was part of the Thingvalla Line and was a 3414-ton steamship. On this its last voyage, it carried 59 crew members and 665 passengers from Denmark, Sweden, and Norway who were on board for emigration to America. On March 20, 1889, the Danmark began its journey from Copenhagen to New York to deliver its passengers, most of whom were women who intended to go to the West to marry or seek work as domestics. There were also a large number of families with children. The bulk of the passengers were in the steerage, with only 26 passengers in cabins. The Danmark had fought high winds and high seas from March 24, 1889. On April 4, 1889, the winds had become more violent, and the swells which the Danmark rode were mountainous. Most of the passengers became ill. By April 5, 1889, the Danmark was in terrible trouble and sinking, having survived high winds but with a severely damaged hull from a hole caused by her propeller shaft when it snapped. The ship was unable to make any headway because its engines were kept running so that the pumps could keep pumping the water to keep the ship from sinking. The Captain C.B. Knudsen had considered abandoning the ship but was concerned that the lifeboats would be overturned in the high seas. And Every Soul Was Saved, painting by Thomas M. M. Hemy, 1889 On April 5, 1889, the SS Missouri came upon the disabled Danmark in bad weather and high seas. Fortunately, for the crew and the passengers of the Danmark, the Missouri happened upon the Danmark because it had taken on such a large cargo in London that she was ordered to proceed straight from London and Philadelphia and skip Swansea. The Missouri was one of four freighters built for the Atlantic Transport Line to carry cargo, cattle, and goods between London, Swansea, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. The Missouri was 2,845 tons and manned by a crew of 37. Because it was a freighter and had insufficient quarters for people and supplies, it could only accommodate an additional 20 people. Because its cargo hold was built to haul cattle, it had a large fresh water condenser capable of condensing 8,000 gallons of water per day. Upon seeing the distress flags of the Danmark, its Captain, Hamilton Murrell, immediately ordered his crew to set a course for the Danmark, and he steered as close as possible to the disabled steamship. Because of the bad weather and his inability to accommodate the passengers, Captain Murrell decided not to risk the open sea transfer and instead offered to tow the Danmark to St. John. It took several hours to attach the tow lines because of the strong winds and heavy seas, but eventually the process was completed. The Missouri was able to the tow the Danmark but, because of the gale, it was hard going. When the storm increased in intensity, the Danmark was carried away and the wire bridle of the tow line was ripped away. However, the tow line held, and the Danmark did not go adrift. Because the Missouri was making no progress, and Captain Murrell had seen ice ahead, he decided to change course for the Azores. Three hours later, Captain Knudsen signaled that the Danmark was continuing to sink and would not make the trip to the Azores. Captain Murrell ordered the tow line to be cut and ordered that the cargo be thrown overboard. The Danmark was told that the Missouri using its two life boats would begin the transfer of passengers and crew because the sea conditions would only allow the best of sailors to keep the lifeboats from crashing into the two ships. The second and third officers of the Missouri were ordered to begin the transfer, beginning with women and children first, in groups of 22-24. Because the first life boat contained babies and small children, Captain Murrell lowered coal baskets with ropes to pull the babies aboard. The larger children and other passengers were lifted onto the Missouri using ropes. As the weather slightly improved, Captain Murrell ordered the Danmark to use its seven lifeboats to bring over more passengers and whatever food supplies the Danmark had on board. After almost five hours, all of the passengers had been taken aboard the Missouri. They were given hot tea and biscuits. Captain Murrell ordered the crew to abandon the Danmark because fog had begun to roll in, and he was afraid that they would lose sight of the Danmark. Captain Knudsen was the last to leave the Danmark because he was reluctant to abandon his ship. Three valuable dogs were killed because there was no room on the Missouri for them. By nightfall, the Danmark sank, leaving no trace of where it had been. Other sources disagree with this last sentence. Danish newspapers could on April 13 report: \\"London, 12. April. A depeche from Queenstown (Ireland) states that the steamer \\"City of Chester\\", that has arrived from New York, on 8 April on pos. 4555N/3716W passed the steamer \\"Danmark\\" a drift with no one on board. On the afternoon the same day Reuter's Bureau reported that \\"Danmark\\" was seen without any of its life boats and with the anchor chains hanging down. The crew of the Missouri had worked for twelve hours without food or rest, and they freely gave up all their quarters to the passengers. Passengers were made beds in the wheelhouse and the engine room. Five women and a baby were given Captain Murrell‚Äôs cabin. Captain Murrell and his crew slept on the deck when they could. Because the provisions from the Missouri and from the Danmark only gave them enough food for three days, Captain Murrell knew that he had to make land as soon as possible. The Missouris engines were strained with the load, and, right before, St. Michaels was sighted, the Missouri had run out of food. On April 10, 1889, the Missouri reached the Azores. Initially, only Captain Murrell was allowed to leave the ship. After consultation with the Danish consul and the British Governor, it was agreed that 370 single men could be put ashore at St. Michaels until they could be transported to the United States. Captain Murrell was asked to take the remaining passengers to Philadelphia. Because the crew of the Missouri would have to undergo hardship conditions, Captain Murrell promised each crew member an extra month‚Äôs pay. Captain Murrell purchased more provisions which were taken on board, and the Missouri sailed for Philadelphia, arriving on May 2, 1889. Upon arrival, Captain Murrell and his crew were honored for their sacrifices and bravery. Captain Murrell‚Äôs employer ratified his promises to his crew for the extra wages and held him harmless for the loss and destruction of the Missouris cargo.

They are commemorated by the Eastern Orthodox Church on March 6.  Events  In 838, the Abbasid Caliph al-Mu'tasim led a major campaign against the Byzantine Empire that ended in the sack of the city of Amorium, the capital of the Anatolic Theme and birthplace of the reigning Byzantine Amorian dynasty. Following the sack, 42 officers and notables of Amorium were taken as hostages to Samarra, then the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate. Repeated efforts by Emperor Theophilos and, after his death in 842, by Michael III and Empress-regent Theodora, to ransom them were rebuffed by the caliphs. After refusing to convert to Islam, they were executed at Samarra on 6 March 845. Only a few of the 42 are known by name: * , a court eunuch and possibly strategos of the Bucellarian Theme, regarded as the leader of the 42 in the hagiographic texts. * the patrikios Aetios, the strategos of the Anatolic Theme. * the patrikios Theophilos, otherwise unknown. * the magistros Constantine Baboutzikos, husband of Empress Theodora's sister and thereby apparently the highest-ranking of the prisoners. He was the first to be proposed to convert to Islam, and possibly also the first to be executed after refusing. * Bassoes, identified as a \\"runner\\", otherwise unknown. * Kallistos, possibly a member of the Melissenos family. An obscure patrikios and tourmarches according to the chroniclers, he is given an extensive biography by the hagiographies, where he is portrayed as rising from imperial spatharios to komes of the Scholai and finally doux of Koloneia, before being taken prisoner by Paulician soldiers under his command and delivered to the Abbasids, who placed him among the captives of Amorium. * Constantine, secretary (' or ') of Constantine Baboutzikos.  Hagiography and veneration  The hagiography of the 42 was written soon after their execution, by the monk, Euodios, who used their fate and the sack of Amorium as an indictment of and proof of divine retribution against the re-adoption of Iconoclasm by Emperor Theophilos. Euodios' narrative mostly contains theological discussions between the steadfast prisoners and various people‚ÄîByzantine defectors, Muslim officials, etc.‚Äîsent to convince them to convert during their seven-year imprisonment. Their execution was then carried out by Ethiopian slaves on the banks of the Euphrates. Euodios' hagiography is the \\"last example of the genre of collective martyrdom\\", and was widely disseminated, with several variants of the legend of the 42 Martyrs appearing in later authors. The feast day of the 42 Martyrs is on 6 March, the day of their execution. Pictorial representations of the 42 are rare in Byzantine art, unlike their analogues, the 40 Martyrs of Sebaste; when they are depicted, they are represented simply as a group of officials in court dress.

A special system exists for PO Box deliveries, which do not follow the district system. These special postal codes refer to a specific post office rather than an area. The \\"1000\\" postal code designates the Countrywide Logistics Centre, which is currently located outside the 1000 region, in Buda√∂rs, which is in the 2000 region. The rest of the country is structured as follows: * County capitals are always designated a postcode ending with \\"00\\". However, some cities have postal codes ending on \\"00\\" without being a county capital. * Cities generally have postcodes ending with \\"0\\". * Smaller towns and villages have any other number.

Juan Carlos Mesa (May 15, 1930 ‚Äì August 2, 2016) was an Argentine humorist, screenwriter, and director. Life and work Juan Carlos Mesa was born in C√≥rdoba, Argentina, in 1930. Following a stint as a writer in Uruguay for a sitcom, Telecataplum, He began his career in Argentine television in 1967 as a junior writer for comedian Carlos Bal√° and first collaborated on a film script in 1971, with Enrique Carreras' family comedy, El veraneo de los Campanelli. He was reunited with Carreras for the film's 1972 sequel, wrote later that year for Fernando Siro in his picaresque comedy, Autocine mon amour, and in 1976, earned his first credit as lead writer in Palito Ortega's Dos locos en el aire.IMDb: Juan Carlos Mesa Writing for leading local television comic Tato Bores in 1980, Mesa first became widely known as a performer on the radio, rather than on the screen, with his popular Radio Mitre show, Tenis de mesa; the name of the show (\\"table tennis\\") was a play on his own last name, a witticism that became part of his act on many of his subsequent productions.La Naci√≥n: Mesa animada Perhaps the most successful of these was Mesa de noticias (\\"News Desk\\"). The primetime sitcom, which premiered in 1983, set Mesa in a struggling network news program as its hapless programming director, and ran until 1987, appealing to audiences of an unusually varied demographic.Gustavo Masutti Llach. Hombres (y mujeres) de la radio: Juan Carlos Mesa His leading co-star, Italian actor Gianni Lunadei, joined Mesa in 1991 for a less successful spin-off, El gordo y el flaco (akin to Laurel and Hardy). Mesa continued to write for cinema, as well, working with the best-known local comedy duo of the 1980s, Alberto Olmedo and Jorge Porcel (whose wiry and portly physiques, respectively, mirrored those of Lunadei and Mesa, somewhat). His script for the boot camp comedy Los colimbas se divierten (1986) was followed by the Olmedo-Porcel duo's last, the 1988 gender-bender Atracci√≥n peculiar. Following Alberto Olmedo's death in 1988, and Porcel's departure for Miami Beach, Mesa's career declined somewhat. Appearing mainly on radio, he worked with his brother Edgardo and son, Juan Mart√≠n, in El Surtidor (\\"The Dispenser\\"), a variety show complete with astrology forecasts. He reemerged on television, however, as the chief writer and in a supporting role in a 2003 sitcom, Dr. Amor (played by Arturo Puig, who had become well-known among younger audiences in the United States in the PBS educational series, Destinos). He returned Radio Mire in 2006 with a segment, R√≠o con Mesa, on Lalo Mir's top-rated Animados, and portrayed Noah in a voice-over role for an award-winning 2007 animated film, El arca (\\"The Ark\\").

Actinoceratoidea, Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, part K.(Nautiloidea) The Armenoceratidae, established by Troedsson (1926) are characterized by large, straight, or slightly curved shells and large siphuncles with strongly expanded segments between the septa. Septal necks are short and abruptly recurved along brims. Radial canals in the endosiphuncular canal system are typically arched, curving forward and backward from near the septal foramina (openings) to connect with the parispatium on either side of the middle of each segments. The parispatium is the narrow opening between the inner side of the connecting rings in actinocerids and the internal siphuncular deposits that grow forward and back from the region of the septal openings.

Selkirkoceras is a large armenocerid from the Upper Ordovician with a blunt, flattened, somewhat breviconic shell. Among the Silurian genera, Elrodoceras has a large shell with the apical part slightly curved, otherwise is straight, and a siphuncle that is narrower than in Armenoceras. Monocyrtoceras has a siphuncle like that of Elrodoceras, but the entire shell is gently and evenly curved. Megadiscosorus is similar to Armenoceras, but more breviconic and slightly exogastrically cyrtoconic and with the siphuncle in contact with the ventral wall.

It is set in Pittsburgh and was created by Ricky Blitt, who is also the show's head writer. The show stars Alyssa Milano. ABC officially canceled the series on May 16, 2010. Six episodes were produced, but only four aired. Premise Milano plays Rebecca Thomas, a recently divorced single mom attorney in Pittsburgh who hasn't dated \\"since Bill Clinton was president\\". The show will follow her transition from family life to primary bread winner. Milano had stated that the show would most likely be on beyond the 9 p.m. time slot, probably following Dancing with the Stars, saying: \\"I don't know if it's an 8 o'clock show . . . There are a lot of jokes about sex.\\" Cast and characters Main cast *Alyssa Milano ‚Äì Rebecca Thomas *Kyle Bornheimer ‚Äì Perry Gill *Josh Lawson ‚Äì Shawn Goldwater *Kelly Stables ‚Äì Lisa Thomas *Israel Broussard ‚Äì Justin Thomas *Sierra McCormick ‚Äì Scout Thomas Episodes Development and production In January 2009, ABC announced a put pilot commitment with Ricky Blitt for a new comedy. Initially titled Threesome, the pilot revolved around a single 30-something man who is caught between his lazy best friend roommate and his single-mother girlfriend. Eric Christian Olsen was the first actor cast, in the leading role of Shawn. In early March 2009, it was reported that Alyssa Milano would also star in the comedy pilot as Shawn's girlfriend Rebecca. On why she accepted the role, Milano commented: The cast was filled in mid-March with the casting of Kyle Bornheimer as Shawn's roommate Perry, and Kelly Stables as Lisa, the best friend to Milano's character. At the end of March, ABC announced the show as Single With Baggage in its 2009 program development guide, and finally as Romantically Challenged in May. In addition, in August 2009 the role of Lisa was described as Rebecca's sister instead of her best friend. Also in August 2009, ABC announced Romantically Challenged was scheduled for a midseason 2010 run of 13 episodes. In November, this was decreased to a seven episode commitment. Meanwhile, producers chose to recast the role of Shawn, replacing Olsen with Josh Lawson. Filming started in January 2010 with James Burrows as director. Shooting took place at the old Seinfeld stage. Romantically Challenged was initially scheduled for an April 12, 2010 premiere, but ABC delayed the start to April 19 to allow for a two- hour Dancing with the Stars episode. Setting Milano has told the press that Pittsburgh was selected since the creator and executive producer Blitt wanted the show set in a \\"small-town city\\", and that he is also a \\"huge Pittsburgh Penguins fan\\". Director Burrows also endorsed Pittsburgh since his positive experience filming parts of the former sitcom Back to You in the city.  Reception   Critical reception  The show's early reviews were mixed. It scored an average of 44 on Metacritic based on 15 reviews. An Entertainment Weekly critic wrote of the opening episodes: \\"At times relatably funny: The rules of one-night stands can be fairly confusing. But other times, characters say things like 'Who is that mansicle?'\\" Others were praising the performance of Milano but gave a negative review of the show, like USA Today: \\"As terrible as Romantically is, it is in the end more puzzling than insulting. Why would any studio or network waste a star like Milano on a show that would seem to have virtually no chance of survival?\\"  Ratings  The pilot delivered 'average ratings', with a total of 10.7 million viewers. Although a reasonable amount at another timeslot, the show's future was already feared to be cut short due to its lead-in from Dancing with the Stars, which captured 20.8 million viewers. The four aired episode averaged on 9.57 million viewers per episode and ranked 35th in total viewers and 59th in Adults 18‚Äì49 rating and share.

It is approximately long and connects Tooele and Grantsville in Tooele County. It also provides access to the Tooele Army Depot. Route description From its western terminus at SR-138 (Main Street) just east of Grantsville, the route starts out as 800 East, going south and quickly turns to the southeast. It continues in this direction for several miles meeting, and then running along the northeast boundary of the Tooele Army Depot. About from its end, the route turns to the east along 1000 North in Tooele and continues east until its terminus at SR-36 (Main Street). History The route was designated on May 12, 1931, as the road from Tooele at SR-36 northwest to Grantsville at then SR-2 (now SR-138). Since that time, the route had undergone only a handful of minor legislative description changes until April 2009, when the eastern end was realigned. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided funds for a new construction project on 1000 North in Tooele, which would provide an alternate route from SR-112 to 600 West. As a result, this new construction from SR-112 to SR-36 (Main Street) was designated as part of SR-112, and the stretch of SR-112 from 1000 North southwesterly along Utah Avenue to Main Street was removed from the state highway system and returned to local jurisdiction.

Septal necks, components of the siphuncle that project from the back side of the septa, are cyrtochoanitic (outwardly curved) and may be recumbent. Connecting rings are thick, reflective of the ancestral form. Varieties The three varieties of Wutinoceras are based on the form of the siphuncle, and each contains a number of species. These have not been ascribed to subgenera. They include those with broad segments and strongly recumbent brims to the septal necks; those with large segments and rings free ventrally; and those with small segments in which the brims on the dorsal side are sometimes free. The genotype Wutinoceras foerste, which comes from northeast China (Manchuria), is of the second variety. Distribution Wutinoceras species of the broad-segment variety are found in Newfoundland, Oklahoma, and Tasmania; those of the large-segment variety are found in Utah, Nevada, Newfoundland, and Manchuria. Those of the small-segment variety have only been found in Nevada. unless new species describedMemoir 28, New American Wutinoceratidae ....

His last name is also spelled Pietersen. In the 1670s he travelled to Lund, Sweden where he was an employee of the newly founded University. By 1680, however, he had moved to Amsterdam where he remained for the rest of his career.Rudolf A Rasch, Grove He is notable for a collection of twelve sonatas for violin and basso continuo published in 1683 entitled Speelstukken. It is the only Dutch publication of its type in this period. There are similar collections of pieces for violin and bass by German composers such as Westhoff and Biber; however the sonatas are closest in style to Johann Jakob Walther's Scherzi da Violino solo con il basso continuo published in 1676. It is possible that Walther had connections to Amsterdam and may have taught Petersen. Petersen's other compositions include a large number of song settings with continuo in Dutch. They were published in Amsterdam in collaboration with the Dutch poets Abraham Alewijn and Cornelis Sweerts. Petersen is also closely associated with a number of composers such as Servaes de Koninck and Hendrik Anders. Along with Johannes Schenck, Carolus Hacquart and Carl Rosier they contributed to a revival of Dutch music and arts in the period before 1710.

A new system of post codes was introduced on August 1, 2015. Introduction of the Postal Codes, Korea Post The postal code of the Republic of Korea was first enacted on July 1, 1970, and was revised three times in 1988, 2000, and 2015. History It was first introduced on July 1, 1970. Were given for each post office zip code, and the region is given the three-digit and 2-digit, when have a postal code are assigned as 120-01 (Susaek-dong, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul), in the case of the old region, the 3-digit 100 (Seoul, Korea). Unlike the current ZIP code granted by the administrative district, in the postal code system was implemented in 1970, give a zip code, a post office by \\"taking into account the rail transport line. Therefore, the postal code and administrative area were often not consistent. The large post office used a three-digit postal code and the small post office used a five-digit postal code. For example, the Seoul Central Post Office was 100 and the Seoul Search Post was 120-01. 700 beondae military post, 800 beondae are Hwanghae, Pyongan the 900s, 000 beondae was Hamgyong. Were given a new six-digit postal code of eupmyeondong units on February 01, 1988 by administrative area, it was reflected in the administrative district reorganization and highway transportation network, such as the opening changes. 400 units, which were not previously available, are allocated to Gyeonggi and Incheon areas, and 700 units, which are dedicated to military mail, have been changed to Gyeongbuk, Daegu. On May 1, 2000, a postal code was assigned to each postal area of the delivery agent to make it easier to deliver mail to the postal code for each administrative area. The postal code assigned in 1988 is the basic goal. The postal code was subdivided to match the area in charge of each postman according to the completion of the national mailing system and the introduction of automated mail sorting equipment. According to the National Foundation District introduction, with street address laws enforced since January 2014 six-digit postal code was abolished in August 2015 from August 1, 2015, using the National Foundation District No. 5-digit postal code Doing. Notation Method *1970 ~ 1987: Yes (Susaek-dong, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul) 120-01 *1988 ~ July 2015: Yes (Susaek-dong, Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul) 122-090 *August 2015 ~: Yes (Gangnam- gu, Seoul) 06000~06371 6-digit postal code (1988~2015) Shipping number The three digits in the front part of the postal code are the number for sending, and are the numbers assigned based on the administrative area of the destination. It is used for mail classification in China. The first digit is assigned to each metropolitan administrative district (city, metropolitan, provincial, special autonomous, etc.), the second digit is assigned to the resident's living zone or concentrated country, and the third digit is assigned to each city, county, or district. In principle, when two or more basic municipalities are consolidating, and in the case of urban and rural complex without a ward, it is a principle to match the first three digits that were used differently before consolidation, but this is not the case if the postal codes can overlap. For example, in the case of Iksan-si, 570 for the former Iri-si and 572 for the former Iksan-gun were used, but there was no area where the three digits overlapped. However, in the case of Pyeongtaek-si, there were areas where the three digits overlapped, so the previous three digits are used differently. The chart below records the administrative areas designated by the first three digits. Parentheses indicate the abolished administrative divisions. For the postal code assignment status in the administrative area prior to 1995, refer to the postal code change notice. Delivery number The delivery number is a number used to deliver the mail to the recipient, and is divided and assigned to match the area in charge of each delivery agent. It is divided into dongs and myeons, but it is also divided into buildings or mailbox units. It is assigned based on the statutory dong, and when there are multiple administrative dongs in the statutory dong, both the statutory dong and the administrative dong are assigned a postal code. Exceptionally, if there is one administrative dong in multiple statutory dongs, a postal code is assigned to each statutory dong, and a postal code is not assigned to administrative dongs. In the case of apartments, 500 posts per day, and in the case of buildings or institutions, individual postal codes are assigned when there are more than 300 posts per day. For the delivery of the postal code of the bulk delivery service, the permission of the local post office is required. For reference, 999-999 is a return number for a financial company, and is marked as \\"Right edited Chinese mailbox 999\\". 5-digit postal code (1970~1988) The status of postal code assignment as of 1986 can be found on page 1014 of the 1986 Administrative District Overview.

Plot  Based on true events, Teenage Dirtbag tells the unlikely love story of Amber and Thayer. At local Idaho IGA store, Amber Lange, very pregnant, runs into an old classmate and learns that Thayer Mangeres, a boy they went to school with, has drowned while jumping off a cliff into a river. Shaken, Amber reflects and flashes back to her days in high school as an unhappy but popular cheerleader and her interactions with Thayer, a ‚Äúproblem kid.‚Äù Because of their last names, they were often seated next to each other in class. In science class, Thayer drinks the blood of a dead fetal pig in an effort to impress his fellow students. Instead of being impressed, Amber is disgusted by Thayer, and tells him that she thinks nothing of him. Her casual dismissal sets Thayer on a course to make Amber‚Äôs life miserable. Thayer begins to harass Amber in each class, including Creative Writing class. When Tabitha, a new student arrives, he soon strikes up a relationship with her, and she joins in the taunting of Amber. After an incident in Study Hall, Amber reports Thayer‚Äôs actions to the teacher and he is sent for discipline by the school principal. After school, Thayer returns home to learn that news of the trouble in class has reached his father. Because of this, Thayer‚Äôs brother Dooley is summoned by their father to hold him down on the ground while their father whips him with his belt. When the classmates return Creative Writing, Thayer starts to reveal his pain in his poems. Amber, sharing the experience of a loveless home life, picks up on the subtle messages in Thayer‚Äôs written work. She finds herself in the strange position of relating to the boy she hates more than anyone. Saying very little, Amber offers Thayer an orange later that day amid the silence of study hall. This opens the door to the pair developing a very private friendship. Through poems read aloud in class, Thayer and Amber exchange intense feelings for one another. Amber experiences ongoing social pressure, rejection and abandonment at home, while Thayer‚Äôs problems at home escalate with violence sexual abuse aimed at his older sister, Jeannie. Thayer tries but fails to protect her from the abuse. As the weeks pass, Thayer confides his secrets to Amber in a notebook they share in study hall. The pair become closer, leaning on one another during dark times, until one night when Thayer sees Amber at a party at the lake. Amber is drunk and climbs into a boat with another boy. Thayer secretly watches them having sex. Feeling betrayed, Thayer finds revenge the following day by reading a poem to the class about Amber, exposing her. To spite Thayer, Amber pull out the private notebook full of secrets that she shares with Thayer and throws it onto Tabitha's desk. After looking at a few pages, Tabitha runs out of the classroom and the notebook is quickly passed around, humiliating Thayer and exposing his private messages to the whole school. The following day, Thayer places drugs onto his desk. He takes them in front of Amber and overdoses. As the class is ushered out of the room, Amber watches through the window as Thayer becomes convulses. After the overdose, Thayer never returns to school. Amber's world returns to normal. A year later, while shopping, Amber sees Thayer again but almost doesn‚Äôt recognize him, as he has become a Mormon missionary. Months later, Amber meets Thayer again at the beach. She questions him about his Mormon mission and he informs her that he left early. Eventually, Amber informs him that she is getting married; Thayer ignores her and turns the subject to how easy it would be to fake his own death. Later that night, Thayer follows Amber into the bathroom of a movie theatre. Alone together, he demands she admit her feelings. For a split second, they come close to professing their love to each other. But instead, she denies him, and leaves. Returning to present day, Amber is searching for answers, and learns that Thayer‚Äôs father and brother both died in questionable accidents. Now she is determined to find out if Thayer is really dead, or if he just faked his own death as he threatened to do. Searching for answers, she visits Thayer's home to find his sister Jeannie still lives there alone. Learning that the truth about Thayer may never be known, she visits their old high school after hours and returns to her seat in the study hall where she and Thayer once shared happy memories. Amber pulls out the notebook, revealing that she has kept it all of these years. She writes a long passage in it, and passes it to the empty seat where Thayer once sat. Later, Jeannie is standing in the doorway of a hospital room, smiling but with tears in her eyes. In the room, Amber is holding her newborn baby boy. The nametag on his wrist reads ‚ÄúThayer.‚Äù References External links  * Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:2000s teen drama films Category:2009 films Category:English-language films Category:American teen drama films Category:Teensploitation Category:2009 drama films ","title":"Teenage Dirtbag (film)"},{"id":"24626381","text":"White Gull is an unincorporated community in northern Alberta within the Athabasca County.

He was born in the town of L'H√¥pital (), France, then part of the German province of Alsace-Lorraine, where his father worked as an industrial worker. In 1909, the family moved to the industrial town of Zagorje ob Savi. He attended high school in Ljubljana. Already as a teenager, he became a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, and became one of the leaders of the Communist Youth in Slovenia. During the 1920s, he worked as a journalist for left wing newspapers. He strongly opposed Yugoslav centralism, and advocated the establishment of a socialist and federal Yugoslavia. In 1924, he took part in the armed clash between the Communist-organized workers' units and members of the Yugoslav nationalist militiamen of the ORJUNA organization that took place in the industrial town of Trbovlje. Between 1926 and 1929, he was in the leadership of the Slovenian section of the Yugoslav Communist Party. During this period, he was arrested and imprisoned by the Yugoslav authorities on two occasions. In 1930, he emigrated to the Soviet Union. In the mid-1930s, he was accused of counter-revolutionary activity, and imprisoned. He was released in 1945, but had to remain in the Soviet Union because of his disapproval of the Informbiro declaration. In 1956, he was released at the request of the Yugoslav authorities. After his return to Yugoslavia, he settled in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and became a professional historian, focusing on the history of the worker movement in Slovenia, and on the history of the Communist Party. Together with Du≈°an Kermavner, he was one of the foremost Communist historians of the Socialist movement in Slovenia. He was also vocal in the defence of the federalist system in Yugoslavia and of the autonomy of the single Yugoslav republics against centralist pressures. He was also a prolific translator from Russian into Slovene. Among other, he translated several works of Lenin and Mayakovsky. In 1964, he translated Solzhenitsyn's novel One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. He died in Ljubljana. He was the brother of the social realist poet Mile Klopƒçiƒç, and the uncle of the film director Matja≈æ Klopƒçiƒç.

Each city street or rural region has a unique five-digit number. The first three digits identify the city, municipality or prefecture. In major cities, the final two digits identify streets or portions of streets.Hellenic Post: FAQs Accessed July 13, 2008 Postal codes beginning with the digits between 100 and 180 are used for the city of Athens; the beginning sequences 180 to 199 are used for other parts of the prefecture of Attica, with the exception of Corfu and Rhodes. A complicated system relates the numbers used for the second and third digits to the numbers used in the fourth and fifth digits. # In less populated areas, the third digit is always a 0, while the final two digits identify municipalities in the prefecture. Because there are fewer municipalities in such regions, the final two digits tend not to exceed 50 or 60. # In areas with a greater population, the third digit may climb as high as 6 or 8, while the fourth and fifth digits may also be higher. # In larger cities, the third digit is never a 0, but ranges from 1 to 9.

It is one of the few law enforcement organisations in the world to combine water policing and coast guard duties while remaining as a policing unit. It operates primarily as a law enforcement agency, with secondary responsibilities in search and rescue. History The Haitian Coast Guard was formed in the late 1930s, 20 years after the disbandment of the Haitian Navy, and was equipped with two small picket boats named 1 and 2 and the 161-ton Sans Souci. The latter was formerly the American yacht Captain James Taylor. During World War II, six 83-foot cutters, named 1 through 6, were transferred from the US Coast Guard in 1942. Three 121-ton SC class submarine chasers, Touissaint L'Ouverture, 16 Aout 1946, and Admiral Killick, were transferred in 1947, along with the 47-ton cutter Savannah and the light transport Verti√®res. The two picket boats were withdrawn at this time. In 1948, a US Naval Mission arrived in Haiti. The transport Verti√®res sank in 1951 and was replaced by the Artibonite, a LCT which had been previously wrecked on the Haitian coast and was subsequently salvaged. The Coast Guard remained this way until the Admiral Killick was stricken in 1954 and was replaced by a US-sourced buoy tender given the same name in 1955. In 1956 a new 100 ton coast cutter, La Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot, was acquired from the United States. The two remaining sub-chasers were stricken in 1960 which is when the new Verti√®res, sister to the La Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot, was acquired. The US Navy netlayer , renamed Jean-Jacques Dessalines, arrived in 1960 for a five- year, extended to 17-year lease. On April 21, 1970,http://defend.ht/history/articles/events/845-the-mutiny-of-the-haitian- coast-guard three units ‚Äî La Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot, Verti√®res, and Jean-Jacques Dessalines ‚Äî mutinied and shelled the Presidential Palace in Port-au-Prince. They were driven off by fighter aircraft and then interred themselves in the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. The US disarmed the vessels and relocated them initially to Puerto Rico and then back to Haiti. Duvalier celebrated this event by renaming the Coast Guard the \\"Haitian Navy\\" (La Marine Haitienne). In 1973, Duvalier attempted to expand this with the purchase of up to 24 small boats, allegedly to include PT boats, but these plans came to naught. In 1976, the Haitian Navy purchased five small patrol craft from Sewart Seacraft of Berwick, Louisiana. The Dessalines was returned to the United States, while the Admiral Killick, Artibonite and the Savannah and the six 83-foot cutters were stricken. In 1978, the , a Sotoyomo class tug, was acquired and recommissioned as the Henri Christophe. The planned sale of a sister ship fell through. The Coast Guard in the late 1980s consisted of only the armed tug Henri Christophe, nine small patrol craft built in the United States between 1976 and 1981, and the old presidential yacht Sans Souci. This small force was manned by 45 officers and 280 enlisted personnel based at Port-au-Prince. When the Haitian Armed Forces were disbanded in the 1990s, the remnants of the Haitian Navy was renamed the Coast Guard and was transferred to the National Police. Current Coast Guard The marine police is exercised by a specialized unit of the National Police called the Corps des Gardes-C√¥tes or Coast Guard. This unit was created July 16, 1996 and is based Bizoton. Role and mission The core mission of the Coast Guard is to secure the maritime area of Haiti through surveillance of territorial waters and the safety of maritime navigation divided into these different functions: * Perform active surveillance of the national maritime areas; * Ensuring compliance with laws and regulations regarding fishing and navigation; * Participate in the fight against drug trafficking; * Participate in the fight against all forms of crime. Structure The Coast Guard consists of a command post (CP) include: Commandant of the Coast Guard, an Assistant Commandant, an Operations Manager and Head of the Administration and three basic units: ;Bases * Killick, the base of Port-au-Prince ** equipped with: 6 vedettes and 4 patrol boats. * The base of Cap-Ha√Øtien ** equipped with: 4 vedettes and 2 patrol boats. * The base of Jacmel ** equipped with: 2 vedettes and 1 patrol boat. ;Ship types * 12 Vedette: 40 foot boat - ex-Haitian naval cruisers c.1980s * Patrouilleur: 32-foot patrol boat called GO FAST for fast response.

Background Nuhu Aliyu was born in June 1941. He studied Advance Police Management at the Police Staff College in Jos. He became a Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police. In June 1994, the arrest of opposition leader Moshood Abiola in Lagos triggered demonstrations. Abiola had been elected president of Nigeria in 1993, but the election results were annulled by the military president Ibrahim Babangida. DIG Aliyu was responsible for stepping up security to maintain the peace. As Deputy Inspector-General of Police he was in charge of the Force Criminal Investigations Department (FCID). Aliyu was state chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Niger State before his election to the senate. First Senate term 1999-2003 Aliyu was elected in 1999 as a member of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) for the Niger North constituency and appointed chair of the Upper House committee on Police Affairs. In January 2001, after the Senate had rejected liberalisation of the downstream sector of the petroleum industry, Aliyu said this was because the Senate had not been consulted. Early in 2002, the Senate made a move to impeach president Obasanjo. In November 2002, it emerged that senators and representatives had been paid to drop the proceedings. Aliyu said he was asked to collect his share of the impeachment booty but that he declined. In January 2003, as Senate Committee chairman on Security and Intelligence, Aliyu advised the house not to conduct the screening of three proposed ministers in haste and later come back and complain about the behaviour of the nominees. Second Senate term 2003‚Äì2007 Aliyu was re-elected in 2003. In May 2003, the Senate passed the Hydro- Electric Power Commission Bill, which Aliyu co-sponsored. In October 2003, he co-sponsored a motion that criticized the withholding of local government council allocations and grants by state governments. In January 2004, his guest house in Kontagora, Niger State was burned during riots that followed a disputed local election. In February 2004, he attended a meeting of the Niger State caucus of the Peoples Democratic Party, which issued a declaration that the creation of seventeen additional local government councils was permanent and the elections on January 10, 2004 were valid. In September 2004, he co- sponsored a Police Tax Fund Bill that aimed to provide adequate funding for the Police in crime prevention and detection. Also in September 2004, Aliyu seconded a motion that President Olusegun Obasanjo should relieve Mallam Nasiru El-Rufai of his job as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) within 48 hours. This followed public remarks by El-Rufai describing the Senators as 'fools' in response to a Senate Public Account Committee report that indicted him of financial irregularities, both as Director General Bureau for Public Enterprise and as Minister of the FCT. In December 2004, he criticized a report from the Senate Committee on States and Local Governments on restoring peace in Anambra State, saying a pending report on the same subject by Senator David Mark's Committee was likely to be better researched and considered. In May 2005, two agencies established by President Olusegun Obasanjo started proceedings against several high-profile figures. Some members of the House of Representatives then threatened to impeach the president. Aliyu remarked that he had investigated some of the supporters of the impeachment plan for alleged fraud during his career in the police. Aliyu described some of his colleagues as confirmed distinguished crooks. In November 2005, following reports of a spate of highway accidents, he seconded a motion for the Senate Committee on Works to investigate the Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA) and the Federal Ministry of Works and report back within four weeks. In February 2006, Nuhu Aliyu described the alleged third term bid of President Olusegun Obasanjo and the constitutional review as \\"evil.\\" In April 2006, Aliyu asked that various allegations of fraud against Senator Ibrahim Mantu, the Deputy Senate President, should be investigated, and Mantu should be suspended from the Senate during the investigation. The motion to suspend Mantu did not gain enough support to pass, but the senate decided to launch a probe. In February 2007, Aliyu criticized the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for allowing itself to be used by the government to fight its perceived political enemies, but said that although the approach might be wrong, the EFCC was doing some good. Third Senate term 2007‚Äì2011 Aliyu was reelected again in April 2007. He was appointed to committees on Security & Intelligence, Police Affairs, Local and Foreign Debts, Culture & Tourism and Communications. He was a contender for the position of Senate President, but David Mark was selected. In January 2008, he stated that some members of the Senate were involved in fraud, but later on advice from his lawyers apologized and withdrew the accusation without naming names. The chairman of the House Committee on Media and Publicity, Eziuche Ubani, said the House would not accept Aliyu's apology, but asked him to reveal his list of the National Assembly members alleged to be involved in 419 fraud. In March 2008, Aliyu donated 400 motorbikes and 400 sewing machines to the local government of Borgu in Niger State, to be distributed to the people. \\"The sewing machines are for the women, while the motorcycles are for the men.\\" He said he was putting together a foundation, to be called the Senator Nuhu Aliyu Foundation, for further donations. In a May 2009 interview, Aliyu said a police report presented to the Court of Appeal on the Osun State governorship election petition was forged, noted that the sole role of police in an election was to keep the peace, and expressed confidence in the evolution towards full democracy in Nigeria. Aliyu ran for reelection for a fourth term in April 2011, but was defeated by the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) candidate Ibrahim Musa who polled 131,872 votes to 83,778 for Aliyu. After the election Aliyu, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Security, filed a petition with the Niger state election petition tribunal against Ibrahim Musa.

Climbing the steps one reaches the double doors leading into the dukang (du khang) or assembly hall. Three green drums are on the right of the door under which is the place of the Gyeskos. The wall and entry door are richly painted. Upstairs is the Dukar Lhakang (\\"residence of the deity\\") or inner sanctuary. There is an impressive figure here of Avalokite≈õvara (Tibetan: Chenrezig) with 1,000 arms (all holding weapons) and 1,000 heads. The walls are painted with a Tibetan calendar, mandalas and rules for the monks. Above the wooden stairs can be seen the rooms of the Abbot, guest rooms and the library.Schettler (1981), p. 114. A lama from Sankar Monastery visits the mid-sixteenth century fort built by Tashi Namgyal at Namgyal Tsemo, the peak above Leh every morning and evening to maintain the temples associated with the fort and light the butter-lamps.Rizvi (1996), p. 225.

Random House) Beast in View is a Psychological Suspense- Horror thriller by Margaret Millar published in 1955 that won the Edgar Award in 1956 and was later adapted for an episode of the television series Alfred Hitchcock Hour in 1964 and remade for The Alfred Hitchcock Presents revival in 1986. It also made the list of The Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time that was issued in 1995 by the Mystery Writers of America.  Plot  Helen Clarvoe gets a call from someone identifying themselves as ‚ÄúEvelyn Merrick‚Äù who offers her help dealing with her late father's finances but Clarvoe rejects her offer. The caller states that one day she will be famous and her body will be in every art museum in the country. Before hanging up the caller predicts that Helen will suffer injuries to the forehead and mouth. Later that evening while trying to write a letter to her mother Helen trips over a chair in her bedroom and suffers the exact injuries that the caller predicted. Scared, Helen calls her father's old acquaintance, investment councilor Paul Blackshear and asks him to come over to offer his advice. Blackshear, retired since the death of his wife from cancer, is initially reluctant to help but upon seeing Clarvoe‚Äôs distress agrees to help track down Merrick. Going off the caller's comment that one day she will \\"be in every museum in the country,\\" he deduces that she is an aspiring model and goes to the Lydia Hudson modelling school. Hudson tells Blackshear that Merrick claimed to have modeled for a photographer named Jack Terola. She also told her that she wanted to pose naked for portraits and that she wanted to become ‚Äúimmortal‚Äù. Hudson put her in contact with a photographer named Harley Moore whom Blackshear goes to see. Bertha Moore, wife of Harley Moore gets a call from a person identifying themselves as Evelyn Merrick. She tells Bertha she is an acquaintance of her husband and the two happily discuss their baby and Bertha invites her over to see her. Bertha calls Harley to tell him that his acquaintance Evelyn Merrick is on her way to see the baby, at which point Harley who is in the middle of speaking to Blackshear, goes into a panic and tells Bertha to lock the doors and not let Evelyn in the house. Bertha does so but when Evelyn arrives at the house she taunts Bertha from outside the front door telling her that her husband is not as noble as she thinks he is as he may have fathered one of her children as well. Harley and Blackshear arrive just after Evelyn has left and Blackshear suspects that she is a non-violent sociopath who gets thrills from preying on people‚Äôs fears. Blackshear goes to visit Helen‚Äôs mother Verna who tells her that Evelyn is her son Dougie‚Äôs estranged wife and moreover tells him that she met Dougie through Helen as the two were friends in college. After Blackshear leaves, Evelyn calls and tells Verna why she believes Dougie has been acting out lately which causes Verna to faint. (The novel does not elaborate on what Evelyn says to Verna at this stage.) Meanwhile, bartender Florian Vicente admonishes a woman in his bar for being on the phone for too long. The woman, who identifies herself as Evelyn Merrick, decides that Vicente must be punished for being rude. She goes to a payphone, calls Vicente's wife and tells him that his husband is \\"a pimp for niggers\\" before hanging up. She skips with delight down the road in the pouring rain. She goes into a diner, has a drink then attempts to call Helen but she does not pick up. She then calls Bertha, Verna and Terola but discovers they have all either changed their numbers or hang up as soon as they recognize her voice. Angered she vows to get even with Helen first. In her dream Helen experiences a flashback to her high school days where Evelyn attracted all the good looking boys at the school dance whereas Helen hid in the bathroom stall due to her shyness. That night she overheard her parents conversing and agreeing that they wish Helen was more like Evelyn. She is particularly affected when her father says that Helen's punishment is \\"having to be herself\\". Blackshear goes to Evelyn's house to meet with her mother Annabel. He learns that Evelyn returned from her honeymoon with Dougie prematurely stating she wanted an annulment from Dougie because he was ‚Äúa pervert‚Äù and that he only married her to prove he wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúfairy‚Äù. That night Douglas comes home from his photography class with Terola and Verna deduces that the two of them are in fact lovers. Verna disowns Douglas and leaves the house to confront Terola and, after she has left, Dougie commits suicide by slashing his wrists. Blackshear goes to Helen to tell her the bad news about her brother but realizes that they can‚Äôt go to the police because Evelyn hasn‚Äôt technically committed a crime, she merely called Verna and told her something about Dougie which was true. They realize that all they can do is to try and learn everything they can about Evelyn and find out if she has committed any actual crimes. Blackshear goes to Terola‚Äôs studio and finds him dead in his office with a pair of garden sheers stuck in his neck. Blackshear suspects that Verna is the murderer but she maintains that she changed her mind about going to see him. In the bathroom of the public library Evelyn washes blood off her clothes. She grabs a book and sits in the corner pretending to read so that she can contemplate what she has done and decide her next course of action. Through flashback it s revealed that she visited Terola and asked him to destroy the original photos he took of her as they didn‚Äôt do her justice. When he refused and called her crazy she stabbed him. Her suspicious behavior is noticed by a Mr Hoffman in the library. She goes to a phone booth and calls a frantic Verna telling her that Helen is working in a call house. Blackshear learns of a friend of Evelyn's named Dr Clare Lawrence whom he goes to see. He tells her of Evelyn's recent activities and confides in her that he believes she developed multiple personality disorder after the break up of her parents marriage. As Blackshear is questioning Clare, Evelyn walks through the door. Blackshear demands to know where Helen is but Evelyn claims not to have seen her or her family for years. Helen wakes up in a call house heavily fatigued and having being loaded with alcohol. She escapes but realizes she is being followed by Evelyn. As she tries to escape she is knocked over by a taxi but is not seriously injured and when the crowd around her disperses Evelyn has disappeared. She gets the taxi driver to take her back to her hotel where she hides in her room. Evelyn arrives at the hotel along with Blackshear who has deduced that it is in fact Helen who has multiple personality disorder. Helen in fact hallucinated the phone call from \\"Evelyn\\", made the fatal phone call to her mother as \\"Evelyn\\", modeled for and eventually murdered Terola as Evelyn, went to work at the call house as Evelyn but drunkenly passed out and woke up as Helen and finally imagined that she was being chased by Evelyn. Blackshear determines that Helen, eternally jealous of Evelyn's popularity and feeling abandoned and betrayed by her parents, developed a separate, evil personality in order to be more like the real Evelyn. Helen quickly regains her memory in her hotel room and is engulfed by guilt. Blackshear and Evelyn go to Helen's room and beg her to come out so they can begin seeking treatment and rehabilitation for her. They tell her that she was a wonderful person the way she was and she had no reason to want to be someone else. Their efforts are futile as Helen, faced with the magnitude of what she has done, takes a knife and kills herself by plunging it into her throat.

It is often used when designing zoning codes, planning redevelopment, and conducting urban planning research. The survey consists of a series of images that participants must score according to their preference. The images may be actual photographs or computer-simulated images depicting potential urban environments.LGC: Resources: Community Design: Participation Tools: Public Participation and Visual Surveys The participants' input is then used to make decisions about the future built environment. This technique was developed by urban planner Anton \\"Tony\\" Nelessen in the late 1970s,NY Times: Architecture Rejuvenates Main Streets and it grew in popularity during the 1990s. The method has been criticized on the basis that lighting, weather, and background activities might influence preferences. In part this is corrected by using simulated imagery,New Tools: Anton Nelessen/Nelessen Associates but simulations themselves may be misleading when compared with actual photographs. Recent plans utilizing visual preference surveys include Denver,Downtown Denver Visual Preference Survey Summary Topeka,City of Topeka - Visual Preference Survey Results New Castle,New Castle Comprehensive Plan Visual Preference Survey and Orlando.City of Orlando Visual Preference Survey  Criticisms of Visual Preference Surveys  Visual Preference Surveys have been criticized for potentially eliciting inaccurate measurements of a communities preference. As planner Reid Ewing has noted , ‚Äúwhen you show citizens stark images of new suburban subdivisions or strip centers versus beautified images from America‚Äôs finest small towns, the outcome is predictable and largely meaningless.‚Äù For accurate results, a visual preference survey must adhere to sound research design: It must be specifically tailored to the community and location, generated after multiple discussions and field investigations and photographic reconnaissance, and address eight or more related categories of visual and spatial characteristics. Effective visual preference surveys are precise in exploring which variables they are attempting to measure, whether it be street trees, bike lanes, crosswalks, or any number of proposed changes. Nelessen and other practitioners have addressed this issue through the use of simulated or manipulated imagery using Adobe Photoshop or any number image manipulation software. In practice, this may involve taking exactly the same picture, yet adding a single element to the second picture to gauge community reaction to a proposed change. For example, visual preference surveys for locations such as Topeka, Princeton, and Journal Square contain several such images - one untouched image contrasted with exactly the same picture except with a single new element added, such as pedestrians, a narrower street, a median with greenery or other design elements. In such instances, higher scores for the second, doctored image provide a more reliable gauge for the aesthetic preferences of a community.http://www.geoearth.uncc.edu/people/iheard/3115Readings/TurningHighwaysMainStreets.pdf See also * Environmental psychology References External links *Description from A.

The album features his earliest recordings for Prestige Records, performing as a soloist with a rhythm section of bassist Gary Mapp (originally credited as \\"Gerry Mapp\\"), either Art Blakey or Max Roach on drums, and one track with Percy Heath replacing Mapp. It also contains the earliest recorded versions of the jazz standards \\"Blue Monk\\" and \\"Bemsha Swing\\". Secondary sources have placed the album's release year to either 1954 or 1956. It has been re-released numerous times, occasionally under the title Monk's Moods and with different track orders. Its track listing expands on the 10\\" LP issue Thelonious (1953), augmented with two tracks from his fourth 10\\" LP, Thelonious Monk Plays (with Percy Heath and Art Blakey), released in 1954.  Release history  According to Sputnikmusic writer Alex Robertson, Thelonious Monk Trio was originally released in 1954 as Monk's first proper studio album. It follows the release of his two Genius of Modern Music compilations‚Äîthe first volume in 1951 and the second volume in 1952. The record has since been re-released numerous times on different formats, usually with its original title, although occasionally as Monk's Moods. (Monk's Moods was first released in 1960 by Prestige.)Sheridan, Chris, Brilliant Corners: A Bio-discography of Thelonious Monk, p 296, Westport and London: Greenwood Press, 2001 According to Robert Christgau, the 10-track Thelonious Monk Trio \\"has been reissued in more iterations and titles than I can catalogue\\". On some of its re-releases, Robertson notes Thelonious Monk Trio had a track listing order different from the original, which opens with \\"Little Rootie Tootie\\". The album also features the first recorded performances of \\"Blue Monk\\" and \\"Bemsha Swing\\". According to music journalist Charles Waring, Thelonious Monk Trio was first released in 1954 and is a 12-inch vinyl revamping of the 1953 10-inch LP Thelonious. Chris May from All About Jazz also placed the release year to 1954. Chris Sheridan, in his book Brilliant Corners: A Bio-discography of Thelonious Monk, dates the album's first 12-inch vinyl release, Thelonious Monk Trio (Prestige LP 7027), to 1956 and lists it as the first Monk LP in Prestige's 7000 series of 12-inch records, followed that same year by Monk and Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins.  Critical reception  Thelonious Monk Trio received critical acclaim during the 2000s. Reviewing in All Music Guide to Jazz (2002), Scott Yanow said the album features \\"brilliant performances\\" in spite of Monk \\"suffering from lack of work and a complete lack of recognition from the public\\" at the time of the recordings. Fellow AllMusic contributor Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr. called its music \\"intimate, intense, and inspired ... 35 minutes of professional musicians practicing their craft\\", and wrote that, although they were \\"pieced together from three different sessions,\\" the recordings' \\"small settings ... allow the necessary space for Monk's explorations, which conjure up images of a mathematician working out geometric patterns on the keyboard.\\" BBC Music's Charles de Ledesma remarked that \\"the various personnel make little difference to the overall effect ‚Äì Monk throughout offers a sumptious flow of melody, punctuation, nuance and charm.\\" Reviewing the album's 2007 Rudy Van Gelder remaster, Chris May from All About Jazz hailed Thelonious Monk Trio as \\"immortal, stratospheric music\\" and \\"amongst the most eternal\\" of Monk's releases. \\"At this period like no other\\", May said, \\"Monk's rhythmic attack packed the power of an express train.\\" Sputnikmusic's Alex Robertson said that \\"even when Monk gets nutty, as on the brutally virtuosic 'Trinkle, Tinkle,' the album's appeal lies not in his 'sabotage' of popular music but his ability to turn it into something invigoratingly weird, two approaches often conflated when looking back on the work of an inventive musician.\\" In MSN Music, Christgau said the record offers \\"the not so common chance to hear Monk as a solely featured soloist with a rhythm section\\", with drummers Art Blakey and Max Roach performing like \\"co-stars\\".

Hopewell Interaction Sphere The Hopewell Exchange system began in the Ohio and Illinois River valleys about 200 BCE. The culture is referred to more as a system of interaction among a variety of societies than as a single society or culture. Hopewell trading networks were quite extensive, and their valued commodities included obsidian from the Yellowstone area, copper from Lake Superior, and shells from the Gulf Coast. The Hopewell tradition was not a single culture or society, but a widely dispersed set of related populations. They were connected by a network of trade routes. known as the Hopewell Exchange System. At its greatest extent, the Hopewell exchange system ran from the Southeastern United States into the southeastern Canadian shores of Lake Ontario. Within this area, societies participated in a high degree of exchange with the highest amount of activity along waterways, the easiest transportation routes. Burial customs of the Saugeen people were similar to those of the nearby Point Peninsula Complex. The evidence from excavations suggests a band size of about 50 individuals. No indications of status differences have been found in excavations, but no mounds in the Saugeen Complex have been excavated. The main distinction between the Saugeen complex and the nearby Point Peninsula Complex peoples seems to be that Saugeen ceramics were cruder in construction and decoration.

They are scattered throughout most of the Neotropics, but are not common in any part of their range. They grow in wet forests from 100 m to 900 m in elevation. There is no known use of these vines by humans. Description Anthodon is a large liana. Its leaves are opposite or subopposite, simple, and with margins that are crenulate or serrulate. They are elliptic, 6 to 12 cm long, and 2.5 to 5 cm wide. The inflorescences are borne in the axils of the leaves, on peduncles 5 to 30 mm long. They are roughly flat-topped in shape, dichotomously branched, and bearing numerous flowers. The flowers are a greenish or pale yellow, fragrant, and 5 to 10 mm in diameter. They are bisexual and pentamerous, with the sepals and petals being completely free. The sepals and petals are serrate; the petals conspicuously so, often with each tooth tapering to a short hair. The stamens are three in number, equal, and ascending to erect. The filaments are short and broadened toward the base. The anthers are basifixed and broadly reniform, opening by a transverse, apical cleft. A nectary disk encircles the stamens. The ovary is 3-sided and 3-locular, with 8 to 14 ovules per locule. The placentation is axile. The style is short and stout, surmounted by three small, triangular stigmas, these located opposite the stamens. The fruit is distinctive, easily attracting attention by its odd appearance. There is usually only one per inflorescence. It has been described as three coherent capsules and as a 3-locular capsule. It is dorso-ventrally flattened into a disk which hangs lantern-like from the peduncle attached at its center. It is green and variable in size, up to 18 cm in diameter. In most of its close relatives, the three locules of the ovary become three separate fruits, but in Anthodon, they are united for their entire length and over half their width into a trilobed capsule with a notch at the end of each lobe. At maturity, the capsule breaks into three pieces, with each locule splitting down the middle and the adjacent halves of the locules remaining fused, sometimes weakly so. Unlike many in Celastraceae, the seeds have no aril. Eight to 14 are crowded into each locule. The basal part of the seed is a membranous wing with a single, central vein that forms as a remnant of the funiculus. The embryoniferous part of the seed is near the edge of the capsule. Names The name Anthodon was coined by Ruiz and Pavon in 1798 in their masterpiece, Flora Peruviana et Chilensis. It means \\"flower tooth\\" or \\"flower teeth\\", and refers to the prominent teeth that line the margins of the sepals and petals. At the end of their description, they wrote, \\"Genus Anthodon √† foliolis calycinis et petalis dentato-ciliatis nominavimus\\".Hip√≥lito Ruiz-L√≥pez and Jos√© Antonio Pav√≥n y Jim√©nez. 1789-1802.

They described one species, Anthodon decussatum, named for the decussate arrangement of the leaves. It is the type species for the genus. In 1940, Albert C. Smith named the second species, Anthodon panamense. Some have doubted that Anthodon contains two species, suggesting that it might be a single species with a disjunct distribution and a Panamanian variety. After Ruiz and Pavon established the genus Anthodon, several species were assigned to it by other authors,\\"Anthodon\\" at International Plant Names Index (see External links below). resulting in a genus that was hard to distinguish from a few others. These species have been reassigned to other genera. Relatives In a treatment of the family Celastraceae in 2004, Mark Simmons placed Anthodon in the subfamily Hippocrateoideae, which contains about 100 species. Hippocrateoideae is one of three morphologically distinct and monophyletic subfamilies embedded in the large, paraphyletic subfamily Celastroideae. The classification proposed by Simmons is an artificial construct, meant to be used until a phylogenetic classification of Celastraceae can be found. The subfamily Hippocrateoideae (sensu Simmons) encompasses about a third of the species of the now defunct family Hippocrateaceae that was erected by Jussieu in 1811.Antoine Laurent de Jussieu. 1811. page 486. In: \\"Dixi√®me M√©moire; Sur les caract√®res g√©n√©raux des familles tir√©s des graines, et confirm√©s ou rectifi√©s par les observations de Gaertner. Renonculac√©es - Malpighiac√©es.\\". Annales du Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle 18:472-487. (see External links below). The division of Hippocrateoideae into genera has been a source of considerable disagreement.Albert C. Smith. 1940. \\"Introductory Information\\" pages 341-356. In: \\"The American Species of Hippocrateaceae\\". Brittonia 3(3):341-555. (see External links below). Simmons recognizes 19 genera in this group. Most authors have recognized fewer genera and some have put all of the 100 or so species into one genus, a very broadly circumscribed Hippocratea. Circumscription The genus Anthodon has been variously \\"sunk\\" into other genera. In 1872, John Miers placed the only species known at that time into Prionostemma.John Miers. 1872. \\"On the Hippocrateaceae of South America\\". Transactions of the Linnean Society of London 28(2):319-342 + 32 plates. Theodor Loesener placed it in Hippocratea subgenus Pristimera.L.E. Theodor Loesener. 1942. \\"Anthodon\\" page 208.

Duncker and Humblot: Berlin, Germany. 1960 reprint of 1942 publication. Anthodon has not yet been sampled for DNA, but four of its close relatives, Hippocratea, Pristimera, Plagiopteron, and Loesenerella were sampled for a molecular phylogeny of Celastraceae that was published in 2008.Mark P. Simmons, Jennifer J. Cappa, Robert H. Archer, Andrew J. Ford, Dedra Eichstedt, and Curtis C. Clevinger (2008). \\"Phylogeny of the Celastreae and the relationships of Catha edulis inferred from morphological characters and nuclear and plastid genes\\". Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 48(2):745-757. The ultimate botanical fate of Anthodon can not presently be known. It might be subsumed into some other genus or it might be expanded by having additional species transferred to it. Only further studies of Celastraceae will provide an answer.

Origins The origins of Haiti's military lie in the Haitian Revolution. A decade of warfare produced a military cadre from which Haiti's early leaders emerged. Defeat of the French demonstrated Haiti's considerable strategic stamina and tactical capabilities, but Haiti's victory did not translate into a successful national government or a strong economy. Lacking a strong constitution, Haiti was usually ruled by force. The armed forces, who had been united against the French, fragmented into warring regional factions. The military very soon took control of almost every aspect of Haitian life. Officers assumed responsibility for the administration of justice and for municipal management. According to a Haitian diplomat, the country was in its earlier days \\"an immense military camp.\\" Without viable civilian institutions, Haiti was vulnerable to military personalities, who permanently shaped the nation's authoritarian, personalist, and coercive style of governance. 19th century Haiti's defense fell victim to political vagaries. A readiness for battle and the initiation of defense related engineering projects in the early 19th century turned out to be costly preparation for conflict against phantom armies. The engineering projects included construction of the citadel of La Ferri√®re in northern Haiti. Soon afterward, Haiti turned its attention toward the rest of the island of Hispaniola (La Isla Espa√±ola), which Haiti controlled between 1822 and 1844. Controlling the whole island, however, drained the national treasury and induced torpor in the battle-hardened veterans of the wars of independence. During the mid-19th century, prolonged instability weakened the military. By the end of the 19th century, Haiti's military had become little more than an undisciplined, ill-fed, and poorly paid militia that shifted its allegiances as battles were won or lost and as new leaders came to power. Between 1806 and 1879, an estimated 69 revolts against existing governments took place; another twenty uprisings, or attempted insurrections, broke out between 1908 and 1915. During the second half of the 19th century, the army either failed to protect the central government or directly caused the government's collapse. Rural insurgent movements led by piquets and cacos limited the central government's authority in outlying areas. These groups carried on war into the 20th century; they were finally put down by the United States Marine Corps in 1919. At the beginning of the 20th century, Haiti's political instability provoked interference of the great powers (France, Germany, and the United States). The increasing American interest in Haiti prompted the United States Navy to deploy to the country's ports fifteen times between 1876 and 1913 in order to protect American lives and property, and the United States Marines to occupy the whole country from 1915 to 1934. The Haitian Navy was created in 1860 with the commissioning of a single gunboat. Two additional gunboats entered service in 1875 followed by a corvette ten years later. By 1900 three British and French-built gunboats had been launched. In 1902 the Haitian gunboat Cr√™te-√†- Pierrot had a brief engagement with a German warship. The Admiral of the Haitian fleet, Hammerton Killick, scuttled his ship rather than surrender. United States occupation The United States Marines disbanded Haiti's army, which consisted of an estimated 9,000 men, including 308 generals. In February 1916, the Haitian Constabulary (Gendarmerie d'Ha√Øti) was formed. United States Marines and United States Navy officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs) commanded the group. The Gendarmerie attempted to secure public safety, initially by subduing the cacos; to promote development, particularly road construction; and to modernize the military through the introduction of a training structure, a health service, and other improvements. The United States occupation of Haiti brought order and resulted in some economic and social development. At the same time, the United States overhauled Haiti's disintegrated military infrastructure. The Gendarmerie became the Garde d'Ha√Øti in 1928; the Garde formed the core of Haiti's armed forces after the United States administration ended. The United States sought to establish a modern, apolitical military force in Haiti. On the surface, it succeeded; the organization, the training, and the equipment of the Garde all represented improvements over the military conditions existing before the occupation. 20th century After the United States occupation ended, the Haitian military was given the responsibility to ensure domestic law and order. This concern with internal, rather than with external security, endured throughout the 20th century. The Haitian Coast Guard was created in the late 1930s. The Haitian Air Force was created in 1943. Haiti became a party to a number of international agreements, including the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (the Rio Treaty), the Charter of the Organization of American States, and the earlier Act of Chapultepec (1945). The nation's security concerns regarding neighboring Cuba and the Dominican Republic have been viewed since World War II within the broader framework of United States strategic interests in the Caribbean. The fact that the FAd'H deployed relatively few of its units along the Dominican border, despite a history of conflicts with its neighbor, reflects Haiti's limited national security concerns. Duvalier period After the establishment of the Duvalier regime in 1957, various external threats have had little impact on Haiti's security. The Duvaliers' tight control eliminated all Marxist influences in the country, thus minimizing the effects of the Cuban Revolution. It was not until 1986 that a communist party, the Unified Haitian Communist Party (Parti Unifi√© Communiste Ha√Øtien, PUCH), openly operated in the country. Cuba helped some Haitian refugees travel to Florida in the 1980s, but its overall interest in Haitian affairs has been unclear. The severity of Haiti's political and economic crises, along with the high profile of the United States in the region, has limited involvement by other countries in Haitian affairs. Threats to Haiti's internal security, however, have been numerous during the past four decades. Between 1968 and 1970, the government repulsed three invasions supported by exiled Haitians. In 1970 the Coast Guard mutinied. The Coast Guard's five ships, low on fuel and ammunition, went into exile at the United States military base at Guant√°namo, Cuba. In the early 1980s, Haitian military forces and members of the Volontaires de la s√©curit√© nationale (VSN) defeated a small exile force on the Ile de la Tortue (Tortuga Island). An airplane dropped a bomb on the National Palace in 1982, and a car bomb exploded nearby in 1983. Exile groups, however, never posed a significant military challenge to the army and the VSN. The real challenge to these forces came in the popular domestic disturbances that developed after 1984. Post-Duvalier period After the collapse of the Duvalier regime in 1986, the FAd'H developed an agenda to exert national political leadership, to restore public order, and to gain control over the VSN and other paramilitary groups, but carrying out this program proved difficult, given Haiti's political, economic, and foreign policy situations. The main mission of Haiti's armed forces in the late 1980s continued to be internal security. After 1986, however, this mission regularly conflicted with the national leadership role of the FAd'H. Generational and political differences among officers and a scarcity of resources for the military led to chronic instability that culminated in military coups. These coups caused the government to change hands four times in 1988. A fifth coup in early 1989, however, failed to topple the government. The two most important problems that the FAd'H had to face were, first, a divided senior military command and, second, suspicious junior officers and NCO personnel. These problems became apparent in 1988 when Avril ousted Namphy and subsequently dismissed a number of senior officers. The degree to which NCOs may have been manipulated in this process and the extent to which lower army echelons had begun to shape their own political attitudes caused some observers to doubt the military's future as an institution. The challenges facing the FAd'H in the late 1980s were more political than military. The largest and most immediate questions revolved around the institution's ability to govern Haiti during a period of political transition and modernization. It remained unclear, in mid-1989, how and when the military planned to transfer power to a legitimate civilian government. Another important problem concerned the personal political ambitions of some army commanders. It was also unclear how the FAd'H would respond to these challenges because the institution had not demonstrated viable national political capabilities. The FAd'H was ill- prepared for this broad new role in national life because Fran√ßois Duvalier had severely limited its role in government affairs. Other security-related problems included narcotics trafficking. United States officials have expressed concern over Haiti's role as a major transshipment area for narcotics, mainly Colombian cocaine bound for the United States. This role apparently expanded after Jean-Claude's fall. The United States Drug Enforcement Administration opened an office in Port-au- Prince in October 1987 to help Haitian authorities control drug trafficking; however, the lack of a professional police force in Haiti hindered these efforts. The FAd'H appeared ambivalent toward the narcotics issue because drug-related corruption reportedly involved hundreds of members of the officer corps and because some officers resented pressure from Washington. Avril, however, attempted to placate United States concerns by dismissing some officers linked to drug trafficking. The most prominent among the dismissed officers was Paul, a former commander of the Dessalines Battalion, who was indicted in March 1988 by a Florida grand jury on charges of cocaine distribution. Haiti had signed an extradition treaty with the United States, but the agreement did not cover narcotics-related offenses, so Paul never faced trial on the charges. Paul's continued service in the army posed a political problem, and Avril asked him to retire. In November 1988, however, Paul died mysteriously, possibly a victim of poisoning. Paul's death removed a major narcotics figure and a potential threat to Avril's political power. Unstable and unstructured civilian politics and institutions also undermined Haiti's stability. Some Duvalierists sought to use the armed forces completely or partially to restore the ancien r√©gime. At the same time, more democracy-oriented civilian groups, all of which lacked strong institutional bases, continued to be suspicious of the army's political leadership. The weak economy and the international media's criticism of Haitian affairs resulted in financial and public- relations problems for the army; and, because Haiti's political environment remained volatile and because the army did not always appear to be in control of the country, Haiti faced more unrest and the possible development of insurgency movements. On the one hand, Haiti's armed forces was still one of the few institutions of national magnitude, but, on the other hand, the armed forces suffered from serious institutional deterioration and diminished cohesion. In 1989 the military was struggling to provide political leadership at a time when it faced its own disintegration. Disbandment After years of military interference in politics, including dozens of military coups (from two Duvalier-period attempts in 1958 and 1963 to the last one staged in 1991), Haiti disbanded its military in 1995. Haiti's National Assembly created new civilian law enforcement, with the heavily armed Haitian National Police, and the Haitian Coast Guard, with the help of the United States and the United Nations. Yet, to date there has been no official constitutional amendment to abolish the military. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) has been authorized to complete the disarmament and demobilization of any remaining militias. Without its own military, Haiti relies heavily on United Nations (UN) peacekeeping forces. The multinational force has been responsible for quelling riots and preparing for democratic elections. Before UN forces arrived, a multilateral force made up of troops from Canada, Chile, France, and the United States helped stabilize the country under the interim leadership of President Boniface Alexandre. Haiti has no obvious external threats. Tensions have long existed between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, but the current border has been fixed since 1936. 21st century Reformation In 2017, it was announced that Haiti's government had launched a campaign to re-establish the army. According to the announcement, the government wanted to recruit about 500 men and women, between the ages of 18 and 25, who have passed their secondary education exams. The role of the army would be to help deal in times of natural disaster and to patrol Haitian borders. Equipment The army and air force were the better equipped branches of the armed forces, with the navy the least equipped over the years and up to 1994. Aircraft Many of Haiti's air force aircraft were donated second hand from the United States and France: * North American Aviation F-51D Mustang fighters ‚Äì 6 delivered 1950 and the last retired 1973/74, sold to Dominican Republic for parts * North American Aviation T-28 Trojan fighter trainer ‚Äì 12 ex-French Air Force delivered 1973 * Cessna O-2A Skymaster ‚Äì 8 observation aircraft delivered 1975 and sold to Dominican Republic for parts * Sikorsky S-55 utility helicopters * Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando transport * de Havilland Mosquito light bomber ‚Äì 8 ex-Royal Air Force delivered 1946 * de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver/de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter utility transport * Hughes Helicopters 269C utility/trainer helicopter ‚Äì 3 * Hughes Helicopters 369CC utility/trainer helicopter ‚Äì 2 * Sikorsky S-58T (CH-34 ChoctawC) * Aermacchi SF.260TP Warrior trainer * Cessna 150 ‚Äì 3/ * Cessna 172 Skyhawk trainer ‚Äì 1 * Lockheed C-60 Lodestar Lynn Garrison with Haitian Corps d'Aviation Marchetti and crew, September 1990 * Boeing S-307 Stratoliner * Cessna 310 * Douglas C-47 Dakota * Beech 58 Baron * Cessna 402 Utililiner * IAI 201 Arava * Piper PA-34 Seneca * Cessna 303 * Beech 65 Queen Air * Fairchild PT-19 trainer * North American Aviation North American T-6G Texan trainer * Vultee Aircraft Vultee BT-13A Valiant trainer * Beech Bonanza F33 trainer * SIAI-Machetti S-211 jet trainer, retired and put up for sale on 23 April 1990, 2 sold to United States Private companies and 2 to Republic of Singapore Air Force After remobilization of Haitian Air Force by President Jovenel Mo√Øse, Haitian Air Force will purchase military aircraft from Russia in 2020 as part of an overall re-equipment plan.

Current forces Haitian National Police A Haitian SWAT officer with a U.S. Marine The Haitian National Police is tasked with providing law enforcement and security for Haiti. The force currently numbers more than 8,500 police officers, and is expected to reach 14,000. The force consists of the General and Administrative Services, the Administrative Police, the Judicial Police, the SWAT team, and the Presidential Protection Unit. The Police also has several paramilitary units for defense. The Haitian police uses the following weapons: * IMI Galil * IWI Tavor X95 * IWI ACE * IWI Negev * R4 assault rifle * M16 rifle * M4 Carbine * FN SCAR * Browning M2 * Benelli M4 * Heckler & Koch MP5 Haitian Coast Guard The Haitian Coast Guard is charged with law enforcement, security, and search and rescue operations. It maintains bases in Port-au-Prince, Cap-Ha√Øtien, and Jacmel. It is led by the Commandant of the Coast Guard, an Assistant Commandant, an Operations Manager, and a Head of Administration. The force currently has 19 vessels. Officially, it is a part of the Haitian National police.

The VFR1200F has several new technologies including the first dual clutch transmission offered on a motorcycle. When the previous VFR800 was discontinued, it was followed by both the 2014 VFR800F (RC79) and the larger VFR1200. The VFR1200F was discontinued in 2017, as it no longer complied to new emission standards and noise regulations. Development Honda V4 Concept Model. The first V4 concept bike was unveiled at the 2008 Intermot show in Cologne, Germany. It had distinctive design elements that were to appear in the production VFR1200F, in particular the X shaped headlights. Leaks and spy photos of a new Honda appeared in various places including online and print news outlets. Honda created teaser websites in Fall 2009, in which parts of the a new V4 were shown tantalizingly, and a countdown timer was displayed.Honda promotional website: \\"Feel the V4\\" Eight years after the introduction of the previous 6th generation VFR800 Honda unveiled the production VFR1200F at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show. Production Honda VFR1200F engine with dual-clutch transmission at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show. Production of the VFR1200F began in October 2009 and first models were delivered in early 2010. The transverse-mounted V4 architecture is kept from previous VFR models though the engine and gearbox are completely new with displacement increased from 800 to 1200 cubic centimeters. A slightly de-tuned version of the engine, and the same gearbox, have been used on the VFR1200X Crosstourer, a dual-sport motorcycle launched in 2011. Design The VFR1200F was primarily designed in Honda's Italian and German design studios under the supervision of Spanish designer Teofilo Plaza. The exterior features a variety of aerodynamic enhancements taken from the Honda MotoGP bike including a dual-layered fairing designed to pull heat away from the rider and an X shaped bulbous front nose to keep the vehicle stable at high speeds as well as increase turn-in handling. While the new design was viewed with mixed to negative reactions by the general public and press, Plaza was supported by other designers who felt the VFR represented a new design trend where the function is the primary design goal with aesthetics used to complement the aerodynamic profile of the motorcycle. Engine The new engine incorporates the single overhead camshaft distribution system called \\"Unicam\\" which was tested on Honda's offroad machines. This compact system reduces engine size, allowing it to be placed further forward in the frame while lowering the bike's center of gravity. This allows for better front-wheel traction when cornering. A 28¬∞ positioning of crank pins and a specific firing order of the cylinders (1&4 and 2&3 layout instead of the regular 1&3 and 2&4) resulted in an engine with perfect primary balance. Because of this, there is no balance shaft, further lightening the engine. Instead of conventional direct mechanical connection from the rider's twistgrip to the throttle, electronic throttle control (\\"throttle by wire\\") commands the engine control unit to modulate engine power output. The configuration of the cylinders is also unusual. The V4 has the rear bank of cylinders paired closely together, with the big ends of their connecting rods on the inner sides of the crank journals. The forward bank of cylinders is conversely set outboard of the rear bank, with the big end journals mounted on the outer sides of the crank journals. This design allows for a much narrower engine at the rear, which makes the bike slimmer where it contacts the rider and allows an easier reach to the ground from the seat. Transmission The VFR1200F is available with either a conventional constant-mesh sequential manual transmission, with shaft-drive, or an automatic dual clutch transmission (DCT).Honda Announces the New Dual Clutch Transmission for Use in Large-displacement Sport Bikes The DCT version, known in North America as the VFR1200A or in other markets as the VFR1200D, has dual clutches, one operating 1st, 3rd and 5th gears, the other operating 2nd, 4th, and 6th gears. The dual clutches are able to switch quickly between gears and can operate in one of three modes: 'D', which is a fuel-efficient fully automatic mode; 'S', a sports automatic mode, which changes gear at higher engine speeds; and manual mode, in which the rider changes gear using paddles fitted to the handlebars. This gearbox was the first of its type fitted to a large capacity motorcycle, although dual-clutch transmissions were already used in a number of automobiles. The DCT gearbox retains characteristics of a conventional manual transmission like engine braking and clutch engagement as the internal components are very similar except the clutch operation is controlled by an electric motor and computer rather than the rider. Both models feature a slipper clutch to reduce wheel spin during hard engine braking and a shaft-drive system to transmit power to the rear wheel. The shaft-drive system is bolted to the frame on a swinging pivot mount. Engineers developed a two-part shaft connected by a spline that allows the system to flex under load mimicking the feel and performance benefits of a traditional chain drive. Brakes The VFR1200F incorporates the C-ABS combined braking system sourced from the CBR600RR and CBR1000RR sportbikes. C-ABS distributes the braking forces completely electronically sending information from the brake lever into a separate braking computer before the system applies hydraulic pressure to the brakes. Anti-lock brakes (ABS) now as standard equipment rather than optional equipment as they were in the previous generation. During front brake lever activation, all the right- side caliper pistons are applied, along with four of the pistons on the left side. When the rear brake is applied, the other two left-side pistons are actuated. To maintain equal braking force when using just the front brake, the right-side pistons are slightly smaller than the left-side pistons. Reception Reactions to the production VFR1200 were mixed at its introduction. Some had expected a return of the VFR to its racing past because of a much more sport-focused concept model along with V4 engine architecture sourced from the Honda RC212V MotoGP bike. Others noted Honda continued its tradition of using the VFR line to showcase new technologies: the previous VFR800 introduced Honda's VTEC to the worldwide market, and the new VFR1200 became the first production motorcycle to have a DCT automatic transmission. Traction control was added to all 2012 models at no additional cost though it was not available on first-year models. The reduction in fuel tank capacity from on the previous VFR800 down to on the VFR1200F has been the main complaint raised by motorcyclists, coupled with the new engine's higher-than- expected fuel consumption. On-road tests have shown a maximum distance from a single tank of less than , with some press reviewers running out of fuel after just .

The period from 1865 to 1895 saw a tremendous change in the fortunes of the black community following the elimination of slavery in the South. Immediately after the American Civil War, the federal government launched a program known as Reconstruction which aimed to rebuild the states of the former Confederacy. The federal programs also provided aid to the former slaves and attempted to integrate them into society as citizens. Both during and after this period, blacks gained a substantial amount of political power and many of them were able to move from abject poverty to land ownership. At the same time resentment of these gains by many whites resulted in an unprecedented campaign of violence which was waged by local chapters of the Ku Klux Klan, and in the 1870s it was waged by paramilitary groups like the Red Shirts and White League. In 1896, the Supreme Court ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson, , a landmark upholding \\"separate but equal\\" racial segregation as constitutional. It was a devastating setback for civil rights, as the legal, social, and political status of the black population reached a nadir. From 1890 to 1908, beginning with Mississippi, southern states passed new constitutions and laws disenfranchising most blacks and excluding them from the political system, a status that was maintained in many cases into the 1960s. Much of the early reform movement during this era was spearheaded by the Radical Republicans, a faction of the Republican Party. By the end of the 19th century, with disenfranchisement in progress to exclude blacks from the political system altogether, the so-called lily-white movement also worked to substantially weaken the power of remaining blacks in the party. The most important civil rights leaders of this period were Frederick Douglass (1818‚Äì1895) and Booker T. Washington (1856‚Äì1915). Reconstruction Freedmen voting in New Orleans, 1867 Reconstruction lasted from Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 to the Compromise of 1877.Allen C. Guelzo, Fateful Lightning: A New History of the Civil War and Reconstruction (2012) pp 445-513Eric Foner, A Short History of Reconstruction (1990)Mark Wahlgren Summers, The Ordeal of the Reunion: A New History of Reconstruction (2014) The major issues faced by President Abraham Lincoln were the status of the ex-slaves (called \\"Freedmen\\"), the loyalty and civil rights of ex-rebels, the status of the 11 ex-Confederate states, the powers of the federal government needed to prevent a future civil war, and the question of whether Congress or the President would make the major decisions. The severe threats of starvation and displacement of the unemployed Freedmen were met by the first major federal relief agency, the Freedmen's Bureau, operated by the Army.Paul A, Cimbala, The Freedmen's Bureau: Reconstructing the American South after the Civil War (2005) includes a brief history and primary documents Three \\"Reconstruction Amendments\\" were passed to expand civil rights for black Americans: the Thirteenth Amendment outlawed slavery; the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed equal rights for all and citizenship for blacks; the Fifteenth Amendment prevented race from being used to disfranchise men. Of more immediate usefulness than the constitutional amendments, were laws passed by Congress to allow the federal government, through the new Justice Department and through the federal courts to enforce the new civil rights Even if the state governments ignored the problem. These included the Enforcement Acts of 1870‚Äì71 and the Civil Rights Act of 1875.Robert J. Kaczorowski, \\"To Begin the Nation Anew: Congress, Citizenship, and Civil Rights after the Civil War.\\" American Historical Review 92.1 (1987): 45-68. in JSTORStephen Cresswell, \\"Enforcing the Enforcement Acts: The Department of Justice in Northern Mississippi, 1870‚Äì1890.\\" Journal of Southern History 53#3 (1987): 421-440. in JSTOR Ex-Confederates remained in control of most Southern states for more than two years, but that changed when the Radical Republicans gained control of Congress in the 1866 elections. President Andrew Johnson, who sought easy terms for reunions with ex-rebels, was virtually powerless; he escaped by one vote removal through impeachment. Congress enfranchised black men and temporarily suspended many ex-Confederate leaders of the right to hold office. New Republican governments came to power based on a coalition of Freedmen together with Carpetbaggers (new arrivals from the North), and Scalawags (native white Southerners). They were backed by the US Army. Opponents said they were corrupt and violated the rights of whites. State by state they lost power to a conservative-Democratic coalition, which gained control by violence and fraud of the entire South by 1877. In response to Radical Reconstruction, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) emerged in 1867 as a white-supremacist organization opposed to black civil rights and Republican rule. President Ulysses Grant's vigorous enforcement of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1870 shut down the Klan, and it disbanded. But from 1868 elections in many southern states were increasingly surrounded by violence to suppress black voting. Rifle clubs had thousands of members. In 1874, paramilitary groups, such as the White League and Red Shirts emerged that worked openly to use intimidation and violence to suppress black voting and disrupt the Republican Party to regain white political power in states across the South. Rable described them as the \\"military arm of the Democratic Party.\\"George C. Rable, But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction (2007) Reconstruction ended after the disputed 1876 election between Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes and Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden. With a compromise Hayes won the White House, the federal government withdrew its troops from the South, abandoning the freedmen to white conservative Democrats, who regained power in state governments.Edward L. Ayers, The Promise of the New South: Life After Reconstruction (1992) pp 3-54 Kansas exodus Following the end of Reconstruction, many blacks feared the Ku Klux Klan, the White League and the Jim Crow laws which continued to make them second-class citizens,. Motivated by important figures such as Benjamin \\"Pap\\" Singleton, as many as forty thousand Exodusters left the South to settle in Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado. This was the first general migration of blacks following the Civil War. In the 1880s, blacks bought more than of land in Kansas, and several of the settlements made during this time (e.g. Nicodemus, Kansas, which was founded in 1877) still exist today. Many blacks left the South with the belief that they were receiving free passage to Kansas, only to be stranded in St. Louis, Missouri. Black churches in St. Louis, together with Eastern philanthropists, formed the Colored Relief Board and the Kansas Freedmen's Aid Society to help those stranded in St. Louis to reach Kansas. One particular group was the Kansas Fever Exodus, which consisted of six thousand blacks who moved from Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas to Kansas. Many in Louisiana were inspired to leave the state when the 1879 Louisiana Constitutional Convention decided that voting rights were a matter for the state, not federal, government, thereby clearing the way for the disenfranchisement of Louisiana's black population. The exodus was not universally praised by African Americans; indeed, Frederick Douglass was a critic. Douglass felt that the movement was ill-timed and poorly organized. Political organization Hiram Revels (R-MS), Rep. Benjamin Turner (R-AL), Robert DeLarge (R-SC), Josiah Walls (R-FL), Jefferson Long (R-GA), Joseph Rainey and Robert B. Elliott (R-SC), 1872 Black men across the South obtained the right to vote in 1867, and joined the Republican Party. The typical organization was through the Union League, a secret society organized locally but promoted by the national Republican Party. Eric Foner reports: :By the end of 1867 it seemed that virtually every black voter in the South had enrolled in the Union League, the Loyal League, or some equivalent local political organization. Meetings were generally held in a black church or school.Eric Foner, \\"Black Reconstruction Leaders at the Grass Roots\\" in The Union Leagues promoted militia-like organizations in which the blacks banded together to protect themselves from being picked off one-by-one by harassers. Members were not allowed to vote the Democratic ticket.Steven Hahn, A Nation under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South, from Slavery to the Great Migration (2003) pp 174-84. The Union Leagues and similar groups came under violent assault from the KKK after 1869, and largely collapsed. Later efforts to revive the Union League failed. Black ministers provided much of the black political leadership, together with newcomers who had been free blacks in the North before the Civil War. Many cities had black newspapers that explained the issues and rallied the community.Richard H. Abbott, For Free Press and Equal Rights: Republican Newspapers in the Reconstruction South (2004) Factionalism In state after state across the South, a polarization emerged inside the Republican Party, with the blacks and their carpetbagger allies forming the Black-and-tan faction, which faced the all- white \\"lily-white\\" faction of local white scalawag Republicans.Eric Foner, Reconstruction: America's unfinished revolution, 1863‚Äì1877 (1988) pp 303-7 (The terms for the factions became common after 1888, a decade after the end of Reconstruction.)Paul D. Casdorph, \\"Lily-White Movement,\\" Handbook of Texas Online, accessed March 17, 2016 The blacks comprised the majority of Republican voters, but got a small slice of the patronage. They demanded more. Hahn explains the steps they took: :Black assertiveness....looked toward local political power and independence and began to construct a new political identity. Black laborers called white party leaders to account. They moved to control the county and district party machinery. They rejected white office- seekers and substituted black ones. They nominated all-black electoral slates.Hahn, A Nation under Our Feet (2003) p 253. The black-and-tan element usually won the factional battle, but as scalawags lost intra-party battles, many started voting for the conservative or Democratic tickets. The Republican Party became \\"blacker and blacker over time\\", as it lost white voters.Hahn, A Nation under Our Feet (2003) p 254. The most dramatic episode was the Brooks‚ÄìBaxter War in Arkansas in 1874.Michael W. Fitzgerald, \\"Republican Factionalism and Black Empowerment: The Spencer-Warner Controversy and Alabama Reconstruction, 1868‚Äì1880.\\" Journal of Southern History 64#3 (1998): 473-494. in JSTOR Michael Les Benedict says, \\"Every modern history of Reconstruction stresses its [factionalism] contribution to the collapse of southern Republicanism.\\" In terms of racial issues, Sarah Woolfolk Wiggins argues: :White Republicans as well as Democrats solicited black votes but reluctantly rewarded blacks with nominations for office only when necessary, even then reserving the more choice positions for whites. The results were predictable: these half-a-loaf gestures satisfied neither black nor white Republicans. The fatal weakness of the Republican Party in Alabama, as elsewhere in the South, was its inability to create a biracial political party. And while in power even briefly, they failed to protect their members from Democratic terror. Alabama Republicans were forever on the defensive, verbally and physically. Populism In 1894, a wave of agrarian unrest swept through the cotton and tobacco regions of the South. The most dramatic impact came in North Carolina, where the poor white farmers who comprised the Populist party formed a working coalition with the Republican Party, then largely controlled by blacks in the low country, and poor whites in the mountain districts. They took control of the state legislature in both 1894 and 1896, and the governorship in 1896. The state legislature lowered property requirements, expanding the franchise for the white majority in the state as well as for blacks. In 1895, the Legislature rewarded its black allies with patronage, naming 300 black magistrates in eastern districts, as well as deputy sheriffs and city policemen. They also received some federal patronage from the coalition congressman, and state patronage from the governor.Helen G. Edmonds, The Negro and Fusion Politics in North Carolina, 1894‚Äì1901 (1951). pp 97-136 Determined to regain power, white Democrats mounted a campaign based on white supremacy and fears about miscegenation. The white supremacy election campaign of 1898 was successful, and Democrats regained control of the state legislature. But Wilmington, the largest city and one with a black majority, elected a biracial Fusionist government, with a white mayor and two-thirds of the city council being whites. Democrats had already planned to overthrow the government if they lost the election here and proceeded with the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898. The Democrats ran blacks and Fusionist officials out of town, attacking the only black newspaper in the state; white mobs attacked black areas of the city, killing and injuring many, and destroying homes and businesses built up since the war.Andrea Meryl Kirshenbaum, \\"'The Vampire That Hovers Over North Carolina': Gender, White Supremacy, and the Wilmington Race Riot of 1898,\\" Southern Cultures 4#3 (1998) pp. 6-30 online An estimated 2100 blacks left the city permanently, leaving it a white-majority city. There were no further insurgencies in any Southern states that had a successful black-Populist coalition at the state level. In 1899, the white Democratic-dominated North Carolina legislature passed a suffrage amendment disenfranchising most blacks. They would largely not recover the power to vote until after passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 Economic and social conditions The great majority of blacks in this period were farmers. Among them were four main groups, three of which worked for white landowners: tenant farmers, sharecroppers, and agricultural laborers.Edward Royce, The Origins of Southern Sharecropping (2010).James R. Irwin and Anthony Patrick O'Brien. \\"Where Have All the Sharecroppers Gone?: Black Occupations in Postbellum Mississippi.\\" Agricultural History 72#2 (1998): 280-297. in JSTORRalph Shlomowitz, \\"'Bound' or 'Free'? Black Labor in Cotton and Sugarcane Farming, 1865‚Äì1880.\\" Journal of Southern History 50.4 (1984): 569-596. in JSTOR The fourth group were the blacks who owned their own farms, and were to some degree independent of white economic control.Sharon Ann Holt, \\"Making freedom pay: Freedpeople working for themselves, North Carolina, 1865‚Äì1900.\\" Journal of Southern History 60#2 (1994): 229-262. Urban elements The South had relatively few cities of any size in 1860, But during the war, and afterward, refugees both black and white flooded in from rural areas. The growing black population produced a leadership class of ministers, professionals, and businessmen.Foner, Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution (1988) pp 396-98.Howard N. Rabinowitz, Race Relations in the Urban South, 1865‚Äì1890 (1978) pp 61-96, 240-48. These leaders typically made civil rights a high priority. Of course, great majority of blacks in urban America were unskilled or low skilled blue- collar workers.James Illingworth, Crescent City Radicals: Black Working People and the Civil War Era in New Orleans. (PhD dissertation, University of California Santa Cruz, 2015) online. Historian August Meier reports: :From the late 1880s there was a remarkable development of Negro business ‚Äì banks and insurance companies, undertakers and retail stores.... It occurred at a time when Negro barbers, tailors caterers, trainmen, blacksmiths, and other artisans were losing their white customers. Depending upon the Negro market, the promoters of the new enterprises naturally upheld the spirit of racial self-help and solidarity.for detailed national report on the numbers of black businessmen and their finances in 1890, see Andrew F. Hilyer, \\"The Colored American in Business,\\" pp 13-22 in . Memphis Blacks in Memphis under attack, Harper's Weekly, 26 May 1866 During the war thousands of slaves escaped from rural plantations to Union lines, and the Army established a contraband camp next to Memphis, Tennessee. By 1865, there were 20,000 blacks in the city, a sevenfold increase from the 3,000 before the war.James G. Ryan, \\"The Memphis Riots of 1866: Terror in a Black Community during Reconstruction\\", Journal of Negro History (1977) 62#3: 243-257, at JSTOR. The presence of black Union soldiers was resented by Irish Catholics in the city, who competed with blacks for unskilled labor jobs. In 1866, there was a major riot with whites attacking blacks. Forty-five blacks were killed, and nearly twice as many wounded; much of their makeshift housing was destroyed.Art Carden and Christopher J. Coyne, \\"An Unrighteous Piece of Business: A New Institutional Analysis of the Memphis Riot of 1866\\", Mercatus Center, George Mason University, July 2010, accessed 1 February 2014 By 1870, the black population was 15,000 in a city total of 40,226. Robert Reed Church (1839‚Äì1912), a freedman, was the South's first black millionaire. He made his wealth from speculation in city real estate, much of it after Memphis became depopulated after the yellow fever epidemics. He founded the city's first black-owned bank, Solvent Savings Bank, ensuring that the black community could get loans to establish businesses. He was deeply involved in local and national Republican politics and directed patronage to the black community. His son became a major politician in Memphis. He was a leader of black society and a benefactor in numerous causes. Because of the drop in city population, blacks gained other opportunities. They were hired to the police force as patrolmen and retained positions in it until 1895, when imposed segregation forced them out.Christopher Caplinger, \\"Yellow Fever Epidemics\\", Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture (2010) Atlanta Atlanta, Georgia had been devastated in the war, but as a major railroad center it rebuilt rapidly afterwards, attracting many rural migrants. From 1860 to 1870 Fulton County (Of which Atlanta was the county seat) more than doubled in population, from 14,000 to 33,000. In a pattern seen across the South, many freedmen moved from plantations to towns or cities for work and to gather in communities of their own. Fulton County went from 20.5% black in 1860 to 45.7% black in 1870. University of West Virginia, Historical Census Browser, 1860 census Atlanta quickly became a leading national center of black education. The faculty and students provided a supportive environment for civil rights discussions and activism. Atlanta University was established in 1865. The forerunner of Morehouse College opened in 1867, Clark University opened in 1869. What is now Spelman College opened in 1881, and Morris Brown College in 1885. This would be one of several factors aiding the establishment of one of the nation's oldest and best-established African American elite in Atlanta. Philadelphia Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was one of the largest cities north of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line, and attracted many free blacks before the Civil War. They generally lived in the Southwark and Moyamensing neighborhoods. By the 1890s, the neighborhoods had a negative reputation in terms of crime, poverty, and mortality.Roger Lane, William Dorsey's Philadelphia and Ours: On the Past and Future of the Black City in America (1991). W.E.B. Du Bois, in his pioneering sociological study The Philadelphia Negro (1899), undermined the stereotypes with experimental evidence. He shaped his approach to segregation and its negative impact on black lives and reputations. The results led Du Bois to realize that racial integration was the key to democratic equality in American cities.Martin Bulmer, \\"W. E. B. Du Bois as a Social Investigator: The Philadelphia Negro, 1899,\\" in Martin Bulmer, Kevin Bales, and Kathryn Kish Sklar, eds. The Social Survey in Historical Perspective, 1880‚Äì1940 (1991) pp 170-88. Education The African-American community engaged in a long-term struggle for quality public schools. Historian Hilary Green says it \\"was not merely a fight for access to literacy and education, but one for freedom, citizenship, and a new postwar social order.\\"Hilary Green, Educational Reconstruction: African American Schools in the Urban South, 1865‚Äì1890 (Fordham UP, 2016) p 15 The black community and its white supporters in the North emphasized the critical role of education is the foundation for establishing equality in civil rights.Foner, Reconstruction pp 96-102, 144-46, 322 Anti-literacy laws for both free and enslaved black people had been in force in many southern states since the 1830s,Heather Andrea Williams, Self-Taught: African American Education in Slavery and Freedom (U of North Carolina Press, 2009) The widespread illiteracy made it urgent that high on the African-American agenda was creating new schooling opportunities, including both private schools and public schools for black children funded by state taxes. The states did pass suitable laws during Reconstruction, but the implementation was weak in most rural areas, and with uneven results in urban areas. After Reconstruction ended the tax money was limited, but local blacks and national religious groups and philanthropists helped out. Integrated public schools meant local white teachers in charge, and they were not trusted. The black leadership generally supported segregated all-black schools. The black community wanted black principals and teachers, or (in private schools) highly supportive whites sponsored by northern churches. Public schools were segregated throughout the South during Reconstruction and afterward into the 1950s. New Orleans was a partial exception: its schools were usually integrated during Reconstruction.Louis R. Harlan, \\"Desegregation in New Orleans Public Schools During Reconstruction.\\" American Historical Review 67#3 (1962): 663-675. in JSTOR In the era of Reconstruction, the Freedmen's Bureau opened 1000 schools across the South for black children using federal funds. Enrollments were high and enthusiastic. Overall, the Bureau spent $5 million to set up schools for blacks and by the end of 1865, more than 90,000 Freedmen were enrolled as students in public schools. The school curriculum resembled that of schools in the north. By the end of Reconstruction, however, state funding for black schools was minimal, and facilities were quite poor.Louis R. Harlan, Separate and Unequal: Public School Campaigns and Racism in the Southern Seaboard States, 1901‚Äì1915 (1958) pp 3-44 online. Many Freedman Bureau teachers were well-educated Yankee women motivated by religion and abolitionism. Half the teachers were southern whites; one-third were blacks, and one-sixth were northern whites. Black men slightly outnumbered black women. The salary was the strongest motivation except for the northerners, who were typically funded by northern organizations and had a humanitarian motivation. As a group, only the black cohort showed a commitment to racial equality; they were the ones most likely to remain teachers. Secondary and collegiate education Almost all colleges in the South were strictly segregated; a handful of northern colleges accepted black students. Private schools were established across the South by churches, and especially by northern denominations, to provide education after elementary schooling. They focused on secondary level (high school) work and provided a small amount of collegiate work.F. Erik Brooks, and Glenn L. Starks. Historically Black Colleges and Universities: An Encyclopedia (Greenwood, 2011) pp 11-132 describes the 66 colleges opened by 1900; most are still active today. Tuition was minimal, so national and local churches often supported the colleges financially, and also subsidized some teachers. The largest dedicated organization was the American Missionary Association, chiefly sponsored by the Congregational churches of New England.Joe M. Richardson, Christian Reconstruction: The American Missionary Association and Southern Blacks, 1861‚Äì1890 (1986). In 1900, Northern churches or organizations they sponsored operated 247 schools for blacks across the South, with a budget of about $1 million. They employed 1600 teachers and taught 46,000 students. At the collegiate level the most prominent private schools were Fisk University in Nashville, Atlanta University, and Hampton Institute in Virginia. A handful were founded in northern states. Howard University was a federal school based in Washington. In 1890, Congress expanded the land-grant plan to include federal support for state-sponsored colleges across the South. It required southern states with segregated systems to establish black colleges as land-grant institutions so that all students would have an opportunity to study at such places. Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute was of national importance because it set the standards for industrial education. Of even greater influence was Tuskegee Normal School for Colored Teachers, founded in 1881 by the state of Alabama and led by Hampton alumnus Booker T. Washington until his death in 1915. Elsewhere, in 1900 there were few black students enrolled in college-level work. Only 22 blacks graduated from college before the Civil War. Oberlin College in Ohio was a pioneer; it graduated its first black student in 1844. The number of black graduates rose rapidly: 44 graduated in the 1860s; 313 in the 1870s; 738 in the 1880s; 1126 in the 1890s; and 1613 in the decade 1900‚Äì1909. They became professionals; 54% became teachers; 20% became clergyman; others were physicians, lawyers or editors. They averaged about $15,000 in wealth. Many provided intellectual and organizational support for civic projects, especially civil rights activities at the local level. While the colleges and academies were generally coeducational, historians until recently largely ignored the role of women as students and teachers.Marybeth Gasman, \\"Swept under the rug? A historiography of gender and Black colleges.\\" American Educational Research Journal 44#4 (2007): 760-805. online Funding and philanthropy Funding for education for blacks in the South came from multiple sources. From 1860 to 1910, religious denominations and philanthropies contributed about $55 million. Blacks themselves through their churches, contributed over $22 million. The southern states spent about $170 million in tax dollars on black schools, and about six times that amount for white schools. Much philanthropy from rich Northerners focused on the education of blacks in the South. By far the largest early funding came from the Peabody Education Fund. The money was donated by George Peabody, originally of Massachusetts, who made a fortune in finance in Baltimore and London. He gave $3.5 million to \\"encourage the intellectual, moral, and industrial education of the destitute children of the Southern States.\\" The John F. Slater Fund for the Education of Freedmen was created in 1882 with $1.5 million for \\"Uplifting the legally emancipated population of the Southern states and their posterity.\\" After 1900, even larger sums came from Rockefeller's General Education Board, from Andrew Carnegie and from the Rosenwald Foundation.Eric Anderson and Alfred A. Moss, Dangerous donations: Northern philanthropy and southern Black education, 1902‚Äì1930 (1999). By 1900, the black population in the United States had reached 8.8 million; it was based overwhelmingly in the rural South. The school-age population was 3 million; half of them were in attendance. They were taught by 28,600 teachers, the vast majority of whom were black. Schooling (for both whites and blacks) was geared to teaching the three R's to younger children. There were only 86 high schools for blacks in the entire South, plus 6 in the North. These 92 schools had 161 male teachers, and 111 female teachers; they taught 5200 students in the high school grades. In 1900, there were only 646 blacks who graduated from high school. Religion Black churches played a powerful role in the civil rights movement. They were the core community group around which black Republicans organize their partisanship.Hahn, A Nation under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South, from Slavery to the Great Migration (2003) pp 230‚Äì34.John M. Giggie, After redemption: Jim Crow and the transformation of African American religion in the Delta, 1875‚Äì1915 (2007). [ DOI:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195304039.001.0001 online] The great majority of the black Baptist and Methodist churches rapidly became independent of the primarily white national or regional denominations after 1865. Black Baptist congregations set up their own associations and conventions.Kenneth Bailey, \\"The Post‚ÄìCivil War Racial Separations in Southern Protestantism,\\" Church History (1977) 46#4 pp 453-73 in JSTOR Their ministers became leading political spokesman for their congregations.C. Eric Lincoln and Lawrence H. Mamiya, The Black Church in the African American Experience (Duke University Press, 1990). Black women found their own space and church-sponsored organizations, ranging from choirs to missionary projects, to church schools and Sunday schools.Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, Righteous Discontent: The Women's Movement in the Black Baptist Church, 1880‚Äì1920 (1993). In San Francisco there were three black churches in the early 1860s. They all sought to represent the interests of the black community, provided spiritual leadership and rituals, organized help for the needy, and fought against attempts to deny blacks their civil rights.Philip M. Montesano, \\"San Francisco Black Churches in the Early 1860s\\" California Historical Quarterly (1973) 52#2 pp 145-152 The San Francisco black churches had decisive support from the local Republican Party. In the 1850s, the Democrats controlled the state and enacted anti-black legislation. Even though black slavery had never existed in California, the laws were harsh. The Republican Party came to power in the early 1860s, and rejected exclusion and legislative racism. Republican leaders joined black activists to win the legal rights, especially in terms of the right to vote, the right to attend public schools, equal treatment in public transportation, and equal access to the court system.Robert J. Chandler, \\"Friends in Time of Need: Republicans and Black Civil Rights in California during the Civil War Era\\" Arizona & the West (1982) 24#4 pp 319-340. in JSTOR Black Americans, once freed from slavery, were very active in forming their own churches, most of them Baptist or Methodist, and giving their ministers both moral and political leadership roles. In a process of self-segregation, practically all blacks left white churches so that few racially integrated congregations remained (apart from some Catholic churches in Louisiana). Four main organizations competed with each other across the South to form new Methodist churches composed of freedmen. They were the African Methodist Episcopal Church, founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, founded in New York City; the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church (which was sponsored by the white Methodist Episcopal Church, South), and the well-funded Methodist Episcopal Church (Northern white Methodists).Clarence Earl Walker, A Rock in a Weary Land: The African Methodist Episcopal Church During the Civil War and Reconstruction (1982) By 1871, the Northern Methodists had 88,000 black members in the South, and had opened numerous schools for them.William W. Sweet, \\"The Methodist Episcopal Church and Reconstruction,\\" Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society (1914) 7#3 pp. 147-165 in JSTOR at p. The blacks during Reconstruction Era were politically the core element of the Republican Party, and the ministers played a powerful political role. Their ministers could be more outspoken since they did not primarily depend on white support, in contrast to teachers, politicians, businessmen, and tenant farmers. Acting on the principle expounded by Charles H. Pearce, an AME minister in Florida: \\"A man in this State cannot do his whole duty as a minister except he looks out for the political interests of his people,\\" over 100 black ministers were elected to state legislatures during Reconstruction. Several served in Congress and one, Hiram Revels, in the U.S. Senate.Eric Foner, Reconstruction: America's unfinished revolution, 1863‚Äì1877 (1988) p 93 Methodists Bishop Henry McNeal Turner, AME leader in Georgia. The most well organized and active of the black churches was the African Methodist Episcopal church (AME). In Georgia, AME Bishop Henry McNeal Turner (1834‚Äì1915) became a leading spokesman for justice and equality. He served as a pastor, writer, newspaper editor, debater, politician, the chaplain of the Army, and a key leader of emerging black Methodist organization in Georgia and the Southeast. In 1863, during the Civil War, Turner was appointed as the first black chaplain in the United States Colored Troops. Afterward, he was appointed to the Freedmen's Bureau in Georgia. He settled in Macon, Georgia, and was elected to the state legislature in 1868 during Reconstruction. He planted many AME churches in Georgia. In 1880, he was elected as the first southern bishop of the AME Church after a fierce battle within the denomination. He fought Jim Crow laws.Stephen Ward Angell, Henry McNeal Turner and African-American Religion in the South (1992) Turner was the leader of black nationalism and promoted emigration of blacks to Africa. He believed in separation of the races. He started a back-to-Africa movement in support of the black American colony in Liberia.Edwin S. Redkey, \\"Bishop Turner's African Dream.\\" Journal of American History 54#2 (1967): 271-290. in JSTOR Turner built black pride by proclaiming \\"God is a Negro.\\"Andre E.

Johnson, The Forgotten Prophet: Bishop Henry McNeal Turner and the African American Prophetic Tradition (2012) There was a second all-black Methodist Church, the smaller African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (AMEZ). AMEZ remained smaller than AME because some of its ministers lacked the authority to perform marriages, and many of its ministers avoided political roles. Its finances were weak, and in general its leadership was not as strong as AME. However it was the leader among all Protestant denominations in ordaining women and giving them powerful roles.Canter Brown, Jr. and Larry Eugene Rivers, For a Great and Grand Purpose: The Beginnings of the AMEZ Church in Florida, 1864‚Äì1905 (2004). One influential leader was bishop James Walker Hood (1831‚Äì1918) of North Carolina. He not only created and fostered his network of AMEZ churches in North Carolina, but he also was the grand master for the entire South of the Prince Hall Masonic Lodge, a secular organization that strengthen the political and economic forces inside the black community.David G. Hackett, \\"The Prince Hall Masons and the African American Church: The Labors of Grand Master and Bishop James Walker Hood, 1831‚Äì1918.\\" Church History 69#4 (2000): 770-802. online In addition to all- black churches, many black Methodists were associated with the Northern Methodist Church. Others were associated with the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church CME; CME was an organ of the white Southern Methodist Church.Raymond R. Sommerville, An Ex-colored Church: Social Activism in the CME Church, 1870‚Äì1970 (Mercer University Press, 2004).

Brooks, \\"The Evolution of the Negro Baptist Church.\\" Journal of Negro History 7#1 (1922): 11-22. free in JSTOR rapidly forming state and regional associations. Unlike the Methodists, who had a hierarchical structure led by bishops, the Baptist churches were largely independent of each other, although they pooled resources for missionary activities, especially missions in Africa.Sandy Dwayne Martin, Black Baptists and African Missions: The Origins of a Movement, 1880‚Äì1915 (1989). The Baptist women worked hard to carve out a partially independent sphere inside the denomination.Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, Righteous discontent: The women's movement in the Black Baptist church, 1880‚Äì1920 (1993).Shirley Hamilton, \\"African American Women Roles In The Baptist Church: Equality Within the National Baptist Convention, USA.\\" (MA Thesis, Wake Forest University, 2009). online Urban churches The great majority of blacks lived in rural areas where services were held in small makeshift buildings. In the cities black churches were more visible. Besides their regular religious services, the urban churches had numerous other activities, such as scheduled prayer meetings, missionary societies, women's clubs, youth groups, public lectures, and musical concerts. Regularly scheduled revivals operated over a period of weeks reaching large, appreciative and noisy crowds.Howard N. Rabinowitz, Race Relations in the Urban South: 1865‚Äì1890 (1978), pp 208-213 Charitable activities abounded concerning the care of the sick and needy. The larger churches had a systematic education program, besides the Sunday schools, and Bible study groups. They held literacy classes to enable older members to read the Bible. Private black colleges, such as Fisk in Nashville, often began in the basement of the churches. Church supported the struggling small business community. Most important was the political role. Churches hosted protest meetings, rallies, and Republican party conventions. Prominent laymen and ministers negotiated political deals, and often ran for office until disfranchisement took effect in the 1890s. In the 1880s, the prohibition of liquor was a major political concern that allowed for collaboration with like- minded white Protestants. In every case, the pastor was the dominant decision- maker. His salary ranged from $400 a year to upwards of $1500, plus housing ‚Äì at a time when 50 cents a day was good pay for unskilled physical labor. Increasingly the Methodists reached out to college or seminary graduates for their ministers, but most Baptists felt that education was a negative factor that undercut the intense religiosity and oratorical skills they demanded of their ministers. After 1910, as blacks migrated to major cities in both the North and the South, there emerged the pattern of a few very large churches with thousands of members and a paid staff, headed by an influential preacher. At the same time there were many \\"storefront\\" churches with a few dozen members. Religious interpretation of history Deeply religious Southerners saw the hand of God in history, which demonstrated His wrath at their sinfulness, or His rewards for their suffering. Historian Wilson Fallin has examined the sermons of white and black Baptist preachers after the War. Southern white preachers said: > God had chastised them and given them a special mission ‚Äì to maintain > orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety, and traditional race relations. > Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, emancipation was a > historical tragedy and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's > favor. In sharp contrast, Black preachers interpreted the Civil War as: > God's gift of freedom. They appreciated opportunities to exercise their > independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and > dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. > Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations, and > conventions. These institutions offered self-help and Racial uplift, and > provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a > result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help > him; God would be their rock in a stormy land.Wilson Fallin Jr., Uplifting > the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama (2007) pp 52-53 Deteriorating status After 1880, legal conditions worsened for blacks, and they were almost powerless to resist.Howard N. Rabinowitz, \\"From exclusion to segregation: Southern race relations, 1865‚Äì1890.\\" Journal of American History 63#2 (1976): 325-350. in JSTOR The Northern allies in the Republican Party made an effort in 1890 to stop the deteriorating legal conditions by congressional legislation, but failed.Richard E. Welch, \\"The Federal Elections Bill of 1890: Postscripts and Prelude.\\" Journal of American History 52#3 (1965): 511-526. in JSTOR Every southern state passed codes requiring segregation in most public places. These persisted until 1964, when they were repealed by Congress. They are known as Jim Crow laws.Jane Elizabeth Dailey, Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore, and Bryant Simon, Jumpin'Jim Crow: Southern politics from civil war to civil rights (2000). The Southern states In the 1890‚Äì1905 period systematically reduced the number of blacks allowed to vote to about 2% through restrictions that skirted the 15th amendment, because they did not explicitly mention race. These restrictions included literacy requirements, voter-registration laws, and poll taxes. The U.S. Supreme Court in 1896 ruled in favor of Jim Crow in the case of Plessy vs. Ferguson, declaring that \\"separate but equal\\" facilities for blacks were legal under the 14th Amendment.J. Morgan Kousser, \\"Plessy v. Ferguson.\\" Dictionary of American History (2003) 6: 370-371. online Jim Crow laws and segregation Typically in the Black Codes across the seven states of the lower South in 1866 intermarriage was illegal. The new Republican legislatures in six states repealed the restrictive laws. After the Democrats returned to power, the restriction was reimposed. Not until 1967 did the United States Supreme Court, in Loving v. Virginia, , rule that all provisions like it in 16 states were unconstitutional. A major concern in the 1860s was how to draw the line between black and white in a society in which white men and black slave women had fathered numerous children. On the one hand, a person's reputation, as black or white, was usually decisive. On the other hand, most laws used a \\"one drop of blood\\" criteria to the effect that one black ancestor legally put a person in the Black category.Peter Wallenstein, \\"Reconstruction, Segregation, and Miscegenation: Interracial Marriage and the Law in the Lower South, 1865‚Äì1900.\\" American Nineteenth Century History 6#1 (2005): 57-76. Legal segregation was imposed only in schooling, and marriage, but that changed in 1880s when new Jim Crow laws mandated the physical separation of the races in public places.C. Vann Woodward, The strange career of Jim Crow (1955; 3rd ed. 1974) online From 1890 to 1908, southern states effectively disfranchised most black voters and many poor whites by making voter registration more difficult through poll taxes, literacy tests, and other arbitrary devices. They passed segregation laws and imposed second-class status on blacks in a system known as Jim Crow that lasted until the civil rights movement. Political activities on behalf of equality often centered around transportation issues, such as segregation on streetcars and railroads.Roger A. Fischer, \\"A pioneer protest: the New Orleans street-car controversy of 1867.\\" Journal of Negro History 53#3 (1968): 219-233. in JSTOR Beginning in the 1850s, lawsuits were filed against segregated streetcars and railroads in both the North and South.

The perpetrators were rarely or never arrested or convicted. Nearly 3,500 African Americans and 1,300 whites were lynched in the United States, mostly from 1882 to 1901. The peak year was 1892.see ; also Lynchings by year The frequency of lynchings and the episodes that sparked them varied from state to state as functions of local race relations. Lynching was higher in the context of worsening economic conditions for poor rural whites in heavily black counties, especially the low price of cotton in the 1890s.Elwood M. Beck and Stewart E. Tolnay. \\"The killing fields of the deep south: the market for cotton and the lynching of blacks, 1882‚Äì1930.\\" American Sociological Review (1990): 526-539. online Ida B. Wells (1862‚Äì1931) used her newspaper in Memphis Tennessee to attack lynchings; fearful for her life, she fled to the more peaceful precincts of Chicago in 1892 where she continued her one-person crusade.Jacqueline Jones Royster, ed., Southern horrors and other writings: The anti-lynching campaign of Ida B. Wells, 1892‚Äì1900 (1997), with primary and secondary documents. Nationally organized opposition to lynching began with the formation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909. There were 82 lynchings in 1909, and 10 in 1929.Robert L. Zangrando, The NAACP crusade against lynching, 1909‚Äì1950 (1980). Public images In the mainstream national and local media of the late 19th century, \\"Blacks were persistently stereotyped as criminals, savages, or comic figures. They were superstitious, lazy, violent, immoral, the butt of humor, and the source of danger to civilized life.\\" Eric Foner, \\"Introduction,\\" to Rayford W. Logan The Betrayal of the Negro, from Rutherford B. Hayes to Woodrow Wilson (1997). p. xiv online. Foner's 1997 introduction is paraphrasing the 1965 2nd edition of Logan's book. Booker T. Washington, the young college president from Alabama, became famous for his articulate challenges to the extremely negative stereotypes. According to his biographer Robert J. Norrell, Washington: :challenged the ideological positions of white Southerners on several fronts. His emphasis on black progress countered the white supremacists insistence on black degeneracy and criminality. His declaration of affection and loyalty to white Southerners defied the white nationalists believe that all blacks were ethnic enemies. The same time, Washington demonstrated to white Northerners that he and his fellow blacks were loyal, patriotic Americans, the rightful and deserving inheritors of Lincoln's interpretation of democratic values....African-Americans accepted the inherently competitive nature of American society and wanted only a fair chance to prove themselves. Leadership Much of the black political leadership in this area came from the ministry, and from Union Civil War veterans. The white political leadership featured veterans and lawyers. Ambitious young black men had a difficult time becoming lawyers, with few exceptions such as James T. Rapier, Aaron Alpeoria Bradley and John Mercer Langston. The upper class among the black population was largely mulatto and had been free before the war. During Reconstruction, 19 of the 22 black members of Congress were mulattoes. These wealthier, mixed-race blacks represented the majority of the leaders in the civil rights movement of the 20th century as well.Ronald W. Walters and Robert C. Smith, African American Leadership (1999) p 13. Hahn reports that the mulatto element held disproportionate power in the black political community in South Carolina and Louisiana.Hahn, A nation under our feet (2003) p 261. Many of the leaders, however, were also dark-skinned and former slaves.Howard N. Rabinowitz, Race, Ethnicity, and Urbanization: Selected Essays (1994), p. 183 Anna J. Cooper In 1892, Anna J. Cooper (1858‚Äì1964) published A Voice from the South: By A Woman from the South. It led to many speeches where she called for civil rights and woman's rights. A Voice from the South was one of the first articulations of Black feminism. The book advanced a vision of self- determination through education and social uplift for African-American women. Its central thesis was that the educational, moral, and spiritual progress of black women would improve the general standing of the entire African-American community. She says that the violent natures of men often run counter to the goals of higher education, so it is important to foster more female intellectuals because they will bring more elegance to education. This view was criticized by some as submissive to the 19th-century cult of true womanhood, but others label it as one of the most important arguments for black feminism in the 19th century. Cooper advanced the view that it was the duty of educated and successful black women to support their underprivileged peers in achieving their goals. The essays in A Voice from the South also touched on a variety of topics, from racism and the socioeconomic realities of black families to the administration of the Episcopal Church. Frederick Douglass, (1818‚Äì1895) Frederick Douglass Frederick Douglass (1818‚Äì1895), an escaped slave, was a tireless abolitionist before the war. He was an author, publisher, lecturer and diplomat afterward. His biographer argues: :The most influential African American of the nineteenth century, Douglass made a career of agitating the American conscience. He spoke and wrote on behalf of a variety of reform causes: women's rights, temperance, peace, land reform, free public education, and the abolition of capital punishment. But he devoted the bulk of his time, immense talent, and boundless energy to ending slavery and gaining equal rights for African Americans. These were the central concerns of his long reform career. Douglass understood that the struggle for emancipation and equality demanded forceful, persistent, and unyielding agitation. And he recognized that African Americans must play a conspicuous role in that struggle. Less than a month before his death, when a young black man solicited his advice to an African American just starting out in the world, Douglass replied without hesitation: \\"Agitate! Agitate!

The book was reissued in 2007 by St. Martin's Press with a new epilogue. Overview In Broad Daylight: A Murder in Skidmore, Missouri details the case of Ken Rex McElroy and his 21-year reign of terror throughout four counties in northwest Missouri, and the ultimate murder of McElroy, who was shot to death as he sat in his pickup truck on the main street of the town. Although there were more than 45 witnesses to the killing, and three grand juries considered the case, no one has been prosecuted for the killing. McElroy was indicted 21 times and acquitted 20 times for his life of crime - due in large part to the keen legal abilities of his Kansas City attorney Richard Gene McFadin. MacLean carefully details the background history of McElroy's childhood, early and later life, the endurance of the farmers and victims of McElroy's two decades of crime and terror, the failure of the criminal justice system to even superficially respond to McElroy's crime spree, the State of Missouri's bemused reaction to McElroy's death, the federal government's sudden interest in pursuing McElroy's death as a civil rights violation, and ultimately the skewed and misinformed coverage of the story by the national and international press and media. Critics have praised MacLean's lyrical depiction of rural, bucolic agricultural life in America's heartland - contrasted with a methodical and chilling description of the actions, causes and consequences of an ongoing nightmare of domestic terror. The book, as well as the movie, chronicles the story of McElroy‚Äôs crimes, his killing on July 10, 1981, and the alleged coverup by the town of the identity of the killers for more than 30 years.

Georgia Tech won by a score of 41‚Äì38 over top-ranked Virginia. The game concluded with a 37-yard field goal by Scott Sisson with seven seconds remaining. Georgia Tech went on to claim the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship and a share of the national championship. Background The conference matchup of two undefeated teams in midseason drew great national interest. The game was televised nationally by CBS with Jim Nantz handling play-by-play duties. The night before the game, vandals broke into Scott Stadium and set fire to the AstroTurf surface, burning a large midfield patch. The morning of the game, school officials questioned holding the game that day. Field personnel took spare turf from Virginia's baseball field and, after cutting out the burned sections, stitched it into the field as patches, enabling the game to be played as scheduled. Game recap Virginia took 10‚Äì0 lead in first quarter and had a 28‚Äì14 lead by halftime. However, Georgia Tech took advantage of two third quarter errors by Virginia to tie the game with score of 28‚Äì28. First, Tech scored four plays after recovering Virginia fumble on opening possession of third quarter. Then Georgia Tech linebacker Calvin Tiggle's interception at the Yellow Jackets 10-yard line stopped the ensuing Virginia drive. Georgia Tech gained field position for quarterback Shawn Jones' 26 yard scoring pass to wide receiver Emmett Merchant. Virginia's quarterback Shawn Moore then countered with long touchdown pass to Herman Moore, but GT running back William Bell tied the game again with score of 35‚Äì35 with 8-yard run late in third quarter. Tech took its first lead at 38‚Äì35 with Scott Sisson's 35-yard field goal kick with 7:17 minutes left. Virginia came back, obtaining first-and-goal achieved by 48 yard Moore-to-Moore pass. However, Virginia was penalized twice during next five plays, one nullifying tight end Aaron Mundy's touchdown catch. Virginia had to settle for Jake McInerney's tying field goal kick with 2:30 minutes left. The Yellow Jackets then went 56 yards in five plays to position Sisson for game- winning field goal with seven seconds left. Key plays in that drive included a Jones-to-Bell 23-yard pass, Bell's 13-yard run on which he fell on his own fumble, and Jones-to-wide receiver Greg Lester 15-yard pass completion. Georgia Tech quarterback Shawn Jones finished the game with 17 pass completions with 29 attempts for 257 yards and 2 touchdowns. Virginia quarterback Shawn Moore set a Virginia school record with 344 yards passing on 18 completions with 28 attempts. Effects Georgia Tech won its remaining games with Virginia Tech (also with a last second Sisson field goal), Wake Forest, and arch-rival Georgia to complete its fifth undefeated regular season in school history at 10‚Äì0‚Äì1. Virginia's season spiraled downhill from the game, with the Cavaliers going 1‚Äì3 to finish 8‚Äì4 and ranked #22 (AP) at the season's end. As ACC champion, Georgia Tech received the then-automatic bid to the 1991 Florida Citrus Bowl in Orlando against Nebraska. The Yellow Jackets dominated the Cornhuskers and won the game, 45‚Äì21. Georgia Tech finished the 1990 season with a record of 11‚Äì0‚Äì1 (eleven wins, no losses, and one tie), while the Colorado Buffaloes' record was 11‚Äì1‚Äì1, (eleven wins, one loss, and one tie). Georgia Tech tied North Carolina, 13‚Äì13, on October 20. Colorado tied Tennessee, 31‚Äì31, on August 26 and lost to Illinois, 23‚Äì22, on September 15 of that year. On October 6, Colorado controversially defeated Missouri, 33‚Äì31, on the game's last official play ‚Äì a \\"fifth down\\". Referees in that game lost count of the downs at the end of the game and inadvertently awarded the Buffaloes a fifth down and goal that resulted in the game's deciding touchdown. Due to its result ‚Äì and its effect on the 1990 national championship voting ‚Äì the 1990 Fifth Down Game has subsequently been viewed as one of the most controversial game endings in college football history. Plaque for Georgia Tech's national championship The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) governs American football as played by the teams representing the largest universities in the United States, termed Division I-A (Changed in 2006 to FBS ‚Äî Football Bowl Subdivision). Although smaller schools participate in formal NCAA tournaments to determine the national college football championships in Divisions I-AA, II, and III, Division I-A lacks such a tournament. During this time frame, before the College Football Playoff system was implemented, the \\"mythical national championship\\" of Division I-A was determined by polls of coaches and/or sportswriters. In the early 1990s, two such polls were regarded as authoritative: A poll of sportswriters conducted by the Associated Press (AP) called the AP Poll, and a poll of college football coaches conducted by the United Press International (UPI) called the Coaches Poll. These polls are conducted weekly during the football season, and the final polls (in January, after all bowl games) determine the championship. Because 1990 was a year in which no single college football team was undefeated, the Fifth Down controversy played a role in determining the Division I-A national champion for the 1990 season. The Missouri game caused Colorado's ranking to decline to 14th. However, most of the top teams lost in subsequent weeks, while the Buffaloes won their remaining games, including a 27‚Äì12 victory in Lincoln over #3 Nebraska and a squeaker over #5 Notre Dame. The Orange Bowl victory over Notre Dame was considered very controversial as well, due to a clipping call on Notre Dame on a punt return touchdown late in the game by Raghib Ismail when Colorado held a 10‚Äì9 lead, which would be the final score after Notre Dame was assessed the penalty. A blocked extra point by Colorado turned out to be the winning margin. Colorado would be crowned 1990 national champion in the AP poll of sportswriters. By one vote, Georgia Tech would be crowned 1990 national champion in the UPI poll of college football coaches, its fourth national title in school history (after 1917, 1928, and 1952). Tom Osborne, then Nebraska head coach (the only school that played both schools that season), cast the deciding vote in favor of the Yellow Jackets.

San Isidro, Para√±aque City, Metro Manila, Philippines. It was founded by Atty. Ambrosio R. Valdez Sr., for whom the school's gymnasium hall was named. History PATTS College of Aeronautics was founded in 1969 as the Philippine Air Transport and Training Services. The unfavorable investment climate at the time constrained the founders to drop the first objective and only organize and operate an educational institution, intended to provide professional and technical training to its clients. The school started with two-year airframe mechanic and two-year power plant mechanic courses. In its second year of operation, the two-year communication technician course (avionics) and the four-year aeronautical engineering course were added. Under the stewardship of its board of directors, the school rose to higher levels of credit and educational standards. Its BS Aeronautical Engineering graduates regularly topped the PRC‚Äôs Licensure Board Examination for Aeronautical Engineers from its inception in 1983. In 1989, the school became an accredited college. PATS School of Aeronautics grew into a larger educational institution known as PATTS College of Aeronautics, adapting the slogan ‚ÄúFly high, your future is in the skies‚Äù. In 2005, the school's greatest transformation coincided with PATTS' 36th anniversary. PATTS was relocated from its old site at Domestic Airport Road, Pasay City to its new home at Lombos Avenue, San Isidro, Para√±aque City. Educational success encouraged the Board of Directors to be more forward-thinking in their management of the school. Following the 36th Anniversary, management announced a new diversification. PATTS would offer non-aviation related programs responsive to industry needs, starting with B.S. Hotel and Restaurant Management as of the 2005‚Äì2006 school year. Feasibility studies are being conducted to determine what other curricular offerings are viable. Graduate Studies is also a possibility, leading to university status. Academic program PATTS course offerings are recognized by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) certifies that PATTS is an Aircraft Maintenance School, rated for Airframe and Power Plant. Aircraft frames and power plants are available for PATTS students to work on, dismantle and assemble in the laboratories under the direct supervision of duly licensed personnel. PATTS graduates are also required to undergo on-the-job training with aviation companies such as Philippine Airlines, Air Philippines, Cebu Pacific, Philippine Aerospace Development Corporation and the Philippine Air Force. This training prepares graduates of PATTS for integration into the industry. Old Patts Campus Computer laboratory in the 70s Courses offered A student inspects a mini gas turbine engine.

He was nicknamed \\"Son\\" or \\"Sonny\\" by his family, to differentiate him from his father, Andrew Lewis Sr. Family He is the son of former soldier and businessman Andrew Lewis Sr. (whose photo is used on Lewis' \\"Dignified\\" CD cover) and his wife, Frances Frano. He has one sister, Michele. Career Although not coming from a musical family, he was influenced by his cousin Carl Lewis, who exposed him to Delta and Chicago blues at a very young age. Lewis started playing guitar in 1964, studying under the R&B; guitarist Dennis Gorgas, and later with Danny Kalb, founder and leader of The Blues Project. During that time, Lewis performed with The Avlons (on bass guitar) and fronted The Strangers and The Love Merchants (vocals and rhythm guitar) performing covers of \\"Blue-eyed Soul\\", Motown and STAX hits. By late 1968, Lewis had begun visiting the folk and blues clubs of New York City's Greenwich Village. After witnessing a performance by John P. Hammond at Gerde's Folk City, he was determined to begin performing as a solo acoustic performer. In early 1969, Lewis became a regular fixture at \\"open mics\\" and \\"hootenanys\\" in and around the New York/New Jersey area, singing and playing acoustic blues guitar in the Delta and Piedmont styles. These performances resulted in several paid gigs as an opening or support act at The Coffeehouse at Fairleigh Dickenson University in New Jersey. During that period, Lewis opened shows for The Manhattan Transfer (when they were a folk group), comedian Chris Rush, Melissa Manchester, J.F. Murphy and Free Flowing Salt. In 1974, Lewis re-incorporated electric guitar into his repertoire and shortly thereafter formed The Son Lewis Blues Band, which has featured members of Mink DeVille, Exuma, Rockett 88, Impact and The Ricki Lee Jones Band. Since 1979, he has appeared on numerous albums, primarily for New Jersey's Silk City RecordsSilk City Records and has appeared on numerous compilation albums. In 1996, he was selected by The Skyland Blues Society to represent Northern New Jersey in the 'International Blues Competition', held by the Blues Foundation in Memphis, Tennessee. He has also appeared on a number of local television programs and has over 25 live radio broadcasts to his credit. Songwriter Long considered \\"an interpreter\\", Lewis originally wrote ballads in the late 1960s but refused to perform them in his live performances. He began writing blues and roots-based songs again in 2001, and now focuses extensively on original material for his recorded works. His CD Cadillac Rhythm, released in 2008, featured all original songs written by Lewis, or co-written with his keyboardist John Pittas. Lewis' original material was again featured prominently in his 2011 recording \\"Laws of Nature\\". Lewis has also returned to writing in other genres outside of Blues and his instrumental song \\"For Skylar\\" has been used by several broadcast radio stations as a music bed for public service announcements. Movie scores Son Lewis contributed 19 original jazz compositions to Director Mike Lordi for use in the 2013 independent film Love in a Coffeeshop and four Blues tunes for Lordi's 2011 film The Big Weekend. He has also contributed numerous pieces for television, radio and internet advertisements. Narrations, Voice Overs and Stage Lewis has performed on the stage, appearing in \\"John Brown's Body\\" (as Clay Wingate), \\"Thurber Carnival\\" and \\"Oh Dad, Poor Dad\\". He has done voice overs for various commercial advertising agencies as well as lent his voice to \\"The Laughing Bunny\\" Easter Toy.

The work describes the spirits of a rural landscape that are connected to Greek mythology. The images serve to discuss aspects of British life along with promoting the freedom of conscience for the British people. The collection as a whole received many attacks by contemporary critics, but later commentators viewed the poem favourably. Background During the end of 1816, Hunt began to put together his ideas for a poem that would become The Nymphs.Roe 2005 p. 271 While working on the poem in 1817, Hunt was staying at the Albion House in Marlow and spent much of his time in the garden or walking through the countryside.Roe 2005 p. 299-300 During this time, he heard stories of Francis Dashwood and his Hell-Fire Club, which its members spent their time drinking and pursuing women.Roe 2005 p. 300 The poem was included in Hunt's collection of poems called Foliage,Roe 2005 p. 310 which was published in early 1818. The Nymphs was the first poem in the book.Blunden 1930 pp. 126-127, 133 When Hunt republished The Nymphs in his collected works, he did not republish portions of the poem possibly because of the themes not matching those found in his other works.Blainey 1985 p. 104 Poem The poem begins with a discussion on health and philosophy:Roe 2005 p. 301 the motes of Bigotry's sick eye, Or the blind feel of false Philosophy The poem describes the nymphs that were part of the landscape:Roe 2005 p. 300 Those are the Naiads, who keep neat The banks from sedge, and from the dull- dropp'd feet Of cattle that break down the fibrous mould. They snap the selfish nets, that, overbold Cross the whole river, and might trip the keels Of summer boats. The poem ends with a command that the reader should spread the message of the poem:Roe 2005 p. 301 Go tell our song To such as hang their pale home-withered heads For winter-time, and do our kindness wrong: And say, that they might bear, The more they know us, the moist weight of air Themes Although supposedly located in Thessaly, the description used in the poem is based on the landscape surrounding Marlow and the Thames river valley. In addition to the landscape, elements of the Hell-Fire Club enter into the poem. These British based subjects are combined with Greek mythology along with creatures that Hunt made up on his own. All of the creatures are related to Pan and natural religion that was based in liberty. In doing so, the poem discusses British society and how to fix the problems in the world. In particular, Hunt attacked the established Anglican faith and problems related to the religion. While working on the poem, Hunt defended John Wright against claims that the Unitarian minister was promoting blasphemy. The poem serves to defend the freedom of conscience while attacking the intolerant people.Roe 2005 pp. 300-302 The work as a whole was a parallel to John Keats's Endymion written at the same time, and both Keats and Hunt were influenced in their understanding of paganism by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Wallenstein.Blunden 1930 pp. 133-134 Critical response The poem, along with the collection Foliage, was attacked by critics. In particular, the Literary Gazette claimed that the work fell short of the sublime aspects that were part of what they labelled \\"true poetry\\". In the only review that was accepting of the collection, the Eclectic Review claimed that the poem described the \\"demonology of Paganism\\" as a possible reality.Roe 2005 p. 310 However, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Hunt's friend and fellow poet, claimed that the work was \\"truly poetical, in the intense and emphatic sense of the word.\\"Roe 2005 qtd p. 311 In 1930, Edmund Blunden stated that the poem was \\"finer than any of Hunt's previous poetry, and though free and easy in form yet sustained by a strong philosophical design.Blunden 1930 pp. 133-134 Ann Blainey, in 1985, argued that the poem \\"may well be one of Hunt's best poems [...] The poem has a sensitive joy in nature which owed much to Shelley's vigorous poetical and sexual outlook, and a sensuousness more open and genuine than Hunt would ever express again.\\"Blainey 1985 p. 103 Notes References * Blainey, Ann.

One of the first Hawaiians to read and write and sponsor a church, she made a dramatic display of her new faith which made her the subject of a poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson.  Ancestry  Every high chief in the Hawaiian Islands was related to her, including Kamehameha I, who was both her second cousin and her third cousin through different relations. Her ancestors included royalty of Kaua ªi, royalty of Maui and the royalty of Hawai ªi island. The name probably comes from ka pi'o lani meaning \\"heavenly arch\\" in the Hawaiian language. The father of Kapi ªolani was Keawemauhili, who was high chief (Ali ªi Nui) of the district of Hilo on the island of Hawai ªi. She was probably born there about 1781. Keawemauhili was half-brother to Kalani ª≈çpu ªu who was king of the island during the fatal visit of Captain James Cook in 1779. Her mother was his second wife Kekikipa ªa, daughter of Kame ªeiamoku, who had fled with from her first husband Kamehameha I to Hilo in order to marry Keawemauhili. She was a first cousin of Kiwala ªo, the young king of the island who was killed when Kamehameha I first came to power at the battle of Moku ª≈çhai in July 1782.  Life  The  ªahu ªula (feather cape, reserved for royalty) of Kapiolani, Bishop Museum After a quiet period of a few years, the civil wars continued in 1790. Her father Keawemauhili joined forces with Kamehameha, but was then killed by his nephew Ke≈çua Kuahu ªula. The young Kapi ªolani was thrown in the bushes by her caretakers as the army fled, but was saved and sent to live with her aunt Akahi in the village of Kealia in the Kona District near the religious centers on Kealakekua Bay. She was instructed in the Hawaiian religion and its strict social rules known as kapu. For example, women were not allowed to eat bananas. Once she sent a servant boy to secretly get some for her to taste. When the local priest found out, she was spared but the boy was sacrificed. She was still a young girl when the Vancouver Expedition arrived at Kealakekua Bay in 1793 and 1794. This time, through interpreters, Hawaiians could start to learn about other cultures. In 1805, an epidemic known as mai oku'u broke out. Much of the royalty, including Kamehameha I and Kapi ªolani got very sick. She might have briefly married High Chief Chief Kuakini, who later became the royal governor of the island. She became known as having liaisons with several members of the ruling class. The death of Kamehameha in 1819 put the kingdom into turmoil. The period known as  ªAi Noa (literally, \\"free eating\\") after one king's death was traditionally followed by the new king imposing similar Kapu rules. However, this time, powerful women such as Queen Ka ªahumanu (then Regent), Ke≈çp≈´olani (mother of the new King Kamehameha II), along with Kapi ªolani, were not satisfied with the old ways. Chief Keaoua Kekuaokalani attempted to gather followers of the old system at the temple near where she was living, but he was defeated at the battle of Kuamo ªo. American Christian Missionaries led by Rev. Asa Thurston arrived only a few months later, in March 1820 at Kailua-Kona about to the north. They had already embarked on the ship Thaddeus before Kamehameha's death. They describe meeting Kapi ªolani for the first time as she was sunbathing while applying coconut oil, \\"basking in the noonday tropical sun, like a seal\\". They also describe finding her \\"with her two husbands, all nearly nude, and in a state of beastly intoxication\\". Kapi ªolani and Naihe, at the rear of the funeral procession of Queen Ke≈çp≈´olani, 1823. She followed the missionaries to Honolulu in 1821, where a school had been set up. She quickly learned to read and write, and found that the new religion might mean more than freely eating bananas. She settled into a monogamous relationship with her husband Naihe (her stepbrother, since her father married his mother). She returned to Kealakekua Bay in the spring of 1823, but wanted to continue her education. She would send boats up to Kailua to pick up a preacher for Sunday services. In the summer of 1823 William Ellis toured the island to determine locations for mission stations, and identified Kapi ªolani and Naihe as \\"friends and patrons of missionary efforts\\". Because of this, he suggested the village of Ka ªawaloa at the north end of Kealakekua Bay as one of the first sites for a church. Later on the tour, after a long journey to the volcano Kƒ´lauea with little food, Ellis eagerly ate the wild berries they found growing there. The berries of the  ª≈åhelo (Vaccinium reticulatum) plant were considered sacred to the goddess Pele, who lived in the volcano according to Hawaiian mythology. Traditionally prayers and offerings to Pele were always made before eating the berries. The volcano crater was an active lava lake, which the natives feared was a sign that Pele was not pleased with the violation. In February 1824 Kapi ªolani constructed a thatched house about by for use as a church, and Rev. James Ely starting using it for services in April. Although other leaders had tolerated the missionaries, this was the first time a major noble had constructed a building specifically for them.  Challenging Pele  Molten lava in Kƒ´lauea Book illustration of Kapi ªolani defying Pele In the fall of 1824 she decided to show her people a dramatic demonstration of her faith. Although many other temples were destroyed by this time, the native Hawaiians continued to honor the goddess Pele at Kƒ´lauea, which was still active. Following the example of the Ellis trip, she traveled to the volcano. Because of the sharp, barren lava rock on the way, it would have been much faster to use canoes. She set out on foot, gathering a large crowd as she walked about sixty miles. Rev. Goodrich from the Hilo mission met her at the volcano near the end of December. The guardians of Pele warned that if she did not make the customary offerings, she would certainly be killed. Many remembered when their relatives were wiped out by an explosive eruption in 1790. She said a Christian prayer instead of the traditional one to Pele, and descended about 500 feet down into the main vent of Halema ªuma ªu. There was a molten lava lake at the time, but no eruption and she survived intact, with only bruises on her feet from the long journey. This event has become legendary at the volcano. The tale probably was enhanced through time, often involving the throwing of stones into the pit or eating  ª≈åhelo berries. In July 1825, Admiral Lord Byron (cousin of the famous poet) brought back the bodies of Kamehameha II and Queen KamƒÅmalu who had died in England. Naihe traveled to Honolulu and helped negotiate the peaceful transition in which the 11-year-old Prince Kauikeaouli would be named Kamehameha III, but power would be held again by Queen Ka ªahumanu. Naihe led Byron back to Kealakekua Bay, where his crew looted many artifacts from the temples that remained in the area. In October 1825 Kapi ªolani was baptized. Commanding the respect of the people, she kept order in her districts of south Kona and Ka ª≈´, and often traveled to help the less fortunate. This was very different than the strict isolation of the upper classes that was the tradition in ancient Hawaii. She is described as not being \\"hard and puritanical\\" but rather having a \\"nature-loving spirit\\". Rev. Samuel Ruggles became pastor of the church in 1828. He found the shoreline areas too hot, so Kapi ªolani offered some land at a higher elevation and a few miles inland to build a house. It was near the present town of Captain Cook, an area formerly used to grow taro called Kuapehu. visited Kealakekua Bay in 1829 and she hosted the officers at her home. The ship chaplain, Rev. Charles Stewart, was a former missionary to Hawaii who had met Kapi ªolani in 1823. In 1829, she was saddened to find the destruction of the temples included desecrating the bones of her ancestors at the Pu ªuhonua o H≈çnaunau. She removed the remains of the old chiefs and hid them in the Pali Kapu O Ke≈çua cliffs. She then ordered this last temple to be destroyed. The bones were kept hidden safely until they were moved to the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii in 1858. Naihe died December 29, 1831, and Kapi ªolani moved uphill to live near the missionaries. She became friends with Persis Goodale Thurston Taylor (daughter of Asa and Lucy Goodale Thurston) who sketched a silhouette in 1839. She started a garden, experimenting with various plants, including guava, oranges, and coffee. This area is now known as the center for growing Kona coffee. In 1839 missionary Cochran Forbes started to build a massive stone church on more of her land. The site was kepulu, just uphill from the current village of Napo ªopo ªo, since the village of Ka ªawaloa was mostly abandoned. In about 1840 she developed breast cancer. In March 1841 she traveled to Honolulu for surgery by Dr. Gerrit P. Judd (without anesthetic). She recovered, and was preparing to leave when she died on May 5, 1841. She was buried in a royal plot in Honolulu.  Legacy  The massive stone church would fall into ruin, but be rebuilt several times. Now known as Kahikolu Church, it is still in use today. The \\"Chiefess Kapi ªolani Elementary School\\" is named for her. As of 2008 enrollment was 402 students. The school is located at 966 Kilauea Avenue in Hilo, Hawaii. The story of Kapi ªolani became very popular in the middle of the 19th century. The British author Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809‚Äì1892) wrote a poem about her, published after his death by his son. Verse IV, for example reads: > Long as the lava-light > Glares from the lava-take, > Dazing the starlight; > Long as the silvery vapor in daylight, > Over the mountain > Floats, will the glory of Kapiolani be mingled with either on Hawa-i-ee. > Her nephew K≈´hi≈ç Kalaniana ªole named his daughter after her, who became known as Queen Kapi ªolani (1834‚Äì1899) when her husband became King KalƒÅkaua. This namesake would in turn lend her name to several notable institutions in Hawaii.

Foundation of the district  Canyons District was created after residents in the communities of Alta, Cottonwood Heights, Draper, Midvale and Sandy voted in 2007 to leave the Jordan School District, which was the largest district in the state at the time. David Doty, a former high school Spanish teacher, and Assistant Commissioner and Director of Policy Studies for the Utah System of Higher Education, was chosen by the new board of education to be the district's first superintendent. On June 30, 2013, Doty resigned his position to join a Utah-based education consulting firm. He was replaced July 1, 2014, by Dr. James Briscoe, a veteran educator with 12 years of experience as a superintendent of schools in Illinois. Briscoe, who, in his tenure has also filled the roles of high school principal, assistant principal and math and social studies teacher, was chosen at the conclusion of an exhaustive national search, which included three months of community input meetings. Ginger Rhode, who served as Canyons' Deputy Superintendent for Student Achievement and the Chief Academic Officer since November 2008, acted as interim superintendent from July 1, 2013, to July 1, 2014, when she retired. In July, 2019, Dr. Rick Robins was appointed as CSD's new superintendent, replacing Briscoe, who retired. Robins came to Canyons from Juab School District, where he was superintendent for six years.  Canyons School District Board of Education  The Canyons Board of Education is composed of seven elected community leaders who are responsible for establishing education policy for the children in the district. The current members of the board are: * Nancy Tingey, who represents District 3, was elected in November 2012. In January 2019, she was chosen to be the first woman to serve as President of the Canyons School District Board of Education. In 2017, she served as the President of the Utah School Boards Association and in 2018 she served as the association's legislative liaison. Tingey earned a Bachelor of Science from Brigham Young University and has been an active parent volunteer in public schools for more than 20 years. * Amber Shill, who represents District 2, was elected in November 2014. Shill currently serves as Vice President of the Board. She graduated from Brigham Young University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Finance and, for the past 20 years, has volunteered in Canyons District schools, serving on multiple districtwide committees and in leadership capacities on School Community Councils. * Steve Wrigley, who represents District 5, was elected in November 2010. Wrigley currently serves as Vice President of the Board. He has a master's degree in Rehabilitation Counseling and a Bachelor of Science in Criminology Counseling from California State University, Fresno. He teaches community Marriage Education classes and is a Certified Public Manager. * Mont Millerberg, who represents District 1, was elected in November 2016. He previously served on the inaugural Canyons School Board from 2008-2012, during which time he played an instrumental role in establishing the Canyons Education Foundation. Millerberg has served on school community councils at Hillcrest and Union, and worked as a Certified Public Accountant before entering retirement to enjoy time with his family. * Clareen Arnold, who represents District 4, was elected in November 2014. She has a master's degree in Education in Administration and Curriculum Development from Azusa Pacific University, and two Bachelor of Science degrees. She also earned an associate degree in Accounting from Salt Lake Community College. *Amanda Oaks, who represents District 6, took office in January 2019. Oaks is a classically- trained musician who attended Brigham Young University on a full academic and music scholarship as she received her Bachelor of Arts in Viola Performance. She also earned a law degree and has worked as a substitute teacher in Canyons' Chinese Dual Language Immersion classrooms. * Chad Iverson, who represents District 7, was elected in November 2012. He earned an MBA from the University of Chicago, and graduated summa cum laude from Brigham Young University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science.  Student achievement  Canyons District students are known for their accomplishments, which span from academic and athletic state championships to scholarships. In 2016, graduating students earned $34.8 million in scholarship offerings and won nine state championships. The graduating class had 12 National Merit Semifinalists and 1,349 students earned advanced or honors diplomas, which require students to achieve exemplary scores on the ACT college entrance exam, as well as take additional credits in higher-level mathematics and science and world languages. Since 2010, 1,047 students in the district's program at the Utah State Prison have earned high school diplomas. The district earned a place on the 2012 College Board's Advanced Placement Honor Roll for student involvement in AP classes. Two of the district's high schools have been included on Newsweek magazine's list of the best high schools in the country. In 2012, Quail Hollow Elementary School became a National Blue Ribbon School, one of three in Utah. During the same year, Midvale Middle School became an International Baccalaureate World School, making it one of two middle schools in Utah with the authorization to offer the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme. The district also offers an online virtual high school, magnet programs to support advanced learners and dual immersion language programs in Mandarin Chinese-English, French-English and Spanish-English. Facilities and operations On June 22, 2010, voters approved a $250 million, tax-neutral bond to finance improvements and new construction in the district. In Fall 2016, construction was completed on Butler Elementary, preserving elements of the school's deep history. A completely rebuilt Mount Jordan Middle School opened in 2015 and new schools Corner Canyon High school and Draper Park Middle school in Draper, as well as Butler Middle school in Cottonwood Heights, were completed in 2013. Midvale Elementary school in Midvale was completed in 2012. Albion Middle School in Sandy was completely renovated in 2012. Construction is currently underway at Midvale Middle School, with completion anticipated in Fall 2017. Other renovations and upgrades have also taken place, including seismic upgrades, playground updates, cooling system updates and accommodation for ninth-graders in the existing Brighton and Hillcrest high schools as part of a grade re- alignment.Canyons district bond barely passes. The Salt Lake Tribune. June 24, 2010. Winters, Rosemary. At Alta High School, crews added a new entrance; new classrooms; tennis courts; art, robotics, and engineering labs; a Healthy Lifestyles Center equipped with new cardio and exercise machines; a wrestling room; and new sprinkling systems and landscaping. Newly completed and renovated schools feature details like an emphasis on natural light, state-of- the-art computer labs, large auditoriums, and gymnasiums with elevated tracks. Several schools also have newly built media centers with TV production studios and green-screen capability. Corner Canyon High School features a 4,700-seat sports complex, as well as science and computer labs. Canyons District maintains more than 5 million square feet in its buildings, nearly 12,000 computers with an average age of about three years, about 350 acres of lawn, and 167 buses.  Outreach and partnerships  Canyons School District receives support from volunteers and the local community through partnerships that include cities, businesses and nearby colleges. These entities work with the Canyons School District Education Foundation, an independent non-profit organization of volunteer business leaders in the community who donate their time and allocate resources to the district to improve educational opportunities for students.  Fiscal accountability  Canyons District also established high financial standards and accountability to the public. It received awards for budget excellence in 2010, 2011 and 2012 and successfully campaigned for a $250 million bond to build and renovate schools with the highest possible bond rating from Moody's Investors Service. The district regularly partners with civic and business leaders and maintains an active volunteer program.  Assets, bonds and debt  Canyons School District and Jordan School District entered an arbitration process to divide assets between the two districts after Canyons' creation. \\"Arbitration ruling issued in Jordan School District split\\". KSL. March 18, 2009. As a result of that process, Canyons School District received 41 percent of the overall assets, based on student population. Canyons also agreed to pay 58 percent of a $281 million bond debt ‚Äî incurred in 2003 by the formerly combined district ‚Äî until 2022. In 2010, voters approved a $250 million bond to build or rebuild aging schools and add cooling systems to schools that did not have cooling systems. In total, 13 schools were remodeled or rebuilt, including Corner Canyon High School, Mount Jordan Middle, Midvale Elementary, Midvale Middle, Butler Elementary, Butler Middle, Alta View elementary, Albion Middle and Draper Park Middle. The last remodeling was finished in 2018.

It was co-produced with the National Geographic Channel. Ed Wardle, an accomplished extreme photographer, created and filmed the series. Throughout the adventure, during which he never saw another human, Ed tweeted daily outgoing-only messages about his experiences. The goal was to survive solo for three summer months. The series was produced by Dick Colthurst of Tigress Productions, Bristol. It was commissioned by Tanya Shaw of Channel 4, London. The multiplatform aspect of the project (including the use of Twitter) was commissioned by Adam Gee at Channel 4. Episodes In Episode 1, he was dropped off by an amphibious aircraft, along with essential supplies and rations, at Dog Pack Lake in the Yukon Territory of Canada. He found a few fish, greens, and some berries, and managed to kill, butcher, and eat a porcupine, but quickly lost weight, and his heartrate dropped to as low as 28 bpm. Episode 2 focused on his trek to a potentially more food-laden site at Tincup Lake which, although only about ten miles away, took nearly four days to reach, because he traversed that large body of water, negotiating steep and brushy terrain, in order to locate his camp near the stream emptying from the far shore, where salmon would hopefully be found. He often commented about the serene natural beauty of the lacustrine and montane scenery. For psychological enhancement, he also tried meditation, but it appeared to provide little or no benefit. During Episode 3, he attempted to find sustenance at Tincup, following the outflowing stream downhill in search of salmon. During the expedition, he saw several moose, a caribou, and ducks, but Canadian law did not permit him to kill any of them. Tincup proved to be even worse than Dog Pack. Although he continued to check nearly a score of rabbit snares, only one or two rabbits were ever collared. He shot another porcupine, but worried that a bear might smell the flesh and attack him. He was frequently overtaken by trepidation toward bears. Although he managed to capture a few trout and graylings at Tincup, and found some blueberries, he never spotted one salmon. The most serious issue, however, may have been his loneliness, which caused him to cry at some point in all three episodes. The combination of social isolation and undernourishment, as he ran out of rations at approximately day 50 of the outing, finally forced him to call for a rescue plane to take him to Whitehorse, where he reflected on the trip in the comparative luxury of a hotel room.

They were the first pottery using people of Ontario north of the Trent-Severn Waterway. The complex is named after the former unincorporated community of Laurel, Minnesota. Hopewell Interaction Sphere The Hopewell Exchange system began in the Ohio and Illinois River Valleys about 300 BCE. The culture is referred to more as a system of interaction among a variety of societies than as a single society or culture. Hopewell trading networks were quite extensive, with obsidian from the Yellowstone area, copper from Lake Superior, and shells from the Gulf Coast. The construction of ceremonial mounds was an important feature of the Laurel Complex, as it was for the Point Peninsula Complex and other Hopewell cultures. Sites were usually located at rapids or falls where sturgeon come to spawn and ceremonies may have coincided with this yearly event. The mounds and the artifacts contained within them indicate contact with the Adena and Hopewell of the Ohio River valley. It is unknown if the contact was direct or indirect.  Kay-Nah-Chi-Wah-Nung  The first mound- builders in what is now the Kay-Nah-Chi-Wah-Nung National Historic Site of Canada, Laurel culture (c.2300 BP - 900 BP) who lived \\"in villages and built large round burial mounds along the edge of the river, as monuments to their dead.\\" These mounds remain visible today. Kay-Nah-Chi-Wah-Nung is considered to be one of the \\"most significant centres of early habitation and ceremonial burial in Canada,\\" is located on the north side Rainy River in Northwestern Ontario, Canada.

Established c. 1846, it is located at (33.6806738, -88.8000525) at an elevation of 279 feet (85 m). History Palo Alto was named in honor of the Battle of Palo Alto. The Palo Alto Academy was once located in Palo Alto. A carriage factory, general store, and the Palo Alto Inn were formerly in operation in Palo Alto. The community was prosperous prior to the Civil War, but was absorbed into the nearby community of Abbott after the Civil War. A post office operated under the name Palo Alto from 1846 to 1898. Company F of the 44th Mississippi Infantry was known as The Palo Alto Confederates and was mustered into service on July 27, 1861 in Palo Alto. Soldiers from this company served with the Army of Tennessee in many battles, including Shiloh, Munfordville, Murfreesboro, and Chickamauga. During the Civil War, a skirmish was fought in Palo Alto on April 21 and 22, 1863 between the 2nd/22nd Tennessee Cavalry (Barteau's) and the 2nd Iowa Volunteer Cavalry Regiment. The Iowa soldiers, under the command of Edward Hatch, were part of Grierson's Raid and were being used to distract Confederate soldiers from Grierson's main column. After the skirmish Hatch's soldiers marched to Okolona, burning down barracks, a cotton warehouse, and ammunition stores. Six Union Army soldiers were declared missing after the skirmish. In 1876, Palo Alto was the site of an incident in which a group of heavily armed white men brought a piece of field artillery and broke up a meeting of the Republican Club in order to suppress black voters.

Under the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), they are two of the assignment conditions on which an appraisal assignment is predicated, the others being general assumptions, laws & regulations, supplemental standards, jurisdictional exceptions, and other conditions affecting scope of work.Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Scope of Work Rule, pg. U-13Stephanie Coleman MAI SRA, Scope of Work, Appraisal Institute (2006) Chicago, IL, , p. 44. Making the distinction between the two is important when compiling or reporting appraisals in the United States or other jurisdictions where USPAP is considered the professional standard because USPAP has different specific disclosure requirements for each in an appraisal report and specifies different conditions under which each can be made.Stephanie Coleman MAI SRA, Scope of Work, Appraisal Institute (2006) Chicago, IL, , p. 46 An assumption is a statement or condition that is presumed or assumed to be true and from which a conclusion can be drawn.

A hypothetical condition assumes a condition which is known to be contrary to fact whereas an extraordinary assumption assumes a condition or a fact which is merely unknown or uncertain. The results of an analysis involving any hypothetical conditions are known to not be reflective of what exists because the assumptions on which they are predicated are contrary to fact. The results of an analysis involving extraordinary assumptions are only potentially not reflective of what exists to the extent of the uncertainty underlying the assumptions on which the analysis or opinions are predicated.Stephanie Coleman MAI SRA, Scope of Work, Appraisal Institute (2006) Chicago, IL, , p. 112 Distinction with general assumptions and limiting conditions The concept of assumptions is closely related to the concept of scope of work in the identification of the appraisal problem in the appraisal process. The determination of the scope of work appropriate to the needs of the client, the use of the appraisal results, and the expectations of the appraiser's peers frame the extent of the general assumptions and limiting conditions of the appraisal assignment.Stephanie Coleman MAI SRA, Scope of Work, Appraisal Institute (2006) Chicago, IL, , p. 49 An appraisal can involve the assumption or determination of a wide range of facts or conditions. The determination of the veracity of all of the various facts and conditions on which an appraisal may be predicated is typically beyond the scope of investigation conducted by an appraiser and may exceed the appraisers expertise or competence. A distinction is made between extraordinary assumptions and general assumptions which allows an appraiser to make certain assumptions without having to personally investigate and confirm all relevant facts.Stephanie Coleman MAI SRA, Scope of Work, Appraisal Institute (2006) Chicago, IL, , p. 61 A general assumption is a typical assumption of an appraisal.The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 4th Ed., (2002), The Appraisal Institute, , p. 124) A limiting condition is a special condition that limits the use of an appraisal, primarily by specifying the intended use and intended users of the results and appraisal report.The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 4th Ed., (2002), The Appraisal Institute, , p. 166) If an appraiser has a general expectation regarding certain conditions and has uncovered no indication which might call such assumptions into question, he can treat the assumption as a general assumption, and as a consequence not be required to meet the disclosure and analysis requirements of an extraordinary assumption or a hypothetical condition. :For example, an appraiser inspecting a house may not be qualified to detect a termite infestation without an extensive expert investigation. Depending on the scope of work expected by the users of the appraisal and the appraisal's limiting conditions, if the appraiser has not observed any indications of an infestation in his normal investigation, the appraiser may omit such an investigation and make a general assumption that the property is not infested with termites and not have to meet the analysis and reporting requirements of an extraordinary assumption. However, the limiting conditions and description of the scope of work would need to make it clear to the users of the report the extent of the appraiser's investigation of the subject property and that the focus of the appraiser's investigation was determination of characteristics relevant to valuation and not the explicit detection of termites which would be the purview of a termite or structural home inspector and probably beyond the expertise of the appraiser. The determination of the scope of work appropriate to the needs and expectations of the users of the appraisal results and the intended use of the appraisal drive the determination of the scope of work and scope of investigation appropriate to the appraisal problem and frame the extent to which the appraiser investigates the subject of the appraisal and the market. If in the course of investigation, inspection, or research the appraiser discovers evidence which might call particular assumptions into question, he may still have a further decision to make regarding the scope of work. Depending on the needs or expectations of the client, the appraiser may choose to continue to investigate the condition to determine its veracity or he may choose to continue to assume the veracity of the assumption despite indications to the contrary, in which case the assumption would be an extraordinary assumption and have to be reported as such. Limiting conditions may frame the appraisal problem in such a way that facts or conditions which are even known to be false do not have to be treated as hypothetical conditions. :For example, title to a property may be owned subject to a minor mechanics lien, but the appraiser may define the appraisal problem as involving the unencumbered fee simple interest and conduct the appraisal assignment under the limiting condition that the appraiser is not responsible for or qualified to investigate the details of title and not have to treat the supposition of the absence of the mechanics lien as a hypothetical condition. A statement of general assumptions and limiting conditions is often included in the discussion of the premises of the appraisal in an appraisal report for the appraiser's protection as well as for the information and protection of the client and third party users of the appraisal results.The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 4th Ed., (2002), The Appraisal Institute, , p. 124The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 4th Ed., (2002), The Appraisal Institute, , p. 166 General assumptions and limiting conditions are sometimes thought of as 'legalese' and 'boilerplate' for appraisal reports, but each assumption or condition must be reasonable and supportable in the context of the appraisal and must not conflict with the appraiser's other responsibilities such as the identification of extraordinary assumptions or hypothetical conditions.The Appraisal of Real Estate, 12th Ed., (2001), The Appraisal Institute, , p. 618 Examples Extreme examples Although these concepts are of particular importance in the field of appraisal conducted under USPAP where they can carry legal consequences for an appraiser, they are generally applicable to any analytical field where calculations or representations of professional opinions based on such assumptions are communicated by a professional to a client or end user, such as through an attest function. Appraisers often use extreme examples to demonstrate fuzzy concepts. There are several philosophical examples lying outside the field of appraisal that are often used to illustrate the differences between extraordinary assumptions, hypothetical conditions, and general assumptions or limiting conditions. *In a discussion or analysis of historical events one may assume the hypothetical condition that Bobby Kennedy was not assassinated in 1968 and went on to become President of the United States (known to be contrary to fact). The discussion could then attempt to extrapolate the resulting course of history, but the results, though possibly interesting or even useful, would obviously be not true because the analysis that produced them was based on a fact known to be false. *In a discussion of many subjects involving phenomenology, such as the debate between creationism and evolution, one must ultimately make a determination that God either does or does not exist. The belief in the existence of a god is generally regarded as an element of faith. The assumption that God does not exist is justified as an assumption of science under lex parsimoniae or Occam's Razor. The actual existence or non-existence of God is generally recognized as not being directly observable and not susceptible to logical proof. If the determination of the existence of God is important to the subject matter being discussed, then such a discussion or analysis would be based on an extraordinary assumption and not a hypothetical condition. Then if the assumption is important to the results of the analysis, the results would be only as reliable as the certainty of the assumption. *Carrying that example a step further, if one were to research the genetics of a transgenic potato, one might make the general assumption that God does not exist, or at least make the general assumption that He has no interest in affecting one's plant research. Even if you are religious and have faith in God, you can make a general assumption regarding His effect on your research. The limiting conditions of one's investigation may recognize that you might not be qualified to determine the existence of god, and the determination of the existence of God is beyond the scope of research. The observation of signs of environmental conditions may require the use of an extraordinary assumption that the property is not contaminated if the nature and extent of contamination are unknown or can't be determined by the appraiser, depending on the scope of the appraisal and the needs of the client. Examples of hypothetical conditions Classic examples of hypothetical conditions include *In the appraisal of property, assuming that a property is zoned commercially or can be rezoned for commercial uses when it is in fact zoned residentially and there is no reasonable expectation that it could be rezoned commercially. Such a hypothetical condition would have to be assumed in order to estimate the impact on value of a past downzoning. Examples of extraordinary assumptions Examples of extraordinary assumptions used in the course of analysis might include *In the appraisal of real estate, when an appraiser observes items which might potentially indicate the presence of environmentally hazardous material, but he has no direct knowledge of any environmental contamination and is not qualified to detect such conditions, he may continue to formulate an opinion of value under an extraordinary assumption that the property is not chemically contaminated, though as a practical matter, he would need to communicate the extraordinary assumption made along with the value conclusion so that the users of the report can make their own determination of the reliability of the results given the observed conditions. *Analyzing data and reaching a conclusion when the source of the data, its accuracy, or its veracity may be suspect, but is not known to be completely false. The conclusions would be based on the extraordinary assumption that the data is accurate and reliable. The valuation of a property with proposed improvements or partially completed improvements as if completed will require the use of an extraordinary assumption or a hypothetical condition depending on whether the date of valuation is prospective or contemporary An appraisal of a property with proposed multi-tenant improvements may involve the estimation of a value as of a prospective date assuming both the completion of improvements and the leasing of the property to a stabilized occupancy. Proposed construction example One of the more troublesome examples of the distinction between extraordinary assumptions and hypothetical conditions regards the valuation of property with proposed improvements or proposed alterations. Such examples require the understanding of and inter-relation with prospective values, retrospective values, and contemporary values. A lender may be considering making a loan to finance the construction of a house and may need to know the value of the collateral that will result. The subject property is a vacant lot, but the client needs to know what the value of the lot is or would be or will be with a house (of certain described physical characteristics) constructed on it. For purposes of discussion, we will assume that everybody expects the construction of the house to take about six months. There are a couple of choices of how to proceed.Stephanie Coleman MAI SRA, Scope of Work, Appraisal Institute (2006) Chicago, IL, , p. 45Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, Advisory Opinion AO-17, p. 141 *If the contemporary value of the property is estimated as of the current date, the value of the vacant lot could be estimated without any particular assumptions. But if the property were to be valued as of the current date assuming the completion of the proposed house, the appraisal of the proposed property would be subject to a hypothetical condition because the assumption that the house is completed as of the current date is an assumption which is known to be contrary to the known fact that the lot is vacant. USPAP and appraisal ethics would require that the appraisal be reported in a manner which would not mislead reasonably anticipated users of the report into believing that the lot is actually currently improved with a house or mislead users into believing the value reported applies to the existing property on the current date. *If the value of the property is estimated as of the future date six months away when the property is expected to be improved with a new house, the prospective value of the vacant lot could be estimated, but would have to be reported under the extraordinary assumption that the house is not constructed. Also, the prospective value of the property assuming the completion of the house would also have to be reported as being subject to an extraordinary assumption that the house is completed. Under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, the valuation of a property with proposed improvements is required to be valued in its *'as-is' condition (usually considered as of the contemporary date as a vacant lot, but if construction has commenced, the appraiser must make a hypothetical condition that the lot is still vacant) *'as-proposed' condition under the extraordinary assumption that the improvements are completed as of a prospective date of valuation corresponding to the projected date of completion, and *'as-stabilized' condition under the extraordinary assumptions that the improvements are completed as of the projected date of completion and are leased to a stabilized occupancy at projected rents at a prospective date of valuation corresponding to the end of a projected absorption period after the projected date of completion. Diminution in value examples Often the purpose of a particular appraisal may be not the determination of the value of a property, but rather the determination of the contributory value of a particular component or portion of the property or the effect on value of a particular condition affecting the property or proposed to be imposed on the property. Examples of these situations are usually found in the field of forensic appraisal where a legal determination is sought regarding the diminution in value resulting from the removal of a portion or component of a property or for the adverse imposing of a condition on the property. The estimation of the diminution in value is usually defined as the difference between the value of the entire property before the taking or without the condition and the value of the property or any remainder after the taking or with the condition. The valuation of property for estimating just compensation due for a partial taking of property for purposes of constructing a public improvement may involve the use of several extraordinary assumptions or hypothetical conditions in both the before and after condition in order to formulate estimates of overall just compensation due or damages from non- compensable items, including quantifying project influence, damages from diversion of traffic, condemnor's blight, temporary construction easements, general benefits, special benefits, and other factors, sometimes all in the same appraisal, or sometimes repeatedly for every property affected by a larger project involving acquiring right of way from several different property owners. Examples include *Estimating the just compensation due for a partial taking of a property by a public entity under powers of eminent domain or by the courts for other purposes often involves estimating the diminution in value for the partial taking.Pesick, Jerome P., \\"Eminent Domain: Just Compensation in Partial Taking Cases\\", Michigan Bar Journal, December 2003, pp. 34-38Before and After Rule, Jury Instructions, Oregon UCJI No. 60.10 Usually such an analysis requires the assumption of a hypothetical condition in either the before or after condition, or both, and will often involve other extraordinary assumptions, for example, **In the appraisal of property, assuming for purposes of estimating just compensation for the taking of property for a public use by a governmental entity that the proposed public improvement will not be constructed in an effort to isolate any impact on market values of project influence. **the value of any property remainder in the after condition would be predicated on the extraordinary assumption that the proposed public improvement is to be constructed expeditiously subsequent to the date of taking. *Estimating the impact on value of physical or economic damage to a property from casualty or from actions of others, such as **estimating damage to a property from a casualty is usually estimated as a before/after calculation where the property is valued as of immediately before and immediately after the casualty. Usually the impact on value is measured as the cost to repair if the repair is economically feasible, that is if the potential loss in value or utility exceeds the cost to cure the deficiency, with the value after equal to the value before less the cost to repair. The value in the before condition would assume that the casualty was not about to happen. In many cases involving estimating damage for purposes of insurance, there may be requirements to assume several items, whether uncertain or entirely hypothetical, such as assuming a stable market for repair services after the casualty or involving various insurance exclusions. **estimating damage for an economic loss from events outside the property often involves assumptions in the before and after condition. For example, in a case where a noxious chemical plant is to be constructed adjacent to a substantial residence, the impact on the value of the residence of the presence of the rendering plant is estimated by first estimating the value under the extraordinary assumption that the plant is not to be constructed and subtracting the estimate of value under the hypothetical condition that it is already constructed and operating. **The calculations may sometimes have to be abstracted between various elements of damage. For example, assume that an aircraft is damaged in an accident, such as a gear-up accident. The value in the before condition assumes that the aircraft is not about to be damaged. Normally, the impact on value of the damage is measured as the cost to repair, but after a repair the result is an aircraft with a substantial damage history. Sometimes it is contended that there is a diminution in value in the after condition beyond the cost to repair because of the resulting damage history. The estimation of diminution in value from a damage history, one must value the property assuming a credible repair and compare that with an estimate of value of the property in the same condition as after the repair, but under the hypothetical condition that it not have any damage history. Such estimates are considered very difficult to prove and are often controversial. **When estimating compensation for a title claim, the before condition is usually predicated on the hypothetical condition that the title condition did not exist in the before condition. There may be other assumptions made regarding the existence of subsequently constructed improvements and other conditions. USPAP analysis and reporting requirements USPAP definitions These two related terms are defined in the text of USPAP, and most appraisal literature and coursework have since been built around these definitions. The two definitions are nearly identical except for the distinction: *Extraordinary assumptions are defined as assumptions, directly related to a specific assignment, which, if found to be false, could alter the appraiser's opinions or conclusions. A comment to the definition explain that extraordinary assumptions presume as fact otherwise uncertain information **about physical, legal, or economic characteristics of the property, **or about conditions external to the property, such as market conditions or trends, **or about the integrity of data used in an analysis. *Hypothetical conditions are defined as that which is contrary to what exists but is supposed for the purpose of analysis. The comment to the definition explain that hypothetical conditions assume conditions contrary to known facts **about physical, legal, or economic conditions, **or about conditions or facts lying outside the observable scope of discussion or analysis but potentially affecting the scope or results of analysis or direction of discussion (such as market conditions or trends known to be contrary to known conditions), **or about the accuracy, reliability, or integrity of data on which an analysis may be based. Hypothetical conditions are assumptions made for the purpose of discussion or analysis which are known to be contrary to known facts and are distinguished from extraordinary assumptions which are assumptions made also for the purpose of discussion or analysis, but regarding facts or conditions which are merely uncertain or undetermined. The distinction between hypothetical conditions and extraordinary assumptions can carry a legal consequence and are most important in analytical fields where calculations or representations of professional opinions based on such assumptions are communicated by a professional to a client or end user, such as through an attest function. USPAP development and reporting requirements The USPAP Scope of Work Rule requires that an appraiser identify specific assignment elements in the planning of an appraisal assignment and gather and analyze information about those elements, including assignment conditions, which include assumptions, extraordinary assumptions, hypothetical conditions, and hypothetical conditions.Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Scope of Work Rule, Problem Identification, Comments, page U-12 & 13 Additionally, all USPAP standards dealing with the development of appraisals, consulting, or mass appraisal specifically require that any extraordinary assumptions and any hypothetical conditions necessary in the assignment be identified in the course of formulating the appraisal problem and planning the scope of work.Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, Standards Rule 1-2 (f) and (g), pg U-17Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 4-2 (f) and (g), pg U-37 and 38Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 6-2 (i), pg U-46Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 7-2 (f) and (g), page U-56Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 9-2 (f) and (g), page U-69 Under USPAP, an appraisal may be predicated on extraordinary assumptions only under certain conditions, specifically *the use of the extraordinary assumption is required to properly develop credible opinions and conclusions *the appraiser has a reasonable basis for the extraordinary assumption *use of the extraordinary assumption results in a credible analysis *and the appraiser complies with the appropriate disclosure requirements (as proscribed elsewhere in USPAP). Similarly, an appraisal may also be predicated on a hypothetical condition only under certain additional more restrictive conditions, specifically *use of the hypothetical condition is clearly required for legal purposes, for purposes of reasonable analysis, or for purposes of comparison *use of the hypothetical condition results in a credible analysis *the appraiser complies with the disclosure requirements set forth in USPAP for hypothetical conditions These requirements are specified in *Standard 1: Real Property Appraisal, DevelopmentAppraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 1-2 (f) and (g), pg U-17 *Standard 4: Real Property Consulting, Development *Standard 6, Mass Appraisal, Development and Reporting *Standard 7, Personal Property Appraisal, DevelopmentAppraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 7-2 (f) and (g), pg U-56 *Standard 9, Business Appraisal, DevelopmentAppraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 9-2 (f) and (g), pg U-69 All USPAP standards dealing with appraisal reporting require that any written and oral appraisal report clearly and accurately disclose all assumptions, extraordinary assumptions, hypothetical conditions, and limiting conditions used in the assignment.Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 6-8 (c), pg U-49Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 2-1 (c), pg U-21Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 5-1 (c), pg U-39Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 8-1 (c), pg U-59Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 10-1 (c), pg U-72 These same reporting standards require that the reporting of appraisal assignment results must \\"clearly and conspicuously\\" state all extraordinary assumptions and hypothetical conditions and state that their use might have affected the assignment results.Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 2-2 (a) (x), pg U-24Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 2-2 (b) (x), pg U-26Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 2-2 (c) (x), pg U-28Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 5-2 (g), pg U-40Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 8-2 (a) (x), pg U-61Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 8-2 (b) (x), pg U-63Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 10-2 (a) (x), pg U-74Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 10-2 (b) (x), pg U-75 Appraisal reports written where USPAP compliance is a requirement or assignment condition will usually be written with a separate section, or sometimes two distinct separate sections, enumerating and explaining the rationale for and effects on value or utility of all extraordinary assumptions and hypothetical conditions. Enforcement of USPAP development and reporting requirements The distinction between extraordinary assumptions and hypothetical conditions can be a matter of law or professional standards in the field of real estate appraisal in the United States where the distinction is not only codified in USPAP, but enforced by various state real estate appraiser commissions or professional boards. However, the concepts are clearly applicable to appraisal ethics and professional conduct for all forms of valuation, including mass appraisal, personal property appraisal, and business valuation, as promoted by most appraisal professional organizations and associations. All of the reporting standards state that an appraisal must be communicated in a manner that is not misleading.Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standard 2, USPAP 2008, page U-21Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation,USPAP Standard 5, p. U-39Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standards Rule 6-8 (a), p. U-49Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standard 8, pg U-59Appraisal Standards Board, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2008-2009 Edition, The Appraisal Foundation, USPAP Standard 10, pg U-72 The reliability or accuracy of assignment results predicated on an extraordinary assumption is limited by the likelihood of the veracity of the extraordinary assumption. The purpose of the requirements to recognize and report extraordinary assumptions is to allow the client and third party users of the report to assess the veracity or likelihood of the extraordinary assumption and relate that to the reliability of the assignment results. Similarly, the results of assignment results predicated on a hypothetical condition are not reflective of the value of what actually exists since the analysis is known to be based on facts known to be false. The purpose of the requirements to recognize and report hypothetical conditions is to limit the potential for the communication of the appraisal to imply that the hypothetical condition may be plausible or probable and limit the potential for the a user of assignment results being misled by the appraisal regarding its actual value or regarding the existence of conditions contrary to known facts. Distinction between appraisal assumptions and legal presumptions Though the concepts are related, there is an important distinction between what appraisers call assumptions and what the legal profession and the courts call a presumption. In a colloquial sense the two terms are considered synonymous. Many dictionaries define one term with the other .Google, define:assumptionGoogle, define:presumptionMerriam-Webster Online: presumption In a legal context, a presumption is defined as a conclusion derived from a particular set of facts based on law, rather than probable reasoning.Answers.com Dictionary definition This can be colloquially interpreted as meaning that when the law makes a presumption, it is assuming a particular condition regardless of reality. For example, most state laws are written with a \\"legal limit\\" for blood-alcohol content, often 0.08%. It is not a crime to have a certain blood alcohol content; the crime is operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. If a driver's blood alcohol content is measured above the legal limit, the law makes a presumption that he is intoxicated, even though a particular person's physiologically might be almost unaffected and his driving abilities might not be impaired. However, the actual legal effect of a legal presumption is not the legal determination of a fact. Most presumptions are rebuttable. What a legal presumption does is relieve one party of having to prove a particular fact once a precedent fact is proven, but most presumptions are rebuttable. The presumption shifts the burden of proof from one party to the other.The Lectric Law Library's Lexicon On Presumption Legal presumptions affecting appraisal conditions are rare, but the appraiser may encounter legal presumptions in the course of an appraisal practice. For example, in some jurisdictions a public entity has standing to commence an action to condemn private property only if it is able to demonstrate that it could not reach a resolution with the property owner. Often, the courts make a legal presumption that a resolution cannot be reached if the public entity make an offer in good faith and have that offer rejected. In this context, the public entity is usually able to demonstrate that it was bargaining in good faith if the offer made was based on an independent appraisal. This legal presumption is often the basis of why right of way acquisition procedures are set up the way they are. So an appraiser's entire practice may be the result of a legal presumption. A legal presumption which may be regarded as an assignment condition might include the legal presumption that in the after condition of a partial taking of real estate, the proposed public improvement is to be constructed expeditiously immediately after the date of taking and not delayed for years or decades as is often the ultimate practical reality. An appraiser performing and communicating an appraisal under USPAP may estimate value assuming facts and conditions proscribed by a legal presumption, but a determination would have to be made whether the assumption is an extraordinary assumption or hypothetical condition and communicated appropriately as required under USPAP. However, should the legal context require the communication of results in a manner contrary to USPAP, or if the law requires the valuation of a property under a hypothetical condition in a manner not apparently allowed by USPAP, the appraisal could be provided with the assignment conditions determined by a jurisdictional exception and still be compliant with USPAP.

By August 1937, four of its eight members had resigned or been fired. The 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt took place from March to June 1937 in the Canadian province of Alberta. It was a rebellion against Premier William Aberhart by a group of backbench (not part of the cabinet) members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) from his Social Credit League. The dissidents were unhappy with Aberhart's failure to provide Albertans with C$25 monthly dividends through social credit as he had promised before his 1935 election. When the government's 1937 budget made no move to implement the dividends, many MLAs revolted openly and threatened to defeat the government in a confidence vote. The revolt took place in a period of turmoil for Aberhart and his government: besides the dissident backbenchers, half of the cabinet resigned or was fired over a period of less than a year. Aberhart also faced criticism for planning to attend the coronation of George VI at the province's expense and for stifling a recall attempt against him by the voters of his constituency. After a stormy debate in which the survival of the government was called into question, a compromise was reached whereby Aberhart's government relinquished considerable power to a committee of backbenchers. This committee, dominated by insurgents, recruited two British social credit experts to come to Alberta and advise on the implementation of social credit. Among the experts' first moves was to require a loyalty pledge from Social Credit MLAs. Almost all signed, thus ending the crisis, though most of the legislation the experts proposed was ultimately disallowed or struck down as unconstitutional. Background 1935 Alberta election on the strength of his advocacy of social credit, an economic theory that he said could restore prosperity to the depression-ridden province. In the midst of the Great Depression, Calgary schoolteacher and radio evangelist William Aberhart became a convert to a British economic theory called social credit. Believing it could end the depression and restore prosperity, he began to promote it around Alberta. When the provincial government proved resistant to adopting it, Aberhart resolved to field social credit candidates in the 1935 provincial election.Barr 71 These candidates won 56 of the province's 63 seats, and Aberhart became Premier of Alberta.Byrne 111 In the runup to the campaign, Aberhart promised to increase Albertans' purchasing power by providing monthly dividends to all citizens in the form of non-negotiable \\"credit certificates\\". While he did not commit to any specific dividend amount, he cited $20 and, later, $25 per month as reasonable figures.Elliott 110 Though he noted that these figures were given \\"only for illustrative purposes\\", he repeated them so often that, in the assessment of his biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller, \\"it would have been impossible for any regular listener not to have gained the impression that Aberhart was promising him $25 a month if Social Credit should come to power.\\"Elliott 157 Aberhart had been in some conflict with C. H. Douglas, social credit's British originator. Douglas, while assiduously avoiding specific comment on the Albertan proposals,Elliott 143 submitted them to his Social Credit Secretariat for review; it found them to be \\"fallacious from start to finish.\\"Elliott 128 By the end of 1936, Aberhart's government had made no progress towards the promised dividends, leaving many Albertans disillusioned and frustrated. These Albertans included some of Aberhart's own Social Credit MLAs, who had been elected on the promise of dividends and were angry at Aberhart's failure to follow through.Elliott 249 Some of them felt that, while the idea of social credit was sound, Aberhart lacked a real understanding of Douglas's theory and could not implement it. These MLAs wanted Douglas or somebody from his British organization to come to Alberta and deliver on Aberhart's campaign promises.Elliott 251 One such MLA, Samuel Barnes, had been expelled from the Social Credit caucus and from the Social Credit League for voicing these views.Elliott 243 Genesis In December 1936, John Hargrave, the leader of the Social Credit Party of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, visited Alberta. While he had been disowned by Douglas, many MLAs frustrated with Aberhart saw Hargrave as their saviour. On arrival in Alberta, he met with Aberhart and his cabinet, who told him that the Canadian constitution (which made banking a matter of federal, rather than provincial, jurisdiction) was an obstacle to their introducing social credit. Hargrave proposed a plan for implementing social credit in Alberta; while he acknowledged that it was unconstitutional, he believed that the federal government would not dare enforce its jurisdiction in the face of broad popular support for social credit.Elliott 252 After he presented his plan to a group of Social Credit MLAs, the news media began to report that Aberhart intended to implement a radical and unconstitutional set of laws. Aberhart immediately disavowed any \\"intention of drastic legislation\\" and, after studying Hargrave's plan, announced that neither he nor his cabinet supported it.Elliott 253 Provincial Treasurer Charles Cockroft's January 1937 resignation was among the public's first clues that all was not well in the Aberhart government.Despite this statement, the Social Credit caucus invited Hargrave to explain his plan, which he did to the approval of many caucus members. Attorney-General John Hugill pointed out that the plan was unconstitutional, to which Hargrave replied that he was \\"not interested in legal arguments.\\" Two weeks later, Hargrave left the province, telling the press that he \\"found it impossible to co-operate with a government which [he considered] a mere vacillating machine.\\"Elliott 255 In this message, some MLAs found confirmation of their misgivings about Aberhart. A group of them, reported as numbering anywhere from five (\\"soon joined by eight or ten others\\")Elliott 256 to 22,Brennan 48Barr 102 began to hold meetings in Edmonton's Corona Hotel to, as Brian Brennan puts it, \\"plot Aberhart's downfall\\". Brennan identifies their leader as Pembina's Harry Knowlton Brown, while T. C. Byrne names Ronald Ansley, Joseph Unwin, and Albert Blue.Byrne 120 To make matters worse for Aberhart, Minister of Lands and Mines Charles Cathmer Ross resigned late in 1936, followed by Provincial Treasurer Charles Cockroft on January 29, 1937. Neither minister's resignation was directly related to the dissidents' complaints: Ross resigned over disagreements with Aberhart on oil policy,Barr 101 while Cockroft left over a combination of ill health, clashes with Aberhart over the issue of a federal-provincial loan council, government investment policies, and Aberhart's approach to patronage. Nevertheless, the resignations were the public's first clue of dissent in Social Credit's ranks. Cockroft's resignation was followed by that of his deputy, J. F. Perceval, and there were rumours that Hugill and Minister of Agriculture and Trade and Industry William Chant would soon follow. This left Minister of Health Wallace Warren Cross, Minister of Public Works and Railways and Telephones William Fallow, and Provincial Secretary Ernest Manning as Aberhart's only indisputably loyal ministers, and Manning was away from the legislature, ill with tuberculosis.Brennan 46 On February 19, William Carlos Ives of the Supreme Court of Alberta dealt the government another blow when he struck down key provincial legislation, including one act reducing the interest paid on the province's bonds by half (though this was only a technical defeat, since the government had been defaulting on its bond payments since the previous April). On February 25, a new session of the legislature opened with the speech from the throne, delivered by Chief Justice Horace Harvey in the absence of Lieutenant-Governor Philip Primrose.Byrne 119 Its commitment to social credit was limited to a vaguely worded promise to pursue \\"a new economic order when social credit becomes effective.\\"Brennan 49 Three days later, on his weekly radio program, Aberhart acknowledged that he had been unable to implement the monthly dividends during the eighteen-month period he had set as his deadline, and asked Social Credit constituency association presidents to convene meetings of all Social Credit members to decide whether he ought to resign. He suggested that, in light of poor spring road conditions in rural areas, these meetings be delayed until early June, during which time he would remain in office. Open dissent The media objected to Aberhart's plan to place his government's future in the hands of the 10% of Albertans who were Social Credit members; the Calgary Herald called for an immediate election. To many Social Credit MLAs, Aberhart's greater offense was bypassing them, the people's elected representatives. This was especially irksome in view of social credit's political philosophy, which favoured technocratic rule and held that elected representatives' only legitimate function was channelling the public desire; by appealing directly to Social Credit members, Aberhart appeared to be denying the MLAs even this role.MacPherson 170 In the legislature, Conservative leader David Duggan called for Aberhart's resignation; in a move that Brennan reports shocked the assembly, his call was endorsed by Social Credit backbencher Albert Blue. On March 11 or 12,Elliott 257 Cockroft's replacement as Provincial Treasurer, Solon Low, introduced the government's budget. It included no implementation of social credit, and was attacked by the opposition parties as \\"the default budget\\" and by insurgent Social Crediters as a \\"banker's budget\\" (a harsh insult given Social Credit's dim view of the banking industry). Ronald Ansley rose immediately to attack it as containing \\"not one single item that even remotely resembled Social Credit.\\" Blue, again echoing Duggan, threatened on March 16 to vote against the government's interim supply bill, the defeat of which, under the conventions of the Westminster parliamentary system, would force the government's resignation. In response, Aberhart praised Blue's courage in speaking his mind, and called him a worthy Social Crediter.Elliott 258 The budget of Solon Low (right, pictured here with Chief Joe Bullshield and Archdeacon S. H. Middleton), which included \\"not one single item that even remotely resembled Social Credit\\", was the catalyst to the insurgents' decision to make their discontent public.Surprised by Aberhart's refusal to be drawn into open conflict, the insurgents needed time to reassess their strategy. They got that time when, on March 17, Lieutenant-Governor Primrose died, necessitating a five-day adjournment while the federal government selected a replacement.Elliott 258‚Äì259 When the legislature reconvened March 22Elliott 259 or 23, the dissidents filibustered against the budget. Albert Bourcier opened debate, and was followed by, among others, Edith Rogers, Ansley, and Wilson Cain. On March 24, Harry Knowlton Brown moved an adjournment, which was carried over the government's objections by a vote of 27 to 25. Though the insurgents considered this a vote of non-confidence in Aberhart's government, he refused to resign; he acknowledged, however, that he would do so if the budget itself was defeated.Brennan 50 Coronation and recall petition Though the bulk of the revolt took place in and around the legislature over the issue of social credit and government fiscal policy, Aberhart was also under attack on other fronts. He had been invited to attend the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, set for May 1937 in London, and planned to go. Douglas, challenged by Hargrave for the leadership of the social credit movement and under attack by some of his own followers for his lack of cooperation with the world's first social credit government, offered to host Aberhart, and a member of Douglas's social credit secretariat was planning a speaking tour for Aberhart. In the same speech in which he threatened to bring down the government on the supply motion, Blue attacked the trip as an extravagance that depression-ridden Alberta could ill afford. Faced with a political insurgency at home, Aberhart reluctantly decided at the end of March to cancel his trip, inaccurately claiming that he had never definitely decided to go.Elliott 261 Such a retreat was not an option in the face of another of Aberhart's troubles. One of Social Credit's 1935 promises had been the introduction of recall for MLAs, which they had implemented with their first legislative act.Elliott 273 As Aberhart's popularity fell, the residents of his own Okotoks-High River riding, where he had been elected in a by-election shortly after the general election (in which he had not run), availed themselves of the legislation. On April 9 their petition was endorsed by the riding's Social Credit constituency association,Barr 105 and by fall it had gathered the signatures of the required two thirds of the electorate. In response, the Social Crediters repealed the Recall Act retroactive to its date of origin; Aberhart claimed that oil companies active in his riding had intimidated their workers into signing the petition, and that some of the signatories had moved to the area specifically to sign.Barr 111 Manoeuvring and negotiation On March 29, in the aftermath of the insurgent victory on Brown's adjournment motion, Aberhart gave notice of closure on the budget debate. Belatedly realizing that this move would be risking his government in a vote that he might very well lose, he then announced that he would seek the consent of the legislature to withdraw his closure motion and move an interim supply motion instead. The unanimous consent needed to withdraw the closure motion was refused, and the motion itself was defeated. That evening, Aberhart negotiated with the insurgents for four hours until a compromise was accepted: the insurgents would support the supply bill, in exchange for which the cabinet would introduce a bill amending the Social Credit Measures Act to establish a board of MLAs empowered to appoint a commission of \\"experts\\" to implement social credit.Elliott 260 On March 31 the insurgents kept their part of the agreement by allowing the supply bill to be passed on second reading and the budget to be hoisted for ninety days.Barr 103 However, when the cabinet introduced its promised bill, the insurgents claimed that it was not as agreed and refused to support it. Instead, they demanded Aberhart's resignation and announced that they were prepared to take over the government within 24 hours. A delegation put this demand to Aberhart in the evening of March 31; according to them, he agreed to resign if they allowed the supply bill to pass a third reading. They did so, but Aberhart denied that he had agreed to resign and refused to do so unless he was defeated in a general election. The insurgents, leery of Aberhart's oratorical powers and the reach of his weekly radio show, wanted to avoid an election. Even so, they rejected a motion by Low to raise their pay for the session by $200, seeing it as a crass bribe.Elliott 261 On April 8MacPherson 171 or 12,Byrne 121 the government capitulated. Low's Alberta Social Credit Act delivered what the insurgents wanted, including the creation of \\"Alberta credit\\" in the amount of \\"the unused capacity of industries and people of Alberta to produce wanted goods and services\\", the establishment of \\"credit houses\\" to distribute this credit, and the creation of a Social Credit Board. The bill was passed, and the insurgents were placated, though Brown warned during a cross-province speaking tour that they were determined to see social credit implemented, and \\"if anyone gets in our way, he's going to get into trouble ... we must choose between principles and party, between Social Credit and Premier Aberhart.\\"Barr 104 Social Credit Board and commission The Social Credit Board comprised five backbenchers. Insurgent Glenville MacLachlan was chair, and Aberhart loyalist Floyd Baker was secretary. The other three members were insurgents Selmer Berg, James L. McPherson, and William E. Hayes. The Board was empowered to appoint a commission of between three and five experts to implement social credit; the commission was to be responsible to the Board.MacPherson 172 The Social Credit Board hoped that C. H. Douglas would come to Alberta to serve as its expert advisor. While Douglas declined to come himself, he did send two of his lieutenants.Historians have taken different approaches to analyzing the effect of the Board on traditional Westminster parliamentary governance. C. B. MacPherson emphasized \\"the extent to which the cabinet had abdicated in favour of a board composed of a few private members of the legislature\\", Byrne agrees that \\"in some respects, the powers granted to the board superseded those of the Executive Council\\" but notes that \\"Aberhart was permitted to carry on with regular government operations.\\"Byrne 172 Elliott and Miller take a similar approach to MacPherson's, suggesting that \\"Aberhart and his cabinet ... were in a position, strange in a cabinet system of government, of being ruled in the matter of economic policy by a board of private members that would be under the influence of Social Credit 'experts'.\\" Barr disagrees, arguing that the Board was \\"still under the control of cabinet\\" and pointing out that \\"the cabinet was left with the power\\", through its privileged position in introducing legislation, \\"to supplement or alter the provisions of the Alberta Social Credit Act\\" under which terms the board was constituted. Whatever the relative influence of the Board and cabinet, the latter disavowed any ownership of the act that established the former. Though it was a government bill, sponsored by Solon Low, the Provincial Treasurer explained that he took no responsibility for it, as it was drawn up by a committee of insurgents \\"without the interference of the cabinet\\". Though some insurgents complained that the version of the bill introduced by the government was different than that drafted by the committee, MacLachlan insisted that there had been no material changes. The bill was passed April 13, and the legislature adjourned the following day.MacPherson 173 Immediately after, MacLachlan invited Douglas to come to Alberta and take the head of the expert commission. Douglas suggested that MacLachlan come to London to discuss the matter; MacLachlan left April 29, arrived in London May 9, and proceeded to meet with Douglas at his fishing lodge.Elliott 262‚Äì263 Douglas refused to come to Alberta himself, but provided two of the \\"experts\\" the Board was charged with finding. The first was L. D. Byrne, who was in the insurance business, was an expert on social credit, and was appointed to do most of the substantive work. The second, tire salesman George Frederick Powell, was expected to handle the commission's public relations. Powell arrived in Edmonton June 10 with MacLachlan, while Byrne followed several weeks later.Elliott 264 While MacLachlan was in England finding his experts, feuding continued in Alberta. Aberhart fired William Chant, a known Douglasite, from his cabinet after he refused to resign.Elliott 263 Both sides accused one another of subservience to the banking industry, the Social Credit League's sworn enemy. Baker, the board's sole Aberhart loyalist, travelled the province defending his premier; at one 4,000 person meeting in Calgary, he was shouted down by angry supporters of the insurgency. A petition calling for Aberhart's resignation circulated among backbenchers, and proved to be a plant by the cabinet to test MLAs' loyalty. Outwardly, however, the Social Crediters showed a united front as they awaited the promised experts; in the first recorded vote after the legislature reconvened June 7, all insurgents present voted with the government, though 13 were absent.MacPherson 175 One of Powell's first actions on arriving in Edmonton was to prepare a \\"loyalty pledge\\" committing its signatories \\"to uphold the Social Credit Board and its technicians.\\" Most Social Credit MLAs signed, and the six who did not wrote to Powell assuring him of their loyalty to Douglas's objectivesMacPherson 51 (though one, former Provincial Treasurer Cockroft, later left the Social Credit League and unsuccessfully sought re-election as an \\"Independent Progressive\\").Brennan 51 The insurgency was over. Aftermath Byrne and Powell prepared three acts for the implementation of social credit: the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, the Bank Employees Civil Rights Act, and the Judicature Act Amendment Act. The first required all bankers to obtain a license from the Social Credit Commission and created a directorate for the control of each bank, most members of which would be appointed by the Social Credit Board. The second prevented unlicensed banks and their employees from initiating civil actions. The third prevented any person from challenging the constitutionality of Alberta's laws in court without receiving the approval of the Lieutenant- Governor in Council. All three acts were quickly passed.MacPherson 177 New Lieutenant-Governor John C. Bowen, asked to grant royal assent, called Aberhart and Attorney-General Hugill to his office. He asked Hugill if, as a lawyer, he believed that the proposed laws were constitutional; Hugill replied that he did not. Aberhart said that he would take responsibility for the bills, which Bowen then signed. As they left the meeting, Aberhart asked Hugill for his resignation, which he received. Shortly after, the federal government disallowed all three acts.Elliott 268 Powell was not discouraged, stating that the acts \\"had been drawn up mainly to show the people of Alberta who were their real enemies, and in that respect they succeeded admirably.\\"Elliott 269 John Hugill's (right) honest assessment of the constitutionality of government legislation was viewed by Aberhart (left) as insubordination; he asked for and received Hugill's resignation in August 1937.Soon after the bills were introduced, Social Credit MLAs were subjected to a new loyalty pledge, this one shifting the target of their loyalty from the Social Credit Board to the cabinet. Six MLAs‚Äîincluding former cabinet ministers Chant, Cockroft, and RossElliott 270‚Äîrefused to sign, and were ejected from caucus. In the fall, Aberhart re-introduced the three disallowed acts in altered form, along with two new acts.Byrne 124 The Bank Taxation Act increased provincial taxes on banks by 2,230%, while the Accurate News and Information Act gave the chairman of the Social Credit Board a number of powers over newspapers, including the right to compel them to publish \\"any statement ... which has for its object the correction or amplification of any statement relating to any policy or activity of the Government or Province\\" and to require them to supply the names of sources. It also authorized cabinet to prohibit the publication of any newspaper, any article by a given writer, or any article making use of a given source.Barr 109 Bowen reserved approval of the bills until the Supreme Court of Canada could comment on them; all were ruled unconstitutional in Reference re Alberta Statutes.Barr 112 During the fall session in which the offending bills were proposed, police raided an Edmonton office of the Social Credit League and confiscated 4,000 copies of a pamphlet called \\"The Bankers' Toadies\\", which urged its readers as follows: \\"My child, you should NEVER say hard or unkind things about Bankers' Toadies. God made snakes, slugs, snails and other creepy-crawly, treacherous and poisonous things. NEVER, therefore, abuse them‚Äîjust exterminate them!\\" The pamphlet also listed eight alleged toadies, including Conservative leader Duggan, former Attorney-General John Lymburn, and Senator William Antrobus Griesbach. Powell and Social Credit whip Joe Unwin were charged with criminal libel and counsel to murder. Both were convicted of the former charge. Unwin was sentenced to three months hard labour; Powell was sentenced to six months and deported.Barr 109‚Äì110 Aberhart's government was re-elected in the 1940 election with a reduced majority of 36 of 63 seats. Among the defeated incumbents were dissident leader Brown, the convicted Unwin, the expelled Barnes, and the Provincial Treasurer Low. Aberhart won re-election by running in Calgary; his replacement as Social Credit candidate in Okotoks‚ÄìHigh River was soundly defeated. Aberhart died in 1943 and was replaced as Premier by Ernest Manning, who steered the Social Credit League in a more conservative and conventional direction until his 1968 retirement. Though the disallowance of banking bills put an end to any real chance of social credit being implemented at the provincial level, the Social Credit Board persisted until 1948, when it was dissolved in response to a number of its anti-semitic pronouncements and its suggestion that the secret ballot and political parties be eliminated.Brennan 94‚Äì95 Notes References Bibliography   * Social Credit Backbenchers Revolt, 1937 Social Credit Backbenchers Revolt, 1937 Category:Political history of Alberta Category:Canadian social credit movement Category:Alberta Social Credit Party Category:1937 in Alberta ","title":"1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt"},{"id":"24627639","text":"Mindanao Polytechnic College (MPC) is a maritime school located at the junction of the National Highway and the Makar-Koronadal Road, about 7 kilometers from downtown General Santos City, Philippines. It is the city‚Äôs premier school for nautical and marine engineering courses, and lately, of HRM courses (maritime-based), BS in INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (BSIT) and others. History Mindanao Polytechnic College (MPC), formerly called Mindanao Polytechnic School (MPS), came into existence in 1980. Conceived several years earlier, the idea was finally brought into realization by the founder, Capt. Arturo a. Aguilar, MM. Capt. Aguilar, ably assisted by his wife, Susana, established Mindanao Polytechnic School in February 1980. Capt. Aguilar, a master mariner by profession and a former harbor pilot of the Port of General Santos City, and Mrs. Susana R. Aguilar, an education graduate and business entrepreneur, combined their resources to give rise to the only maritime school then in the SOCSKSARGEN area, one of the growth centers in Southern Mindanao. During the initial year of operation, the school rented two separate buildings in the downtown area of General Santos City. In June 1981, the school transferred to its new campus at Crossing Makar. Consisting of three hectares, the campus is quiet, cool, pollution-free and conducive for learning. The school eventually gained recognition in 1981 when the prestigious Philippine Association of Maritime Institutions (PAMI) accepted MPS as a full-fledged member. In that same year, MPS President Capt. Aguilar was elected as one of the officers of PAMI and the school became a member of the Philippine Association of Private Technical Institutions (PAPTI). The name of MPS was changed to Mindanao Polytechnic College (MPC) in 1984. Now on its 30th year of operation, MPC offers Maritime courses (BS Marine Engineering and BS Marine Transportation) and non-Maritime courses (BS in Hotel and Restaurant Management, BS in Mechanical Engineering, BS in Customs Administration, and BS in Information Technology/System). Performance in government examinations (Mechanical Engineering, Customs Brokers, Deck and Engine Officers) has been very satisfactory.

History   As Fine Living  The channel was announced by Scripps in 2001 and launched the following year as Fine Living (later Fine Living Network, FLN). The brand was positioned towards high-income viewers \\"who want guidance in helping spend their free time\\", and featured a mix of lifestyle- and leisure-themed programming dealing with topics such as travel and adventure, finance, real estate, \\"everyday pursuits\\", and technology. Scripps positioned Fine Living as a multi-platform brand, having launched a companion website, and purchasing a 49% stake in a free-circulation magazine that would be co- branded with the channel. Scripps planned to invest $100 million in original programming for Fine Living.The network was launched on August 21, 2002. In 2007, Fine Living acquired primetime encores of the syndicated series The Martha Stewart Show. The network later added Whatever, Martha!, a series featuring her daughter Alexis Stewart and Jennifer Hutt comedically riffing over footage from Martha Stewart Living.  As Cooking Channel  In October 2009, Scripps Networks Interactive announced that Fine Living would be relaunched as Cooking Channel in 2010, after the Great Recession and a severe decline in American personal income and spending effectively stunted Fine Living Network from any further ratings or programming expansion. The network would be a spin-off of Food Network oriented towards instructional and personality-based programming, which had been largely displaced by the growth of Food Network's reality and competition programming. The network airs both new series, and archived programming from Food Network.

It was founded in May 2001 to bring attention to ovarian cancer, as well as provide education, encourage advocacy and garner support for research and an eventual cure. WOCA is a tax-exempt organization pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The organization falls under the umbrella, and is a working partner of the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance . The Wisconsin Ovarian Cancer Alliance mission is to overcome ovarian cancer through the following: Education - WOCA pledges to create awareness of early warning signs that may be indicative of ovarian cancer. This means educating individuals, the medical community and organizations to recognize the subtle symptoms of ovarian cancer. In so doing, WOCA hopes to increase early detection and improve treatment methods. Support - WOCA works to support Wisconsin women and their families in their battle against ovarian cancer. This includes developing and distributing educational material, promoting support systems and creating networking groups. Advocacy - WOCA's membership supports the advocacy efforts of the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance to secure additional funds and advance research toward a cure. WOCA achieves its mission through grass roots campaigns, annual events and fundraisers, support groups, industry partnerships and educational activities. History While working as a volunteer on the Komen Foundation's Milwaukee Race for the Cure in 1999, Joan Sagan, an oncology nurse with more than 20 years experience, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She wanted to start a Wisconsin organization that would provide education, encourage advocacy, and generate support for ovarian cancer research and awareness. After her treatment, Sagan assembled family, friends, medical professionals and fellow survivors to launch the Wisconsin Ovarian Cancer Alliance (WOCA). Key actions have included the formation of a medical advisory board; identification of outreach partners in Green Bay and Madison, as well as Metropolitan Milwaukee; creation of the Comedy for the Cure fundraising event; and the launch of an informational web site. Governance and leadership WOCA is run by a Board of Directors composed of officers, members and advisors from all over the Metropolitan Milwaukee area, and includes founders, supporters, survivors and medical professionals.WOCA Board of Directors There is also an Ovarian Cancer Medical Advisory Board.Ovarian Cancer Medical Advisory Board Support groups Ovarian Cancer Support Groups are available via WOCA in Metropolitan Milwaukee, Appleton, Madison and Waukesha .WOCA - Support Groups References External links  Gilda's Club Southeastern Wisconsin * Stillwaters Center - Cancer Support Services * Ovarian Cancer National Alliance * Category:Organizations based in Milwaukee Category:Ovarian cancer Category:2001 establishments in Wisconsin Category:Cancer charities in the United States Category:Medical and health organizations based in Wisconsin ","title":"Wisconsin Ovarian Cancer Alliance"},{"id":"24627690","text":"Pharaoh's Revenge is a puzzle/platform video game developed by Ivan Manley and released by Publishing International in 1988 for the Apple II, Commodore 64 and MS-DOS.

Along with Bernardo Pasquini and Alessandro Scarlatti, he was one of the leading composers active in Rome during the 17th century. He is also ranked among the second school of Roman opera composers which began with his brother's 1668 opera Il Girello. He is chiefly remembered today for his large output of liturgical music that he wrote while serving in various musical posts in Rome. Of particular interest is the large number of polychoral motets that he produced and his eight ascribed oratorios. Three published collections of his liturgical music survive today along with numerous solitary motets from other published volumes. A number of original manuscripts also survive. Biography Born in Pistoia, Melani began singing at the Pistoia Cathedral at the age of 11, remaining there for ten years until he became maestro di cappella in Orvieto in 1663 and Ferrara in 1665. He returned to Pistoia in December 1666 to replace his brother as maestro di cappella of the cathedral in June 1667. The following October he was appointed maestro di cappella of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. He remained there until July 1672 when he became the maestro at San Luigi dei Francesi, remaining in that role until his death 31 years later. Melani was a favorite composer of Cardinal Giulio Rospigliosi (later Pope Clement IX). The Papal conclave of 1667 commissioned him to write an opera (title now unknown) for Carnival of 1668. His next opera, L'empio punito (commissioned by Marie Mancini), premiered at Carnival a year later and was notably the first opera on the subject of Don Juan. In 1686 he collaborated with Scarlatti and Pasquini on the opera Santa Dimna. In 1685 he composed an oratorio, Golia abbattuto, for King John III of Poland. The work was written to celebrate the Holy League's victory against the Turks; he gained the commission through the efforts of Pope Innocent XI. This coupled with the fact that Alessandro‚Äôs nephews were made a part of the minor nobility in Tuscany around this time has caused some scholars to speculate that politics played a role in the events surrounding the 1685 commission. Melani wrote another notable oratorio in 1690, Lo scisma nel sacerdozio (now lost), for Francesco II d'Este. Of all the oratorios attributed to him the most frequently performed was Il fratricidio di Caino. He also enjoyed the patronage of Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and he was listed among the \\"celebrated professors of music protected by the Prince of Tuscany\\" in 1695. He died in Rome at the age of 64.

It is preserved in the left and bottom margins of a Latin legal treatise in a ninth- or tenth-century manuscript, where it is written upside down.The manuscript is #201 of the Biblioth√®que du Patrimoine de Clermont Auvergne M√©tropole. The poem is on folio 89v. See Fig. 1 in Paden and Paden, p. 14. Line 14 is missing, but has been supplied by the editors on the basis of the pattern of the final three lines. It has been edited and translated into English by William Doremus Paden and Frances Freeman Paden: { :Tomida femina :in tomida via sedea; :tomid infant :in falda sua tenea; :tomides mans :et tomidas pes, :tomidas carnes :que est colbe recebrunt; :tomide fust :et tomides fer :que ist√¶ colbe doner unt. :Exsunt en dolores :d'os en polpa :[de polpa en curi] :de curi in pel :de pel in erpa. :Terra madre susipiat dolores.Paden and Paden, p. 15. :A swollen woman :Sat in a swollen road; :A swollen child :She held in her lap; :Swollen hand :And swollen feet, :Swollen flesh :That will take this blow; :Swollen wood :And swollen iron :That will give this blow. :The pain goes out :From bone to flesh, :From flesh to skin, :From skin to hair, :From hair to grass; :Let mother earth receive the pain.Paden and Paden, p. 16. |} The meaning of the poetic charm, a \\"talking cure\\", is uncertain. Possibly it is intended as a cure for an edema. The swollen woman of line 1 and the swollen child of line 3 may both be patients, or perhaps only one of them. The charm transfers the swelling from the patient to wood and iron, possibly referring to medical instruments, and thence to the earth. On the other hand, the swollen woman and child \\"held in her lap\\" may refer to a pregnancy. The chanter may be the midwife. The poem's editors note the fittingness of an image of birth at the beginning of Occitan literature. Notes Sources *W. D. Paden and F. F. Paden. 2007. Troubadour Poems from the South of France.

It is named for its close proximity to Humboldt Bay. The large shopping facility is the only major mall located on the coast north of the San Francisco Bay Area, securing Eureka as the trading center for the entire far North Coast. History The mall was built in 1988 as demand for shopping grew in the North Coast Region of California. The original anchors were Mervyn's on the south end, Gottschalks on the west end, JCPenney on the east end, and Sears on the north end. Longs Drugs also operated a store at the mall, which was closed (having been relocated to the PayLess store purchased by Longs at the Eureka Mall nearby) and most of that space was converted to Petco in 2004. In the early 2000s, JCPenney downsized into an outlet store, then left the mall entirely. Bed, Bath, and Beyond, along with Borders Books, came in soon after and split the anchor space. Then, in late 2008, Mervyn's filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, and in turn, closed their Eureka store in December of that year. Gottschalks closed in July 2009, after filing Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, leaving just one anchor space filled. Kohl's officially opened up their new store at the old Mervyn's location on September 27, 2009. Old Navy and the Gap closed before The Movies, a branch of a local cinema entertainment company with other sites scattered over the region, closed in December 2009. Borders Books closed in September 2011 following bankruptcy. Following the purchase, plans to remodel the 73,000 square foot Gottschalks space were submitted to the City of Eureka by a contractor for Walmart during the summer of 2011, and opened June 12, 2012. Hometown Buffet closed on December 31, 2011. In late summer of 2013, TJ Maxx went into the mall where Borders had been. The same year ULTA Beauty and Sports Authority went where The Movies had been, and in 2014, Sbarro closed amid bankruptcy issues, while Ms. Clothing, a value clothing store, came in while Staples went into the mall where Hometown Buffet had been in September 2015. The Avenue and Wet Seal closed in January 2015, though Avenue never showed signs of a closeout or going out of business sign. A localized pizza place entered the mall in January 2015 in the former Sbarro's spot, later to be known as Hot Slice Pizzeria, with a clothes store, Salt Tree, going in a vacant lot (but leaving just a few weeks later along with long-time tenant RadioShack). Planet Fitness opened later in the year (though it was delayed until early 2016) where the half of Hometown Buffet had been. June 2016 saw Sports Authority close after just three years due to the company going bankrupt. In March 2017, Hot Slice Pizzeria closed, with a Mexican restaurant opening just a few weeks later in the same place. June 29, 2019 saw the return of Old Navy, going where Sports Authority had been, after leaving the mall in 2019. 2010 Eureka earthquake On January 9, 2010, a 6.5 earthquake struck off the coast of Eureka, about 27 miles out at sea, at 4:27 pm. The mall was among the buildings damaged by the quake, with loosened floor and ceiling tiles, as well as water damage from the sprinklers, but engineers found no structural damage. Bayshore Mall today Currently, the Bayshore mall has over 80 stores available with 70, and it is the largest shopping complex for over 200 miles. Anchor stores are Kohl's, and Walmart, which opened June 13, 2012, and TJ Maxx, which opened August 25, 2013. ULTA Beauty and Sports Authority opened in 2013, but Sports Authority declared Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in 2016. Old Navy returned to the mall in 2019, occupying the old Sports Authority space. Ray's Food Place, a full-service supermarket, was located in a separate building directly south of the Kohls entrance on the same property, but closed at the end of 2013 when parent company C&K; Markets declared Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. Other major stores include Ross Dress for Less, Bed Bath & Beyond, Petco, and Pier 1 Imports. The mall is served by the Eureka Transit Service and Redwood Transit Service. On August 31, 2019, it was announced that Sears would be closing this location a part of a plan to close 85 stores nationwide. The store closed on December 1, 2019. In January 2020, Pier 1 Imports announced it would close this location as part of a plan to close over 400 locations nationwide.

History  They belonged to high nobility originally from Hesse. The family is first mentioned in 1138 and has its ancestral seat in Hatzfeld. In 1418 the family inherited Wildenburg Castle near Friesenhagen, a Lordship with Imperial immediacy, from the Lords of Wildenburg. Melchior von Hatzfeld (1593‚Äì1658), Imperial field marshal in the Thirty Years' War, became the first count in 1635. He was enfeoffed with Trachenberg Castle in Silesia in 1641, and Gleichen Castle with the town of Wandersleben in Thuringia in 1651. Franz Phillip Adrian became the first Prussian F√ºrst (Prince of Hatzfeld-Gleichen-Trachenberg) in 1741 (the branch extinguished in 1794). The Hatzfeldt-Werther-Sch√∂nstein branch inherited Trachenberg and became Prussian Princes of Hatzfeldt and Trachenberg in 1803 and Prussian Dukes of Trachenberg in 1900 (still existing). They lost their estates, including Trachenberg, when Silesia became part of Poland in 1945, whose Communist government expelled most of Silesia's German population.

The route extends for from an interchange with I-81 in Pamelia to the main entrance of Fort Drum in Le Ray. It also has one intermediate interchange with U.S. Route 11 (US 11) just west of Fort Drum. I-781 is four lanes wide and serves as the principal travel corridor into and out of the post. The freeway is ceremoniously designated as the Paul Cerjan Memorial Highway in honor of Paul G. Cerjan, a late US Army Lieutenant General who oversaw a $1.2 billion expansion of Fort Drum in the 1980s. The original designation for I-781 was New York State Route 781 (NY 781). On April 13, 2009, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) designated NY 781 as a future Interstate Highway corridor and as \\"Future I-781\\". The I-781 designation officially took effect when the highway was completed and opened to traffic on December 6, 2012. Route description I-781 signage denoting its ending near Fort Drum I-781 begins at I-81 exit 48A, a trumpet interchange located north of exit 48 (NY 342) in the town of Pamelia. It proceeds to the east, roughly paralleling NY 342 as it heads toward Fort Drum. I-781 has one intermediate interchange with US 11 just west of Fort Drum before it terminates at Fort Drum's main gate. The highway is four lanes wide, with two lanes for each direction. History Origins and funding By 2003, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) had begun to evaluate potential ways to improve Fort Drum's access to I-81. Three alternatives were considered: the construction a new highway that would run north of NY 342 and directly connect I-81 to the main gate of Fort Drum; the construction of a new route to the south of NY 342 that would link I-81 to US 11 southwest of the post's main gate; and improving the existing NY 342. In November 2005, NYSDOT officials announced that the southern route had been chosen and that it would cost $64 million to construct. However, just two months later, NYSDOT announced that they now favored the northern alignment after receiving input from area residents and the United States Army. According to NYSDOT Commissioner Thomas Madison, the new alignment would have less of a negative impact on future development around Fort Drum and cost $7 million less to construct. The proposed highway was initially designated as NY 781 by NYSDOT. On February 11, 2008, NYSDOT submitted an application to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials requesting that NY 781 be designated as Interstate 781\\\\. The FHWA designated NY 781 as a future Interstate Highway corridor on April 13, 2009; however, the I-781 designation was not officially assigned at this time as per United States Code an Interstate Highway designation can only be assigned to a completed highway built to Interstate Highway standards. As a result, FHWA stipulated that the highway could only be referred to as \\"Future I-781\\" until I-781 was completed. The project received $724,000 in funding from the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) in June 2008. Another $1.425 million was granted by USDOT in January 2010. The project had been nominated to receive $95 million in funding through the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery grant program; however, the application was rejected in February 2010. NYSDOT officials had seen the funding as a way to free up money for other projects in the area rather than funding that was necessary to construct I-781. Much of the project‚Äîprojected to cost between $106 million and $113 million‚Äîwas funded through several state and local sources, with at least $16.6 million coming from NYSDOT. Construction and opening In April 2009, project engineers discovered that Indiana bats‚Äîan endangered species of bat‚Äîlive in the area in and surrounding the proposed right-of-way of the Fort Drum Connector (I-781). As a result, several concessions were made, including clearing trees during the winter season while the bats hibernate in caves, purchasing and setting aside land to replace those lands lost during construction, and leaving trees in the of land alongside the highway that would typically be cleared to serve as embankments. The last of the three changes preserved of forest. NYSDOT installed guardrails along the length of I-781 to make up for the narrower shoulders. The site preparation contract‚Äîwhich included the clearing of trees along the proposed I-781 right-of-way‚Äîwas awarded to The Delaney Group on December 26, 2009. Work on this portion of the project took place from February 2010 to May 31, 2010, and cost $722,000. NYSDOT had originally planned on opening the bidding process for the construction of I-781 itself on April 1, 2010; however, the date was pushed back to May 6 due to the lack of an approved state budget. The state previously had plans to award the contract as early as December 2009; however, the earlier date was conditional on the allocation of enough funds for the project by that time. On July 20, NYSDOT announced that a $56.5 million contract was let to Lancaster Development of Richmondville to construct the freeway. Work on the highway began the week of July 20 and a formal groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 4. Total completion of the project was originally slated for August 2012; however, it was ultimately pushed back to the end of November. The highway was opened to traffic on December 6, 2012. A formal ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held at a later date. On July 3, 2012, I-781 was ceremoniously designated as the Paul Cerjan Memorial Highway in honor of Paul G. Cerjan, a US Army Lieutenant General from Rome who died in April 2011. Cerjan was the Assistant Commander for Support of the 10th Mountain Division in the mid-1980s, during which time he developed and supervised a $1.2 billion project that expanded Fort Drum (the home base of the 10th Mountain Division) from a small reserve training center to a full military installation. Beginning with I-781, NYSDOT is using mileage-based exit numbering for all new Interstate Highway designations as part of the 2009 MUTCD regulations phasing in distance-based exit numbers. Exit 1, westbound only, initially used cardinal directions N-S for access to I-81; in 2015 the letters became A (northbound) and B (southbound).

Career Born in Karlovac (SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia), he started playing football since young age, along his elder brother Goran Bunjevƒçeviƒá who later became Serbian international. Their talent was soon spotted by the most prominent Croatian clubs HNK Hajduk Split and NK Dinamo Zagreb who brought them to their youth teams. Later, they moved to Serbian capital Belgrade, and, after playing for some period with FK Grafiƒçar Beograd, Goran, 5 years older, will begin his top flight career by joining FK Rad, playing back then in the First League of FR Yugoslavia, while Mirko continued playing in youth levels with FK Radniƒçki Beograd. After gaining some senior experience by playing one season with lower-league side IM Rakovica, his career will burst in 1998 when he joined FK Rad, a club that his brother successfully represented for four seasons and that led him to sign with local powerhouse Red Star Belgrade a year before Mirko arrived. However this period was much harder generally for football in Serbia, as the country experienced the Kosovo war, NATO bombing and major political turmoil during this time. Thus Mirko, after spending three seasons with Rad, moved for the first time abroad, by joining Slovenian side FC Koper in summer 2001. He will play two and a half seasons in the Slovenian First League, first two with Koper, and a half season with NK Mura.Profile and stats from Slovenia at PrvaLiga He played with Koper in the 2002 UEFA Intertoto Cup where they were defeated by Swedish side Helsingborgs IF (0‚Äì1; 0‚Äì0) in the first round. In early 2004 he signed a contract with FC Arsenal Kyiv starting a period of almost five years spent in the Ukrainian Premier League. He became a standard player in the team gathering 55 league appearances in two and a half years he spent in Kyiv. The club had mid table results, finishing 9th, 9th and 12th respectively in the seasons he spent there. He left Arsenal in summer 2006 and returned to Serbia where he was one of the signings of FK Hajduk Kula for their 2006‚Äì07 UEFA Cup campaign. However after a narrow away- goals defeat in their tied matches against Bulgarian PFC CSKA Sofia (1‚Äì1; 0‚Äì0) their European campaign came to an end. Mirko Bunjevƒçeviƒá played the rest of the first half of the season with Hajduk in the Serbian SuperLiga, but during the winter break he moved back to Ukraine reinforcing the newly promoted Premier League side FC Zorya Luhansk. The club surprisingly became a mid table regular mostly by combining domestic players with Bunjevƒçeviƒá and other signings. In summer 2009 he returned again to the Serbian SuperLiga, this time joining Belgrade-based FK ƒåukariƒçki Stankom, however, he will stay only half a season, as he will join during the winter break Azerbaijani side Olimpik Baku. The club was just entering into a new era, and it had just had their first ever European participation where they lost against, coincidentally, a Serbian side, FK Vojvodina. Soon after Mirko Bunjevƒçeviƒá joined them, the club was renamed for sponsorship reasons into AZAL PFC. During the 2009‚Äì10 season AZAL finished 7th in the league, however at beginning of the season a new coach Nazim Suleymanov was appointed and he started a revolution in the club, to which Mirko Bunjevƒçeviƒá much contributed in archiving the 4th place at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 Azerbaijan Premier League, as he was a starter in 31 of 32 league matches that season.Mirko Bunjevƒçeviƒá at Soccerway That result led them to the qualifiers for the 2011‚Äì12 UEFA Europa League, however their European campaign ended up in disappointment as they lost in the first qualifying round against Belorussian side FC Minsk (1‚Äì1; 1‚Äì2). As the spirit was high, before the matches had been played coach Suleymanov had promised to resign if the team ended defeated, and as the fortune was not on his side, he kept the promise and so he did. In the following winter break Mirko Bunjevƒçeviƒá also left. During the period he spent with AZAL the club had reached twice the semi-finals of the Azerbaijan Cup. Mirko Bunjevƒçeviƒá returned to Serbia during the winter break of the 2011‚Äì12 season, and he joined a historical side FK Zemun.Mirko Bunjevƒçeviƒá at Srbijafudbal They had been going through a major crisis as they had been relegated the summer before to the Serbian League Belgrade, one of four Serbian third level leagues.

This upper Tanana River valley has been called the \\"Tetlin Passage,\\" because it serves as a major migratory route for birds traveling to and from Canada, the lower 48 and both Central and South America. Many of these birds breed and nest on the refuge. Others pass through on their way to breeding and nesting grounds elsewhere in the state. Migrants, including ducks, geese, swans, cranes, raptors and songbirds, begin arriving in the valley in April, and continue into early June. An estimated 116 species breed on Tetlin during the short summer, when long days and warm temperatures accelerate the growth of plants, insects and other invertebrates, providing a ready source of rich foods for nesting birds. Tetlin Refuge also supports a variety of large mammals. Dall sheep dot the higher slopes while Alaskan moose feed upon the tender new growth that springs up in the wake of frequent lightning caused fires. Wolf packs, turkey vulture, Canadian lynx, tundra swan, red fox, peregrine falcon, coyote, beaver, golden eagle, marten, six species of owls, snowshoe hare, osprey, trumpeter swan, muskrat, bald eagle, river otter, grizzly bears and black bears and members of three different caribou herds range over the refuge.

Hailing from Grand Forks, North Dakota, they were a mere seventeen to twenty-three years of age, when they signed with the Tommy Dorsey Band, in 1944, to replace the popular Pied Pipers, after the Pipers had quit Dorsey's band to go out on their own. Although they never achieved the fame and fortune of some of their contemporaries (like the Andrews Sisters and the McGuire Sisters), the Clark Sisters' recordings are highly prized by jazz aficionados, for their unique vocal stylings in which they often emulate instrumental sections. Early history The Clark Sisters were born and raised in Grand Forks, North Dakota. They began singing as young children, and by the late 1930s were performing together in civic events and church services. After achieving some local fame, the sisters traveled by train to New York City, where they appeared several times on Major Bowes' Amateur Hour. Although they did not win, they did receive a contract to appear for several months in a USO show. Following their USO tour, they returned to New York. Tommy Dorsey was looking for a vocal quartet to replace one of his band's most popular features, the Pied Pipers: he had become angry at one of the Pipers for sending him in the wrong direction at the train station in Portland, Oregon, and fired him. The Pipers, out of \\"team loyalty,\\" resigned en masse. At that moment, the #1 record on the charts was \\"There Are Such Things\\" sung by Frank Sinatra and the Pied Pipers; the last RCA record they did with Dorsey. The sisters auditioned for Dorsey in their West Forty-Fifth Street apartment, where he offered them a job on the spot. Emerging Popularity Following their initial few appearances on Dorsey's radio program (for which they were not credited), he began to receive mail from listeners wondering about the identities of the new vocalists. Realizing he had a potential threat to the vocal domination of The Andrew Sisters, he made plans to build them into regular and featured appearances on his show. However, rather than allowing the Sisters to be billed under their own names, he re- christened them as \\"The Sentimentalists\\" - a name which he had previously utilized for a small instrumental combo. Since he \\"owned\\" the name, he was confident that he could avoid a repeat of the incident with the Pied Pipers. Although the Sisters had to begin by learning all of the Pipers' songs with the band, they were soon able to grow into their own artistic voice as well. This was helped along by the willingness of Dorsey's band members (particularly lead alto saxophonist and arranger Sid Cooper, as well as Nelson Riddle, guitarist Bob Bain, Sy Oliver and Buddy Defranco) to write and arrange musical numbers which featured the Sisters' talents to their fullest. The Sisters' \\"wholesome\\" good looks and extrovert personalities had endeared them to the members of Dorsey's band, who became their friends, and acted protectively towards them. Peggy Clark Schwartz (the widow of clarinetist Willie Schwartz of the Glenn Miller Orchestra), later recalled, in the Tommy Dorsey biography, authored by Peter J. Levinson, that she and her sisters may have been a little naive when they originally went to work for Dorsey: \\"In those days, you had to be young and stupid. You also had to be pretty needy ... it was almost comical when you look at it; it was part of the growing-up process!\\" While with Dorsey's Band, the Sisters had several hit records, including \\"I Should Care\\", \\"On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe\\", \\"On the Sunny Side of the Street\\", a version of \\"Chicago\\" (with Sy Oliver) and \\"Why Do I Love You?\\", from the musical Show Boat. Later years In 1953, the Clark Sisters made the decision to leave the Dorsey organization, primarily due to Dorsey's failure to pay them what they felt they were worth, as well as their desires to quit touring and devote themselves to family, and to recording. True to his original intentions, Dorsey refused to allow them to continue to use the \\"Sentimentalists\\" name, and would not allow them to reference in their publicity information that they had ever been known under that name. Despite this setback, the Sisters persisted and, in addition to continuing to perform well into the 1960s, they recorded three albums under the \\"Clark Sisters\\" name, and under the Coral Records label. In 1990 however, Jasmine Dream Records acquired the rights to the master tapes, and re-released the three albums, compiled into a single CD, titled, \\"The Clark Sisters Swing Again\\". The Clark Sisters also sang the original soundtrack to Walt Disney's \\"Tiki Room\\" at Disneyland. Peggy Clark Schwartz and Ann Clark Terry sang in the chorus' of many television shows including Judy Garland, Andy Williams, Carol Burnett and Sonny and Cher.

Career College Shipalane moved from his native South Africa to the United States in 2005 to attend and play college soccer at Lindsey Wilson College, where he was the 2006 NAIA Region XI Player of the Year and a three-time All-American. During his college years Shipalane was a member of the highly successful Michigan Bucks USL Premier Development League team. With the Bucks, Shipalane scored the winning goal in the 2006 PDL championship game, lost in the final of the 2007 PDL Championship game, and won the PDL regular season title in 2008. In total, he scored 11 goals in 49 appearances over three seasons with the team. Professional Shipalane trialled with Columbus Crew during the 2009 pre-season, but was not offered a contract by the team; instead, he was signed by the Harrisburg City Islanders of the USL Second Division. He made his professional debut on 18 April 2009 in Harrisburg's 2-2 opening day tie with the Richmond Kickers.

The term first came into use during the late 1970s due to an attempt by Burger King to generate increased market and mind- share by attacking the size of bigger rival McDonald's hamburgers. By the mid-1980s, the constant spending on advertising began to affect the major players. In 1987, Burger King laid off more than a hundred people from its corporate headquarters in Miami, Florida, while Dublin, Ohio-based Wendy's reported its first quarterly operating loss since its founding in 1969. Conversely, McDonald's operating revenue and profit increase while its market share also grew. Smaller chains, such as Hardee's, worked to keep from getting caught up in the extensive financial brinkmanship by avoiding the expensive ad campaigns and by staying in smaller, more geographically limited locations. The New York Times states that the poor economy of the late 2000s and early 2010s recessionary period has led to the return of the Burger Wars. Because of tightened budgets, consumers have been forced to seek value and the major fast food chains are in increasing competing for consumer dollars. The Wendy's chain has been at the forefront of the revival, airing a series of ads that feature founder Dave Thomas's daughter Melinda Lou Morse, the original \\"Wendy\\", advertising a series of new burgers and reviving its Where's the beef? advertising slogan. A March 2014 report in USA Today noted that Burger King is reviving the Burger Wars, including introducing clones of the Big Mac and McRib sandwiches, in response to business declines at McDonald's.Friedman, Nicky (March 19, 2014). Burger King hits McDonald's where it hurts. USA Today. Retrieved March 19, 2014. Modern examples In a 2007 advertising campaign, Jack in the Box aired a series of television ads in the United States that disparaged several rivals' Angus-beef burgers in which it was alleged that they equated Angus beef with an anus. Rival chain operator CKE claimed the ads were misleading because they confuse consumers by comparing sirloin, a cut of meat found on all cattle, with Angus, which is a breed of cattle. CKE, operator of the Carl's Jr. and Hardees chains, had been noted for running controversial ads and claimed that there was no comparison between the ads they were running and those of Jack In the Box because their ads did not insinuate their products came from an undesirable part of cows. Because of their similar preparation styles and menus, the expansion of Five Guys into the territories of its Los Angeles-based counterpart In-N-Out has been described as a newer version of the Burger Wars by several publications. Breakfast Wars The entry of Taco Bell into the breakfast fast-food business in 2014 for its United States locations triggered a related phenomenon known as the \\"Breakfast Wars\\", particularly between Taco Bell and McDonald's. Taco Bell rolled-out its breakfast menu by soliciting testimonials from people named Ronald McDonald, a move to which McDonald's responded by providing free coffee for a two-week period.Horovitz, Bruce (March 29, 2014). Breakfast wars perk up: McDonald's pours free coffee. USA Today. Retrieved March 29, 2014. Similarly, McDonald's Canada recently began offering free coffee for a week during Tim Hortons' \\"Roll Up the Rim to Win\\" campaign. Taco Bell's new value menu Dollar Cravings was instigated in reaction to McDonald's and Wendy's value menus. Burger King's McWhopper proposal On August 26, 2015, Burger King released an open letter to McDonald's proposing a joint promotion for Peace Day called the \\"McWhopper\\", a combination of the two restaurants' signature burgers. The overture was rejected by McDonald's, a response that drew mostly criticism for its tone and the sense of a missed opportunity. Despite the missed opportunity, President Barack Obama declared it a breaking point in the \\"Fight for $15\\" movement, reportedly saying that the \\"McWhopper\\" was an example of how American fast food corporations can learn to unite for a common cause, and he hoped it could be further utilized as a springboard in raising the minimum wage for uneducated fast food workers. McDonald's later released a commercial directed by comic filmmaker Mel Brooks to much critical acclaim, showcasing the charitable efforts of characters Ronald McDonald and the Hamburglar along with the promised effort to renew the \\"Fight for $15\\". On September 1, 2015, Burger King announced that they had been approached by representatives from Denny's, Wayback Burgers, Krystal, and Giraffas about partnering on a similar project. Burger King then announced the \\"Peace Day Burger\\", which would feature ingredients from all five restaurants' burgers.

Connections on modules are generalization of a linear connection on a smooth vector bundle E\\\\to X written as a Koszul connection on the C^\\\\infty(X)-module of sections of E\\\\to X.Koszul (1950)  Commutative algebra  Let A be a commutative ring and P an A-module. There are different equivalent definitions of a connection on P.Koszul (1950), Mangiarotti (2000) Let D(A) be the module of derivations of a ring A. A connection on an A-module P is defined as an A-module morphism : abla:D(A) i u\\\\to abla_u\\\\in \\\\mathrm{Diff}_1(P,P) such that the first order differential operators abla_u on P obey the Leibniz rule : abla_u(ap)=u(a)p+a abla_u(p), \\\\quad a\\\\in A, \\\\quad p\\\\in P. Connections on a module over a commutative ring always exist. The curvature of the connection abla is defined as the zero-order differential operator : R(u,u')=[ abla_u, abla_{u'}]- abla_{[u,u']} \\\\, on the module P for all u,u'\\\\in D(A). If E\\\\to X is a vector bundle, there is one-to-one correspondence between linear connections \\\\Gamma on E\\\\to X and the connections abla on the C^\\\\infty(X)-module of sections of E\\\\to X. Strictly speaking, abla corresponds to the covariant differential of a connection on E\\\\to X.  Graded commutative algebra  The notion of a connection on modules over commutative rings is straightforwardly extended to modules over a graded commutative algebra.Bartocci (1991), Mangiarotti (2000) This is the case of superconnections in supergeometry of graded manifolds and supervector bundles. Superconnections always exist.  Noncommutative algebra  If A is a noncommutative ring, connections on left and right A-modules are defined similarly to those on modules over commutative rings.Landi (1997) However these connections need not exist. In contrast with connections on left and right modules, there is a problem how to define a connection on an R-S- bimodule over noncommutative rings R and S. There are different definitions of such a connection.Dubois-Violette (1996), Landi (1997) Let us mention one of them. A connection on an R-S-bimodule P is defined as a bimodule morphism : abla:D(A) i u\\\\to abla_u\\\\in \\\\mathrm{Diff}_1(P,P) which obeys the Leibniz rule : abla_u(apb)=u(a)pb+a abla_u(p)b +apu(b), \\\\quad a\\\\in R, \\\\quad b\\\\in S, \\\\quad p\\\\in P.

Established in 1767, it had a long history as a Madrasi unit but in 1902 enlistment was changed in an attempt to trial the employment of Coorg tribesmen in the Indian Army. This was not a success and the regiment was disbanded two years later. Early history Until 1901 the regiment was designated as the 11th Madras Infantry. In 1902 the regiment was reorganised and the basis of recruitment changed from Tamil and Telugu to Coorg soldiers. The Coorgs had not previously been recruited into the Indian Army and this conversion was seen as a test of both their availability and suitability for military service. The origins of the regiment could be traced to 1767, when it was raised as the 15th Battalion Coast Sepoys. The regiment served in the Third Anglo-Mysore War but saw no more active service during the nineteenth century. Establishment as Coorg regiment The restructured regiment was renamed the 71st Coorg Rifles in 1903, and given dark green uniforms with scarlet facings. Red fezzes, which were an unusual item of uniform in the Indian Army, are reported to have been worn by the sepoys. Subsequently described as \\"an-out-of-the-run unit\\"W.Y. Carman, page 226 \\"Indian Army Uniforms - Infantry\\" and \\"an experiment that failed\\", they were disbanded in 1904 because of insufficient recruits.John Gaylor, page 9 \\"Sons of John Company\\", The mess funds and silver were bequeathed to the newly raised 2/9th Gurkha Rifles.W.Y. Carman, page 226 \\"Indian Army Uniforms - Infantry\\" Subsequent recruitment During World War I the rapid expansion of the Indian Army led to a further attempt to enlist members of the Coorg community. No attempt was made to recreate a class regiment but 700 Coorgs were recruited for service in various southern Indian units. Surveys indicated that there were only 4,000 Coorg males of military age at that time.Peter Kersten, page 112 \\"Recruiting, Drafting and Enlisting: Two Sides of the Raising of Military Forces\\" In 1942 Coorgs were again recruited, into the newly raised 1st Coorg Battalion. Like the 71st Coorg Rifles, the new battalion had a badge incorporating crossed Coorg knives. In 1946 it was converted to the 37 (Coorg) Anti-Tank Regiment Unit of the Royal Indian Artillery. It is now a part of the modern Indian Regiment of Artillery.

It manages an education program on essential health issues in schools, slums and villages of Uttar Pradesh (India) thanks to auto-produced multimedia educational movies. It also gives health care and supplies free medicines to penniless people at its charitable hospital and two hospices.Ramakrishna Mission Home of ServiceAbout us . History Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service was created in 1900 by a group of young men at Varanasi, inspired by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda, in a very modest way with 4 annas (0,25 rupees) as capital which they got by begging. The Home of Service was started by three friends - Jamini Ranjan Majumdar, Charuchandra Das (later Swami Shubhananda) and Kedarnath Moulik (later Swami Achalananda). On 13 June 1900, Jamini Ranjan nursed an old lady pilgrim who was left to die on the way side and begged food to feed her. Later he got her admitted to Bhelurpur hospital and arranged for her treatment by collecting necessary funds for her treatment. The group searched for suffering and helpless people on the streets and roads of Varanasi and their principle was to serve them as God, in line with the philosophy propounded by Swami Vivekananda. Thus they formed an organisation called Orphanage or Poor Men's Relief Association. The money for medicines, beds, blankets and other necessities were obtained by individual contributions or by begging. On 13 September 1900, a house was rented for Rs 5/- per month in Ramapura. As the work expanded the hospital was shifted to a bigger place and attracted attention of the prominent citizens. Swami Vivekananda, when he visited Varanasi in February, 1902, was immensely impressed to see the dedicated service of those poor but determined youth and wrote an appeal for funds. He also instructed the group to name the hospital as Ramakrishna Sevashrama or Home of Service. The Sevashrama was affiliated to Ramakrishna Mission on 23 November 1902 and was renamed as Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service. Sister Nivedita went from door to door to collect funds for the sevashrama after Swami Vivekananda died in 1902. Swami Shivananda, who established the Adviata Ashrama in Benares, adjacent to the Home of Service was also a great source of inspiration. In 1903 the President of the Ramakrishna Order, Swami Brahmananda visited the ashrama and wanted to construct a permanent building. Eventually, the present land in the Luxa area of Varanasi was purchased in 1908. Upendra Narayan Deb and Tarini Charan Pal paid for the land. Swami Brahmananda laid the foundation stone and inaugurated the new building on 7 May 1910. The building was designed by Swami Vijnanananda. The new building had six general wards and three isolation wards to accommodate 46 patients. The local Government approved a grant of Rs 120/- annually. The home had the unique privilege to be blessed by the visit of Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi on 8 November 1912. She donated a ten rupee note to the sevashrama as a token of her approval for the service rendered to the poor as God. Most of the direct disciples of Sri Ramakrishna visited the Sevashrama including Swami Premananda, Swami Shivananda, Swami Brahmananda, Swami Saradananda, Swami Turiyananda and Swami Akhandananda. As the years went by, the Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service grew in all proportions. New service wings were added. Today this multi-dimensional institution of service (a 230 bedded General Hospital) sprawls into an area of and specially caters to the needs of the rural poor and underprivileged patients. Health Promotion Program The Health Promotion Program started in 2000, and very soon gained the support of famous organisations, such as the World Health Organization, the European Commission, the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, the British Medical Association and the National Institute of Urban Affairs. It aims at the poor populations from the area of Varanasi, and provides them health education (especially through the Multimedia Health Education Program) but also attends to their essential health needs. In the end, the program's purpose is to ensure a healthy environment for these populations, for their bodies as well as for their minds. Principles *To render selfless service as means to purification of mind, which leads to spiritual realisation. *To look upon all men, women and children, irrespective of caste, creed, colour or nationality as the veritable manifestations of the lord, as taught by Sri Ramakrishna and worship them as such by trying to remove their wants and sufferings. *To serve those who have none to help when dark days of disease, old age and starvation overtake them and make them feel the want of a friendly hand more than ever before. *To give all possible relief to the destitute lying in the streets and bathing ghats by admitting them into the Home and giving them medicine aid, diet etc., till their recovery.

The regiment's origin could be traced to 1794, when it was raised as the 35th Madras Battalion. At the beginning of the 20th century the basis for recruitment was changed from Madrasis to Moplahs - a Muslim Dravidian people located along the coast of Malabar. The Moplahs had a reputation as an aggressive race and it was hoped to make use of their martial skills in the Indian Army. A problem from the beginning was that the population numbers available for recruitment were limited.John Gaylor, page 9 Sons of John Company, In 1907, shortly before disbandment, the regiment numbered only 350 men. Two battalion-sized regiments of Moplah Rifles were accordingly raised (the 77th and 78th MR) and the second of these was posted to the North West Frontier in 1905 to be tested under active-service conditions. The experiment was not considered as being a success.John Gaylor, page 9 Sons of John Company, In part this was because of difficulties experienced by British officers in learning the Moplah language, which did not include any military terms.W.Y. Carman, page 226, Indian Army Uniforms Under the British - Artillery, Engineers and Infantry, Morgan-Grampian London 1969 Another problem reported was that the Moplah sepoys, acclimatized to the moist humidity of southern India, suffered severely from the dry climate of the Punjab frontier.paragraph 9, Indian Office Records and Private Papers, Ref IOR/L/MIL/7015-7235, 28 June 1906 In the year that the Moplahs became the 2nd Moplah Rifles (1902), a detachment was shipped to England for the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. They attracted attention, in part because of their scarlet zouave jacketsW.Y. Carman, page 9 Sons of John Company, and red tarbushes - a headdress not previously worn by the Indian Army.W.Y. Carman, page 226, Indian Army Uniforms Under the British - Artillery, Engineers and Infantry, Morgan-Grampian London 1969 The last two annual reports on the Moplah Rifles were negative, stating that 'fanaticism' amongst the sepoys made these units unsuitable for garrison duties in Madras.Paragraph 9 of Government of India despatch No 56 of 28 June 1906 In view of the problems faced by the 78th MR when posted to the North-West Frontier Province, service with the field army was not considered a feasible alternative.

Si nanotubes created by etching of Si-covered ZnO nanowires. Si nanotubes produced using a carbon template. Clockwise: carbon fiber; carbon fiber coated with silicon; silicon oxide tube remaining after removing the carbon core; covering the silicon oxide with poly-crystalline silicon. Scale bars 200 nm Silicon nanotubes are nanoparticles which create a tube-like structure from silicon atoms. As with silicon nanowires, they are technologically important due to their unusual physical properties, which differ fundamentally to those of bulk silicon. First reports on silicon nanotubes appeared around the year 2000. Synthesis One method to prepare silicon nanotubes is using a reactor employing an electric arc without the use of any catalyst. To ensure purity, the reactor is evacuated and filled with the nonreactive noble gas argon. The actual formation of the nanotubes relies on the process of chemical vapor deposition. A more common laboratory-scale method involves the use of germanium, carbon or zinc oxide nanowires as a template. Silicon, coming typically from either silane or silicon tetrachloride gas, is then deposited onto the nanowires, and the core is dissolved leaving behind a silicon tube. The growth of template nanowires, silicon deposition and nanowire etching, and consequently the geometry of resulting Si nanotubes, can be accurately controlled in the second method; however, the smallest inner diameter is limited by tens of nanometers. The conventional vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) and solid-liquid-solid (SLS) mechanisms are favorite techniques to grow one-dimensional silicon nanostructures. However, they usually incorporate only one type of metal as catalyst and therefore can not be used for growing tubular (hollow) silicon nanostructures. In a recent attempt, a nickel-gold bilayer catalyst layer has been used to take the advantage of the uneven growth rate of constituent metal catalysts. Using these modified VLS and SLS techniques, multiwall silicon nanotubes with a sidewall thickness of few nanometers have been grown. Applications As the result of Ballistic conductivity, silicon nanotubes and nanowires have been considered for use in electronics, e.g. in thermoelectric generators. Since the structure can accommodate molecules of hydrogen so it might resemble coal without the CO2, it appears that silicon nanomaterials may behave like a metal fuel. A silicon nanotube charged with hydrogen delivers energy and in the process leaves residual water, ethanol, silicon and sand. However, as hydrogen production requires considerable energy, this is only a proposed method of storing energy, not producing it. Silicon nanotubes and silicon nanowires can be used in lithium-ion batteries. Conventional Li-ion batteries use graphitic carbon as the anode, but replacing this with silicon nanotubes experimentally increases the specific (by mass) anode capacity by a factor of 10 (though the overall capacity improvement is lower due to the far lower specific cathode capacities).McDermott, Mat. (2009-09-23) Li-Ion Battery Breakthrough: Silicon Nanotubes Boost Capacity 10x. TreeHugger. Retrieved on 2015-11-13. Another emerging application of silicon nanotube is light emission. Since silicon is an indirect band gap semiconductor, the quantum yield of radiative recombination in this material is very low. As the thickness of silicon-based nanostructures reduces below the effective Bohr radius (about 9 nm, in silicon) the quantum efficiency of light emission from this material increases owing to the quantum confinement effect. Relying on this fact, photoemission capability of silicon nanotubes with very thin sidewalls has been demonstrated.

Today, in addition to schools, HDF operates orphanages and homes for street kids, assists children and adults living with AIDS, provides emergency assistance and home repair to slum families affected by crippling floods and fires, acts in cooperation with community members to mediate activities involving welfare organizations, housing authorities, governmental agencies, and the Port Authority of Thailand. In 2000, a gift from Atlanta businessman and philanthropist John M. Cook allowed for the major physical expansion of Mercy facilities. The multi-structure compound includes a 400-pupil kindergarten, a home for street kids, a home for mothers and children with AIDS, a 26-bed free AIDS hospice, a legal aid anti-trafficking unit, and various administrative offices that oversee operations ranging from a sponsor-a-child program, to community health and outreach services. The centre includes a house for Father Joe on Mercy grounds, the terms of the donation having stipulated that he move out of the slaughterhouse slums and away from the ostensible health hazards of slum living.

Tung Lin Kok Yuen is a Buddhist nunnery and educational institution located at No.15 Shan Kwong Road in Happy Valley, Hong Kong. Founded in 1935 by Lady Clara Ho-Tung, it is home to approximately 30 nuns and 50 lay devotees.Welch, Holmes. Buddhist Organisations in Hong Kong, pg. 107. It is the only seminary for Buddhist nuns in Hong Kong and provides an 8-year curricular programme in Mahayana Buddhism. It contains both a primary day and primary night school, the Po Kok Vocational Middle School, and a separate branch of primary schools in the New Territories. In all institutions a study of Buddhist Sutras is given, but other subjects, depending on the location, include Mathematics, English, Chinese and History. All said institutions are female-only, and the total enrolment is 1,256. A large draw to Tung Lin is its two halls housing memorial tablets for the deceased. Each Remembrance Day, Tung Lin hosts a public service for the souls of the dead there.Notes and Queries: Visit to the Tung Lin Kok Yuen, Tam Kung Temple, Happy Valley, and Tin Hau Temple, Causeway Bay, 7 November 1970. Similarly, there have been famous courses offered several times a year at the seminary, taught by authorities from the Sangha. These courses last several weeks each session. Both events are sponsored by the Hong Kong Buddhist Association.  History  In 1931, Lady Clara Cheng Lin Kok (wife of Sir Robert Ho Tung) received a sum of $100,000 from her husband as a gift for their 50th wedding anniversary. During that period, China faced civil war and social disputes, causing many tragedies and chaos in the society. Lady Clara Lin Kok, who was a faithful believer in Buddhism, decided to use the anniversary gift to establish a base for the propagation of Buddha's teaching. Her vision and goals are to promote social harmony and to build a school so as to allow children of poverty to receive education with Buddhism teachings.Tung Lin Kok Yuen official webpage The location was selected to be in vibrant Happy Valley. The twelve thousand square feet plot of land where now the temple stands, was purchased from the Hong Kong Government by Lady Clara. She had also invited Ven. Aiting (), who had retired as the abbot of the Bamboo Grove Monastery, also called Zhulin Temple (), to supervise the construction project. Ven. Aiting at the same time was invited to give dharma talks to the community. The temple is named after Lady Clara and Sir Robert Ho Tung, in memory for her husband's support of her charity work and also his virtuous acts.History of Tung Lin Kok Yuen Part 3 Tung Lin Kok Yuen's construction was finally completed in 1935, comprising a Buddhist temple and Po Kok Free School, first free Buddhist school for girls in Hong Kong. As the number of students outgrew the spaces available in the temple building, a new school building was built next to Tung Lin Kok Yuen in 1951 which held the Po Kok Vocational Middle School.  Lady Clara Lin Kok  Lady Clara Lin Kok Lady Clara Lin-Kok (1875‚Äì1938) was the second of two wives of Sir Robert. She married him in 1895. She was the mother to ten children, 7 daughters and 3 sons. Lady Clara Lin-Kok, supported by Sir Robert, invested a considerable amount of time and energy in her life to the establishment of diverse charitable activities aimed at assisting and alleviating the sufferings of the infirmed, disadvantaged and underprivileged. Her charitable acts were largely inspired by her belief in, and devotion to, the Buddhist faith.  Realization of Buddhism  The suffering that Lady Clara experienced in her life has made her devotion to Buddhism stronger as she held on to her faith while going through the tough times. The early death of her eldest son, serious illness contracted by her immediate family, such as Sir Robert Ho Tung contracting a serious case of pneumonia, her parent's death and her throat condition had energised her faith greatly.History of Tung Lin Kok Yuen Part 1 She sought relief of suffering by continually reciting the name of Buddha and found herself in a state of peace, comprehending the realities of human suffering.  Dedication to Buddhism  Lady Clara made the Bodhisattva vow ‚Äì that she would commit her life to help alleviate the sufferings of all sentient beings at Putuo Shan, when she was there with her eldest daughter, who had then just recovered from post natal depression. Her husband supported her fully in her decision. After returning to Hong Kong, Lady Clara contacted followers to promote Dharma activities in the colony. Some of these activities include a seven-day retreat in 1922, where she invited many reputable and prominent monks to Hong Kong to spread teachings of Dharma and a series of talk on Mahayana Buddhism, lasting three months in 1925, addressing the misconceptions and misrepresentation of the Buddhist teachings in the colony.History of Tung Lin Kok Yuen Part 2 All the events attracted many believers and the response was positive. Lady Clara travelled widely to visit esteemed monasteries to pursue her journey to truth. She visited in total twenty one famous mountains and other famous monasteries such as Mount Wutai and Mount Lao.  Contribution to society  Lady Clara herself did not have much education and she did not want the future generation to follow her footsteps. She believed that education for women is essential for advancement of social stability.Tung Lin Kok Yuen Introduction webpage She founded the Po Kok First Free school in Hong Kong in 1930 and soon after Po Kok Second Free school was started in Macau too. The primary purpose of these schools was to provide practical education to women in the society so as to promote greater independence. Lady Clara Lin-Kok wholly dedicated the latter part of her life to promoting Buddhist education at Tung Lin Kok Yuen. She worked diligently until the day of her death in 1938. To continue her mission in posterity she nominated successors to posts in Tung Lin Kok Yuen's board of directors in her will.  Construction and design  Traditional Chinese architecture style. In 1935 the same year that Tung Lin Kok Yuen was completed, the Po Kok School and the Society for the Study of Buddhism were merged under the one roof and operated out of the temple premises. The building itself while not very old, is of special interest because many of the religious images, furniture and fittings survived the Japanese occupation when very little else in the colony did.Anonymous 1970, Notes and Queries: A visit to Tung Lin Kok Yuen, pp. 184‚Äì197.  Interior design and style  Tung Lin Kok Yuen contains a dharma hall, lecture theatre, library, sutra hall, dining hall, ancestral hall and dormitories. One main feature of Tung Lin Kok Yuen is the amazing and valuable collection of calligraphy and Chinese-style couplets written by renowned personages.Tung Lin Kok Yuen Italian stained glass window in Tung Lin Kok Yuen. The fittings inside the building were mostly carried out by Shanghainese craftsmen who also worked on Sir Robert Hotung's house on the Peak. Within the Yuen there are two halls which are devoted to the maintenance of memorial tablets for the dead. One of these is part of the original building and the other was made later as an extension in 1959. The construction style of Tung Lin Kok Yuen is a fusion between the traditional oriental elegance and classical western construction elements. The imported Italian stained windows resemble those typically used in churches.Êâ∂ÊûóÊôöÈ¢®‚ÄßÊù±ËìÆË¶∫ËãëÁöÑ‰øùËÇ≤Â∑•Á®ã: Wen Wei Pao Conventional architectural features of imperial palaces such as curved ceramic tiled roofs are prominent and the mixture of different styles give Tung Lin Kok Yuen its own unique characteristics. The appearance of the entire temple is shaped like a boat, which matches with the symbolism that Buddha will guide the people in the sea of suffering to the way of light.  Classification as Historical Building  Historical buildings, site and ancient structures in Hong Kong may be legally protected under the Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance. The procedure for declaring a building or site to be protected is fully contained in the legislation. In brief, the Antiquities Authority may, after consulting the Antiquities Advisory Board, with the approval of the Chief Executive and publication of notice in the government gazette to declare protection of a place. In practice, the Chief Executive will also consult the Executive Council in controversial case.Antiquities and Monuments Office official webpage Tung Lin Kok Yuen has been classified as a Grade I Historical building in Hong Kong. According to the guidelines issued by Antiquities Advisory Board and the Antiquities and Monuments Office, Grade I is defined as \\"Buildings of outstanding merit, which every effort should be made to preserve if possible.\\" When a building is selected to be classified, extensive repairs and restoration work would be conducted if needed by the government in order to preserve the historical heritage. Tung Lin Kok Yuen, although only 70 odd years old, suffers from groundwater infiltration, which degenerates the teak floor layer. The conservation work performed in the temple include recovering of concrete foundation and teak flooring; insertion of plastic between ground and concrete foundation; and adding of underground drainage system. All these work aim to facilitate the discharge of underground water and prevent infiltration.  Present uses  Tung Lin Kok Yuen is currently used to advance the cause of Buddhism and managing the respective schools under the Po Kok team.\\"Tung Lin Kok Yuen n.d, The Tung Lin Kok Yuen by Buddhist Door, Hong Kong, Hong Kong.\\" The temple is also concerned with the practical needs of the community and social projects which will benefit it. Examples of these projects include the publication of the Lin Kok Quarterly Journal and the \\"Lin Kok Collection\\" which uses both Chinese and non-Chinese scholars to discuss and reflect on the true meaning of life. The Yuen also contributes financial aid toward the Hong Kong Society for the Aged and the construction of an aged care facility and also the Mental Health Association of Hong Kong and its work on mental health rehabilitation. Regular classes in advanced studies of Buddhism, classes in Buddhist hymns, classes in meditation and so forth are also offered at the Yuen.  Po Kok Schools  Po Kok Primary School. Lady Clara Ho Tung officially established the Po Kok Free School for Girls in Causeway Bay in Hong Kong and Macau in 1931.Zhuang Pinghui, 19 March 2005, \\"School back from brink regains aid\\", South China Morning Post p. 3 In 1935 the school was moved to a temple also founded by Lady Clara in Happy Valley, next to its present site in Tung Lin Kok Yuen.Hui, Polly, 9 June 2004, Po Kok a tribute to crusading women,South China Morning Post, p. 1. The school facilities aimed to provide women with the opportunity to receive education and also promote Buddhism. In 2004 the Po Kok Primary School faced trouble and was ordered to cease operating its Primary One class due to lack of enrolment, however after an out-of-court settlement the school was allowed to continue the class with its own funding In 2005 the school met the threshold of 23 student needed for operation. Overall the Temple has three schools in its management: the Po Kok Secondary School in Tseung Kwan O, Po Kok Primary in Happy Valley and Po Kok Branch School in Hung Shui Kiu, Yuen Long. Historical figures show that education standards are high at Po Kok Schools, in 1959 and 1960 over 90 per cent of each graduating class of the middle school passed the Chinese School- leaving certificate examination and nearly a third of those achieved a distinction.Gittens, Jean 1969, \\"Eastern windows, Western skies\\", South China Morning Post Press Pty. Ltd., pp. 106‚Äì107.  Tung Lin Kok Yuen, Canada Society  Tung Lin Kok Yuen, Canada Society is a non-profit charitable organisation registered with the Government of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario.Tung Lin Kok Yuen old Official Webpage It was established in Vancouver, British Columbia by current chairman of the board of directors of Tung Lin Kok Yuen, Robert H. N. Ho. in 1994, aiming to promote Buddhist education internationally. Location The Tung Lin Kok Yuen, Canada Society headquarters is on Victoria Drive, not far from downtown Vancouver. Vancouver was chosen as an ideal location for the first international branch of Tung Lin Kok Yuen because of the large number of immigrants, many of Chinese ethnicity there. Tung Lin Kok Yuen, Canada Society was therefore founded to meet the religious needs of the population as well as to provide an accessible venue for Buddhists and general public to come together and share the value of Buddhism. Indeed, the establishment of the Canada society coincided with a period of marked increase in the number of Buddhists residing in Vancouver ‚Äì official figures recording a rise of 84% in the ten-year period spanning 1991 to 2001. Structure and facilities The temple is a contemporary building of over twenty thousand square feet and consists of two main sections. One houses a Worship Hall, Longevity Hall (Hall of the Medicine Buddha), Meditation Hall, Memorial Hall, library, offices, living quarters, vegetarian kitchen and a Multi-Purpose Hall which can be used for conferences, exhibitions, cultural performances, lectures and seminars. This section also houses a retail shop selling Buddhist artefacts. Another section houses an ancestral hall, a function hall, small meditation rooms as well as a garden. Tung Lin Kok Yuen Foundation In 2004, the Tung Lin Kok Yuen Foundation was established. The aim of the establishment is to promote Buddhist education to the tertiary education sector in Canada and since 2005, several Canadian universities have been sponsored by the foundation for their Buddhist programs.Buddhist Education Part 3 Robert Hung-Ngai Ho established the foundation aiming to form a \\"global network\\" of Buddhist studies scholars and institutions, making maximum use of modern communication technologies. His goal is to establish Centres of Buddhist Studies at major universities in the globe which can share and exchange information according to each speciality in the school. Such centres have already been established in Hong Kong and Canada, and there has been plans to expand such network to universities in the U.S. and Europe.

The actual launch date of the \\"Sport\\" is somewhat uncertain, however it must undoubtedly be one of the two earliest generally available SLR cameras using the 35mm film format, the other being the German Ihagee Kine Exakta, launched in 1936. It was manufactured by the Soviet camera factory Gosudarstvennyi Optiko-Mekhanicheskii Zavod, The State Optical- Mechanical Factory in Leningrad. GOMZ for short. The camera name is engraved in Cyrillic on the finder housing above the lens: ‚Äû–°–ø–æ—Äm‚Äú. The manufacturer's prism logo in gold on black with the factory initials –ì–û–ú–ó (GOMZ) is shown behind a circular magnifying window on the top left camera front. An estimated number of 16,000 cameras were made before Leningrad was besieged in September 1941 and suffered heavy damage. The design concept was not continued later. The development of the \\"Sport\\" was a lengthy process. It started out as the MINE in 1929, named after its designer A. A. Mine. The MINE inspired the pre- production Gelveta design that possibly also was engraved \\"Sport\\", which turned into the \\"Sport\\" production model. The B and 1/25 to 1/500 second focal-plane shutter employs a pair of metal plates, which form a vertical rising slit during exposure. The slit width determines the exposure. The shutter operation incorporates a quick-rising non-returning reflex mirror. The combined shutter speed dial and wind-on knob, situated on the right-hand side, is stationary during exposure. The film transport is from cassette to cassette, no rewind is provided. The original pair of cassettes would take enough film for fifty exposures. A manual-reset frame counter is at the base of the wind-on knob. The camera has an eye-level vertical viewfinder for looking down onto the focusing screen, as well as a built-in direct vision \\"action finder\\".

The Chiefton of Vijayapathi named Asiriya Perumal set fire to this church in 1597. But, it was rebuilt in 1603. Fr. John Pereira, a Jesuit Priest, who took charge of Periathalai as parish priest in 1635, laid foundation for a new church considering the growing population. For the new church which was completed in 1639, St. Stephen also was made as another patron saint. The ancient church began to deteriorate, People wanted to build a new church and Bishop Roche laid foundation for it. However, it took a long time before Fr. Dasan Dalmeida could actually start the work for the new church on 13 November 1963 . This triangular shaped church was consecrated and inaugurated for worship by Bishop Ambrose on the day of the Pentecost, that is on 14 May 1978 . The old church was totally destroyed and in that place is built a Wedding Hall.

The horizontal axis of both charts is geographic distance as measured along likely routes of human migration. The upper graph illustrates that as populations are further from East Africa (represented by the city of Addis Ababa), they have declining genetic diversity as measured in average number of microsatellite repeats at each of the loci. The bottom chart measures the genetic distance between all pairs of populations according to the Fst statistic. Populations separated by greater distance are more dissimilar than those that are geographically close. Isolation by distance (IBD) is a term used to refer to the accrual of local genetic variation under geographically limited dispersal The IBD model is useful for determining the distribution of gene frequencies over a geographic region. Both dispersal variance and migration probabilities are variables in this model and both contribute to local genetic differentiation. Isolation by distance is usually the simplest model for the cause of genetic isolation between populations. Evolutionary biologists and population geneticists have been exploring varying theories and models for explaining population structure. Yoichi Ishida compares two important theories of isolation by distance and clarifies the relationship between the two. According to Ishida, Sewall Wright's isolation by distance theory is termed ecological isolation by distance while Gustave Mal√©cot's theory is called genetic isolation by distance. Isolation by distance is distantly related to speciation. Multiple types of isolating barriers, namely prezygotic isolating barriers, including isolation by distance, are considered the key factor in keeping populations apart, limiting gene flow. Sewall Wright- Ecological Isolation By Distance Wright introduced two different models of population structure, one not taking short- distance dispersal into account and one model incorporating short-distance dispersal. The \\"island model\\" is quite artificial and proposes the idea that a population is divided into two geographically, unique subpopulations (islands) with random mating occurring with exchange of individuals occurring when a migrant is drawn randomly from the total population. In a more realistic model, where short-distance dispersal is taken into account, a population is compiled of continuously distributed individuals over a region of space. Populations in remote locations may become differentiated simply by isolation by distance, restricting the probability of individuals mating with one another. Local populations are small in comparison to the total population and reproduction occurs solely within the local population. This ecological isolation by distance, according to Wright, can create genetic differentiation among subpopulations, leading to evolutionary change. Individuals within the subpopulation are neighbors in the sense that their gametes may come together and inbreeding within the subpopulation increases homozygosity. Wright's statistical theory for isolation by distance looks at population genetic consequences measured by F-statistics where the correlation of randomly uniting gametes within a subpopulation relative to those of the total population is the FST value. F_{ST}=\\\\frac{Var(q_{ST})}{q_{T}(1-q_{T})} The equation takes into account the variance in the distribution (var), the allele frequency within the total population (qT), and the allele frequency within the subpopulation (qST). Neighborhood size affects the local genetic differentiation (FST). Higher FST values indicate greater local genetic differentiation Gustave Mal√©cot- Genetic Isolation By Distance Mal√©cot's theory refers to a population genetic pattern where genetic differentiation among individuals increases as geographical distances increases. Dispersal is normally localized in space, lending to the expectation that individuals from closer subpopulations will be more genetically similar. Mal√©cot argues that neighborhood size is not important because a decrease in the kinship coefficient does not depend on neighborhood size. This probabilistic theory solely depends on distances between that of offspring and their parents. A population, at equilibrium, displays genetic isolation by distance with stochastic processes producing genetic isolation. This genetic isolation by distance theory involves concepts of gametic kinship chains, identity by descent, and migration probabilities. The kinship coefficient (œÜ) is the probability that two homologous loci are identical by descent. \\\\frac{\\\\varphi(r)}{\\\\varphi(0)}=e^{-r\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2k}}{\\\\sigma}} The equation takes into account distance (r), mutation rate (k), and the standard deviation of migration (œÉ). The kinship coefficient decreases as a function of distance and if a mutation occurs in either locus or if the gamete kinship chain is zero, the kinship coefficient will be zero. Yoichi Ishida interprets alteration in neighborhood size as alteration in dispersal variance linking both Wright's statistical theory and Mal√©cot's probabilistic theory explaining why they both invite similar conclusions. Alteration in neighborhood size is alteration in dispersal variance and alteration corresponds to alteration in the variance of the probability of distribution associated with migration probabilities. Both dispersal variance and migration probabilities contribute to local genetic differentiation. Alternate Models to Isolation by Distance Both adaptive and nonadaptive processes play a part, individually or acting together, and create variation in populations and species. Understanding the roles of both processes has been a central goal in biology. As previously described, gradual genetic drift across populations (isolation by distance) and limited gene dispersal can account for some of the genetic and phenotypic divergence across populations, but there are alternative models besides isolation by distance that can contribute to these differences as well. Two of these alternate models include isolation by colonization and isolation by adaptation. The former is a product of colonization history and founder effects while the latter is a product of adaption to varying environments inhibiting migration between populations. A recent scientific article (Spurgin et al., 2014) tried to differentiate between these processes by utilizing island populations of Anthus berthelotii (Berthelot's pipit) native to three Atlantic archipelagos. Microsatellite markers and approximate Bayesian computation revealed that the northward colonization of the species produced genetic bottlenecks. High levels of genetic structure occurring across the archipelagos indicate an isolation by colonization pattern. Significant morphological divergence was present that is highly consistent with trends of bottleneck and genetic structure history, not with geographic distance or environmental variation. Applications in Genetic/Evolutionary Research Understanding genetic and phenotypic divergence across populations of varying species is important in elucidating ecological and evolutionary differences among populations. One such study where genetic structure among human individuals is investigated is by Relethford and Brennan, (1982) where pedigree and marriage data from Sanday, Orkney Islands in Scotland were used to evaluate temporal patterns in isolation by distance. The data considered were for three time periods, 1855-1884, 1885-1924, and 1925-1964. These time periods were categorized by birth year for married males. Average inbreeding coefficient of all potential spouses (chosen within the known demographic and genealogical limits of the population's structure) of each married male was calculated to determine random kinship values. Over time, the isolation by distance model reveals a decline in local isolation and a rise in short and long range migration and the Sandy population experienced an isolate breakdown over time. Distance plays a role in determining kinship, but becomes less significant over time as the measures of the fit of the model decline. Overall inbreeding decreased and mean marital distance increased. Additionally consanguinity avoidance occurred over all distances, but avoidance was more prominent at closer distances. The genetic structure, dynamics, and evolution of populations and species are also important from an ecological point of view when considering the probability of colonization and extinction. One of the key processes influencing these dynamics is dispersal. When localized, populations that are geographically closer are expected to exchange more migrants and should tend to share neutral genetic markers. One such study investigated the direct and indirect measures of dispersal in Branchipodopsis wolfi (fairy shrimp), located in spatially fragmented, ephemeral rock pools located in southeastern Botswana. Dispersal trends and rates were compared by using both spatial genetic structure and direct measures of dispersal. A total of 29 populations from three spatially different rock pools were subjected to allozyme analysis for four loci to access genetic variation and estimates of gene flow between populations were generated using population genetic software. Direct measures of dispersal were determined by quantifying the number of viable floating dormant eggs and larvae that circulated intro overflow traps during flooding events. Genetic differentiation among sites was highly significant (with neighboring sites being more similar). FST ratios for all populations increased with geographical distance in all three rock pool sites, indicating a small-scale isolation-by-distance pattern. Research shows that a distance of 50 meters is an important constraint on the effective dispersal and gene flow for fairy shrimp. Isolation by distance also occurs a result of competition between species: spatial segregation may be due to the negative impact of a species' activity on another one.

Zhang's ideas about the historical process were revolutionary in many ways and he became one of the most enlightened historical theorists of the Qing dynasty, but he spent much of his life in near poverty without the support of a patron and, in 1801, he died, poor and with few friends. It was not until the late 19th century that Chinese scholars began to accept the validity of Zhang's ideas.Hiromu Mimose, \\"Chang Hsueh-ch'eng\\" Former Residence of Zhang Xuecheng in Shaoxing His biographer, David Nivison, comments that while his countrymen did not think him a great literary artist, \\"the infrequent western reader will find his style often both moving and powerful.\\" Zhang developed, Nivison continues, \\"an organic view of history and the state that approaches Hegelian thought, and then built this view upon and into a theory of culture that sometimes suggests Vico,\\" the Italian philosopher.Nivison, Chang Hsueh-ch'eng p. 1 His magnum opus, On Literature and History („ÄäÊñáÂè≤ÈÄöÁæ©„Äã), was published posthumously, in 1832.

This developmental view contrasts with the view of the Neo-Confucians that Confucianism is the expression of timeless \\"principles\\" or \\"patterns\\" that are inherent in the human heart. Zhang's most famous quotation is that \\"the six classics are all history\\" ÂÖ≠Á∂ìÁöÜÂè≤.

After he abdicated the throne the couple retired to a comfortable life in Brindavan, a place associated with the life of Krishna, to whom Samant Singh was greatly devoted. A group of Indian miniature paintings of around 1750 attributed to Nih√¢l Chand from the Marwar school of Kishangarh show Krishna and Radha, using the same models, who are assumed to be Sawant Singh and Bani Thani.Harle, 395; Kossak, 21; Bani Thani britannica.com; bbc.co.uk Bani Thani is depicted with elegant and graceful features, rather stylized, including arched eyebrows, lotus-like elongated eyes and pointed chin. One painting of her was featured in an Indian stamp issued on 5 May 1973.  Biography  Bani Thani was believed to be the mistress of King Sawant Singh, and later became one of his wives. Her birth name was Vishnupriya. She was a singer employed by his stepmother and he was drawn to her because of her beauty and singing. She came to be known as 'Bani Thani', which means \\"the decked out lady\\", because of the exquisite jewellery and makeup that she used to adorn herself with after becoming queen. He also wrote poetry for her under the pen name of Nagari Das. Their love bloomed due to a shared interest in singing, poetry and devotion for Krishna. She also wrote poetry under the pen name of Mrs.Rasikbihari. Later, he commissioned his artists to depict their relationship in a way similar to the love between Radha and Krishna. Both lovers died in the 1760s. They have twin chhatris dedicated to them near the Nagari Kunj temple.  Style and theme  The Kishangarh school of art is notable for its elongated style, with \\"arched eyebrows, lotus-like elongated eyes and pointed chin\\" a highly idealized facial form reminiscent of Indian sculpture art.A Study of Bundi School of Painting By Jiwan Sodhi, page 146 Kishangarh was influenced by B≈´ndi painting in its use of lush vegetation, dramatic night skies, vivid movement and Mughal painting in its use of side-profile portraits, though it can be distinguished from both of them due to its extremely meticulous details, rich colours and fine technique.A Study of Bundi School of Painting By Jiwan Sodhi, page 147 The patron-king Savant Singh was a member of the VallabhƒÅcƒÅrya sect devoted to Krishna, due to which religiously themed paintings flourished in the court under his patronage. The paintings of Kishangarh school are characterised by a religious fervour and this might have been the reason why the portraiture of the queen was compared to, and is believed to have been inspired by, the figure of Radha.  The Sringara-rasa Nayika  Within the Ashta Nayika classification system of heroines, the Bani Thani is identified as the Vasakasajja Nayika type, with the element of Sringara rasa (romantic love) predominating. Hence, the painting conveys the passionate and romantic elements of the legend. She has been portrayed with all the elements of Sringara and exaggerated facial features which are unrealistic but striking. This style of portraiture later became the standard of beauty in all the later paintings of the Kishangarh school.

Thorne‚Äôs Dictionary of Contemporary Slang, published by Bloomsbury in February 2014, remains one of the only treatments of the subject to be based on examples of authentic speech rather than purely upon written or broadcast sources, while Shoot the Puppy, a survey of the latest buzzwords and jargon, drew upon his inside experience of corporate life while working as a communications consultant for multinationals, NGOs and business schools. His 100 Words That Make the English, published by Abacus in April 2011, consists of essays on one hundred key words that are most emblematic of English identity in the 20th and 21st centuries. After explorations in Central and Eastern Europe following the fall of communism and the opening of lost archives, Tony Thorne published the definitive English-language biography of the 16th century Hungarian Countess Erzsebet Bathory, reputed to be a mass murderer who bathed in the blood of her victims. His Children of the Night is a comprehensive account of the historical origins of the vampire myth as well as its subsequent representations in literature and popular culture. The book additionally examines contemporary vampire culture through interviews with self-styled ‚Äòliving vampires‚Äô. Thorne has also written a life of the 18th century French waxworker, Madame Tussaud, for children, and writes on outsider and visionary art. From 1991 to 2007 he was Director of the Language Centre at King's College London where he is now Visiting Consultant.

Perugina  Spagnoli was born in Perugia in 1877. With Giovanni Buitoni, she created the small company Perugina with its headquarters in the historical center of Perugia. Perugina initially began with 15 employees. With the outbreak of World War I, only Spagnoli was left to carry on the business with her two sons Mario and Aldo. After the war, the Perugina factory grew to more than one hundred employees. In 1923, a brand of Italian chocolates called Baci (\\"Kisses\\") was created. Angora Spagnoli After the end of the war, Spagnoli created a new company, breeding poultry and angora rabbits. In 1928, Spagnoli was the first person to introduce angora yarn for knitwear with the trademark l'Angora Spagnoli, including shawls, boleros, and fashionable garments. At the Fair of Milano this innovation was showcased, and the activity of the company soon expanded. Spagnoli was unable to witness the growth of her company, which began about four years later under the guidance of her son Mario. She was diagnosed with cancer. Giovanni Buitoni moved her to Paris to obtain the best medical care available, remaining with her until her death in Paris in 1935.  Industrial development  After Spagnoli's death, her son Mario (1900‚Äì1977) transitioned his mother's company from fine crafts to a more industrialized focus in 1937. He was credited with the invention of two objects, patented in 1942: a comb for collection of wool, and a clamp for tattooing angora rabbits. In 1947, Mario Spagnoli built the City dell'angora factory, built at the center of a growing community. In the 1960s, he also founded the playground of the Citt√† della Domenica originally called Spagnolia, that remains a destination for visitors to this day. Under the leadership of Mario's son Hannibal (1927‚Äì1986), entrepreneur and president of Perugia Calcio, production diversified and the family created the network of Luisa Spagnoli shops; there are now more than 100 shops throughout the world, with the headquarters still based in Perugia.

On 22 November 1906, Jenkins turned out for Monmouthshire to face Glamorgan in a Welsh trial for the upcoming international between Wales and South Africa.Billot (1974), pg 36-37. Four new caps managed to break into the Welsh team, Jenkins, Dick Thomas of Mountain Ash, John Dyke of Penarth and Cardiff's Johnnie Williams.

It is most famous for the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, which is a Taoist ceremony held annually on Cheung Chau island. The festival takes place on the 8th day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, which occurs usually in April or May. The festival lasts for seven days. It attracts many tourists and Pak Tai worshipers.  History  The first settlers in Cheung Chau were fishermen from Huizhou, Guangzhou and Chaozhou. They worshiped the Taoist Sea God, Pak Tai, as their patron deity. In 1777, there was a severe outbreak of plague in Cheung Chau. It is said that when a Huizhounese brought a statue of Pak Tai to the island the pestilence miraculously disappeared.

Deities  The main deity of Yuk Hui Temple is Pak Tai, alternatively known as Yuen Tin Sheung Tai (), the Supreme Emperor of the Northern Heaven or the Mysterious Heaven. In Taoist mythology, he was once a prince of the Shang Dynasty, and then appointed by Jade Emperor to fight the Demon King during the fall of the dynasty. He triumphed in the combat even though the Demon King conjured out a grey tortoise and a gigantic serpent for help. After this victory, Pak Tai was awarded the title of Yuen Tin Sheung Tai and is worshipped for his power, courage and devotion.

It was made in the Song Dynasty about 800 years ago. Allegedly, it was thrown into the sea by a general at the time of Emperor Bing of Song to calm a great storm. Years later it was dredged up by the local fisherman and presented to the deity.Yin, G.D. (2009). Ru Miao Bai Shen. Hong Kong: Cognizance Publishing Company Ltd. There are two legends about the iron sword's whereabouts worth mentioning: The first recounts that during the Japanese occupation, a Japanese soldier took away the sword and accounted it as his own. He soon died mysteriously. One of the soldier's friends was afraid that taking the sword was the reason for this, so he decided to return it to the temple. The second states that the iron sword was stolen in the early 1970s. In order to find the sword, villagers used \\"bwabway\\" (), a tool for seeking divine direction in Chinese folk religion, to ask for Pai Tai's help. According to Pai Tai's direction, the iron sword was in the east and would automatically show up soon. Police later found it abandoned in East Kowloon district.Tian, Y. (2004) Qi Miao. Hong Kong: Ciwenhua Ltd. A newspaper cutting covering this incident is now reserved in the temple. ).  Golden crown  The golden crown worn by the main Pak Tai statue is made of 20-ounce gold and hung with pearls. It was donated by Madam Chung, a worshipper in Cheung Chau island, to commemorate the visit of Princess Margaret and the Earl of Snowdon to the temple in 1966.Raby, K.(2005) Hong Kong Temples.

The building of the grand temple takes into account the spiritual location or 'Feng Shui'. The temple is considered to have good 'Feng Shui' since it is located on the pulse of the dragon, which stretch to the island from Lantau Island nearby, with the sea in front and the mountains of Hong Kong Island protecting from behind). Allegedly, this is also why Yuk Hui Temple has been the most popular temple on the island for a long time. The temple is in traditional Chinese style with a roof of detailed green concave tiles, ridges and ceramic figurines.Hong Kong Tourism Board. (2009). Cheung Chau Island Tour ‚Äì Pal Tai Temple.

Figures of stone lions can be found all around the architecture and this temple has the most stone lions (4) among Hong Kong temples.  Structure  The primary entrance leads to the main hall, which holds the Pak Tai statue. There are two smaller halls on each side of the main hall. The images of a white tiger and a blue dragon in the left- side hall and the right-side hall respectively represent power. The two side halls help to improve the temple's 'Feng Shui'. An ancient drum and bell can be seen on the left of the temple's entrance to drive away evil spirits and to attract the attention of the gods. It is believed that the writings surrounding the bell area will be heard by the gods in heaven.  Stone lions  At the main entrance, there are four lively stone sculptures of lions playing a ball game. Two of the lions have balls in their mouths and it is said that unmarried girls who can remove the balls will eventually marry a prince. The two lions on the left side of the entrance are lionesses with a small cub beneath their paws, while those on the right are males with a ball beneath their feet. It is believed that milk is contained in the ball for humans to drink.  The stone pillars  In the centre of the hall are two stone pillars carved from a solid piece of granite in the shape of dragons. They are imperial dragons as they have five claws on each foot while ordinary ones have only four. A ball can be seen in the dragon's mouth which is known as 'The Pearl of the Dragon'. According to Chinese culture, it is believed to be a sign of good luck if the dragon releases the ball. There are some square stone pillars which carries the message that can be translated as: 'Pi tai will look after Cheung Chau and will bring calm seas and good weather'.  Cheung Chau Bun Festival  Cheung Chau Bun Festival. Cheung Chau Bun Festival is a traditional Taoist festival that takes place in and around the Yuk Hui Temple on Cheung Chau It is staged every year (usually in late April or early May) to mark the eighth day of the fourth moon in the Chinese calendar. The event draws tens of thousands of tourists from overseas and local areas and is promoted by the Hong Kong Tourism Board. The name of the festival comes from its main attraction; the 'bun snatching race' where brave individuals climb up 'Bun Mountains' or 'Bun Towers' and strip them down of buns.

The Laplace affair or the French Incident was a military intervention by the Kingdom of France to end the persecution of Catholics in the Kingdom of Hawaii, which had been promoted by Protestant ministers. Under the threat of war, King Kamehameha III agreed to the French demands to stop the detention of Catholic citizens and pay reparations. Background After the 1819 death of King Kamehameha of the Hawaiian Islands, queen regent Kaahumanu came to power, the powerful newly converted Protestant widow of Kamehameha the Great. New England Protestant ministers convinced her to illegalize Catholicism in Hawaii. Following the enactment of the new policy, chiefs loyal to her forcibly deported French Roman Catholic priests on to the Waverly in Honolulu Harbor on December 24, 1831. Native Hawaiian Catholic converts were arrested and imprisoned. Most of these prisoners were released once Protestant ministers had beaten them into rejecting Catholicism. The prejudice against the French Catholics missionaries remained the same under the reign of her successor, the Kuhina Nui Kaahumanu II. Intervention On July 10, 1839 Captain Laplace of the French frigate Art√©mise sailed to Hawaii under orders to: :Destroy the malevolent impression which you find established to the detriment of the French name; to rectify the erroneous opinion which has been created as to the power of France; and to make it well understood that it would be to the advantage of the chiefs of those islands of the Ocean to conduct themselves in such a manner as not to incur the wrath of France. You will exact, if necessary with all the force that is yours to use, complete reparation for the wrongs which have been committed, and you will not quit those places until you have left in all minds a solid and lasting impression. Agreement Under the threat of war King Kamehameha III issued an Edict of Toleration on July 17, 1839 and paid the $20,000 in compensation for the deportation of the priests and the incarceration and torture of converts, agreeing to Laplace's demands. The kingdom proclaimed: :That the Catholic worship be declared free, throughout all the dominions subject to the king of the Sandwich Islands; the members of this religious faith shall enjoy in them the privileges granted to Protestants. The Catholic missionaries returned unpersecuted and Kamehameha III donated land for them to build a church as reparation.

The temple in the present form was completed in 1964 A.D. Other deities and Sub-temples There are sub-temples for Hanuman, Garuda, Ganapathy, Laxmi, Navagraha and Nagaraja. History During the exodus of Goud Saraswat Brahmins from Goa in the 16th century, many families settled down in and around Cochin. A prominent person among them (Venkateswara Pai alias Vensu Pai) settled in Kuzhupilly in the land given by the Raja of Cochin. Vensu Pai's son Anatha Pai once on his pilgrimage to Tirupathi, purchased some metal idols and dolls for his kids. There was an idol of Balakrishna among them. The children used them in their play and made pooja to these idols. However, the children started to become sick regularly and used to have many health complaints. The elders considered that, it was due to not keeping the idol in sacred form, and started pooja. But the pooja was neither regular nor as per sastra. The suffering of the children continued and also there were some child deaths in the family. The worried Anantha Pai approached a known Astrologer Sri Adoor Chakrapani for a solution. The astrological prasnam and prediction revealed that a separate temple is to be built for the Balakrishna idol and regular poojas to be conducted. Sri Anantha Pai considered Balakrishna as his child and divided his properties among his children and Balakrishna. A small temple was constructed in the land given to Balakrishna and Prathista done in 1895 AD. Over the period, there were internal conflicts in the family of Vensu Pai and the rituals in the temple suffered. The number of GSB families in the area also increased. It was felt that the community should have a common place for worship. Accordingly, the Balakrishna temple was offered to the community and the management was vested with the community in common. However, the Vensu Pai family was given a special status in the affairs of the temple. The samaj members proposed to construct a new temple in a more convenient location. About one and half acres of land was given free by A. Govinda Shenoy and the work was started. But the progress was in snail's pace due to non-cooperation and lack of initiative among the members. It remained incomplete for more than 35 years. Later, a group of youth formed a Seva Samithi and took the lead. They completed the work of Garbhagraha through free service and the Murti was shifted to this new temple in 1964 AD facing east. The improvements in the temple was a continuous effort. In the late eighties, the Aanapandal was constructed with decorated pillars. The committee members also took up construction of a shopping complex and Kalyana mandapam. There are extensive paintings of Da≈õƒÅvatƒÅra on the temple walls inside. The Dhvaja pratishta was done on 18-1-1991. The Centenary of the pratishta was celebrated in 1995 A.D.

Gordon Holt in 2005 Justin Gordon Holt (19 April 1930 ‚Äì 20 July 2009) was an audio engineer and the founder of Stereophile magazine, and is widely considered to be the founder of the high-end audio movement, which promoted the philosophy of judging sound quality by subjective tests, generally with \\"cost no object\\" sound components, including loudspeakers, turntables, amplifiers, vacuum tube components, cables, and other devices. Known as \\"JGH\\" (from his byline in published reviews and articles), Holt established a reputation for veracity, often-controversial opinions, passionate critiques, and journalistic integrity. He also pioneered the concept of the yearly \\"Recommended Components\\" list, providing a thumbnail summary of reviews for audiophiles looking for the finest sound components available at any price. Holt also came up with \\"Holt's Law,\\" the theory that the better the recording, the worse the musical performance‚Äîand vice versa. Early years Justin Gordon Holt was born on April 19, 1930, in Charlotte, North Carolina, and adopted when he was two years of age by Justin Gordon Holt (Sr.) and his wife Katherine (n√©e Hart). Through DNA testing and genealogy research, Holt's son was able to confirm that Gordon was from the Beam and Houser families of North Carolina. His family moved to Melbourne, Australia in 1937 for his father's work, and stayed there through World War II. From 1936 to 1946 Gordon attended the prestigious Melbourne private school Scotch College,Scotch College Admission Register No. 7, Entry 1283, 11 February 1936 returning to the U.S. after his father's sudden death from a stroke on 9 August 1946.Death notice in The Argus, Saturday 10 August 1946, page 20 J. Gordon Holt's father bore such a striking resemblance to famed gangster Al Capone that he was stopped and questioned by a customs official. During his years in Australia his mother worked as the head of the USO for the Australian Red Cross, and his father worked for a textile company. Gordon attended Nether Providence High School in Wallingford, Pennsylvania, and attended Lehigh University with the intent of becoming an engineer. After discovering he \\"couldn't hack the math,\\" Gordon switched his major to Journalism. He graduated in 1953 with a BA. He spent a few years struggling as a cartoonist, and writing the occasional article for High Fidelity magazine, which later offered him a position. Family Gordon married Mary Elizabeth \\"Polly\\" Norton on May 25, 1968, in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. Their first child, Alicia Darroch Holt, was born on January 21, 1970. Their second child, Justin Charles Holt, was born on April 18, 1972. The Holt family moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1979, after taking a trip and falling in love with the area. Mary and Gordon underwent a separation in 1983, with Mary and their children moving to Boulder, Colorado, and Gordon remaining in Santa Fe. Mary was diagnosed with lung cancer in August 1988, and died on March 19, 1989. During this time, Gordon moved to Boulder to care for her and their children, and spent the rest of his life there. Stereophile magazine Holt worked as an editor and critic for Audiocraft and High Fidelity magazines in the mid-1950s through the early 1960s, and wrote numerous articles and reviews on amplifiers, receivers, turntables, tape recorders, and other high- fidelity sound components. After departing the magazine over editorial differences‚Äîwhat he later claimed were disputes between High Fidelity's editorial and advertising staff‚ÄîHolt founded Stereophile magazine in 1962 while living in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. The magazine quickly established a market over the next decade, expanding from a small pamphlet- sized, hand-typed booklet to issues approaching a hundred pages. Holt was one of the first audio critics to provide in-depth details on his listening environment, with details on room acoustics, microphones, and other technical matters, departing from the mass-market slant to competitors such as Stereo Review, Audio Magazine, and his alma mater High Fidelity. Holt's engaging writing style and emphasis on audio engineering made his articles authoritative while still remaining accessible to consumers and audiophiles. \\"JGH\\" (as he referred to himself in print) was often skeptical of wildly successful audio components such as Bose speakers, and often created controversy with passionate reviews and articles on a variety of technical subjects. The high-end audio movement exploded during the 1970s,A Tiny History of High Fidelity, Part 2 with manufacturers such as Audio Research, Magnepan, Infinity, and many others finding great success among well-heeled customers during the decade. After a move to Sante Fe, New Mexico, where Holt constructed an elaborate listening and audio testing room in his home, he spent the decade covering such cutting-edge developments as Dynagroove, Quadraphonic sound, magnetic tape formats, and digital sound, and also reviewed hundreds of audio components. Holt also developed a vocabulary to describe subtle differences between audio components, using terms like \\"warm\\" or \\"harsh\\" to describe different characters and tonalities. (Holt later wrote \\"The Audio Glossary\\",\\"The Audio Glossary,\\" New York: Audio Amateur, Inc., 1990 which clarified and defined many of these terms for the benefit of audiophiles and enthusiasts.) By the late 1970s, Stereophile's own success led to business difficulties, chiefly in getting the magazine distributed on a regular schedule, which created a myriad of financial problems. Holt sold the magazine to businessman Larry Archibald in 1982 for $5,000 (paid in fifty $100 bills), who expanded the magazine, hired a large staff, and eventually increased Stereophile's circulation to 60,000 readers by the late 1980s. The magazine was sold to Petersen Publishing in June 1998. The success of Stereophile in the late 1960s and early 1970s inspired New York writer & reviewer Harry Pearson to start a rival publication, The Absolute Sound, which quickly became a very influential high-end magazine. Pearson, who was an avid admirer of Holt's early work, has stated that he started The Absolute Sound because he wanted to \\"prompt Gordon to more consistent production of his own [magazine].\\" TAS (as it was called) embraced the so-called \\"subjective audio\\" philosophy, which placed an emphasis on the sound of components as a system, eschewing the technical measurements used by Stereo Review and other mass-market magazines. TAS and Stereophile were arguably the Time magazine and Newsweek of the high- end audio industries throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and both thrived on highly critical reviews, editorials, and articles which tended to polarize readers and advertisers. Holt tried to start a new publication in the late 1980s, LaserNews, a newsletter intended to cover the emerging home video industry of VCRs, laserdisc players, and large-screen television technology. He was unable to interest the Stereophile management in video-related topics, and kept the magazine going until about 1990, where he folded it due to ongoing business and distribution problems. Stereophile belatedly started a video-related magazine in 1994, Stereophile Guide to Home Theater, which continues on-line as Ultimate A/V.'. Holt occasionally wrote reviews for both Stereophile and Absolute Sound in the 1990s, and was a frequent visitor to the annual Consumer Electronic Shows throughout the decade. Holt frequently expressed bitterness that the high-end audio business refused to embrace double blind testing, which he was convinced would legitimize the scientific process of evaluating sound quality.\\"Sound Reproduction: The Acoustics and Psychoacoustics of Loudspeakers and Rooms\\" by Dr. Floyd Toole, 2008, Oxford, UK: Focal Press Holt resigned from Stereophile in 1999 to pursue freelance writing,J. Gordon Holt resigns from Stereophile to go freelance Stereophile.com but remained an active participant in the Audio Engineering Society and other industry organizations. Death J. Gordon Holt was as well known for his smoking as he was for his passionate writing, and smoked two- and-a-half packs a day starting when he was seventeen. He was diagnosed with tonsil cancer shortly after his wife's death in 1990, and had a successful surgery shortly thereafter, although he continued to smoke believing that the cancer was likely to kill him anyway. Ten years later, Holt was diagnosed with emphysema. He quit smoking, but it took his life on July 20, 2009. He died at home with his daughter and son present.

The series is a follow-up of the radio series, also called Last Chance to See, in which Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine set out to find endangered animals. In this updated television version, produced for the BBC, Stephen Fry and Carwardine revisit the animals originally featured to see how they're getting on almost 20 years later. In one episode, a male kakapo, called Sirocco, mounts and attempts to mate with Carwardine's head. Sirocco found fame after the video of his antics became an internet hit, and was later anointed as New Zealand's \\"spokesbird for conservation\\". A Last Chance to See special called \\"Return of the Rhino\\" was broadcast on BBC Two on 31 October 2010. The programme followed four of the last remaining northern white rhinos as they were transferred from Dv≈Ør Kr√°lov√© Zoo in the Czech Republic to Ol Pejeta Conservancy, a protected reserve in Kenya, in a last-ditch attempt to save the subspecies from extinction. Episodes The main aim of each episode was to seek out an endangered species and to investigate its plight. In addition, a variety of other animals are filmed on location all over the world. 1. \\"Amazonian manatee\\" An Amazonian manatee calf at a rehabilitation centre in Brazil : UK broadcast 6 September 2009, 3.31 million viewers (13.2% audience share) (data available for Last Chance to See broadcast weeks by searching archive) In the opening programme, Fry and Carwardine travel to Manaus in Brazil in search of the Amazonian manatee. Hunting has reduced wild manatee numbers to a few thousand individuals. On the Rio Negro, they have an encounter with a group of endangered botos, which take food from their hands. The two fly deeper into the forest to rendezvous with a boat, the Cassiquiari, on the Rio Aripuan√£. Further upriver, they meet scientist Marc van Roosmalen and his team. Manatees are known to live in the vicinity, but despite searching the river and surrounding lakes, they fail to encounter the species in the wild. Carwardine takes Fry to INPA in Manaus, where captive manatees are kept for research. At Tef√©, west of Manaus, they plan to join Miriam Rosenthal and her Mamirau√° team on a trip to release an injured one-year-old manatee back into the wild. However, on the morning of their departure, Fry trips and breaks his arm in three places. After Fry is evacuated for medical attention, Carwardine reunites with the Mamirau√° project. The manatee is transferred to a purpose- built enclosure in a remote river community before full release. By engaging local people, the team hope to foster an enthusiasm for conserving the species. 2. \\"Northern white rhinoceros\\" A southern white rhino at Lake Nakuru, Kenya : Broadcast 13 September 2009, 3.28 million viewers (13.2% audience share) The critically endangered northern subspecies of the white rhinoceros is the focus of the second episode. The only surviving wild population is found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Garamba National Park. Carwardine hopes to return to the park where he and Adams managed to find and photograph the animals 20 years ago. The episode opens with an encounter with a wild southern white rhino, which turns out to be a prank by the rangers as the rhino in question is tame, having been hand-reared. In northern Kenya, Fry and Carwardine have a less welcome surprise when they arrive as a conservation project to relocate the northern whites to a protected area is being abandoned. The pair then turn their attention to primates, visiting a chimpanzee rehabilitation centre and tracking mountain gorillas in Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. At Queen Elizabeth National Park, close to the border with the DRC, Carwardine is pleased to find that elephant numbers have increased from a handful of animals to over one thousand, showing that anti-poaching patrols are working. At this point, Carwardine, who has been receiving news from contacts though the trip, decides that it is too risky to cross the border, as the eastern DRC is gripped by the Kivu conflict, and the journey to Garamba National Park, where the rhinos were last sighted in 2006 would involve travelling through the fighting. Returning to Kenya, the presenters join a team from the Kenya Wildlife Service on a black rhino relocation project. After a fast and bumpy ride, they find and dart three rhinos, and transport them 100 miles to begin a new population in a fenced conservancy. This episode was dedicated to sound recordist Jake Drake- Brockman, who was killed in a motorcycle accident on 1 September 2009. 3. \\"Aye-aye\\" The aye-aye's nocturnal habits make it difficult to see in the wild : Broadcast 20 September 2009, 2.15 million viewers (7.7% audience share) The third programme is set in Madagascar, where Adams and Carwardine conceived the idea for Last Chance to See on their first travels together in 1985. In Nosy Mangabe, they encountered a wild aye-aye, a rare nocturnal lemur. Carwardine brings Fry to the tree where he saw the creature, but this time they have no luck. The pair embark on a trip through Madagascar to view the island's unique fauna. They encounter brown and ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Reserve, and the recently discovered Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, the world's smallest primate, in Kirindy Forest. Carwardine is shocked at the disappearance of the island's rainforests since his earlier visit. Timber provides poor communities with fuel and building material‚Äîonly the unsuitable baobab trees are spared. Slash and burn agriculture and monoculture also contribute to deforestation. Conservationists are battling to preserve the remaining fragmented islands of forest by planting green corridors and engaging local communities. In a Malagasy village, Fry and Carwardine witness a traditional healing ceremony. The aye-aye has been a victim of cultural beliefs as well as habitat loss, regarded by some natives as a symbol of death. When superstitious villagers encounter the animal, they kill it to prevent a death in their community. Despite their misgivings, the presenters are charmed by a captive specimen at Antananarivo Zoo. The quest for a wild aye-aye goes on, and their perseverance is rewarded with a sighting of two animals in the same tree in Mananara Nord National Park. 4. \\"Komodo dragon\\" A Komodo dragon, the world's largest lizard : Broadcast 27 September 2009, 2.23 million viewers (7.8% audience share) Fry and Carwardine travel to Indonesia and Malaysia to out a rare, endemic species. At Snake Island they encounter a venomous yellow-lipped sea krait, causing Fry to rue his decision to wear open-toed sandals. At Turtle Island, conservationists are working to protect sea turtles. The presenters help to collect eggs from a female green turtle that has come ashore to lay, and then release new hatchlings back into the sea. Heading further south, the pair dive and snorkel on Indonesia's coral reefs, viewing adult turtles and seahorses. On Mabul Island they find sharks' fins and jawbones, dried seahorses and sea cucumbers for sale. Carwardine explains that the demand from Asian markets, for food and traditional medicine, is driving these species to extinction. At Labuk Bay they view proboscis monkeys in a mangrove sanctuary surrounded by oil palm plantations. Fry compares their noises to lunchtime at the Garrick Club. Their final destination is the Indonesian island of Rinca, home to the Komodo dragon. The world's largest lizard is not to be underestimated: they meet rangers and villagers who have been attacked by dragons, and hear of a child who was killed. However, the dragons are entwined in the islanders' culture, and the tourists they attract bring much-needed income. Fry and Carwardine help Park rangers to fit a radio collar to a dragon as part of a research project. With protection, tolerance from locals and the ability of female dragons to procreate through parthenogenesis, Fry is confident that the species can survive. 5. \\"Kakapo\\" A kakapo feeding on Codfish Island : Broadcast 4 October 2009, 2.36 million viewers (7.8% audience share) The penultimate programme opens with aerial scenes of New Zealand's Southern Alps as the presenters fly in by helicopter. This was once the natural habitat of the kakapo, a critically endangered flightless parrot now confined to two offshore islands. Kakapo numbers were decimated by predators and MƒÅori hunters, and fewer than 100 remained at the time the episode was filmed (the population is now . See list of kakapo). Later, they are shown a MƒÅori cloak made from kakapo feathers in a Wellington museum. On the North Island, they encounter other New Zealand rarities such as the kiwi and giant weta. They also meet filmmaker Peter Jackson, who confesses to a childhood phobia of wetas. Conservationist Don Merton takes Fry and Carwardine to the Chatham Islands, where the endemic black robin was saved from extinction by eradicating introduced predators. This became the model for kakapo conservation, and Merton now hopes to reintroduce kakapo to Sinbad Gully, a remote Fiordland valley. At Invercargill, they enter quarantine before flying to Codfish Island where researchers are predicting a record kakapo breeding season (they are later proved correct, with 34 eggs hatching). They watch a hand-reared male called Sirocco broadcast his nightly booming calls. After days frustrated by bad weather, Carwardine's efforts to take photographs of Sirocco take an unexpected turn. The kakapo climbs on to his head and attempts to mate with him, much to Fry's amusement. He later gets the privilege of filming a female on her nest. Fry is overwhelmed by the conservation effort dedicated to just one species, describing it as a \\"story of human passion and commitment\\". 6. \\"Blue whale\\" A blue whale surfaces to take a breath : Broadcast 18 October 2009, 3.0 million viewers (10.4% audience share) The subject of the final programme was due to be the Yangtze river dolphin; however, the species was declared extinct in 2007. Instead, he takes Fry to the Gulf of California on the eastern side of the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico to search for the endangered blue whale. The area is an important breeding ground for many cetaceans, and one they are almost guaranteed to find is the grey whale. In San Ignacio Lagoon, a group approaches so close to their boat that they reach into the water and touch them. They ride mules through the peninsula's desert interior to view rock art painted by the Cochim√≠, a Pre-Columbian civilisation. Returning to the coast at La Paz, they visit a sea lion colony offshore to collect faeces. Analysis shows they have changed their diet from sardines to bottom-dwelling fish, evidence of overfishing. The presenters then join marine biologists on a research boat, one of whom is Miss Baja California Sur. She and Carwardine dive with a whale shark to take measurements, photos and collect a DNA sample. They spend several days at sea on board the Horizon searching for blue whales. They encounter breaching humpback whales, and learn about one predator benefiting from overfishing of sharks, the voracious Humboldt squid. However, there are no signs of blues, so Carwardine calls in a favour from a local pilot. With the help of the spotter plane, they locate the blue whales.

Early works He graduated from the Crist√≥bal Rojas School of Arts (1972) under the Jes√∫s Soto promotion. From 1973 to 1980 Milton Becerra was assistant-partner in the workshops of the renowned masters Carlos Cruz-Diez and Jes√∫s Soto. He participated in his first collective exhibition when he was still a student. He studied art trends such as Concrete, Neo, Kinetic, Generative and \\"Op-art\\". In 1973 he opened his first solo exhibition \\"Vibro-hexagonal Volume\\" that included a sound atmosphere presented at the Ateneo de Caracas, that won him the prize of the Third National Exhibition of Young Artists. He applies this knowledge to the development of irregular shapes called Hexagon Geometry or \\"Hexagonometry\\", based on the arrangement of different modules in space based on Kasimir Malevich's \\"White Cube\\" theory, and Ludwig Wittgenstein's \\"Tractatus logico-philosophicus\\" concepts that investigates colors, their behavior in space and the division of forms through color ranges. On the resulting works, Venezuelan art historian Alfredo Boulton (1908‚Äì1995) wrote: ‚ÄúMilton Becerra‚Äôs works characterize a concern about the volumes and strong structures, that accompany subtle chromatic features. We are, thus, in front of a solid object, but at the same time light and fragile.‚Äù Concerned about nature and the enormous legacy of Venezuela's indigenous peoples, Milton Becerra is able, in his first solo exhibition, to fuse the traditions of Venezuelan primitive cultures with the modernity of the artistic trends of the time. Milton Becerra does not discriminate on the aesthetic aspects, on the contrary makes them coexist, transcending the artistic harmony and visual resources of primitive cultures with geometric abstraction and the Venezuelan artistic kinetic movement, relevant at that time. Meteorite Ibirapuera Park, XVIII Biennial of S√£o Paulo, Brazil (1985). Three years later Milton Becerra presented at the Caracas Museum of Contemporary Art his work \\"Programmed Modules\\", where he expresses his concerns towards land intervention by photography. Under this context, in the 70s, the early works of Milton Becerra come into view, placed in suburban areas of Caracas, on the blurred boundaries between city and forest, or high pastures and the streambeds, or in the city's last streets and homes, or in the Colonia Tovar, or in La Mariposa dam. Although these were, at the time, actions and interventions, these pieces later became Photographic Series, and constitute‚Äîbeyond themselves‚Äîhis first plastic and poetic approach to the vision of nature and earth as sacred, conducive to mystical experiences and filled with the cultural memory of silenced or vanished peoples. This starting point characterizes later the context of his artworks. Milton Becerra is considered one of the pioneers of Land Art in Venezuela, a contemporary art movement that uses elements of nature or its environments to produce a reaction in the spectator observing the landscape presented and intervened by the artist.  Land Art  Ale'ya Durban Segnini Gallery Miami 2009. Born in London, the European Land Art movement had extremely different concerns to those in Latin America. The Land Art in the old continent pursues to take the viewer to an isolated spot where nature dwells in itself, away from the hustle and influence of large cities. Latin American artists‚Äîand Milton Becerra has been consistent throughout his dilated career in this regard‚Äî intend Land Art to reach for our roots and become part of the soil that sustains us. Milton Becerra, concerned about the ecology, conducted at this stage works such as \\"A Blanket for the Meadow\\" in Caracas' residential area, Lomas de Prados del Este; and \\"Analysis of a Process in Time\\", in the El Valle parish, where he denounces the effects of pollution and deterioration of the landscape. Towards the 80s Milton Becerra relocated to Paris and developed a new perspective of his art, based on his research and perception of the Amazonian Yanomamo tribe's customs. That is when his usual patterns and fabrics, impregnated with modernity, gave a twist that led to the development of his distinguishable Site-specific art, recognized anywhere in the world, from this artist born in Venezuela's T√°chira state. The mixture of fibers and fabrics with other organic elements like rocks, led him to develop series as \\"Chin-cho-rro\\" (1995), \\"Gotas\\" (Drops 1990) and \\"Nidos\\" (Nests 1995). In each of these works the artist appeals to the concept, and then he interprets it and nourishes it with abstractionist and geometric forms, where the light waggling of inert bodies defy the laws of gravity and create a formidable artistic piece. Chin- cho-rro's and Esfera pre-colombina Site-specific art the Museum of Contemporary Art and Design in San Jos√©, Costa Rica (1995)‚Äîunder the invitation of Ms. Virginia P√©rez-Ratton (1950‚Äì2010) not only showed to the public Milton Becerra's interpretation of traditional hammocks used by indigenous groups, but also rested on them stones, as rigid bodies of those men and women who died of the Xawara endemic plague and had, as funeral beds, these pendulous webs. Environmental art Milton Becerra knows the path that as an artist he is following, and proudly acknowledges that he is taking uncommon Venezuelan art to all latitudes. It is impossible for him not to feel attached to his country, especially his beloved Amazonas, with each piece he makes. Milton Becerra was also invited by Alfons Hug, coordinator of the collective exhibition \\"Art Amazon\\", organized by Germany's Goethe Institute during the first United Nations Conference on Environment and Development Earth Summit, ECO-92), at the Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro. For that exhibition he focused on the Upper Orinoco River, the Amazon Federal Reserve, the Yanomamo territory, and he immersed himself into an experiment, as a fully anthropological workshop, developing the theme \\"Xawara Yanomami ‚Äì XXI Century\\".

The company was founded in 1990. Its head office is located in Coventry, it has offices in Russia, Azerbaijan, United Arab Emirates, India, and the United States. It is a privately owned business employing around 240 people on a full-time basis in addition to a number of field experts brought in for specific projects. The Times- 'Profit Track 100‚Äô named Optilan among the 100 fastest growing private companies in the UK in 2008. Optilan's business operations have evolved since starting off as a communications and fibre optic specialist in 1990. Optilan has expanded into a supplier of communications and security systems, providing design through to site commissioning and support solutions within the world's oil and gas, transport, telecommunications networks and utilities sectors. History Early years Optilan was formed in 1990 by friends and co-apprentices from GEC Telecommunications (now Telent); Tim Allen, Richard Buckland and Eamonn McFadden. Prior to forming the company, Buckland and Allen had been working at Walmore Electronics- a fibre optics company in Central London. They left as the company moved into other areas. After discovering that Walmore was no longer continuing in the field of the contracts they had been working on; Allen and Buckland gained their blessing to secure work with acnumber of the clients including; The BBC, Royal Albert Hall, Honeywell in Taiwan and Dubal Aluminium in Dubai. McFadden, who had been working for GEC in Thailand, then joined the pair to become the third member of the team. From 1991, Optilan had started taking orders over ¬£100,000, the first of which being in the Isle of Wight for Plessey Radar, where Optilan installed a fibre optic transmission system. As the company grew in size, Bal Kler and Chris Yarwood joined the three original company founders on the board of directors and more staff were employed on a full-time basis. Channel Tunnel Rail Link In 2001, Optilan was given the contract to work on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, providing the CCTV, Data Transmission Network (DTN) and the Local Area Network (LAN). Optilan was also offered the maintenance contract for the support of these systems. Coventry Citywide Network Coventry City Council‚Äôs own network was the first of its kind to be installed in the UK in 2007. With over 87 miles of fibre optic cables being laid around Coventry by Optilan, the system now reaches all of the council buildings and schools to meet the demands of the city's 300,000 residents and enable local schools to get faster broadband access. This was also Optilan‚Äôs first contract for over ¬£10 million. Strategic Venture With BlueWaterEnergy In 2017, Optilan announced the arrangement of a strategic venture with BlueWaterEnergy Group (BWE), focusing on increasing and developing service offerings on a global scale. Head office locations Optilan‚Äôs Head Office is located in Coventry, England. The company had been located in Kenilworth; however had to move due to an increase in company size. Optilan's equipment build and test areas are also located at the Coventry site. Products from here are distributed worldwide to be fitted within communication and security systems. Optilan also operates from offices in Moscow (Russia), Baku (Azerbaijan), Ankara (Turkey) and the company‚Äôs US subsidiary Optilan Inc. operates out of Houston, United States.

Prelude In the Treaty of 1843 with Hawaii, France had agreed never on any pretense to take possession of any portion of the Hawaiian domain. The French government had issued orders to Guillaume Patrice Dillon, its new consul in Honolulu in 1848: \\"Avoid in your conduct any show of pugnaciousness [esprit de lutte]. It is befitting that moderation be the one to consolidate the fruits of firmness\\". Nevertheless on November 5, 1848, he wrote to the French Foreign Office: \\"I am convinced that it will prove sufficient to display a good French corvette for three days at Honolulu to force concessions from this devious and hypocritical Government.\\" On August 12, 1849, French admiral Louis Tromelin arrived in Honolulu Harbor on the corvette Gassendi with the frigate La Poursuivante. While in Honolulu, Tromelin found out about the past persecution of Catholics and the high tariffs on French brandy from Dillon, who oversaw French interests in Hawaii. Tromelin, angered by the Protestant ABCFM missionaries‚Äô intention to shut out Catholicism and French trade, worked with Dillon to compose ten demands to King Kamehameha III on August 22.Hawaiian Journal p.2 Tromelin‚Äòs demands > # The complete and loyal adoption of the treaty of March 26th 1846. # The > reduction of the duty on French brandy to fifty per cent ad valorem. # The > subjection of Catholic schools to the direction of the chief of the French > Mission and to special inspectors not Protestants and a treatment rigorously > equal granted to the two worships and to their schools. # The use of the > French language in all business intercourse between French citizens and the > Hawaiian Government. # The withdrawal of the alleged exception by which > French whalers which imported wine and spirits were affected and the > abrogation of a regulation which obliged vessels laden with liquors to pay > the custom house officers placed on board to superintend their loading and > unloading. # The return of all duties collected by virtue of the regulation > the withdrawal of which was demanded by the fifth article. # The return of a > fine of twenty-five dollars paid by the whale ship General Teste besides an > indemnity of sixty dollars for the time that she was detained in port. # The > punishment of certain school boys whose impious conduct in church had > occasioned complaint. # The removal of the governor of Hawaii for allowing > the domicile of a priest to be violated by police officers who entered it to > make an arrest or the order that the governor make reparation to that > missionary. # The payment to a French hotel keeper of the damages committed > in his house by sailors from HBMs [His Britannic Majestys] ship . Sacking of Honolulu The demands had not been met by August 25. That afternoon, after a second warning to the civilians of the impending invasion, 140 French Marines, two field pieces, and scaling ladders were landed by boat. The marines took an empty Honolulu Fort from the two men defending it, Governor of Oahu Mataio Kekuanaoa and Marshal of the Kingdom Warren Goodale, who did not resist, the fort having been evacuated before the French landed.Hawaiian Journal p.9 The marines spiked the coastal guns, threw kegs of powder into the harbor and destroyed all the other weapons they found (mainly muskets and ammunition). They raided government buildings and general property in Honolulu, causing $100,000 in damages. They also took the king's yacht, Kamehameha III, which was sailed to Tahiti and never returned. After these raids, the invasion force withdrew to the fort. During the occupation, men in Honolulu ridiculed the French, and on August 30 they organized a mock attack party making the marines double their guard and send skirmishing patrols out late into night, encountering no attackers. Tromelin eventually recalled his men and left Hawaii on September 5. Aftermath Gerrit P. Judd led a party to inquire and settle the incident, leaving for Paris on September 11. Along the way Judd requested support from the United States and Great Britain, the latter accepting for his case against Tromelin. At first the French government condemned the attack on Honolulu but with the account of Tromelin and Dillon who left with Tromelin on September 5, the French government reconsidered the incident as more justified and did not make reparation for the damages.

They are five-digit codes of two-then-three digits, with a hyphen between them. The first digit indicates one of the 10 large postal regions the country is divided into. These areas do not follow the administrative divisions. The second and third digits specify a particular smaller region (originally the number of a regional sorting office, there was one in every county), and the last two are the number of a postal delivery branch. Clients receiving particularly large volumes of mail may have their own unique postal codes; the same goes for PO Box lobbies of the largest post offices. Postal codes are written in Poland before the city/town/locality name, e.g. 00-001 Warszawa.  Main postal areas  The first digit of a Polish postal code specifies the large area (postal region) to which the address concerned belongs.

STATMAN (2000): \\"Behavioral Portfolio Theory,\\" Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 35(2), 127‚Äì151. provides an alternative to the assumption that the ultimate motivation for investors is the maximization of the value of their portfolios. It suggests that investors have varied aims and create an investment portfolio that meets a broad range of goals. It does not follow the same principles as the capital asset pricing model, modern portfolio theory and the arbitrage pricing theory. A behavioral portfolio bears a strong resemblance to a pyramid with distinct layers. Each layer has well defined goals. The base layer is devised in a way that it is meant to prevent financial disaster, whereas, the upper layer is devised to attempt to maximize returns, an attempt to provide a shot at becoming rich. BPT is a descriptive theory based on the SP/A theory of Lola Lopes (1987), and closely related to Roy's safety-first criterion. The theory is described as a single account version: BPT-SA, which is very closely related to the SP/A theory. In this multiple account version, investors can have fragmented portfolios, just as we observe among investors.

It is one of the oldest societies of its kind. Past members include notable British Field Marshals Wavell, Auchinleck and Templer. The current president is Lieutenant- General Sir Barney White-Spunner and Major-General Ewan Carmichael is Chairman of its Council. The Patron of the Society is Field Marshal the Duke of Kent. The society's interests embrace both army and regimental history, military antiquities and pictures, uniforms, badges and medals, arms and equipment and the history of land warfare in general. The study of campaigns, commanders and the political aspects of war are covered from the sixteenth century to the 1970s. Journal The society's main activity is the publication of the peer- reviewed quarterly Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research reflecting its members' interests. Issues of the Journal contain a mixture of articles, which are peer-reviewed, communications, which typically deal with more specialised subjects and are not subject to peer-review, and book reviews. Listings are also included of recent academic work in the field of military history, and of new archival resources of relevance to the topic. Each issue typically contains at least one colour plate, as well as other illustrations. Not all articles are dryly academic; there are often interesting or amusing anecdotal forays into historical nooks, or revealing examinations of unjustly forgotten soldiers. In addition, over the years, the society has produced a number of special issues: topics for special issues include monographs on dress distinctions and bibliographical or regimental research aids, previously-unpublished soldiers' letters or diaries, and anthologies of material dealing with specific topics - most recently the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo, and the Great War.For instance: John Marshall Deane, A Journal of Marlborough's campaigns during the War of the Spanish Succession, 1704‚Äì1711 / edited and introduced by David G.

The special publications also include a full index to the journal from its foundation up to 2006.  Templer Medal  Since 1982, the society has awarded the Templer Medal to the author of the most impressive or significant book relating to the British, Commonwealth or Dominion armies published in the preceding year.

Career Schahin played as a youth for FSV Luckenwalde and Energie Cottbus before joining Hamburger SV in 2006. He broke through into HSV's reserve team in the 2007‚Äì08 season, making seven substitute appearances in the Regionalliga Nord. The following season, he scored twelve goals in 27 appearances, which made him the team's top scorer. On 8 June 2009, Schahin signed for Greuther F√ºrth of the 2. Bundesliga He made twelve appearances in his first season, and after a further six appearances (one goal) in the first half of the 2010‚Äì11 season, he was loaned to Dynamo Dresden in January 2011. Schahin made a huge impact at Dynamo, scoring ten goals in fourteen games to help the club finish third in the 3. Liga and win promotion to the 2. Bundesliga via a playoff win against VfL Osnabr√ºck. Schahin scored the decisive goal in the last league game of the season, against Kickers Offenbach, and the winning goal in the second leg against Osnabr√ºck. After being released by F√ºrth in 2012, Schahin signed for Fortuna D√ºsseldorf. He made his Bundesliga debut on the opening day of the 2012‚Äì13 season against FC Augsburg.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the award on October 9, 2009, citing Obama's promotion of nuclear nonproliferation and a \\"new climate\\" in international relations fostered by Obama, especially in reaching out to the Muslim world. The Nobel Committee's decision drew mixed reactions from US commentators and editorial writers across the political spectrum, as well as from the rest of the world. Obama accepted the prize in Oslo on December 10, 2009. In a 36-minute speech, he discussed the tensions between war and peace and the idea of a \\"just war\\" saying, \\"perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander-in-Chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars.\\" Obama is the fourth President of the United States to have won the Nobel Peace Prize (after Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Jimmy Carter, with Carter's honor happening after leaving office). Nomination and announcement The winner is selected by the Nobel Committee from nominations submitted by committee members and others. Nominations for the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize closed just 11 days after Obama took office. There were 205 nominations for the 2009 award, which included Chinese and Afghan civil rights activists and African politicians. Colombian Senator Piedad C√≥rdoba, Afghanistan's Sima Samar, Chinese dissident Hu Jia and Prime Minister of Zimbabwe Morgan Tsvangirai had been speculated to be favorites for the award. The five members of the Nobel Committee are appointed by the Norwegian Parliament to roughly reflect the party makeup of that body. The 2009 Committee comprised two members of the Norwegian Labor Party, one from the left-wing Socialist Left Party, one from the Conservative Party of Norway and one from the right-wing Progress Party. The chairman of the Committee was Thorbj√∏rn Jagland, former Norwegian Labor Party prime minister and Secretary General of the Council of Europe since September 29, 2009. The panel met six or seven times in 2009, beginning several weeks after the February 1 nomination deadline. The winner was chosen unanimously on October 5, but was initially opposed by the Socialist Left, Conservative and Progress Party members until strongly persuaded by Jagland.Dagbladet, \\"- Nobel-flertallet argumenterte mot Obama\\" Jagland said \\"We have not given the prize for what may happen in the future. We are awarding Obama for what he has done in the past year. And we are hoping this may contribute a little bit for what he is trying to do,\\" noting that he hoped the award would assist Obama's foreign policy efforts. Jagland said the committee was influenced by a speech Obama gave about Islam in Cairo in June 2009, the president's efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation and climate change, and Obama's support for using established international bodies such as the United Nations to pursue foreign policy goals. The New York Times reported that Jagland shrugged off the question of whether \\"the committee feared being labeled na√Øve for accepting a young politician's promises at face value\\", stating that \\"no one could deny that 'the international climate' had suddenly improved, and that Mr. Obama was the main reason... We want to embrace the message that he stands for.\\" Barack Obama with Thorbj√∏rn Jagland at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony. Obama was the fourth U.S. President to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, after Theodore Roosevelt (1906) and Woodrow Wilson (1919)‚Äîboth of whom received the award during their terms‚Äîand Jimmy Carter (2002), who received the award 21 years after leaving office. In addition, then-sitting Vice President Charles Dawes was a co-winner with Austen Chamberlain (1925), and former Vice President Al Gore was a co-winner with the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) Obama was the first U.S. president to receive the award during his first year in office (at eight and a half months, after being nominated less than two weeks in office), although several other world leaders were awarded in the year following their election to national office, including √ìscar Arias (1987) and Aung San Suu Kyi (1991). Reactions Barack Obama Obama said he was \\"surprised\\" and \\"deeply humbled\\" by the award. In remarks given at the White House Rose Garden on the day of the announcement, Obama stated, \\"I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments but rather an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations.\\"\\"Remarks by the President on Winning the Nobel Peace Prize\\" , October 9, 2009, retrieved same day \\"Throughout history, the Nobel Peace Prize has not just been used to honor specific achievement; it's also been used as a means to give momentum to a set of causes,\\" Obama said. \\"And that is why I will accept this award as a call to action ‚Äî a call for all nations to confront the common challenges of the 21st century.\\" He said those common challenges included the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons (which he said might not occur in his lifetime), nuclear proliferation, climate change, tolerance \\"among people of different faiths and races and religions\\", peace between and security for Israelis and Palestinians, better social conditions for the world's poor, including \\"the ability to get an education and make a decent living; the security that you won't have to live in fear of disease or violence without hope for the future.\\" The United States, he said, is \\"a country that's responsible for ending a war and working in another theater to confront a ruthless adversary that directly threatens the American people and our allies.\\" The award, he said, \\"must be shared with everyone who strives for justice and dignity ‚Äî for the young woman who marches silently in the streets on behalf of her right to be heard even in the face of beatings and bullets; for the leader imprisoned in her own home because she refuses to abandon her commitment to democracy [referring to Aung San Suu Kyi]; for the soldier who sacrificed through tour after tour of duty on behalf of someone half a world away; and for all those men and women across the world who sacrifice their safety and their freedom and sometime their lives for the cause of peace.\\" He did not take questions from reporters after giving his statement. Like the thought of President Jimmy Carter and Lyndon Johnson who awarded him of the Medal of Freedom in 1964, Obama speeches were more times influenced by the Protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr.. Archived from the original on Jun 17, 2018 The 2009 Nobel Prize speech recalled a mix of Niebuhr's political realism and moral thinking. Obama announced early that he would donate the full 10 million Swedish kronor (about US$1.4 million) monetary award to charity. The largest donations were given to the housing charity Fisher House Foundation who received $250,000, and the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund which received $200,000. Eight organizations which support education also received a donation. $125,000 was donated to the College Summit, the Posse Foundation, the United Negro College Fund, the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, the Appalachian Leadership and Education Foundation, and the American Indian College Fund. $100,000 was donated to Africare, and the Central Asia Institute. In the United States Obama's winning of the peace prize was largely unanticipated and called a \\"stunning surprise\\" by The New York Times, though major oddsmaker Centrebet had in fact put him at 7‚Äì1 odds of winning, with Piedad C√≥rdoba and Sima Samar at 6‚Äì1 and Morgan Tsvangirai at 7‚Äì1. In a USA Today / Gallup Poll conducted October 16‚Äì19, 61% of American adults polled responded that they thought Obama did not deserve to win the prize, while 34% responded that he did; when asked if they were personally glad that Obama won the award, 46% of respondents said they were and 47% said they were not glad (poll margin of error +/-3%). There was widespread criticism of the Nobel Committee's decision from commentators and editorial writers across the political spectrum. The New York Times published a mildly-supportive editorial which said the prize was \\"a (barely) implicit condemnation of Mr. Bush's presidency. But countering the ill will Mr. Bush created around the world is one of Mr. Obama's great achievements in less than nine months in office. Mr. Obama's willingness to respect and work with other nations is another.\\" It said that much remains to be done. Among those agreeing that the award was a criticism of the Bush administration were the editorial pages of the Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post, as well as Thomas L. Friedman of The New York Times. Today host Matt Lauer and Jonah Goldberg of the National Review said that less than a year into the first term, there have been \\"no major foreign policy achievements to date.\\" Goldberg added: \\"surely someone in Iran‚Äîor maybe the Iranian protestors generally‚Äîcould have benefitted more from receiving the prize\\" while in CounterPunch, political journalist Alexander Cockburn said that, in historical context of other former U.S. Presidents winning the Nobel Peace Prize, the award to Obama \\"represents a radical break in tradition, since he's only had slightly less than nine months to discharge his imperial duties.\\" Peter Beinart of the Daily Beast called the decision a \\"farce\\", while Noam Chomsky said : \\"In defense of the committee, we might say that the achievement of doing nothing to advance peace places Obama on a considerably higher moral plane than some of the earlier recipients\\".\\"Hopes And Prospects\\", Amnesty International Lecture given in Belfast, Northern Ireland, October 30, 2009 Many were critical of the Nobel Committee. A The Wall Street Journal editorial, noting Obama's comment that the world's problems \\"can't be met by any one leader or any one nation\\", opined, \\"What this suggests to us‚Äîand to the Norwegians‚Äîis the end of what has been called 'American exceptionalism'. This is the view that U.S. values have universal application and should be promoted without apology, and defended with military force when necessary. Put in this context, we wonder if most Americans will count this peace-of-the-future prize as a compliment.\\" The Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson wrote that the committee members \\"have forfeited any claim to seriousness. Peace‚Äîthe kind of peace that keeps people from being killed and oppressed‚Äîis an achievement, not a sentiment. [...] Intending to honor Obama, the committee has actually embarrassed him.\\" Commentary magazine's Peter Wehner wrote that the award, with past awards that seemed aimed at criticizing the Bush administration, showed the Nobel Committee \\"long ago ceased to be a serious entity; this choice merely confirms that judgment.\\"\\"Another Slap at Bush‚ÄîBut He Can Take It.\\" According to The Washington Post news analyst Dan Balz, \\"[E]ven among his supporters there was a sense of surprise and even shock on Friday [the day of the announcement], a belief that the award was premature, a disservice and a potential liability.\\" An editorial in The Washington Post began, \\"It's an odd Nobel Peace Prize that almost makes you embarrassed for the honoree\\", and compared the Nobel Committee's statement that Obama had \\"created a new climate in international politics\\" to a recent satirical skit on television. A Los Angeles Times editorial said the committee \\"didn't just embarrass Obama, it diminished the credibility of the prize itself\\". Thomas L. Friedman of The New York Times wrote, \\"It dismays me that the most important prize in the world has been devalued in this way\\". Much of the commentary across the political spectrum involved describing the award as something risible, with the humor focusing on Obama's getting the award without having accomplished much. According to an analysis in The New York Times, \\"it [...] [is] striking how so many people seemed to greet the Nobel news with shock followed by laughter,\\" On the morning of the announcement, several of The Washington Post opinion-page columnists, posting at the newspaper's \\"Post Partisan\\" blog, characterized the award as laughable or directly satirized it, including such supportive columnists as Ruth Marcus (\\"ridiculous‚Äîembarrassing, even\\"), Richard Cohen (who satirized the award), and foreign-affairs columnist David Ignatius (\\"goofy\\" and \\"weird\\"), and Michael Kinsley (whose satirical response came the next day). Other prominent commentators who often supported Obama but responded with ridicule included Peter Beinart, Bienart, a columnist at The Daily Beast website, used to be editor of The New Republic and Ann Althouse.; in addition to being a blogger, Althouse has guest blogged at Instapundit.com, The Volokh Conspiracy blog and has written for The New York Times Op-Ed page and the newspapers website; Her comment: \\"Riddle: Why didn't Barack Obama win the Nobel Prize for Literature? Answer: He wrote 2 books.\\" James Taranto wrote in The Wall Street Journal an article summarising various opinions on the Internet, concluding how the award was embarrassing for Obama. He said the award was a \\"staggeringly premature honor--the equivalent of a lifetime- achievement Oscar for a child star--makes yesterday's satire into today's news\\". Fred Greenstein, presidential historian and author and professor of politics emeritus at Princeton University, told FOX News that giving President Obama the Nobel Peace Prize is a \\"premature canonization\\" and an \\"embarrassment to the Nobel process.\\" Slate magazine blogger Mickey Kaus, The New York Times columnist David Brooks and former U.N. ambassador John Bolton amongst others, called for Obama to not accept the award; pundit Michael Crowley argued that it was a \\"mixed blessing\\". Subsequent to the award many Americans now consider that Obama did not deserve it in the light of following events. Opponents of the award cite the expansion of the War on Terror and the large increase in the number of drone strikes carried out under Obama, specifically in Pakistan. There have been a number of calls for Obama to either return the award or to have the Nobel Committee recall it, most recently in 2013. In April 2013 a petition was begun asking the Nobel Committee to rescind the Peace Prize. The petition garnered 10,000 signatures in its first day and nearly 20,000 by the end of its first week. Political reaction Nobel laureate and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore called the award \\"extremely well deserved\\". Obama received congratulations and kind words from other elected officials, such as from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former rival, Senator John McCain, who said, \\"As Americans, we're proud when our president receives an award of that prestigious category\\". RNC chairman Michael Steele discussed his disapproval of the award in a fund-raising letter, writing, \\"the Democrats and their international leftist allies want America made subservient to the agenda of global redistribution and control.\\" In 2015, Geir Lundestad, the non-voting Director of the Nobel Institute and secretary for the Nobel Committee at the time of the award, published a memoir, Secretary of Peace. In it, he wrote \\"In hindsight, we could say that the argument of giving Obama a helping hand was only partially correct. Many of Obama's supporters believed it was a mistake.\\" Lundestad said that Obama had been surprised by the award, and considered not going to Oslo to accept it. He also said in his memoir that Obama had since failed to live up to the Nobel Committee's expectations. In Norway A poll conducted by Synovate for the newspaper Dagbladet showed that 43% of the Norwegian population believed giving Obama the prize was right, while 38% believed it was wrong. 19% had no opinion. The poll showed a sharp divide between younger and older people; of those over 60 years of age 58% were for and only 31% against it. Of those between 18 and 29 years of age, only 25% approved of the decision, while 42% disapproved. The award divided opinion among politicians. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg congratulated Obama for a \\"well-deserved prize\\". Siv Jensen, leader of the opposition Progress Party, said that while Obama had taken several good initiatives the committee should have waited to see their results. Erna Solberg, leader of the Conservative Party, also said that the prize came early and increased pressure on Obama to live up to the expectation. Torstein Dahle, the leader of the far leftist party Red, called the award a scandal, citing the fact that Obama was the commander-in-chief of a country at war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Other reactions The response from U.S. allies was generally positive; reactions around the world were mixed: Several Nobel Laureates have commented: Bangladeshi economist Muhammad Yunus, (co-winner 2006 prize), said the committee's award was \\"an endorsement of [Obama] and the direction he is taking.\\" Archbishop Desmond Tutu said the award to Obama \\"anticipates an even greater contribution towards making our world a safer place for all.\\" Mairead Corrigan, (co-winner 1976), expressed her disappointment, stating, \\"[g]iving this award to the leader of the most militarized country in the world, which has taken the human family against its will to war, will be rightly seen by many people around the world as a reward for his country's aggression and domination.\\" Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, (1983) cofounder of the Solidarity trade union, and former president of Poland said the award was premature. \\"He has not yet made a real input.\\" The 14th Dalai Lama congratulated Obama. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon praised the Nobel Committee's choice. \\"We are entering an era of renewed multilateralism [...] President Obama embodies the new spirit of dialogue and engagement on the world's biggest problems: climate change, nuclear disarmament and a wide range of peace and security challenges.\\" In Europe, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the award would reinforce Obama's determination to work for justice and peace. He added that the award \\"finally confirms the return of America in the hearts of all the peoples of the world\\". Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said the award will encourage warmer U.S.‚ÄìRussian relations, and he hoped it would \\"serve as an additional incentive\\" for both governments to foster a better \\"climate in world politics\\". British Prime Minister Gordon Brown sent a private message of congratulations to President Obama. Hope that the prize would assist Obama's efforts toward nuclear disarmament was also a part of congratulatory statements from Ireland's Taoiseach Brian Cowen and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Vatican spokesman Fr. Federico Lombardi said the Vatican \\"appreciated\\" the nomination.

In a 36-minute speech, reportedly written by Obama and then edited by Jon Favreau and Ben Rhodes, he discussed the tensions between war and peace and the idea of a \\"just war\\". The address contained elements of the ideas of Reinhold Niebuhr, someone Obama once described as one of his favorite philosophers. The speech was generally well received by American pundits on both ends of the political spectrum. Several noted similarities between Obama's message and the rhetoric of President George W. Bush. This was also mentioned by former Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson, who called it a \\"very American speech\\" and wrote that \\"Obama was recognizing that the great commitments and themes of American foreign policy are durably bipartisan\\". A number of prominent Republican politicians publicly praised the speech, including Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin. Conservative The New York Times columnist Ross Douthat called it an oftentimes impressive speech that was \\"An extended defense of using realist means in the service of liberal internationalist ends\\". Columnist Andrew Sullivan distinguished between the Obama and Bush messages, stating that \\"Obama is far more conservative than his predecessor\\" in his views on human imperfection, reality, and war; he also linked the speech back to the tragic nature of Obama's line \\"the audacity of hope\\". Former Jimmy Carter speechwriter Hendrik Hertzberg said that the speech \\"will live on for a long time as a text for peacemakers in power\\". A few commentators were more critical, with former US Ambassador to the UN John Bolton calling it \\"pedestrian, turgid, and uninspired\\" and US Congressman Dennis Kucinich \\"Once we are committed to war's instrumentality in pursuit of peace, we begin the Orwellian journey to the semantic netherworld where war is peace...\\" The New York Times praised the eloquence of the speech, noting that \\"President Obama gave the speech he needed to give, but we suspect not precisely the one the Nobel committee wanted to hear.\\" The Wall Street Journal echoed this sentiment and congratulated Obama for defending the occasional necessity of war and for stating that evil exists in the world, though used the same editorial to criticize him for current disarmament talks with Russia and a lack of progress with Iran and North Korea.

Native to southeastern Australia, it is found in wet sclerophyll forest and rainforest on rich acidic soils high in organic matter. No subspecies are recognised, though a northern isolated population hybridises extensively with the Braidwood waratah (T. mongaensis). Reaching a height of up to , T. oreades grows with a single trunk and erect habit. It has dark green leaves with prominent veins that are long and wide. The red flower heads, known as inflorescences, appear in late spring. Each is composed of up to 60 individual flowers. In the garden, T. oreades grows in soils with good drainage and ample moisture in part-shaded or sunny positions. Several commercially available cultivars that are hybrid forms with T. speciosissima have been developed, such as the 'Shady Lady' series. The timber is hard and has been used for making furniture and tool handles. Description Flowering plant in Errinundra National Park Telopea oreades grows as a large shrub or narrow tree high with a trunk reaching in diameter. Greyish brown, the trunk is thin in relation to the tree's height and not buttressed. Its surface is smooth with horizontal lenticels and warty protuberances. Smaller branches are more brown and smooth. Young plants have a much more erect habit than other members of the genus Telopea and their stems have a distinct reddish tinge. The shiny dark green leaves are arranged alternately along the stems. The leaves are narrow-obovate to spathulate, and measure long and wide. They have a sunken midrib on the upperside (and corresponding ridge on the underside) with four to six pairs of lateral veins visible at a 45 degree angle to the midline. They veer and converge to form an easily seen vein that runs around inside the leaf margin. The undersurface is paler and greyer. When dried, the leaves appear to have a granular texture. Flowering occurs between October and December in its native range, with plants at higher elevations flowering later than ones at lower altitude. The crimson flowerheads are about in diameter. They are composed of 36 to 60 individual flowers with green to pink bracts, which may be up to long. Each flower is encased in a long perianth, which is a much brighter red on the surface facing the centre of the flower than the surface facing outwards. Anthesis, or the opening of the flowers, begins with those at the centre of the flowerhead and moves to the edges or base. The individual flower bears a sessile anther (that is, it lacks a filament), which lies next to the stigma at the end of the style. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore. After flowering, the curved leathery to woody follicles develop; these are long, which somewhat resemble a boat in shape. These ripen the following May to September, and split open to reveal (and spill) 10‚Äì16 seeds. Arranged in two columns, the winged, flat brown seeds are around long with a roughly rectangular wing long. New shoots often grow through flowerheads. It can be difficult to distinguish T. oreades from T. mongaensis though the leaves of the latter species are more prominently veined, and mostly (but not always) narrower than wide. Telopea oreades flowers around a month earlier than T. mongaensis in areas where both are present. Taxonomy Open follicles following release of seeds The Gippsland waratah was first formally described by the Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1861 in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. The type material was collected in rugged mountainous country around Nungatta Creek, a tributary of the Genoa River in south-eastern New South Wales. Mueller had been surveying the mountainous eastern part of the state since the 1850s. The species name is said to be derived from the Ancient Greek oreos \\"mountain\\" and hence means \\"of or relating to a mountain\\". The proper word for \\"mountain\\" in Ancient Greek is however oros (·ΩÑœÅŒøœÇ).Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. Revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie.Oxford: Clarendon Press. The only alternative scientific name proposed was in 1891, when Otto Kuntze named it as Hylogyne oreades, but it was rejected as an illegitimate name. Common names applies to the species include Gippsland-, Victorian-, mountain-, and tree waratah. Telopea oreades is one of five species from southeastern Australia that make up the genus Telopea. No subspecies are recognised. It has been difficult to distinguish from the similar T. mongaensis, but microscopic analysis has revealed that T. oreades has features termed sclereids while T. mongaensis does not. The two are sister species, and their next closest relative is the Tasmanian waratah (T. truncata). A disjunct northern population of T. oreades grows together with T. mongaensis in the southern Monga Valley in southern New South Wales, with some hybrids reported. Crisp and Weston concluded that the two species for the most part did not hybridise there. However, a genetic study using microsatellites found there was extensive hybridisation, with much of the presumed pure T. oreades showing a close relation to T. mongaensis. The populations of waratahs are thought to have grown and shrunk with the ebb and flow of ice ages in the Pleistocene, finally stranding a population of T. oreades located alongside T. mongaensis as conditions suitable for waratahs changed in southeastern Australia. The genus lies in the subtribe Embothriinae, along with the tree waratahs (Alloxylon) from eastern Australia and New Caledonia, and Oreocallis and Chilean firetree (Embothrium coccineum) from South America. Almost all these species have red terminal flowers, and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance must predate the splitting of Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago. Distribution and habitat Range in southeastern Australia (in red) Telopea oreades occurs in moist forests and temperate rainforests of coastal ranges and tableland escarpments in two disjunct areas of southeastern Australia. The first is centred on East Gippsland in Victoria, from Orbost to the vicinity of Eden across the border in far southeastern New South Wales. There is a more northerly population around the Monga Valley near Braidwood, New South Wales extending to Moss Vale. There are unconfirmed reports of the species in the vicinity of Brown Mountain and Glenbog State Forest in southern New South Wales, which lie between the two areas. Plants in Victoria are found at altitudes ranging from in Lind National Park to on Mount Ellery. Wetter eastern and southern slopes are favoured habitats, and the annual rainfall ranges from . T. oreades grows in acidic soil that is high in nutrients and organic matter. Associated tree species in Victoria include shining gum (Eucalyptus nitens), messmate (E. obliqua), mountain grey gum (E. cypellocarpa), cut-tail (E. fastigata), silvertop ash (E. sieberi), southern sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum), black oliveberry (Elaeocarpus holopetalus), blanket leaf (Bedfordia arborescens), Australian blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon), privet mock‚Äêolive (Notelaea ligustrina), banyalla (Pittosporum bicolor), Errinundra plum pine (Podocarpus sp. Goonmirk Rocks), Errinundra pepper (Tasmannia xerophila subsp. robusta) and soft tree fern (Dicksonia antarctica). Conservation Telopea oreades is not listed under Commonwealth environmental legislation and is not considered by respective state authorities to be rare or threatened in Victoria or New South Wales. The species does occur in the threatened Cool Temperate Rainforest Community in Victoria that is protected under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, and it is a component of the threatened Southern Escarpment Wet Sclerophyll Forests of far southern New South Wales. Furthermore, planted specimens are frequently stolen from bush regeneration sites as they are desirable garden plants. Conversely in New Zealand, there is a report of T. oreades escaping into kanuka scrub from the trout hatchery gardens on the Tongariro River south of Lake Taupo. Ecology Mature plant in cool temperate rainforest habitat The prominent position and striking colour of Telopea oreades and many of its relatives within the subtribe Embothriinae‚Äîboth in Australia and South America‚Äîstrongly suggest it is adapted to pollination by birds, and has been for over 60 million years. Birds recorded visiting the flowers for their nectar include red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), eastern spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris), crescent honeyeater (Phylidonyris pyrrhopterus), yellow-faced honeyeater (Lichenostomus chrysops), brown-headed honeyeater (Melithreptus brevirostris), white-naped honeyeater (Melithreptus lunatus) and silvereye (Zosterops lateralis). T. oreades has a central taproot and few lateral roots. Like most Proteaceae, it has fine proteoid roots that arise from larger roots. These are roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. They are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, including the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. T. oreades has a swollen woody base largely under the soil known as a lignotuber, which stores energy and nutrients as a resource for rapid growth after a bushfire. The wet forests in which it grows seldom catch fire. When they do, the plant community becomes a more open sclerophyll woodland until slow-growing plants with larger leaves take over. New shoots grow from the lignotuber, which survives bushfire as the rest of the plant above ground is burnt. The seed also germinates and grows in post-bushfire soil, which is higher in nutrients and more open with fewer competing plant species. Waratah seeds are often eaten‚Äîand destroyed‚Äîby animals and do not travel far (several metres) from the parent plants. Cultivation and uses Developing flowerhead in bud Telopea oreades needs a well-drained location as well as reliable moisture to thrive. Soil with some clay content is beneficial. It is more shade-tolerant than the more popular New South Wales waratah, preferring part-shade but tolerating sunny aspects. It tolerates moderate frosts. Plants can be hard-pruned‚Äîlopping old stems and branches can rejuvenate mature plants. Plants can benefit from low-phosphorus fertilizer applied in spring and autumn. Propagation is by seed, the germination rates of which fall significantly after several months' storage unless refrigerated, or by cuttings of new growth that has just hardened. Cultivars must be propagated by cutting to make daughter plants identical to the parent. T. oreades has been grown successfully in England. The plant was first cultivated there by Canon Arthur Townsend Boscawen at Ludgvan in Cornwall from seed that he obtained in 1910. He had succeeded in bringing the plant into flower by 1915, providing material for illustration in Curtis's Botanical Magazine in 1916. A plant in Cornwall reached in height, while another at Wakehurst Place reached in the late 1980s. Although thriving at Wakehurst, the species can be very sensitive to English soils. The Royal Horticultural Society awarded the species an Award of Merit in 1916. A selected white-flowered form from the Errinundra Plateau, which was originally known as 'Plateau View Alba' or 'Plateau View White', was registered by the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority in 1990 as 'Errindundra White'. Plantsmen have also developed several hybrids with T. speciosissima, looking to combine the hardiness of T. oreades with the showier flowerheads of the latter. Red-, pink- and even white-flowered cultivars are available. * Telopea 'Champagne' is a cultivar registered under plant breeders' rights (PBR) in 2006. Its creamy yellow flowerheads appear from October to December. It is a three-way hybrid between T. speciosissima, T. oreades and the yellow-flowered form of T. truncata. * Telopea 'Golden Globe' is a cultivar registered under PBR in 2005. Larger than 'Champagne', it is also a three-way hybrid between T. speciosissima, T. oreades and the yellow-flowered form of T. truncata. It has been propagated and sold as 'Shady Lady Yellow'. It was originally bred in the Dandenong Ranges east of Melbourne. * Telopea 'Shady Lady Red' is a larger shrub that may reach high and wide. A hybrid of T. speciosissima and T. oreades, it arose by chance in a Melbourne garden. The first of the 'Shady Lady' series of cultivars, it became commercially available in the mid-1980s. The flowerheads are smaller and lack the bracts of the speciosissima parent. As its name suggests, it tolerates more shade. It is vigorous and more reliable in temperate and subtropical areas, and grows in semi-shade or sun. * Telopea 'Shady Lady White' is a white-flowered hybrid between T. speciosissima and T. oreades. * Telopea 'Shady Lady Pink' is the result of a cross between 'Shady Lady Red' and 'Shady Lady White'. *Telopea 'Shady Lady Crimson' is a selected colour form developed from 'Shady Lady Red'. It became commercially available in Australia in 2010. The timber is fairly hard and resembles silky oak (Grevillea robusta). It is durable and can be readily polished and worked with, making it amenable for use in furniture, picture frames and tool handles.

He was a pioneer in the field of electricity generation through wind power and his wind turbine, which was used to light his holiday home in Marykirk, was the world's first-known structure by which electricity was generated from wind power. Blyth patented his design and later developed an improved model which served as an emergency power source at Montrose Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary & Dispensary for the next 30 years. Although Blyth received recognition for his contributions to science, electricity generation by wind power was considered uneconomical and no more wind turbines were built in the United Kingdom until 1951, some 64 years after Blyth built his first prototype. Early life Blyth's \\"windmill\\" at his cottage in Marykirk in 1891 James Blyth was born in Marykirk, Kincardineshire, on 4 April 1839 to John Blyth, an innkeeper and small farmer, and his wife Catherine. He attended the Marykirk parish school and later, the Montrose Academy before winning a scholarship to the General Assembly Normal School, Edinburgh in 1886. After graduating as a Bachelor of Arts from The University of Edinburgh in 1861, Blyth taught mathematics at Morrison's Academy in Crieff and established the technical and scientific curriculum for the newly established George Watson's College in Edinburgh. Blyth completed his Master of Arts in 1871 and in the same year married Jesse Wilhelmena Taylor at the United Presbyterian Church in Athol Place, Edinburgh. They had two sons and five daughters, two of whom died in infancy. Career In 1880 Blyth was appointed Freeland Professor of Natural Philosophy at Anderson's College, Glasgow, which became the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College in 1886. Whilst teaching at the technical college he pursued an active research programme with a particular interest in the generation and storage of electricity from wind power. Blyth was liked by his students and colleagues who admired his hard working nature, down-to-earth attitude and willingness to roll up his sleeves. He was also well known in the local community through a series of popular lectures and demonstrations. In July 1887 Blyth built a cloth-sailed wind turbine (or \\"windmill\\") in the garden of his holiday cottage in Marykirk and used the electricity it produced to charge accumulators; the stored electricity was used to power the lights in his cottage, which thus became the first house in the world to be powered by wind-generated electricity. In a paper delivered to the Philosophical Society of Glasgow on 2 May 1888, Blyth described the wind turbine as being \\"of a tripod design, with a 33-foot windshaft, four arms of 13 feet with canvas sails, and a Burgin dynamo driven from the flywheel using a rope\\". The turbine produced enough power to light ten 25-volt bulbs in a \\"moderate breeze\\" and could even be used to power a small lathe. The 1895 turbine built for the Montrose Lunatic Asylum Over the next few years Blyth experimented with a number of different designs. The final design operated for the next 25 years and produced surplus electricity which Blyth offered to the people of Marykirk to light the main street of the town. But his offer was rejected, as the people thought electricity was \\"the work of The Devil\\". Blyth was awarded a UK patent for his \\"wind engine\\" in November 1891. In 1895 he licensed the Glasgow engineering company, Mavor and Coulson, to build a second, improved turbine, which was used to supply emergency power to the Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary of Montrose; the system operated successfully for the next 30 years.Making Scotland's landscape: The Climate Presented by Professor Iain Stewart, Producer Michael Burke, Director Colin Murray, BBC Scotland Television screened 11 December 2010 Blyth's original wind generator was the first known structure by which electricity was generated from wind power, but its lack of a braking mechanism meant it was prone to damage in strong winds. In the winter of 1887, some months after Blyth's first wind generator was built, American, Charles F. Brush built the first automatically operated wind turbine. The design of Brush's machine allowed it to be shut down manually to protect it from wind damage. The improved design of the turbine built for the Montrose Lunatic Asylum (which was based on Thomas Robinson's anemometer design) went some way towards solving this problem but it could not be guaranteed to stall in very strong winds. In 1891 Blyth presented a paper to the Royal Society of Edinburgh espousing his belief in the benefits of renewable energy sources, particularly wind but also wave energy. Later that year he was awarded the Brisbane Gold Medal by the Royal Scottish Society of Arts for his work in producing electrical energy from wind, but his wind turbine was not considered to be economically viable. Blyth's other research interests included the relative efficiency of different forms of lighting, telephone communication, and microphones; he also contributed entries on a number of topics for the ninth edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Later life and death Blyth's son, Vincent James (1874‚Äì1916), and his son-in-law, George Edwin Allan (1870‚Äì1955), both became demonstrators, assistants and lecturers in the Department of Natural Philosophy. Blyth himself was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Glasgow in 1900. He died from apoplexy at his home in Glasgow on 15 May 1906. His friend Dr. James Colville remembered him as \\"a true man of science...one who by insight, patient toil, and mechanical ingenuity did much in his day to explain and illustrate many of the facts of physical science.\\" Legacy The Professor James Blyth Memorial Committee, composed of Blyth's former students and associates, was established in March 1907 to raise funds for a memorial to him. The memorial eventually took the form of endowing the Blyth Memorial Prizes, and erecting a wall plaque in the College. The turbine at Montrose Asylum was dismantled in 1914. Britain's first public utility wind turbine did not come into operation until 1951, when a prototype turbine built by John Brown Engineering of Glasgow was installed at Costa Head, Orkney.

Designated as large patrol boats with anti-submarine warfare and air defence capabilities, both Split and its sister ship Koper were eventually armed with launchers for four P-20 anti-ship missiles making them one of the best armed ships in the navy's inventory at the time. During the Croatian War of Independence Split took part in the Battle of the Dalmatian Channels where it was noted for shelling the city of Split after which it was named. With the withdrawal of Yugoslav Navy forces from Croatian territorial waters, Split, along with most of the fleets ships, was relocated to Montenegro. During the 1990s, it was redesignated as RF-31 and possibly renamed Beograd. The ship was decommissioned sometime between 2001 and 2005. After unsuccessful attempts of selling it as a complete warship, it was sold for scrap and broken up in 2013.  Design and construction  During the 1970s the SFR Yugoslav Navy (JRM) was seeking surface ships to increase the overall firepower of its fleet, improving capabilities that were until then either obsolete or nonexistent on other ships in its inventory. Split was laid down in January 1978 at the A.M. Gorky Shipyard in Zelenodolsk as the fourth ship in its class (Projekt 1159). Launched on 21 April 1979, it was temporarily commissioned with the Soviet Navy on 30 November 1979 under the name Sokol. On 10 March 1980 it was acquired by the JRM for a price of 18.27 million dollars, given a new name, Split, and classified as a VPBR (hr. Veliki Patrolni BRod; en. Large patrol boat). Split measured in length, had a beam of and displaced while fully loaded. Like other Koni-class frigates it employed a CODAG type propulsion combining a single M-8G 20.000 hp gas turbine with two 8000 hp diesel engines giving it a maximum speed of Power was also provided by one 200 kW and two 300 kW diesel generators. The ship had a range of at and an endurance of 10 days. ASW weapons included two RBU-6000 launchers mounted side by side, controlled by the \\"Burya\\" fire control system with additional 120 rounds in storage, as well as twelve BB-1 conventional depth charges. Cannon armament consisted of two 76 mm AK-726 dual guns mounted on the ship's bow and stern with two AK-230 CIWS placed on the sides and controlled by the MR-104 \\"Ris\\" FCS. Air defence was provided by a single dual mount for the 4K33 \\"Osa-M\\" system with 20 additional missiles. Four stern facing launchers for P-20 anti-ship missiles were installed soon after the ship was commissioned with the JRM.  Service  Approximate positions of Yugoslav Navy ships, including Split, on 15 November during the Battle of the Dalmatian Channels. During the early stages of the Croatian War of Independence Split, often mistakenly referred to as a destroyer due to Croatian media propaganda, served as the command ship of the TG Ka≈°tela (naval tactical group) which was tasked with enforcing the naval blockade of the Croatian coastline and islands due to secret supply or arms to Croatian forces, and playing a command role in the Ka≈°tela Tactical naval Group of the Yugoslav Navy. In the early morning hours of about 03:30AM Croatians launched attack on the Yugoslav Patrol boat Pƒå-176 Mukos Mukos (Pƒå-176) with a guided homemade torpedo, killing 6 sailors during their sleep. After 05:30 AM on the same day Croatian nationalists from the HOS brought a 100mm MT-12 anti-tank cannon to Zvonƒçac (Split area) to act as coastal battery and opened fire on Yugoslav Naval Vessels in the Braƒç Channel. After more than one hour under constant attack of the HOS and their cannons in 100mm,85mm and 90mm caliber from Zvonƒçac, Baƒçvice, ≈†olta and Braƒç, Yugoslav Navy responded to neutralize fire targets and observing points in the Split harbour. VPBR-31 Split operating under the code name \\"Sava\\" along with other ships of the tactical group opened fire on the city of Split and the islands of Braƒç and ≈†olta. exactly at 06:30, with the shelling ending at 07:15 - during that period Croatian media already proclaimed the attack on Split from the Yugoslav Navy. All of the Yugoslav Navy ships started retreating towards Vis with no visible damage. On 19 November Split was called in to rescue a convoy of overloaded JRM ships that was sailing from Pula to Vis across open sea during strong jugo winds. While rescuing the crew from one of the landing crafts, two sailors died because the ladder thrown to them from Split, accidentally hit them causing them to drown. After the retreat of all Yugoslav Navy forces from Croatia, Split was relocated to Montenegro where it was renamed Beograd in 1993 with its designation being changed to RF-31 (sr. raketna fregata; eng. missile frigate).  Decommissioning and aftermath  On 17 August 2001 the FR Yugoslav Ministry of Defence decommissioned the ship declaring it redundant. The ship was located within the \\"Sava Kovaƒçeviƒá\\" overhaul shipyard in Tivat until 2008 when it was berthed near a military object on Lu≈°tica. Due to the lack of any kind of maintenance, parts of the hull became corroded which resulted in several breaches so sea water needed to be pumped out from time to time. 2004 marked the last time Split sailed on its own during a demonstration for the representatives of the Sri Lankan Navy who were interested in buying the ship. Although the deal was near done, the catastrophic 2004 tsunami and subsequent damage prompted the Sri Lankans to stop the acquisition of all new military equipment, including the purchase of Split. In 2009 Split along with three other frigates was being sold for a price of 3.2 million euros, each. In May 2011 the price for Split was reduced to 1 million euros, but again, no deals were made In 2010 divers from Herceg Novi proposed reaching an agreement with Croatia and scuttling the Split on the sea border of the two countries where it would become a diving site. The act was also to have a symbolic meaning of peace because the ship became notorious in Croatia after attacking the city after which it was named. In October 2011 the Government of Montenegro adopted a document in which it was stated that attempts at selling the ship as a complete warship will stop, and it would instead be sold for scrap. Before the scrapping took place, weapons systems, radio communication and other electrical equipment as well as two MTU 8V396 diesel generators that were installed in 1997 and 1999, were removed from the ship. On 19 August 2013 Split was towed away to a ship breaking yard in Durr√´s after being sold to an Albanian company for 400.000 euros.

By 5 September the industrial action had spread with a quarter of the country's postal workers on strike, and by the time an agreement was reached the following week, the strike had spread throughout the British mainland (workers in Northern Ireland did not strike). No mail was being delivered by this point and, in order to ease the backlog of post, bosses at Royal Mail placed an embargo on the delivery of overseas mail. By the time the strike ended there was a backlog of 150 million undelivered letters and parcels. The postal strike sparked a rise in the sale of fax machines, which helped ease the impact of the strike. The issue of temporary workers also led to some violence. In an incident at a sorting office in Liverpool, three men were arrested and charged with disorderly behaviour after pickets threw bottles at workers arriving at the facility. The strike came to an end on 13 September after union representatives and Royal Mail managers held talks over the preceding weekend. However, because of the backlog of mail, deliveries remained unreliable for several weeks afterwards. The strike led to a delay in the receipt of information concerning the September 1988 unemployment statistics which were briefly over-recorded as a result.

It was located on the east bank of the Colorado River, at Beale's Crossing, near the head of the Mohave Valley in Mohave County, Arizona by the recommendation of Lieutenant Edward Fitzgerald Beale. After the end of the Indian Wars, the fort was transferred to the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1890. In 1935 it was transferred to the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation; the fort is administered by the state of Arizona. History The first known European to visit the area was Spanish explorer Melchor D√≠az. He documented his travels in present-day northwestern Mohave County in 1540. He recounts meeting a large population of natives who referred to themselves as the Pipa Aha Macav, meaning \\"People by the River\\". From \\"Aha Macav\\" came the shortened name \\"Mojave\\" (also spelled \\"Mohave\\"). The tribe retains the traditional Spanish spelling \\"Mojave,\\" but most English speakers use the modern English spelling \\"Mohave.\\" Both are correct, and both are pronounced \\"Moh-hah-vee\\". Named Camp Colorado, the fort was established by the US to provide protection for emigrants to California through Northern Arizona on the Beale's Wagon Road and across the Mojave Desert on the Mojave Road. It was also used as a base of military operations against the Mohave people. The post was renamed Fort Mohave on April 28, 1859 by its first garrison commander Captain Lewis A. Armistead. With 50 soldiers he defeated 200 Mohave in a battle in the summer of 1859, and ended hostilities with them. Two years later after the start of the American Civil War, Brigadier General Edwin V. Sumner ordered the post abandoned and the buildings burned down on May 28, 1861 in order to withdraw the regular troops to garrison Los Angeles against an anticipated secessionist uprising. Later that year the regulars were sent east to serve with the Union in the Civil War. On May 19, 1863, the post was rebuilt and re-garrisoned by companies B and I of the 4th California Infantry; they were assigned to protect the travelers along the Mohave and Prescott road. The Infantry successfully cultivated friendly relations with the Mojave Indians. These volunteer soldiers also took up prospecting and established mining claims in the area; they did not want to leave, and many returned after being mustered out after the end of the Civil War. Mohave men and women and U.S. Army soldiers at Fort Mojave, ca. 1868 Fort Mohave was garrisoned again by regular United States Army troops until September 29, 1890, when the War Department transferred the land to the Office of Indian Affairs by order of President Benjamin Harrison. The buildings were used as the site of a boarding school for Native American children, where for decades students were required to use English and give up native traditions in an effort to assimilate them to the mainstream culture. After closing the school during the Great Depression, the Office of Indian Affairs transferred the property to the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation. The buildings were not maintained; the ruins of the fort are controlled by the state of Arizona as a tourist attraction.

The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 9, 2009. Description and history The town of Canton, located south of Boston, Massachusetts, was first settled in the 17th century by English colonial settlers involved in the Ponkapoag native \\"praying town\\", but its center of development moved to the southwest in the 18th century due to the higher quality of farmland there. Washington Street, the main east-west road through the district, was laid out in 1700 and Pleasant Street in 1723, running south from Washington Street across a dam that impounded Pequid Brook, the southern extent of the district, to form Reservoir Pond. The town's first colonial meetinghouse was built at Canton Corner in 1707, and its town hall was built there in 1824. The district extends from east to west along Washington Street, from Dedham Street to the Canton Corner Cemetery, and south along Pleasant Street to Pequid Brook. The district includes housing spanning more than 250 years of architectural styles, from Georgian (e.g. the c. 1725 David Tilden House at 93 Pleasant Street) to the Craftsman/Bungalow style (e.g. the 1905 Bessie Estey House at 1452 Washington Street). Its oldest public building is the 1824 First Congregational Parish Church, built in 1824; it is a late Federal period building with both Greek and Gothic Revival features. A particularly fine example of Italianate architecture is the John Williams House at 18 Dedham Street.

It specialised in the mass production of engines and gearboxes for vehicles made by W. R. Morris's businesses, later known as the Nuffield Organisation. Morris Engines Ltd. was, therefore, partly responsible for Morris Motors Ltd. becoming Britain's leading motor manufacturer. Early years Morris Engines Ltd., Gosford Street, Coventry in 1923. Source: P.J. Seymour, 2008 Part of the former Morris Engines factory in Gosford Street, Coventry The William Morris Building Coventry University. (photo 2007) The Hotchkiss company of France, who were makers of the famous machine gun, hurriedly transferred production to England during World War I when it looked as if their St. Denis factory near Paris was going to be overrun by the Germans. Consequently, a factory was erected at Gosford Street, Coventry, and both machines and key staff were brought over to England so that production could start as soon as possible. At the end of the War in 1918, the factory suddenly became short of work so Hotchkiss agreed to manufacture engines and gearboxes, copied from American designs, for Morris Motors Ltd. Delivery of these power units started mid 1919 and they were fitted into \\"Bullnose\\" Morris Cowleys and Morris Oxfords. By 1922, the supply of power units was just sufficient to meet the level of production of Morris cars, so W.R. Morris (later Lord Nuffield), the founder and owner of Morris Motors Ltd., asked Hotchkiss to raise production. However, Hotchkiss refused saying that they were unwilling to make more than 300 power units per week, because an expansion in England would have needed capital that they preferred to use in France. After some negotiations, Morris himself bought the Hotchkiss plant and premises for ¬£349,423 (about ¬£15 million at 2009 values) in January 1923 and the business was renamed Morris Engines Ltd. Morris immediately set about a reorganisation and to carry out this task, he appointed F.G. Woollard, who had been known to Morris since 1910, as General Manager. Woollard had risen to the position of Assistant Managing Director of E G Wrigley & Co. Ltd., another Morris supplier, which Morris bought from the Receiver in January 1924 and the business was renamed Morris Commercial Cars Ltd.. Woollard was already a successful pioneer in the techniques of mass and flow production and the results he achieved at the Gosford Street factory were largely due to his expertise in managing men and machines. Expansion Morris invested another ¬£300,000 in extending the Gosford Street factory and in buying new machines. Having re-organised engine production from batch to flow, Woollard introduced a 24-hour working day, by introducing a 3 shift system of 8 hours each, for a 5-day week. Production increased from less than 300 power units per week in January 1923, to 600 units per week in December of that year and to a remarkable 1200 units per week in December 1924. The engine manufacturing process started when cylinder blocks arrived from one of the supplying foundries, one of which was Morris's own. After being inspected, pickled, washed and dried, the blocks were placed on a hand-transfer machining line that carried out 53 operations in turn. The process took 223 minutes and a completed block was being produced every 4 minutes. The cylinder block hand transfer line which carried out 53 machining operations in turn. Source: P.J. Seymour, 2008 The idea of the first hand-transfer machining line, which was operated by 21 men, evolved in 1923. Then, in 1924, the first automated transfer machine was introduced for the production of gearbox cases, which were moved from station to station by compressed air. A second automated transfer machine, for the production of flywheels, was also set up in 1924. These machines were something Morris Engines Ltd. were justifiably proud of and they encouraged the public to see the process. American engineers judged the production systems to be 20 years ahead of their time. Although the hand- transfer machining line remained in use for many years, the automated transfer machines were subsequently divided into individual machine units, as the automatic systems proved to be over complicated for technology of the time. However, Woollard had pioneered a process which is now commonplace. In June 1926, W.R. Morris restructured the ownership of some of his holdings. Morris Motors Ltd., together with several other companies owned by W.R. Morris, were acquired by a new public listed company, Morris Motors (1926) Ltd., which issues Preference shares to the public. W.R. Morris became the sole Ordinary shareholder of the new company, over which he therefore retained full control and, as a result of the change in ownership, Morris Engines Ltd. became Morris Motors (1926) Ltd., Engines Branch. The (1926) was dropped from the company's name in 1929. Situated as it was in a congested area of Coventry, the Gosford Street factory site had little space for expansion on horizontal lines, so a six-storey extension was constructed. As further expansion, to meet the rising demand for power units, was foreseen, Morris purchased a site north of Coventry at Courthouse Green in 1927 and a mechanised foundry, together with the machining of cylinder blocks, was set up there. 1930s Engine Production During the mid-1930s, new buildings were erected at Courthouse Green, into which personnel and machinery were transferred from both the Gosford Street factory and from Wolseley Motors Ltd. With the exception of those built by Morris Commercial Cars Ltd. for their heavy trucks, the Courthouse Green factory of Morris Motors Ltd. Engines Branch then specialized in making power units for cars and light commercial vehicles made by the entire Morris group of companies; notably, Morris Motors Limited, The M.G. Car Company Limited, Morris Commercial Cars Limited, and Wolseley Motors Limited. During the late 1930s, the Courthouse Green factory was turning out over 3,000 power units per week and throughout World War II, it was working flat-out making engines for fire pumps, ambulances, military vehicles, lifeboats and tanks, as well as making component parts for aero engines and for Rotol variable pitch air screws. The factory suffered extensive damage during a heavy bombing raid on Coventry in 1940, but production restarted within six weeks of the raid, even though some of its workforce were having to work in the open air as much of the factory's roof had been blown off and had still not been replaced. After the War, Morris Motors Ltd., Engines Branch, reverted to making power units for vehicles made by the Nuffield Organization and its factory became part of British Motor Corporation when Morris Motors Limited merged with The Austin Motor Company Limited in 1952.

Design The Gates of Firestorm Peak incorporates the \\"Player's Option\\" rules into the adventure scenario, especially those from Player's Option: Combat & Tactics and Player's Option: Skills & Powers.Cordell, Bruce. The Gates of Firestorm Peak (TSR, 1996) The Gates of Firestorm Peak was designed to be used with both the standard and Player's Option AD&D; rules, and adds Player's Option Consideration comments at the end of each description or encounter. The Far Realm, a Lovecraftian plane of madness, was created by Bruce Cordell for The Gates of Firestorm Peak. Plot summary In The Gates of Firestorm Peak, deep within a mountain, many years ago, the Elder Elves carved out a portal that enabled them to explore new worlds. Powered by the Dragon's Tear, a comet on a 27-year cycle, the elves managed to connect directly into an alternate reality. The elves are now long gone but the link remains intact and, with the return of the comet, a whole alien world is about to spill out. The Gates of Firestorm Peak begins in the Shirelands at the village of Longbridge, located in the foothills of the mountain range that contains Firestorm Peak. In prehistory, the Elder Elves thrived during a previous Age of the world, and created a magical laboratory under Firestorm Peak where they opened a gate to the Far Realm which opens every 27 years. Over time, the bizarre physical laws and alien madness of the other dimension began to warp the areas underneath the mountain. Three hundred years ago a colony of duergar settled nearby and became guardians of the corrupted area. Decades ago, the evil conjurer Madreus bypassed the duergar and gained mastery of the Far Realm creatures residing in the complex underneath Firestorm Peak. In the last five years, he gained control of the duergar, and his studies and experiments have begun to cause manifestations of warped behavior in nature and society to spread beyond the legendary mountain. If not stopped by the player characters, the gate will eventually provide Madreus with the energies and allies he needs to bring the Far Realm's madness to the rest of the world. Reception Trenton Webb reviewed The Gates of Firestorm Peak for Arcane magazine, rating it a 9 out of 10 overall. He called the adventure's premise \\"strong, if a little Stargatey\\" noting that it \\"would normally be enough to justify an adventure module. And it would be worthy of note for its solid design, varied structure and high-quality supplementary artwork. Yet what really makes Firestorm Peak different is that it's designed to be used with both the standard and Player's Option AD&D; rules.\\" Webb commented more fully on the Player's Option rules: \\"Now while the Player's Option series undoubtedly refined a woefully inadequate combat system and cleaned up spell casting, it did introduce a cartload of new rules too. And although each of these new rules was clearly explained in isolation, seeing them all in practice is an absolute must if you're to grasp the full impact of the system. As the first 'showcase' supplement for the system, Firestorm Peak does an excellent job.\\" He continued: \\"With the simple addition of Player's Option Consideration comments at the end of each description or encounter, referees can see where the standard and Player's Option games differ. More importantly, these footnotes illustrate the extra depth that can be added to play if used well.\\" Webb concluded his review by saying: \\"The Gates of Firestorm Peak is a totally playable, if somewhat long, adventure for all AD&D; hackers. As a showcase for the Player's Option series, though, it works as both an illustrative guide to the new rules and an advert. Because if you haven't toyed with the new rules, you'll be wondering just why its players get some large-scale maps and cardboard cut-out pieces, but old-style AD&Ders; don't.\\" The Gates of Firestorm Peak was ranked the 11th greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game.

Thiruveezhimizhalai is a revenue village in Kudavasal Taluka of Thiruvarur District in Tamil Nadu, India. This temple is the 61st Padal Petra Kovil also known as Paadal Petra Sthalams in the Chola Naadu, South of Kaveri. Tiruveezhimizhalai, Abodes of Shiva  Mythology  Parvati is said to have been reborn as Katyayani and married Shiva here. Vishnu received the cosmic weapon Chakrayudam from Shiva here in lieu of the 1000 flower worship to Shiva. A panel depicting the divine marriage is seen behind the Shivalingam. The Moolvar vimanam is believed to be brought to here by Mahavishnu. History thumb The name Thiruveezhimizhalai is said to have come from two legends that took place here. The place was once a forest full of Sandhanam (Sandalwood), Senbagai, Pala (Jackfruit), Vila which is called Veezhi in Tamil. Also there is a plant by name Veezhi which grows in abundance at this place. Hence it is called Veezhi Kaadu(forest). Secondly there was a hunter by name Mizhalai Kurumbar who lived here. He used to offer Vila fruit to Lord Shiva daily. Seeing his bhakthi, Lord Shiva gave dharsan to him. Sri Veezhinatheswarar Temple, Dinamalar Temples Lord Shiva + Veezhi Plants + Mizhalai Kurumbar = Thiruveezhimizhalai When Sambandar and Thirunavukarasar visit this place, there was a severe drought all around. They prayed to Lord Shiva who gave Padikasu (Gold Coin) one each every day to both of them. Sambandar gets Padikasu at the Pedam in front of Mahamandapam. Navukarasar gets gold coin in the Pedam in Merkku (west) prakaram(closed precincts of a temple). Using these gold coin, they offered food to the needy people. The Math where they did anandanam is located on Vadaku Therodum Veedhi (North car Street).

Coffins of the same type, dating back to the 14th and 15th centuries, were found at the site. According to Dr. Jesus Peralta, found inside were human remains with artificially deformed skulls - a practice in this region limited to Southern Philippines and unpopular in Luzon. Due to the similarities found between the coffins, it is reasonable for archaeologists to assume that the latter came from that same era. Debate, however, arose regarding the origin of the said artifact, but until now, it is considered to belong to Butuan where it was found.

She is also famous in history as one of \\"the three graces\\" of the Gustavian age; three ladies-in-waiting (Augusta von Fersen, Ulla von H√∂pken and Louise Meijerfeldt) immortalized in the poem Gracernas d√∂pelse by Johan Henric Kellgren, and known profiles of the epoch.Carl Forsstrand: De tre gracerna, minnen och anteckningar fr√•n Gustaf III:s Stockholm. Hugo Gebers f√∂rlag (1912) She was a leading socialite and trendsetter in contemporary Sweden, and one of the best known profiles of the Gustavian age.  Biography  Early life Ulla von Fersen was one of six daughters of the royal Crown Forester count Carl Reinhold von Fersen and the lady-in-waiting Charlotta Sparre. She was as such also the niece of Axel von Fersen the Elder, a leading force within the Caps, and the cousin of the famous Count Axel von Fersen the Younger. Her father was described as \\"one of the most elegant and spirited gentlemen of his time\\", and her mother was celebrated for her beauty at the French royal court of Versailles, when she accompanied her aunt and uncle by marriage, Ulla Tessin and the Swedish ambassador to France count Carl Gustaf Tessin, to France. Both her parents spent their life in service at the royal Swedish court, and Ulla von Fersen, as well as her sisters, served as hovfr√∂ken (maid of honour) prior to her marriage. From 1767 to 1770, she served as hovfr√∂ken to the Crown Princess, Sophia Magdalena of Denmark. Love affair with Prince Frederick Ulrika Eleonora von Fersen In 1767, Prince Frederick Adolf of Sweden fell in love with her. In parallel, Prince Charles courted another lady in waiting, Brita Horn, with the same intent. This is mentioned in the memoirs of the courtier Adolf Ludvig Hamilton from 1767, when he mentioned the love of the princes for \\"the maids of honor Brita Horn and Ulrika Fersen. Prince Charles' love for the first, prince Frederick's for the second, were both adjusted to the character of the two ladies. Miss Horn was blond, virtuous, sometimes cold, sometimes tender. She had almost made passion of her influence. Miss Fersen, funny, jolly, happy, capricious, considered the whole affair as a pastime which flattered her confidence and left it at that\\". Erdmann, Nils, Vid hovet och p√• adelsgodsen i 1700-talets Sverige: en tidskr√∂nika, Wahlstr√∂ms, Stockholm, 1926 Hamilton described a scene at Kina slott that summer: \\"In one corner, the queen discussed politics, in another, the king talked about the hay- and oat prices with his equerry, the crown prince about fashion and France with countess Ribbing (born L√∂wen). Prince Frederick bickered with his beauty (Ulla Fersen), prince Charles stood faithfully by his (Brita Horn), but in silence. The crown princess stood changing feet in boredom - the rest of the court yawned or slept.\\" Neither of the affairs were, as far as it is known, sexually consummated, and neither Horn nor von Fersen had any position of being a royal mistress. Both couples exchanged rings as a token of an unofficial engagement with the intent to marry. Prince Frederick Adolf proposed to her in the garden at Drottningholm Palace, and: \\"She laughed and accepted without a moments doubt, amused and flattered. She laughed still when he suggested that they exchanged rings, and was not more serious when he begun to shower her with jewels and gifts\\".Alma S√∂derhjelm (1945). Gustav III:s syskon (The siblings of Gustav III) Stockholm: Albert Bonniers F√∂rlag. 23033 (Swedish) In both cases, the royal family was opposed to the love matches. However, while the family of Brita Horn supported a marriage between prince Charles and Brita Horn, the family of Ulla von Fersen opposed her marriage to prince Frederick. Her family was convinced that a royal marriage would be a mistake and refused to permit it. The desired love matches of the princes came to be used by the political parties during the Riksdag of 1769 following the December Crisis (1768). The Caps (party), supported by the family of Brita Horn, promised prince Charles the support of his love marriage with Brita Horn from the Riksdag against the will of the royal house in exchange for his support. As a counterattack, the Hats (party) made the same offer to prince Frederick. This caused a crisis. However, the family of Ulla von Fersen refused to cooperate with the Hats (party) as they did not wish the marriage to take place, and in 1770, they had Ulla von Fersen married. The family of Ulla forced her to return the ring and presents to the prince and decided that the next proposal to her would be accepted. To avoid a royal match, her family organized a marriage with Baron Nils von H√∂pken (1750‚Äì1780), cavalry captain of the Scanian cavalry, a man described as a great beauty who was almost ruined by gambling and spending. While the marriage was not entirely arranged, her family encouraged Nils von H√∂pken as a suitor because he was beautiful and was expected to be able to make Ulla fall in love with him, which she also did. Ulla and Nils von H√∂pken were married in 1770. Prince Frederick was sent on a journey abroad, and when returned one year later, he fell in love with her cousin, Sophie Piper. One of the Three Graces Ulrika Eleonora von Fersen in the amateur theatre of Gustav III. Initially, the marriage between Ulla von H√∂pken and her spouse was happy and passionate. It was said that they were indifferent to their economic problems as long as they had a bed, and they were likened to Amor and Psyche. They had a daughter, Ulrika Sofia Albertina von H√∂pken (born and died 1772). However, her husband suffered from a problem with drinking and gambling, and in 1773, they separated after he had subjected her to spousal abuse out of jealousy. After this, they lived separate lives: he spent his time drinking and gambling, and she in \\"pleasing others\\". Ulla von H√∂pken returned to the royal court, where she served as statsfru (Lady of the Bedchamber) to Queen Sophia Magdalena from 1775 to 1795. During her stay in Paris, her mother had studied dance under Marie Sall√© and in turn instructed her daughters, who became known for their grace and talent within dance in the amateur theatre in the court of Gustav III.Gunilla Roempke (1994).

Gustav III:s syskon. Stockholm: Albert Bonniers F√∂rlag. Foremost, Ulla von H√∂pken is famous for her love life. She has sometime been identified as a symbol of the frivolous sexual liberty of the 18th-century aristocracy, and it was said in 1782 that \\"the Aphrodite of the epoch rule as sovereign in the figure of Ulla H√∂pken\\". von H√∂pken had two more children after having separated from her spouse, Nils von H√∂pken (1774‚Äì1829) and Augusta Lovisa von H√∂pken (1775‚Äì1801). In 1778, she was noted to have baron Evert Vilhelm Taube af Odenkat as a lover, whom she shared with Ulrika Eleonora √ñrnsk√∂ld. The same year, she was the subject of a scandal when love letters purporting to be from her circulated, in which she apparently invited several men to join her on the same occasion. In 1781, she was the target of another scandal, when the caricature Lisimons was written by the courtiers to describe her relationship with her three lovers; the three actual men in question was thereafter referred to as her \\"lisimons\\". From about 1781 onward, however, Ulla von H√∂pken had a serious and permanent long term relationship with \\"a beautiful page\\", the younger Georg Jonas von Wright, who was her lover for the rest of her life and whom she eventually married.Hedvig Elisabet Charlotta (1902).

Libris p. 454 Elias Martin: Ulla von H√∂pken¬¥s sacrifice to Asclepius Ulla von H√∂pken was a close platonic friend and confidant of king Gustav III, and it was noted that they enjoyed speaking with each other as if they were flirting. Gustav III once said to her: \\"Well Ulla, you and me are surely friends for ever and will never leave each other\\", upon which she answered: \\"Thank you very much, I have had one unhappy marriage already and that is quite enough.\\" In the summer 1780, Ulla von H√∂pken was again the subject of a scandal when her estranged husband left his regiment in Sk√•ne without permission and publicly stated that he wished to join his wife and expected to be housed in her apartment at Gripsholm Castle. After an appeal to the king, her husband was forcibly stopped on his way toward the royal court by an order of the monarch that he was to be returned to his regiment by force and arrested if necessary. Her position as a favorite and personal confidante of the monarch was disturbed by a conflict with the rising favorite Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt in 1782, who slandered her before the King as vengeance after she herself had made a negative judgement about him.Hedvig Elisabet Charlotta (1903). Hedvig Elisabeth Charlottas dagbok. II, 1783‚Äì1788. Stockholm: Norstedt This was repaired, however, and as late as in 1788, she was mentioned as one who had the privilege to speak completely openly to the monarch about anything, including political affairs. Count Claes Julius Ekeblad, who compared her and her life to that of an actress in a comedy play, noted in his correspondence to Brita Horn that Ulla von H√∂pken were \\"likely the cause of many greater events, both in high society as well as in matters of greater importance.\\" Later life Aphrodite Kallipygos or Venus aux belles fesses (1779) by Johan Tobias Sergel, which was ordered by Gustav III and used Ulla von H√∂pken as a model.

After the Riksdag of the Estates of 1789, when Gustav III came in conflict with the nobility, he arrested her uncle Axel von Fersen the Elder as a leader of the aristocratic opposition to the Union and Security Act and the Russo-Swedish War (1788‚Äì90). This caused a break in the relation between Gustav III and Ulla von H√∂pken, who joined the demonstration of Jeanna von Lantingshausen. In 1795, her mother, chief lady in waiting to queen Sophia Magdalena although bedridden, was relieved from her position, and her daughters Ulla and Augusta simultaneously left their positions at court in solidarity, officially to tend to their mother's health. Her mother died later that same year. In 1797, Ulla von H√∂pken married her \\"fateful admirer\\" and long term lover, the five years younger colonel Georg Jonas von Wright (1754‚Äì1800), and reportedly lived happy with him in Uppsala. After having been widowed, she lived with her sisters and \\"was commonly as respected for their charity as well as for their refined manner, which was primarily afforded those, who was formed by the court of Gustav III\\". Ulla von H√∂pken died of cancer. Legacy Alongside Augusta von Fersen and Louise Meijerfeldt, she became known as one of \\"the three graces\\" in the poem Gracernas d√∂pelse (The Baptism of the Graces) by Johan Henric Kellgren, which was written in circa 1779 and published in 1781. Ulla von H√∂pken was the model of the naked Venus sculpture by Johan Tobias Sergel, Venus aux belles fesses (1779). King Gustav III wished to have a statue of Venus Kallipygos opposite his statue of Apollo in his salon, and \\"as a compliment to our ladies in waiting\\", Ulla von H√∂pken was chosen as the model of the statue's face, to \\"celebrate her fifteen years in the service of Venus\\". In the 18th-century, it was quite controversial for a woman of her social status to stand as the model of a nude statue, and count Claes Julius Ekeblad remarked: \\"Sergel has, of modesty or because uncle Axel has asked him to, not given this portrait all the likeness he could have, but nevertheless she is recognizable. I admit that I have never, despite all the disregard here shown toward gossip, imagined anything of the sort, to have a femme de qualit√© exposed to the entire world in this way.\\" The statue was later placed in the National Museum of Fine Arts. An 18-gun frigate of the Swedish Royal Navy, Ulla Fersen was named after her. The frigate participated in the campaign of 1790 and the Battle of Reval. In March 1801 the ship was detained by the British Royal Navy while on passage to the Swedish colony Saint Barthelemy, but was released after negotiations. She was wrecked in 1807. Fiction Ulla von H√∂pken is the subject of the novel Venus i rokoko; en roman om Ulla von Fersen (English: 'Roccoco Venus; a novel of Ulla von Fersen') by Ole S√∂derstr√∂m (1960). The novel gives a relatively correct fictionalized account of her life until she enters into her lifelong love story with Georg Jonas von Wright. It also includes speculation that Gustav III at one point unsuccessfully attempts to have a sexual relationship with Ulla von H√∂pken, but fails, because of his homosexuality. von H√∂pken has also been suggested as a role model for Bellman's character Ulla Winblad in her \\"aristocratic version\\".

Typical liquids for the bottling application are tar, varnish, resin, grease, chocolate or galantine. Drum heaters are available for drums between 20 and 220 litres.  Drum heating ovens  Drum ovens are designed to store and heat typically from four to 24 drums, usually stored in groups of four on pallets, for ease of insertion and removal by fork-lift. Heated by steam or radiant electric elements, with a single zone thermostat, they are commonly used where long-term storage at a fixed temperature is required to reduce liquid viscosity or keep solids above their melt temperature. Mobile single-drum electric ovens are also available.  Glass fibre mats  Industrial heaters of this type have an isolated heating element embedded in a glass fibre mat. Silicone coated drum heaters are suitable for steel drums, whereas polyester coatings at lower temperatures can be used for plastic containers. As these heaters are flexible and wrap around the container they may also be called band heaters. Up to three band heaters can be applied to a standard 200 litre barrel. There is no additional insulation so heat is lost by radiation into the surrounding air and the surface temperatures can be hot enough to burn unprotected hands.  Insulated heating jackets  These electrical drum heaters have an outer layer of insulation to protect the user and to increase energy efficiency as significantly less heat is lost to the atmosphere, and thus their power consumption is considerably less than band heaters. Typically they are designed to cover the entire surface of the drum or container.  Drum base heater  Many viscous liquids and solids stored in steel drums require considerable energy input prior to removing from the container for processing. It is sometimes beneficial to add heat directly to the underside of the drum, using a base heater. These are available in various constructions using, induction heating, steam, or silicone heater mats inside a body with sufficient mechanical strength to support the weight of a full drum.  Induction Drum Heater  Individual steel drums can be heated by mains frequency induction heating. The magnetic field generated by the induction heater produces eddy currents in the drum wall, causing the steel to heat the contents.

It was distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is the third installment of the Predator franchise. The film follows an ensemble cast of characters including Royce (Adrien Brody), a mercenary who appears in an unidentified jungle among other proficient killers. They find that they have been abducted and placed on a planet which acts as a game reserve for two warring tribes of extraterrestrial killers, and actively look for a way to return to Earth. Producer Robert Rodriguez had developed a script for a third installment as early as 1994, although it was not until 2009 that 20th Century Fox greenlit the project. According to Rodriguez, the title Predators is an allusion to the second film in the Alien franchise, Aliens (1986). The title also has a double meaning, referring both to the extraterrestrial Predator creatures and to the group of human characters who are pitted against them. Principal photography for Predators began on September 28, 2009 and concluded after 53 days; filming took place in Hawaii and then in Austin, Texas. Predators was released in the United States on July 9, 2010, grossed over $24 million on its opening weekend, and has since grossed over $52 million in the United States, with an estimated total of $127 million worldwide. A sequel, The Predator, was released in 2018. Plot A man called Royce awakens to find himself parachuting into an unfamiliar jungle. He meets several others who arrived in the same manner: Mexican drug cartel enforcer Cuchillo, Spetsnaz soldier Nikolai, Israel Defense Forces sniper Isabelle, Revolutionary United Front officer Mombasa, San Quentin death row inmate Stans, Yakuza enforcer Hanzo, and general practice doctor Edwin. Each of them are armed and lethal killers with the apparent exception of Edwin, though none know where they are or how they got there. The group follows Royce, who Isabelle suspects is a former black operations soldier turned mercenary. Reaching higher ground, they find themselves staring at an alien sky and realize they are not on Earth. In the jungle they find a plant with a neurotoxic poison that Edwin collects on a scalpel, empty cages, and deadfall traps set by a deceased Green Beret. The party is attacked by a pack of quadruped alien beasts. Royce deduces they are on a planet used as a game preserve, where humans are hunted. Cuchillo is killed, and his body used to lure the survivors into a trap, which they avoid. The group follows the quadrupeds' tracks to a camp and finds a captive Predator. Their hunters, three larger \\"Super Predators\\" known as the Tracker, Berserker and Falconer, attack the group. Mombasa is killed, but the rest of the group escapes. Isabelle recognizes the Predator as matching the description of a similar creature that killed a Special Forces team in 1987 in Guatemala, but was defeated by the sole survivor, Major Dutch Schaefer. The group encounters Ronald Noland, a solitary American soldier, who has survived on the planet for \\"ten seasons\\" by hiding and scavenging from the Predators and their victims. He explains that the Predators hunt in threes and sharpen their killing skills by abducting warriors and dangerous beasts from other worlds and bringing them to the planet. Noland also reveals that there is a blood feud between the larger and smaller Predators. Royce devises a plan to free the smaller Predator being held prisoner, hoping it will take them home using the larger Predators' spaceship. Noland traps the others and attempts to use smoke to suffocate them. Having gone mad, he plans to kill them for their equipment. Royce uses an explosive to attract the Predators to the hideout. Noland is killed by the Tracker Predator which then releases the group. In the ensuing chase, Nikolai uses two claymore mines to kill the Tracker, sacrificing himself. The remaining group are intercepted by the Berserker. Stans distracts it by attacking it with his shiv, buying time for the others to escape, and is killed when Berserker rips out his spine and skull. Hanzo stays behind to duel the Falconer Predator with a katana that he found in Noland's hideout, killing it before dying from his wounds. Royce, Isabelle and Edwin continue to head for the Super Predators' camp hoping to enact Royce's plan, until Edwin is injured by a trap. When Isabelle refuses to abandon him, Royce leaves them both behind. They are caught by the Berserker, who traps them in a pit and continues to the camp. Royce frees the captive Predator in exchange for transport to Earth. The Predator dons his armor and hacks into the computer of the Super Predators' ship using his wrist computer, setting a course for Earth. Royce runs to the ship as the Berserker arrives, and the two Predators fight each other. The Berserker overpowers and decapitates the smaller Predator before using his wrist computer to self destruct the ship, ostensibly killing Royce. Edwin paralyzes Isabelle using the neurotoxic poison and reveals that on Earth he was also a murderer. Royce appears and stabs Edwin with his scalpel, paralyzing him. Royce booby-traps Edwin with grenades, using him as bait to injure the remaining Predator. While Isabelle crawls for her sniper rifle, he fights the Berserker with an axe. Isabelle shoots the Predator and Royce decapitates it. As Royce and Isabelle rest, they observe parachutes opening in the distant sky. Royce, surmising that more Predators will arrive to hunt the new prey, tells Isabelle they must find another way to get off the planet. Cast * Adrien Brody as Royce, a former U.S. Special Operations Forces veteran turned mercenary who reluctantly assumes leadership of the group of humans. Brody claimed he had been \\"blown away\\" by Predator and viewed his role as a challenge, wanting to bring a complexity to the character that would contrast with Schwarzenegger's role in the original film. He did put on of muscle for the role, stating that \\"I want it to be entertaining and part of the ride that people see when they see a movie like that. But that's not really why I'm in it and that's not really what I brought to it. I brought the same kind of discipline that I would to a film like The Pianist.\\" Antal and Rodriguez specifically wanted to avoid casting an actor physically similar to Schwarzenegger, wanting to \\"go in a very different direction\\" and reasoning that real-life soldiers are wiry and tough rather than burly. \\"We thought casting a physically 'Schwarzenegger-esque' character would have done the original film a disservice\\", said Antal, \\"and would have done this film a disservice because we are not trying to remake or copy the original film. I told everybody early on that I can make anybody look tough. What I can't do is teach them how to act\\". Brody has expressed interest in reprising his role in future sequels. * Alice Braga as Isabelle, a sniper from the Israel Defense Forces. She failed to save her spotter during a mission, and feels that she has been brought to the alien planet as punishment and to seek redemption. As the only female character, Isabelle plays the role of peacemaker: \\"My character, funny enough\\", said Braga, \\"is the one that is always trying to grab everyone together and like reuniting everyone and stopping the fights and saying that we have strength in numbers\\". Braga described the character as \\"a tough cookie ‚Ä¶ sweet inside but tough outside\\". She read a sniper manual to prepare for the role, and carried a fourteen-pound sniper rifle during shooting. * Topher Grace as Edwin, a doctor who does not seem to belong amongst the group of hardened killers until he reveals that he is also a psychopathic murderer. Grace was dubious about taking the role when he read the script, \\"because I really liked the first Predator, but all the sequels haven't been as good. Then when I read this, I thought, 'What Aliens was to Alien, this is to Predator. Because Predator never really got its due; it never really got that sequel\\". He compared Antal's approach to that of James Cameron, director of Aliens; remaining faithful to the original work but taking the concepts in slightly different directions. Grace performed some of his own stunts, including jumping off a waterfall. * Walton Goggins as Stans, a death row inmate from San Quentin State Prison who was scheduled to be executed in two days before suddenly finding himself on the alien planet. Responsible for 38 murders and an admitted rapist. * Oleg Taktarov as Nikolai, a Russian commando from the Spetsnaz Alpha Group who was fighting in Chechnya before finding himself on the alien planet. Taktarov, a retired mixed martial artist and former Ultimate Fighting Champion, described his role as combining elements of Schwarzenegger, Jesse Ventura, and Bill Duke's characters from the original Predator film, and praised it as \\"the first time you get a really, really, positive, good Russian character in an American [film]\\". Taktarov used his martial arts training during some of the film's action sequences. While filming a scene he hit his face on a steadicam and was bleeding, but continued filming because the blood added to the effect of the scene. * Louis Ozawa Changchien as Hanzo, a Yakuza Inagawa-kai enforcer who rarely speaks and reveals late in the film that he is missing his leftmost two fingers, having performed yubitsume. \\"I guess he used to be a guy who can murder someone without a qualm,\\" said Changchien of the character, \\"but by the time he arrives [on the alien planet], he'll no longer be that kind of person. Those things aren't explained in the script, but you'll get it when you see the movie.\\" Changchien used his kendo training for a scene in which his character uses a katana in a duel against a Predator. Antal, a kendo fan, insisted that the sword fight look authentic. * Mahershala Ali as Mombasa, a death squad soldier in Sierra Leone. * Danny Trejo as Cuchillo, a ruthless enforcer for the Los Zetas Mexican drug cartel who carries twin submachine guns. * Laurence Fishburne as Ronald Noland, a United States Army Air Cavalry soldier who has survived on the alien planet for multiple hunting cycles. \\"It's a really interesting role,\\" said Fishburne, \\"quite different from Morpheus [from The Matrix]. He's a bit shady, crazy, surviving on his own, kind of a ratty character.\\" The four Predators in the film are portrayed by Derek Mears, Carey Jones, and Brian Steele. The Predators are identified in the film's credits as the \\"Classic Predator\\", \\"Tracker Predator\\", \\"Falconer Predator\\", and \\"Berserker Predator\\". Mears plays the Classic Predator, designed to resemble the creature in the original film. Steele plays the Berserker and Falconer Predators, two of the larger Predators hunting the humans. The Berserker Predator is identified by an alien mandible attached to its helmet and faces off against Royce in the film's climax, while the Falconer Predator controls a flying reconnaissance drone and is killed by Hanzo. Jones plays the Tracker Predator, identified by a pair of tusks attached to its helmet, which controls the quadrupedal hunting animals and is killed by Nikolai. Jones also doubled for Steele in some scenes as the Berserker and Falconer Predators. Production Development The film was produced by Robert Rodriguez and written by Alex Litvak and Michael Finch. In 1994, Rodriguez wrote an early script for a third Predator film for 20th Century Fox while he was working on Desperado at the time. Rodriguez presented the script to the studio, but was denied when they realized that the budget would be too large. Fifteen years later, the studio decided to go with his script. Rodriguez stated: > It's the story from that script I had written way back then. They had hired > me to write a Predator story while I was waiting to do Desperado back in > 1995. It was crazy, this thing I came up with. So then fast-forward to now > and, like, six months ago, they found the script and called me up. 'Hey, we > want to redo this franchise and we found your old script. This is where we > should have gone with the series! We want to move forward.' And that's what > we're doing. In 2009, 20th Century Fox studio executive, Alex Young, called Rodriguez to consider using his treatment to revive the individual Predator franchise. The film was produced at Rodriguez's Troublemaker Studios as opposed to 20th Century Fox so that Rodriguez had more creative control over the film. It was originally thought that Rodriguez would direct, but on July 1, 2009, Nimr√≥d Antal was officially signed on to direct. Rodriguez and Antal originally said they wanted the film to be a sequel only to the original Predator as the film is trying to distance itself from Predator 2 and the first two Alien vs. Predator films. Casting At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International Rodriguez stated that Predators would feature an ensemble cast, and that the most important element of the film would be \\"great characters so that the audience feels they're going on this journey with them\\". He also noted that the title had a double meaning, referring not only to the extraterrestrial hunters but also to the human characters, all of whom are dangerous killers. He and Antal wanted each of the characters to be well-developed enough to be able to stand alone. Rodriguez hoped to have Arnold Schwarzenegger play a cameo role as Dutch, his character from the original Predator film, but this ultimately did not happen. Filming The film was shot on a 53-day schedule. Exterior filming location was mostly set in Kolekole, Hawaii. Filming started on September 28, 2009. The film wrapped up its 22-day shoot on the Hawaii location on November 1, 2009. The film shot its interior set scenes at Robert Rodriguez's studio in Austin, Texas. Sixty percent of the film was shot in Texas in order to be eligible for a tax benefit. The film shot more exterior footage at Canyon Lake Gorge in Comal County and Hamilton Pool Preserve. Special effects Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis, head of special effects studio Amalgamated Dynamics, Inc. (ADI), who previously worked on 2004's Alien vs. Predator and 2007's Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, did not return for the creature design of Predators, nor did Stan Winston Studios. Instead, KNB EFX's Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero took over building the creature suits. Berger, who worked with Winston on the original Predator, stated that the studio is reprising the original Stan Winston design of the Predator in the film, saying \\"We wanted to have the Predator look as it did in the original film. We went back and looked at the original ‚Ä¶ everyone's going to be very happy that we've been very faithful to the Stan Winston designs.\\" In addition to the original Predator designs, the film features many new creatures never before seen in a Predator film, such as a new breed of Predators that belong to a different tribe, alien creatures that have been domesticated by the Predators for use in hunting, and other alien creatures that have been brought to the planet by the Predators to be used as prey. Music There had been speculation that original Predator composer Alan Silvestri would return to do the score, but on February 26, 2010, it was announced that John Debney, who worked with Rodriguez on such films as Spy Kids and Sin City, would compose the original score for the film. Rodriguez shared his thoughts on how the score should play out saying: Debney recorded many custom sounds and instruments, including Tibetan long horns to create squeals and screams. He also manipulated metal scrapes and ethnic percussion to further highlight the advanced yet brutal and primitive quality of the Predators and their world. Debney also put up a sneak-peek of one of the Predators scoring sessions. La-La Land Records released the original score for the film on July 5, 2010. The song \\"Long Tall Sally\\" by Little Richard plays during the credits; it was also used in the original Predator film. Release It was announced on March 3, 2010, that Robert Rodriguez and Nimr√≥d Antal would reveal a \\"first look\\" at Predators at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas on March 12, at 10:15pm.

A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, \\"Antal is a good enough action director that some of the combat is pretty exciting.\\"At the Movies , video review of Predators by A. O. Scott. On the other hand, Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune wrote, \\"When the story relocates to the Fishburne character's grimy, claustrophobic domicile, the movie turns static. The filmmakers may have been going for an Alien industrial-grunge vibe, but the tension just isn't sufficient.\\"Chicago Tribune, Michael Phillips' review of Predators. The primary complaint leveled against the film is the failure, as film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times described, of the cast to capture the \\"quiet suspense\\" of the original Predator film. Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly complained that the film's characters were more like \\"cardboard clich√©s lining up for the body count\\" than real action heroes. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film a positive review by stating that, \\"After 23 years and three attempts, Predators finally delivers a solid sequel to the Arnold Schwarzenegger B-movie classic.\\" He added that, \\"It's not exactly hard to predict who the survivors will be at the end of Predators, but it's a fun ride.\\" Accolades Other media Sequel Nimr√≥d Antal had talked about a direct sequel to Predators and said he would love to do one. Rodriguez has said that he has interest in a sequel because of the large number of potential ideas the Predator planet setting provides: In 2010, Rodriguez confirmed that there would eventually be a Predators sequel: Adrien Brody also spoke about reprising his role in a possible sequel: In June 2014, Fox announced plans for a new movie, with Shane Black co-writing and directing, Fred Dekker co-writing and John Davis producing (without the involvement of Rodriguez). At the time, Black said the film is a sequel, rather than a reboot. In August 2015, Davis said the film would \\"reinvent the franchise.\\" In November 2016, it was explained that since the plot takes place on Earth, the story will be more closely linked to the first two films.(November 3, 2016), \\"Here's everything we know about 'The Predator'\\", Yahoo Movies UK. Accessed November 3, 2016 In January 2017, it was announced that while the film would acknowledge the events of Predator and Predator 2, it was unknown if it would acknowledge the events of Predators. Comic books A four issue tie-in Predators comic book by Dark Horse Comics was released weekly from June 9 to June 30 to promote the release of the film. The comic series, consisting of two storylines titled \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" and \\"A Predatory Life\\", serves as a prequel to the events depicted in the film.

The parish includes the hamlet of Little Clanfield west of the village, on Little Clanfield Brook which forms the parish's western boundary. The parish's eastern boundary is Black Bourton Brook and its southern boundary is Radcot Cut, an artificial watercourse on the River Thames floodplain. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 879. Preceptory Robert D'Oyly gave land at Clanfield to the Order of Knights Hospitaller, who built a moated preceptory on the site. This gift must have predated D'Oyly's fall from power in 1142 during the Anarchy. By 1279 the preceptory owned land and property not only at Clanfield but also at Brize Norton, Grafton, Westwell, Oxford and Woodstock. The preceptory buildings have gone and their moated site is now occupied by Friars Court, a gabled house built in about 1650. Friars Court is a private house but it is now hired out as an approved venue for weddings and civil partnerships.Silver Pear Weddings Parish church Medieval statue of St Stephen on the church tower In the Church of England parish church of Saint Stephen the tympanum over the south door is Norman and both the arcade between the nave and the north aisle and the responds of the chancel arch are in the Transitional style between Norman and the Early English Gothic. These features date the church building to about AD 1200. St Stephen's has four lancet windows dating from late in the 12th century or early in the 13th century: two in the south wall of the chancel and two in the north wall of a chapel on the north side of the chancel. In the chancel the east window and the easternmost window in the south wall are Decorated Gothic, which dates them to between 1250 and 1350. The style of the bell tower suggests it was built either about 1300 or early in the 14th century. In the 15th century a large statue of St Stephen was added to the outside of the tower, a squint was inserted in the south side of the chancel and the present font was made. The nave was rebuilt in 1869 and the chancel enlarged and partly rebuilt in 1870. The tower has a ring of eight bells. James Keene, who had established a bell-foundry at Woodstock, cast the fourth, fifth and seventh bells in 1653. Michael Darbie, who was an itinerant bell-founder in southeast England, cast the tenor bell in 1667. Richard Keene of Woodstock cast the sixth bell in 1696. John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast the treble, second and third bells in 1905 to complete the current ring. St Stephen's parish is part of the Benefice of Bampton with Clanfield, which includes also the parishes of Aston, Lew and Shifford. Economic history Little Clanfield Mill The parish had two water mills at Little Clanfield on Little Clanfield Brook. One of them, Little Clanfield Mill, is now a private house but its machinery remains operational. The road between Witney and Clanfield was a turnpike from 1771 until 1874. Amenities The Plough Hotel is a three-bay house built of Cotswold stone in about 1660 that is now a public house. From late in the 19th century until the 1950s it was controlled by Garnes Brewery of Burford. In the 1950s Wadworth Brewery of Devizes bought Garnes and thus the Plough. The Masons Arms public house is also a 17th-century Cotswold stone building, recently renamed the Clanfield Tavern. Clanfield Church of England Primary School was founded in 1873 and enlarged in 1991. The village has a post office and general store.

House bill H.R. 3675 was introduced by Congressman Artur Davis (D-AL) and cosponsored by Representatives Mary Jo Kilroy (D-OH), Steve Israel (D-NY), Joe Courtney (D-CT) and Adam Schiff (D-CA). The Quality Cancer Care Demonstration (QCCD) project was developed by community oncologists, with input from policy experts, to be a national Medicare demonstration project focused on ensuring the delivery of quality, cost-efficient medical care to patients with cancer, by reinforcing and expanding the use of evidence-based guidelines and the provision of demonstrated quality delivery of care through adjustments in the payment system. According to the Institute of Medicine, the quality of cancer care must be measured by using a core set of quality measures. Cancer care quality measures should be used to hold providers, including health care systems, health plans, and physicians, accountable for demonstrating that they provide and improve quality of care. H.R. 3675 calls for national reporting, via the Medicare payment system, of key metrics of evidence based care, refinement of those metrics, and development of a new Medicare performance- based reimbursement system that is patient-centric and quality driven, while aligning better with parameters of cost control. Elements The bill includes the following elements: *Establishment by the Secretary of Health and Human Services of a quality cancer care demonstration project for the purpose of establishing quality metrics and aligning Medicare payment incentives in the areas of treatment planning and follow-up cancer care planning for Medicare beneficiaries with cancer. *Conducting of the demonstration project over a sufficient period (of not less than 2 years) to allow for refinement of metrics and reporting methodologies and for analyses. *Evaluation of the QCCD project to determine oncologist participation in the project, to assess the cost effectiveness of the project, including an analysis of cost savings. *Comparison outcomes of patients participating in the project to outcomes for those not participating. *Report to the United States Congress not later than 90 days after the completion of the second year following the commencement of the QCCD project, with recommendations for legislation or administrative action. Treatment planning *Identification and addressing of gaps in current quality measures related to the areas of active treatment planning and follow-up cancer care planning. *Testing and validation of identified treatment planning and follow-up cancer care planning quality measures through a pay-for-reporting program with oncologists. *Use of treatment planning quality measures, including documented pathology reports, documented clinical staging prior to initiation of first course of treatment, treatment education by oncology nursing staff and providing the patient with a written care plan which advises the patient of relevant options. *Implementation of practice- endorsed treatment plans consistent with nationally recognized evidence-based guidelines. *Documented discussion of clinical trials with the patient, or that no clinical trial is available. *Documented discussion or coordination with other physicians involved in the patient's care. Post-treatment care Documented conclusion of primary cancer care treatment and counseling session with the patient to provide recommendations for subsequent care.

The movement was a response to the political and socioeconomic gains made by African-Americans following the Civil War and the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which eliminated slavery. During Reconstruction, black leaders in Texas and around the country gained increasing influence in the Republican Party by organizing blacks as an important voting bloc via Union Leagues and the biracial Black-and-tan faction of the Republicans. Conservative whites attempted to eliminate this influence and recover white voters who had defected to the Democratic Party. The term lily-white movement was coined by Texas Republican leader Norris Wright Cuney, who used the term in an 1888 Republican convention to describe efforts by white conservatives to oust blacks from positions of Texas party leadership and incite riots to divide the party. In North Carolina, Senator Jeter Pritchard, led the movement to remove all blacks from the 1902 Republican Convention. This was in addition to Pritchard's support of removing black office holders throughout the country. The term came to be used nationally to describe this ongoing movement as it further developed in the early 20th century. Background Immediately following the war all of the Southern states enacted \\"Black Codes,\\" laws intended specifically to curtail the rights of the newly freed slaves. Many Northern states enacted their own \\"Black Codes\\" restricting or barring black immigration. The Civil Rights Act of 1866, however, nullified most of these laws and the federal Freedman's Bureau was able to regulate many of the affairs of Southern blacks, who were granted the right to vote in 1867. Groups such as the Union League and the Radical Republicans sought total equality and complete integration of blacks into American society. The Republican Party itself held significant power in the South during Reconstruction because of the federal government's role.Brady (2008), pg. 154 During Reconstruction, Union Leagues were formed across the South after 1867 as all-black working auxiliaries of the Republican Party. They were secret organizations that mobilized freedmen to register to vote and to vote Republican. They discussed political issues, promoted civic projects, and mobilized workers opposed to certain employers. Most branches were segregated, but a few were integrated. The leaders of the all-black units were mostly urban blacks from the North who had never been enslaved. Historian Eric Foner reports: During the 19th century, a small number of African Americans were elected to the United States Congress; all were members of the Republican Party. In the South, the party was a voting coalition of Freedmen (freed slaves), Carpetbaggers (derogatory term used by southern whites for recent arrivals from the north), and Scalawags (derogatory term describing those southern whites who had been loyal to the US during the Civil War). In Texas, Blacks comprised 90% of the party members during the 1880s. In the South, the Republican Party gradually came to be known as \\"the party of the Negro.\\" In Texas, for example, blacks made up 90% of the party during the 1880s. The Democratic Party increasingly came to be seen by many in the white community as the party of respectability. The first Ku Klux Klan targeted violence against black Republican leaders and seriously undercut the Union League.Steven Hahn, A nation under our feet: Black political struggles in the rural South, from slavery to the great migration (2003). pp 165-205 Republican factionalism Norris Wright Cuney, the first African-American chairman of the Texas Republican Party Blacks increasingly demanded more and more offices at the expense of the Scalawags. The more numerous black-and-tan element typically won the factional battles; many Scalawags joined the opposing lily-whites or switched to the Democrats.Sarah Woolfolk Wiggins, The Scalawag in Alabama Politics, 1865-1881 (University of Alabama Press, 1977).Frank J. Wetta, The Louisiana Scalawags: Politics, Race, and Terrorism during the Civil War and Reconstruction (2012) Following the death of Texas Republican leader Edmund J. Davis in 1883, black civil rights leader Norris Wright Cuney rose to the Republican chairmanship in Texas, becoming a national committeeman in 1889. While blacks were a minority overall in Texas, Cuney's rise to this position caused a backlash among white conservative Republicans in other areas, leading to the Lily-whites becoming a more organized, nationwide effort. Cuney himself coined the term \\"Lily-white movement\\" to describe rapidly intensifying organized efforts by white conservatives to oust blacks from positions of party leadership and incite riots to divide the party. Some authors contend that the effort was coordinated with Democrats as part of a larger movement toward disenfranchisement of blacks in the South by increasing restrictions in voter registration rules. Downfall of black Republicans By 1890, with a few brief exceptions, the Democratic Party had gained control of all state legislatures in the South. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states accomplished disenfranchisement of blacks and‚Äîin some states‚Äîmany poor whites.Michael Perman, Struggle for Mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888-1908 (2001) During the first three decades of the 20th century, no blacks served in the U.S. Congress due to their disenfranchisement across the South. Black leaders were barred in 1922 from the Virginia Republican Congressional Convention; the state had imposed racial segregation in public places and disenfranchised most blacks by this time. At the national level, the Republican Party made some attempts to respond to black interests.Lewis L. Gould, The Republicans: A History of the Grand Old Party (2014)Vincent P. De Santis, Republicans face the southern question: The new departure years, 1877-1897 (1959). In 1920, Republicans made opposition to lynching part of their platform at the Republican National Convention. Lynchings, primarily of black men in the South, had increased in the decades around the turn of the 20th century. Leonidas C. Dyer, a white Republican Representative from St. Louis, Missouri, worked with the NAACP to introduce an anti-lynching bill into the House, where he gained strong passage in 1922.George C. Rable, \\"The South and the Politics of Antilynching Legislation, 1920-1940.\\" Journal of Southern History 51.2 (1985): 201-220. in JSTOR One of the Black-and-tan partisans who continued to hold appointed office was Walter L. Cohen of New Orleans, the customs inspector and later comptroller of customs. He gained appointments from four Republican presidents and continued in office through the Calvin Coolidge administration. During the NAACP national convention in 1926, the delegates expressed their disappointment with the party: Aftermath Lily-white/black-and-tan factionalism flared up in 1928, when Herbert Hoover tried to appeal to southern whites; and again in 1932 as the New Deal coalition built by Franklin D. Roosevelt began to attract African-American voters to the Democratic Party. Due to Democratic support of the civil rights movement and Congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the shift of African Americans toward Democratic candidates accelerated. According to author and professor Michael K. Fauntroy, the Lily-White Movement is one of the darkest and most \\"under- examined [eras] of American Republicanism\\".

Prescribed and natural fires play a major role in maintaining and restoring the sea of grass that once filled the Altar Valley. Riparian (wetland) areas along Arivaca Cienega and Arivaca Creek attract an abundance of birds. Brown Canyon, to the west of the Arivaca Creek area, is nestled in the Baboquivari Mountains, where a sycamore-lined stream meanders through oak woodland. Fauna The Refuge is home to 58 mammal species. Among the larger species are mule deer, white- tailed deer, pronghorn, javelina and puma. There are also more than 325 different bird species and 53 species of reptiles and amphibians. There is also a small jaguar population in the area, which is contiguous, with Mexico. Between 2004 and 2007 an old male jaguar was followed by researchers in the area. The animal was called 'Macho B' by the researchers and has been previously photographed in 1996 in the area. During the study its home range compassed the mountains to east and west of the Altar Valley, which is situated in the Refuge. In addition at least one other jaguar was recorded in the area during that study.Emil B. Mccain and Jack L.

Most of the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge is open for visiting and research. Guided access is also available through Friends of Buenos Aires NWR programs. Some of the refuge (about 3% of its area) was closed in 2006 to public access due to human safety concerns. At that time there was a marked increase in violence along the border due to human and drug trafficking. The closed area extends north from the international border roughly away. As of 2010, this portion remains closed; however, the Fish and Wildlife Service reports a marked decline in violence.Media Advisory: Border Refuge Not Closed, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (2010).

Along with these main waterbodies, several important backwaters are home to many wildlife species that reside in this Yuma Desert portion of the Sonoran Desert. Because of the river's life- sustaining water, wildlife here survive in an environment that reaches in the summer and receives an average of only of rain per year. Ecological importance The Refuge is one of the last major stop overs of the Pacific Flyway for migratory birds. Over 250 species of birds have been identified at Cibola NWR, including Canada geese, golden eagles, great blue herons, sandhill cranes, snowy egrets, and the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher. Other species that inhabit the area include mule deer, Gambel's quail, bobcat, and coyote. Conservation Cibola NWR undertakes major projects annually including the conservation of a desert pupfish population, one of three that exist in Arizona. Invasive species removal enhances the natural riparian habitat and provides hunting opportunities. In return, populations are regulated, and the sustainability of the ecosystem is maintained.

Zald√≠var spent nearly four decades at the helm of Repertorio Espa√±ol, which he established in 1968 together with Artistic Director Ren√© Buch.Rohter, Larry. \\"Gilberto Zald√≠var, a Theater Founder, Dies at 75\\", The New York Times, October 8, 2009. Accessed October 9, 2009. Biography Zald√≠var was born in 1934 in the town of Deleyte in Cuba's eastern Holgu√≠n Province and attended the University of Havana. In Cuba, he established the Teatro Arlequ√≠n, which focused on contemporary works. Zald√≠var was hired by the local affiliate of B.F. Goodrich, a position that lasted until 1961 when his personal disagreements with the direction of the government of Fidel Castro led him to emigrate to the United States, where he found an accounting job with Diners Club in New York City and worked his way up to become an executive there. Building on his experience in Cuba, Zald√≠var decided to focus his full-time efforts on theater, initially working with mainstream groups like the Greenwich Mews Theater, led by producer Stella Holt, which sought to include works from minority playwrights. He decided to go off on his own and created Repertorio Espa√±ol in 1968 together with Ren√© Buch, a Cuban emigre who was an art critic who had attended Yale Drama School. With the rise of the Hispanic population in New York City, Zald√≠var recognized an opportunity to involve the \\"hundreds of Spanish actors in New York working in restaurants and offices who are highly desirous of working again in the theater\\" with the hope of providing acting positions for the many \\"Spanish, Cuban and Puerto Rican actors who come here to find opportunities to perform\\". By 1972, Zald√≠var had raised the funds needed to be based at the 140-seat Gramercy Arts Theater in Manhattan on East 27th Street. By the time of his death, Repertorio Espa√±ol had produced plays ranging from Spanish works of the 17th century such as those by Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca and new works from Hispanic playwrights, totaling more than 250 plays in 40 years with appearances from such actors as Ra√∫l Juli√°. The company produced Spanish-language works by Federico Garc√≠a Lorca and Miguel de Unamuno. Translations of English-language plays such as The Fantasticks and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, as well as novel adaptions of works from Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez and Mario Vargas Llosa were put on stage. Repertorio Espa√±ol has run an annual playwriting competition for Spanish-language dramatists since the 1990s. The production of The Fantasticks toured Central and South America under the sponsorship of the United States Information Agency. In 1988, the company toured his native Cuba. Zald√≠var's work has won Drama Desk Awards, Obie Awards and received the New York State Governor's Award. The University of Miami's Cuban/Latino Theater Archive called Repertorio Espa√±ol \\"a national treasure, providing a rich cultural environment which is unmatched by any other Spanish-language theater company\\". Personal Zald√≠var stepped down from his leadership role at the Repertorio Espa√±ol in 2005 due to his progressing illness. A resident of Manhattan, Zald√≠var died at his home there in the Gramercy neighborhood at age 75 on October 6, 2009, due to complications of dementia with Lewy bodies.Paredes, Julio. \\"Muere fundador de Repertorio Espa√±ol\\", El Diario La Prensa, October 8, 2009.

The type sites are named for the villages of Mal'ta (), Usolsky District and Buret' (), Bokhansky District (both in Irkutsk Oblast). A boy whose remains were found near Mal'ta is usually known by the abbreviation MA-1 (or MA1). Discovered in the 1920s, the remains have been dated to 24,000 BP. According to research published since 2013, MA-1 belonged to a population related to the genetic ancestors of Siberians, American Indians, and Bronze Age Yamnaya and Botai people of the Eurasian steppe. In particular, modern-day Native Americans, Kets, Mansi, and Selkup have been found to harbour a lot of ancestry related to MA-1. Much of what is known about Mal'ta comes from the Russian archaeologist Mikhail Gerasimov. Better known later for his contribution to the branch of anthropology known as forensic facial reconstruction, Gerasimov made revolutionary discoveries when he excavated Mal'ta in 1927. Until his findings, the Upper Paleolithic societies of Northern Asia were virtually unknown. Over the remainder of his career, Gerasimov twice more visited Mal'ta to excavate and research the site. Material culture Habitation and tools Mal'ta consists of semi-subterranean houses that were built using large animal bones to assemble the walls, and reindeer antlers covered with animal skins to construct a roof that would protect the inhabitants from the harsh elements of the Siberian weather. Evidence seems to indicate that Mal'ta is the most ancient known site in eastern Siberia; however, relative dating illustrates some irregularities. The use of flint flaking and the absence of pressure flaking used in the manufacture of tools, as well as the continued use of earlier forms of tools, seem to confirm the fact that the site belongs to the early Upper Paleolithic. Yet it lacks typical skreblos (large side scrapers) that are common in other Siberian Paleolithic sites. Additionally, other common characteristics such as pebble cores, wedge-shaped cores, burins, and composite tools have never been found. The lack of these features, combined with an art style found in only one other nearby site, make Mal'ta culture unique in Siberia. Art There were two main types of art during the Upper Paleolithic: mural art, which was concentrated in Western Europe, and portable art. Portable art, typically some type of carving in ivory tusk or antler, spans the distance across Western Europe into Northern and Central Asia. Artistic remains of expertly carved bone, ivory, and antler objects depicting birds and human females are the most commonly found; these objects are, collectively, the primary source of Mal'ta's acclaim. In addition to the female statuettes there are bird sculptures depicting swans, geese, and ducks. Through ethnographic analogy comparing the ivory objects and burials at Mal'ta with objects used by 19th and 20th-century Siberian shamans, it has been suggested that they are evidence of a fully developed shamanism. Also, there are engraved representations on slabs of mammoth tusk. One is the figure of a mammoth, easily recognizable by the trunk, tusks, and thick legs. Wool also seems to be etched, by the placement of straight lines along the body. Another drawing depicts three snakes with their heads puffed up and turned to the side. It is believed that they were similar to cobras. Venus figurines Perhaps the best example of Paleolithic portable art is something referred to as \\"Venus figurines\\". Until they were discovered in Mal'ta, \\"Venus figurines\\" were previously found only in Europe. Carved from the ivory tusk of a mammoth, these images were typically highly stylized, and often involved embellished and disproportionate characteristics (typically the breasts or buttocks). It is widely believed that these emphasized features were meant to be symbols of fertility. Around thirty female statuettes of varying shapes have been found in Mal'ta. The wide variety of forms, combined with the realism of the sculptures and the lack of repetitiveness in detail, are definite signs of developed, albeit early, art. At first glance, what is obvious is that the Mal'ta Venus figurines are of two types: full-figured women with exaggerated forms, and women with a thin, delicate form. Some of the figures are nude, while others have etchings that seem to indicate fur or clothing. Conversely, unlike those found in Europe, some of the Venus figurines from Mal'ta were sculpted with faces. Most of the figurines were tapered at the bottom, and it is believed that this was done to enable them to be stuck into the ground or otherwise placed upright. Placed upright, they could have symbolized the spirits of the dead, akin to \\"spirit dolls\\" used nearly worldwide, including in Siberia, among contemporary people. =Context of the Venus figurines= The Mal'ta figurines garner interest in the western world because they seem to be of the same basic form as European female figurines of roughly the same time period. This similarity between Mal'ta and Upper Paleolithic Europe coincides with other suggested similarities between the two, such as in their tools and dwelling structures. On the other hand, one can argue that, as a group, the Mal'ta Venus figurines are rather different from the female figurines of Western and Central Europe. For example, none of the Siberian specimens depict abdominal enlargement as many European examples do. Also, as breasts are often lacking in the Mal'ta figurines, few offer clear enough evidence of gender to define them as female. More conclusively, nearly half of them show some facial details, something which is lacking in the Venus figurines of Europe. It may not be possible to reach a definitive answer as to the origins of these peoples and their culture. A 2016 genomic study shows that the Mal'ta people have no genetic connections to the Doln√≠ Vƒõstonice people from the Gravettian culture. Symbolism Discussing this easternmost outpost of paleolithic culture, Joseph Campbell finishes by commenting on the symbolic forms of the artifacts found there: Archaeogenetics MA-1 is the only known example of basal Y-DNA R* (R-M207*) ‚Äì that is, the only member of haplogroup R* that did not belong to haplogroups R1, R2 or secondary subclades of these. The mitochondrial DNA of MA-1 belonged to an unresolved subclade of haplogroup U.doi 10.1038/nature12736 Supplementary Information The term Ancient North Eurasian (ANE) has been given in genetic literature to an ancestral component that represents descent from the people similar to the Mal'ta‚ÄìBuret' culture or a population closely related to them. The genetic component ANE descends from Ancient South Eurasian. A people similar to MA1 and Afontova Gora were important genetic contributors to Native Americans, Siberians, Europeans, Caucasians, Central Asians, with smaller contributions to Middle Easterners and some East Asians. Lazaridis et al. (2016) notes \\"a cline of ANE ancestry across the east-west extent of Eurasia.\\" According to a 2016 study, it was found that the global maximum of ANE ancestry occurs in modern-day Kets, Mansi, Native Americans, and Selkups. Additionally it has been reported in ancient Bronze-age-steppe Yamnaya and Afanasevo cultures. Between 14 and 38 percent of Native American ancestry may originate from gene flow from the Mal'ta‚ÄìBuret' people, while the other geneflow in Native Americans appears to have an Eastern Eurasian origin. MA1 is also related to two older Upper Paleolithic Siberian individuals found near the Yana river called Ancient North Siberians (ANS) and to Tianyuan man from Upper Paleolithic China.
