Having suggested by Professor Abdus Salam to the Government of Pakistan, it was established by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission's chairman Mr. Munir Ahmad Khan. An annual college based summer camp, it is organised by Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and National Center For Physics while it is sponsored by International Center for Theoretical Physics and the Minister of Science and Technology of Pakistan. A Physics research centre, it is located in Nathiagali city of Pakistan, and its current director is dr. Riazuddin, a pupil student of professor Salam. Objectives *Breaking the intellectual isolation of the scientist in the developing countries. *Keeping pace with the rapid progress in science and contemporary needs by promoting higher science education. *Placing due emphasis on the interaction of modern trends in physics and their applications in current technological development with special reference to the needs of the countries of the third world. *Promoting a scientific dialogue and provide opportunity and opening avenues for co-operation and joint research programs. *Broaden the outlook of the participants, to re-orient their scientific activities *Indicate the areas where research could be carried out with limited facilities of developing countries. History Professor Abdus Salam had played a major and an integral role in Pakistan's science policy. Professor Salam had supervised more than 21 PhD during his teaching career at the Imperial College, United Kingdom. Half of these students were Pakistanis in which the majority of students had returned to Pakistan to join Abdus Salam. To promote scientific activities in the country, professor Abdus Salam had done the ground breaking work in establishing the research facilities throughout the country. In 1976, Abdus Salam had suggested to Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to established the annual college to promote the scientific activities in the country. Munir Ahmad Khan, then-chairman of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), took the task as he had strongly advocated for the program. In 1976, the first Summer college was established and 14 scientists from all over the world had attended the college for the first time. Professor George Deacon (Chemistry), Professor Roger Penrose (Mathematical Physics), Oliver Penrose (Mathematics), Alice Hanson Cook (Cornell University), Benjamin Whiso Lee (physics), Mujaddid Ahmed Ijaz (physics), Remo Ruffini (Physics) and others had attended the college. Professor Riazuddin, who was at the time Chief Scientist (CS) at the PAEC, was overall in charge of organising the college both administratively and academically. He also was the co-director of the college with alongside of prof. Abdus Salam. After the departure of Professor Salam, Riazuddin has been director of the INSC since then. Research and program emphasis The INSC is located in Nathiagali, Pakistan. The institution is noted for its high-powered research in particle physics, nuclear physics, theoretical physics, astrophysics, nanotechnology, nuclear technology, Semiconductor physics, superconductor, general relativity, polymer physics, experimental physics, molecular physics, atomic physics, laser physics, cosmology and research on nuclear and particle detectors. The institution also host lectures in different fields of science and mathematics The scientific organisations, such as PAEC, KRL, NCP, PCSIR and PEC, had delegated and invited hundreds of scientists from Asia, Africa, Europe, and Americas to participate in the annual event. During the last 32 years of INSC, nearly 950 foreign scientists from as many as 72 countries have participated in the proceedings of the College. INSC has served as a forum for people of different countries whose main problem is scientific isolation. In 2010, approximately 6200 Pakistani scientists, engineers, and mathematicians had attended the college. The vast interaction among Pakistani scientists who have been drawn not only from research institutes but also from universities and colleges. As of today, the college hosts post graduate students are invited to participate in this discourse of a high level. This link with universities and college is important since the ultimate source of technical manpower in any country is none other than the educational institutions.

Chua also served as vice president of Philippine Football Federation (PFF); he previously played high school varsity football for Colegio de San Juan de Letran. Chua died at the height of Tropical Storm Ketsana (local name: Ondoy). Early life and career Chua studied in Colegio de San Juan de Letran up to college, graduating in 1975. He played for the Letran Squires football team and was known as \\"Mr. Football.\\" Chua coached the Philippine women's national football team, and later served as vice president of the PFF. Basketball manager Chua's company Photokina Marketing Corporation fielded the Red Bull to the semiprofessional Philippine Basketball League (PBL), and he was tasked to manage the team. Then PBL commissioner Yeng Guiao allowed the team to compete, and the team won several championships. When the Photokina franchise entered the professional Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) as Batang Red Bull, Chua appointed Guiao as the coach of the team. Guiao led the Red Bull team to three championships: the 2001 and 2002 Commissioner's Cups, and the 2006 Fiesta Conference. After Noli Eala resigned as PBA commissioner, Chua as chairman of the board of governors ran the daily affairs of the league while a replacement was being found. When Sonny Barrios was appointed as interim commissioner, Chua personally welcomed Barrios on his first day on the job. After the 2008‚Äì09 Philippine Cup, Guiao resigned and the team was renamed as the Barako Bull Energy Boosters. Guiao was later signed as head coach of the Burger King Whoppers but the two remained close. Among his projects in the PBA is the PBA Hall of Fame; he was one of the selectors for the third batch which were announced in 2009. Death At the height of Tropical Storm Ketsana (Ondoy), traffic was not moving and he and his driver and Barako Bull liaison officer aides alighted their car. The three trekked the flooded road when a strong current engulfed them, sucking away the driver; Chua can only look at his aide as his body faded out of sight. The two decided to stop and hold on to a tree when a truck carrying lumber passed by, the lumber that jutted out of the truck hit Chua in the face. The details right after he was hit by the lumber weren't clear; he could have died because of hypothermia or from internal hemorrhage, for he was bleeding from the ears. His liaison officer caught up with him and tried to revive him, but he died on the way. The driver's body was fished out of the waters two days after the storm. Reaction Sports officials were saddened by Chua's demise. Guiao was \\"deeply shocked\\" and remarked that Chua was \\"well liked by everyone in the basketball community\\". Guiao's successor as commissioner in the PBL Chino Trinidad said described Chua as \\"a funny guy\\" but \\"passionate in the game\\". PBA commissioner Barrios, who announced Chua's death to the press, was personally affected by Chua's death, saying that we always \\"worked well\\" with him.

Crealock William Ion Belton Crealock (23 August 1920 ‚Äì 26 September 2009) was a yacht designer and author. He was one of the world's leading yacht designers from the 1960s through the 1990s, and his yachts were owned by the famous and wealthy, including Walter Cronkite and William Hurt. Early years Crealock was born in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, England in 1920. He attended the Glasgow University where he studied naval architecture and worked at the Glasgow shipyard during World War II. \\"Vagabonding Under Sail\\" In 1948, Crealock and three friends pooled their money, purchased an old cutter, and set out \\"to study the behavior of boats at sea.\\" Crealock arrived in the United States after \\"an unhurried two-year journey\\" in a small sailboat. Crealock wrote about his adventures sailing with his friends in his first book, \\"Vagabonding Under Sail.\\" Crealock's second book, \\"Towards Tahiti\\" (published elsewhere as \\"Cloud of Islands\\") relates the story of a lengthy cruise from Panama, via the Galapagos, to the South Pacific. On this cruise Crealock sailed on the ketch \\"Arthur Rogers,\\" a Brixham trawler built in 1929, with its owners Tom and Diana Hepworth. The Hepworths later life in the Solomon Islands is documented in the book \\"Faraway\\" by Lucy Irvine. In 1956 and 1957, Crealock was the first mate and navigator on a scientific mission aboard the \\"Gloria Maris,\\" a 110-foot schooner. The mission was commissioned by the National Science Foundation to study the shells of the Pacific Ocean. In February 1957, the schooner was caught in a typhoon in the South China Sea which rolled the ship to 60 degrees to starboard and put the water level halfway up the wooden deck. Crealock recalled being forced to leave the deck at 1 am, telling the skipper, \\"There's no use going topside.\\" The wind tore the main mast from the deck, and Crealock concluded it would be suicide to go on deck; the schooner dragged the mast for 24 hours through the typhoon before it broke loose. Yacht designer In 1959, Crealock began a career as a small boat designer in Southern California. In the 1960s, his fiberglass designs made boats quicker, less expensive to build, and easier to handle.. He designed boats for celebrities, including Walter Cronkite, William Hurt, and Claire Trevor. He also became friends with celebrities, including Rock Hudson, Jane Russell, and Natalie Wood, through their interest in boating. In 1986, The San Diego Union wrote that, in local yachting circles, Crealock's name was almost as well known as that of the America's Cup champion, Dennis Conner.. Crealock said at the time that naval architecture was for people who love boats and boating: \\"We do it for a living, because if we didn't, we'd probably be doing it on the backs of envelopes.\\" He noted that he had started in Glasgow designing parts of large ships and found the design of yachts a more satisfying profession: \\"I soon realized it was not very romantic to spend several weeks designing one bulkhead on a big ship. So I started big and edged my way down to pleasure boats, which was what I really wanted to do, because in small boats you do the whole thing.\\" Crealock described the factors he considers in designing a boat: > \\"Seaworthiness in a cruising boat has to be the No. 1 consideration. It > doesn't matter how cute the boat is if it doesn't get (the cruisers to their > destination) in one piece ... Just about any boat does well in Southern > California. A bathtub would do fairly well. But when things get bad, when > it's blowing hard and rough, that's when the difference between boats shows > up most. But beyond safety, you must give up in some areas to achieve in > others. The boat must be aesthetically pleasing to the owner and not too > slow - nobody likes a slow boat. But you can't take a camper and put it on a > Ferrari and say you have the ideal combination.\\" In 1975, Bill Crealock designed the longest, lightest, trailerable Masthead ketch sailboat ever built, the Clipper Marine 32 Aft Cabin Ketch coastal diesel cruiser racer. About 100 of these sailboats were built in 1975 and 76, and many still sail the waters of the world today. CM32's had an 8-foot beam and 4,500 displament, were supplied with a two or three axle trailer that could be pulled by the family vehicle, put his design in the record books. A heavier displacement blue water CM32 was also built, and was also trailerable, sold in an aft cockpit single mast sloop. A smaller designed CM 30, a 30-foot motorsailor was also offered.. In 1976, he designed the Willard 8-Ton World Cruising Yacht, a blue water yacht for long distance cruising, for the Willard Company. Crealock's other well-known designs included the Westsail 42, the Crealock 34 and 37, the Pacific Seacraft 31 and the Dana 24. In 2002, the Pacific Seacraft 37, designed by Crealock, was inducted into the American Sailboat Hall of Fame. Crealock said the most unusual vessel he was ever commissioned to design was a large bottle. He recalled, \\"A guy sitting inside was to cruise it down the coast off the beaches to advertise a soft drink. It was never built, fortunately.\\" Crealock did not own a boat himself, saying he had no time to sail one. However, he enjoyed participating in sea trials of the boats he designed, joking that he did so \\"just to show I'm not afraid the boat's going to sink.\\" Crealock died at his home in Carlsbad, California, in September 2009. He was survived by his wife, Lynne (Banner) Crealock, a daughter, a stepson and a grandson.

At the age of 11, she was married to Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade, who was a distinguished Indian scholar and social reformer. In that era of social inequality, women were not allowed to go to school and become literate. Ramabai, soon after her marriage, started to learn reading and writing with strong support and encouragement from Mahadev Govind Ranade. Starting with her native language Marathi, she strove hard to master English and Bengali. Inspired by her husband, Ramabai started 'Hindu Ladies Social Club' in Mumbai to develop public speaking among women. Ramabai was also a founder and President of 'Seva Sadan Society' in Mumbai and Pune. Ramabai devoted her life to the betterment of women's lives. Ramabai Ranade with her husband and other colleagues established in 1886 the first girls' high school in Pune, the renowned Huzurpaga.  Introduction  Ramabai Ranade was a pioneer of the modern women's movement in India and outside. She was the founder and president of the \\"Seva Sadan\\", which is the most successful of all Indian women's institution and is attended by thousands of women. The immense popularity of the institution was due to the fact that it was under Ramabai's close personal supervision. Early life and background  Ramabai Ranade was born on 25 January 1862 in Kurlekar family, living in a small village, Devrashtre of Sangli District, Maharashtra. As educating girls was a taboo in those days, her father did not educate her. In 1873, she was married to Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade, a pioneer of India's social reform movement. He devoted his time to educate her in face of opposition of the women in the house and helped her to become an ideal wife and a worthy helpmate in social and educational reform. With his strong support and sharing his visionary path, Ramabai spent all her life making women self-reliant and economically independent. She was barely 11 years old when she was married to Mahadev Govind Ranade, who was a scholar, idealist and a revolutionary social activist. Ramabai was illiterate when she was married as she lived in a time when considered a sin for a girl to read or write. On the contrary, her husband, addressed as the \\"Prince of Graduates\\", was a graduate of Bombay University with first class honours. He not only worked as the Professor of English and Economics at the Elphinstone College in Bombay, but was also as an oriental translator and a social reformer. He worked rigorously against evils that existed in the society. He was against untouchability, child marriage and Sati. He took over the Sarvajanik Sabha and led a number of movements for social development. He had won the praise of the whole of Maharashtra by the time he was in his early thirties. His overarching thinking, dynamic vision, passionate and devoted social commitment strongly inspired Ramabai and illuminated her path for future social work. Ramabai made it a mission to educate herself, so that she could be an equal partner in the active life led by her husband. In her efforts she faced obstruction and hostility from other women in her extended family. Justice Ranade gave regular lessons to young Ramabai in writing and reading Marathi, History, Geography, Mathematics and English. He used to make her read all newspapers and discuss current affairs with him. She became his devoted disciple and slowly became his Secretary and his trusted friend.When Pandita Ramabai came to Pune in 1882 after becoming a widow, the Ranades helped her.Both , Ramabai Ranade and Pandita Ramabai took english language lessons from a christian missionary lady at the Ranade residence.Kosambi, Meera. ‚ÄúIndian Response to Christianity, Church and Colonialism: Case of Pandita Ramabai.‚Äù Economic and Political Weekly, vol. 27, no. 43/44, 1992, pp. WS61‚ÄìWS71. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4399059. Accessed 9 Oct. 2020. Career Ramabai made her first public appearance at Nasik High School as the Chief Guest. Justice Ranade wrote her maiden speech. She soon mastered the art of public speaking, both in English and Marathi. Her speeches were always simple and heart-touching. She began working for Prarthana Samaj in Bombay. She established a branch of Arya Mahila Samaj (Arya women's society) in the city. From 1893 to 1901 Ramabai was at the peak of her popularity in her social activities. She established the Hindu Ladies Social and Literary Club in Bombay and started a number of classes to train women in languages, general knowledge, tailoring and handwork. social activism after the death of Justice Ranade At the age of thirty-eight, upon the death of Justice Ranade in 1901, she left Bombay and came to Pune and stayed at their old ancestral house near Phule Market. For one year, she led an isolated life. Finally, she came out of her self-imposed isolation to organise the first Bharat Mahila Parishad in Bombay. Ramabai lived 23 years after her husband's death ‚Äì a life full of activity for social awakening, redressal of grievances and established social institutions like Seva Sadan for rehabilitation of distressed women. Ramabai made her started public service around 1878, but it was after Justice Ranade's death in 1901 that she wholly identified herself with the cause of women in India. She became a regular visitor to the Central Prison, especially the women's wing, to kindle self-esteem amongst prison inmates. She paid her visit to boys in the reformatory school, spoke to them and distributed sweets to them on festive occasions. She regularly visited patients in local hospitals, distributing fruits, flowers and books. She also went out to Gujarat and Kathiawar in 1913 to organise relief for famine- stricken people. Even in the final years of her life, she went to Alandi at the time of Ashadhi and Kartiki fairs, with volunteers from the Seva Sadan, to render help to women pilgrims visiting the shrine of Sant Dnyaneshwar. In taking up this activity, she laid foundations for a new type of social service for women. At the urging of Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar and Mr. Bhajekar, Ramabai chaired the first session of India Women Conference held in Bombay in 1904. Seva Sadan In 1908 parsee social reformer, B. M. Malbari and Dayaram Gidumal came up with the idea of founding home for women and training Indian women to be Nurses. They then turned to Ramabai, for her guidance and help for starting a Society and thus Seva Sadan (Bombay) came into being. In 1915 the Pune Seva Sadan was registered as a society under her guidance.The Graphic - Saturday 15 November 1919 The society expanded its old educational departments and also started new ones. It developed a Women's Training College, three hostels, one of them for Medical students and other for probationer nurses. In 1924, when Ramabai died, the Pune Seva Sadan was training more than one thousand women in different departments. It was largely owing to Ramabai's initiatives, guidance and exertions that Seva Sadan found a footing and grew so rapidly in spite of prevailing prejudices. The last two outstanding contribution which she made were ‚Äì the organisation of agitation for extending compulsory and pre-primary education to girls; and secondly organisation of Women's Suffrage Movement in Bombay presidency in 1921‚Äì22. The singular position, which she assumed at the end of her life deserved Mahatma Gandhi's tribute to her as quoted: \\"The death of Ramabai Ranade is a great national loss. She was the embodiment of all that a Hindu widow could be. She was a true friend and helpmate of her illustrious husband in his lifetime.\\" \\"After his death she chose her husband's reform activities as her life's aim. Justice Ranade was a reformer and deeply concerned about the uplifting of Indian womanhood. Ramabai put her heart and soul into Seva Sadan. She devoted her whole energy to it. The result is that Seva Sadan has become an institution with no second of its kind throughout India.\\" In early years of Seva sadan,most of the nursing students were widows. Once there was an occasion of the annual social gathering of Seva Sadan. One of the highlights of the function was the prize distribution ceremony. Among the prize winners was a widow. She was dressed in the traditional dress of the widows of those days, a simple dark red sari with the Pallu tightly drawn over her clean- shaven head. As the widow stepped on the stage, the student crowding the galleries started hooting and shouting. This outburst of misbehavior hurt Ramabai's feelings deeply. As she stood upon the stage towards the end of the function to give a brief thanksgiving speech, she was so provoked that she could not help chastising the student crowd with all the severity at her command: \\"You are college students and yet how can you be regarded as educated? How can those be considered as educated who not only do not extend sympathy to their unfortunate sisters who have fallen victims to cruel fate and merciless social customs, but find it fit to heap ridicule on them. Every one of you probably has some unfortunate widow sheltered under your roof, may be your sister, cousin or aunt or even your own mother. If you had kept this in mind you would not have misbehaved the way you did.\\" These were sharp, stinging words striking the students like a whiplash. There was pin drop silence. It was a triumph of Ramabai's powerful and spellbinding personality. She worked relentlessly against the system of child marriage. All these efforts took shape in establishing the Seva Sadan Society in Bombay, which substituted as a home for a number of distressed women. She started Pune Seva Sadan Society in her own ancestral house. This later developed into an institution offering a number of facilities like hostels, training colleges, vocational centres, selling centres, etc. Ramabai's name became synonymous with Seva Sadan. This was her greatest contribution to the welfare of middle class women. Ramabai participated in the War Conference and spoke to the Governor on behalf of Indian women. She also fought for the cause of Indian labour in Fiji and Kenya. She even worked for women's right to franchise. Everyone adored her, but she was modest to call herself a shadow of her husband. In popular culture In her honour, the Indo-Australian Post issued a Postage stamp picturing Ramabai on 14 August 1962, in her birth centenary year for her great contribution towards the Indian society. A television series on Zee Marathi named Unch Maaza Zoka (roughly translated as 'my swing flies high', with an implication of 'Dream big in life and strive for it') based on Ramabai's life and her development as a 'women's rights' activist was telecasted in March 2012. This series was critically acclaimed and celebrated throughout Maharashtra. Legacy * Ramabai's important literary contribution is her autobiography Amachya Ayushyatil Kahi Athavani in Marathi\\"Diamond Maharashtra Sankritikosh\\", Durga Dixit, Pune, India, Diamond Publications, 2009, p. 40. . in which she gives a detailed account of her married life. She also published a collection of Justice Ranade's lectures on Religion.

Cover art by Ed Emshwiller. Valley of the Flame is a fantasy novel by American writer Henry Kuttner, first published in the March 1946 issue of the magazine Startling Stories under the pseudonym \\"Keith Hammond\\".  Plot summary  The year is 1985 and the location is somewhere in the vast, teeming jungles of the Amazon. Medical scientist Brian Raft and his two colleagues Dan Craddock and Bill Merriday are working at a small, newly built health center, researching tropical diseases. They are the only white men in the vicinity and are the last outpost of civilization. Somewhere deeper in the jungle drums have been beating for days and Craddock seems convinced that they are not beating a message, rather that they have some other, more sinister purpose. Craddock, despite his medical training, is a superstitious man \\"with his Welsh ghosts and his shadow-people of the lost centuries\\", so Raft does not take much notice of him. But soon out of the unknown comes a canoe propelled by two men with paddles. They have been working themselves to the point of almost complete exhaustion. One of these newcomers, Thomas Da Fonseca, proves to be a pilot on a mapping expedition whose plane has crashed near the second man's property. This second man, Paulo da Costa Pereira, is of indeterminate origin; he speaks Portuguese, but in a faulty manner, and carries himself in a kind of confident, haughty, evasive way that annoys Raft. Da Fonseca is sick, with a temperature far below normal, and appears to have some tropical disease. Pereira, on the other hand, seems to recover remarkably quickly. Nevertheless, Raft insists, against Pereira's will, on taking a blood sample to be certain of his health. Pereira's blood seems to be strangely mutated. If anything, it works in a superior way to normal blood. Raft overhears Pereira talking to Craddock, then suddenly these two disappear. They are seen by Merriday departing in the Center's motorboat. Craddock seems to be under the hypnotic spell of Pereira. The next morning Raft, with five natives, sets out up the river in pursuit. Raft's journey will ultimately take him to the Valley of the Flame.

After receiving a BA from Tulane University in 1966 and an MA from the University of California, Berkeley in 1968,John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, Reports of the president and of the treasurer (2000), p. 56. he arrived in the former Soviet Union for the first time in 1970 as a graduate student starting work in architectural photography, although he did not seriously study the craft of photography until 1974. Brumfield earned a Ph.D in Slavic studies at the University of California, Berkeley in 1973 and held a position of assistant professor at Harvard University in 1974‚Äì1980. In 1983 Brumfield, formerly a generalist of Slavic studies, established himself in the history of architecture with his first book, Gold in azure: one thousand years of Russian architecture. It was followed by The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture (1991), Russian housing in the modern age: design and social history (1993), A History of Russian Architecture (1993, Notable Book of that year and a best seller according to The New York Times), Lost Russia: Photographing the Ruins of Russian Architecture (1995), Landmarks of Russian Architecture: A Photographic Survey (1997) and Commerce in Russian urban culture: 1861-1914 (English edition 2001, Russian edition 2000).

The manga is licensed in North America by Digital Manga Publishing under its Jun√© imprint, which released the first volume on 28 August 2008. It's about four brothers living together, when one of the brother's old high school flame turns up and claims that he's married to the brothers' wild older sister, who is nowhere to be found, bringing his adopted son. Reception Danielle Van Gorder described the premise as \\"an even more unlikely version of the Brady Bunch\\", and praised Ninomiya's work on the eyes of the characters. Holly Ellingwood praised the series' humour and character interactions, saying it's \\"a gentle and lovely story about what makes a family\\". Leroy Douresseaux describes the feel of the tale as being 'quiet, intimate', but sometimes 'a little too dry'.

Anderson was already playing for London Welsh when he was awarded his first international cap, in Scotland's closing encounter of the 1889 Home Nations Championship, away to Ireland. Anderson was partnered at half back with Charles Orr, with whom He would play all eight of his international appearances. Scotland won the match against the Irish, by a single drop goal, and Anderson and Orr became a regular partnership from that point. Both men lined up for all three games of the 1890 Championship, which saw Scotland lose the title in their final match of the series to England. During the 1890 tournament, Anderson scored his only international points, with a try in the win over Wales. The next season, Anderson was approached by William Percy Carpmael to join his newly formed invitational touring team, the Barbarians. Anderson accepted, becoming one of the team's founding members. The 1891 Home Nations Championship saw Scotland win all three games of the competition to take the Triple Crown. Anderson played in two of the matches, the country's opening victory over Wales, and the final match away to England. For the Ireland encounter, Anderson was replaced by William Wotherspoon; but on his return for the England game, along with Gregor MacGregor, Anderson was seen as the outstanding player of the match. Anderson played in one final Championship in 1892, with a win over Wales, but his final international was a home loss to England.

Its bark is used as a spice similar to cinnamon, giving rise to the common names \\"cinnamon bark\\", \\"wild cinnamon\\", and \\"white cinnamon\\". The wood of Canella is very heavy and exceedingly hard, strong, and close-grained, with numerous thin, inconspicuous medullary rays; it is dark red-brown, and the thick sapwood consists of 25 to 30 layers of annual growth, light brown or yellow in color. The specific gravity of the absolutely dry wood grown in Florida is 0.9893; a cubic foot of the dry wood weighs 61.65 pounds. Canella attains in Florida a height of 25 to 30 feet, with a straight trunk eight to 10 inches in diameter. On the mountains of Jamaica, it is said to grow sometimes to the height of 50 feet. The principal branches are slender, horizontal, and spreading, forming a compact round-headed top. The light gray bark of the trunk is an eighth of an inch thick, the surface is broken into many short thick scales rarely more than 2-3 in long, and about twice the thickness of the pale yellow, aromatic inner bark. The leaves are obovate, round or slightly emarginate at the apex, and contracted into a short, stout, grooved petiole; they are 3.5-5.0 in long, 1.5-2.0 in broad, bright deep green, and lustrous. The flowers open in the autumn, and the fruit ripens in March and April, when it is bright crimson, soft, and fleshy, and is eaten by many birds.  Name  Canella, the diminutive of the Latin canna, a cane or reed, was first applied to the bark of the Old World tree cassia, Cinnamomum aromaticum, from the form of a roll or quill which it assumed in drying, and was later transferred to the West Indian tree. This article incorporates text from Sargent, which is in the public domain. The genus Canella was erected in 1756 by Patrick Browne.Canella in International Plant Names Index. (see External links below).Patrick Browne. 1756. The Civil and Natural History of Jamaica:275. T.Osborne & J. Shipton: London, UK. (See External links below). The species epithet winterana is an artifact from a period when this plant was confused with Winter's bark, Drimys winteri, which is itself named for William Winter. Distribution Canella is widely distributed, and not uncommon on the Florida Keys, where it was first discovered by J. L. Blodgett. It generally grows under the shade of larger trees in dense forests composed of Sideroxylon, Lysiloma, Swietenia, Bursera, Hypelate, Dipholis, and Nectandra. Canella was one of the first American trees to attract the attention of Europeans, and it is mentioned in the accounts of many of the early voyages to America: The white bark, the brilliant deep green foliage, and crimson fruit make the Canella one of the most ornamental of the smaller south Florida trees. It was introduced into England in 1738, and was first cultivated in Europe by Philip Miller.

Shape and appearance  The body of the European smelt is typically 15 to 18 cm long, slender and slightly flattened on either side. Larger fish may reach 30 cm in length. Smelts have a slightly translucent body. The back and sides are grey-green to pink in colour, the flanks bright silver. The tailfin has a dark border. The smelt lives for up to six years. One characteristic is its intense smell, reminiscent of fresh cucumbers.  Habitat and life  The smelt is a sea fish that lives in the coastal waters of Europe from the Baltic Sea to the Bay of Biscay. A freshwater form, known in Germany as the Binnenstint (\\"Inland smelt\\"), is common in the larger lakes of Northern Europe. The smelt gather and swim about in the underflows of stronger currents in order to spawn above areas of sand. This takes place from the end of February to March, if the water temperature is above 9 degrees Celsius. The egg count per female can be as much as 40,000. After spawning there are often mass deaths. The smelt feeds mainly on small plankton crabs, ground animals and even its own young. Smelt caught by angling Smelt are about 15‚Äì20 cm long Fried smelt  Smelt as food   Commercial aspects  During spawning the smelt can easily be caught with nets. Outside the spawning season in the autumn, smelts are found in the harbours on the Baltic Sea coast, where they can be caught with so-called Heringspaternoster lures. In earlier times smelt could be caught in great quantities in rivers, and washing baskets were used instead of nets. In Hamburg the district name of Stintfang (\\"smelt catch\\") indicates this, and in L√ºneburg a row of pubs and restaurants, the Stintmarkt, is named after the fish. In modern times the smelt was of no real significance because it could only be caught in polluted rivers in small quantities and as a result was not in great demand. As the water quality of rivers has improved it can increasingly often be caught in large numbers by smaller fishmongers. Restaurants have especially benefited from the catching and cooking of smelt because the fish is offered as a seasonal speciality. Some of these restaurants have also been successfully run by the smelt fishermen themselves.  Regional culinary aspects Although it is very small, the smelt is prized as food. Its head is usually removed, but the tail and the bones are not because they are very soft. Smelt is generally eaten by hand. The fish is usually fried. In North Germany it is traditionally rolled in rye flour and then fried in butter with bacon. Typical accompaniments include roast potatoes, potato salad and Apfelmus or apple sauce. In the northern Russian city Saint Petersburg smelt (known locally as koryushka) is known as a special local delicacy, famous for its \\"cucumber\\" smell. The availability of koryushka was reputedly one of the reasons Peter the Great chose the location of St Petersburg. In March‚ÄìApril the smelt season opens up with many street vendors offering the fresh merchandise; the cucumber smell allows for them to be found easily. Some restaurants feature smelt in March‚ÄìApril as well, and residents prepare smelt for dinner. The fish are rolled in wheat flour and gently fried. The smelt is also smoked or rolled up and pickled like herring.

David \\"Davy\\" Payne (c. 1949 ‚Äì March 2003) was a senior Northern Irish loyalist and a high-ranking member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) during the Troubles, serving as brigadier of the North Belfast Brigade. He was first in command of the Shankill Road brigade of the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), which was the \\"cover name\\" of the militant branch of the UDA. The group was responsible for a series of abductions and killings of mostly Catholic civilians in the early 1970s. He was arrested after being stopped at a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) checkpoint while driving the \\"scout\\" (lead) car for his UDA colleagues whose cars' boots contained large caches of weapons imported from Lebanon. He was convicted and sentenced to 19 years in prison.Peter Taylor, Loyalists, pp. 191‚Äì92 Ulster Defence Association The Shankill Road neighbourhood of Belfast, as it appeared in the early 1970s. This was where Davy Payne grew up and then started commanded the Ulster Freedom Fighters. Payne was born in Belfast and grew up in the loyalist Shankill Road area of West Belfast. His family belonged to the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster. He remained a member of the church in adulthood and regularly attended services at the Martyrs' Memorial Church, the group's headquarters on the Ravenhill Road in south-east Belfast.Dennis Cooke, Persecuting Zeal: A Portrait of Ian Paisley, Brandon Books, 1996, p. 184 Payne was one of the original members of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) when it was formed from Ulster loyalist vigilante groups in September 1971. These groups, including the Woodvale Defence Association (WDA) and Shankill Defence Association (SDA), had sprung up following the outbreak in the late 1960s of the violent politico-religious conflict known as the Troubles. Payne, who had been a supporter of Gusty Spence and had rioted in 1966 following Spence's arrest, had been a member of both the Ulster Volunteer Force and Tara but took his entire \\"team\\" over to the UDA upon that organisation's foundation.Steve Bruce, The Red Hand, Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 253 As the civil disorder, rioting, and attacks carried out by the Provisional IRA escalated, many Ulster Protestants felt increasingly under threat, and the groups were created as a means of defending the status quo. These vigilante units merged in 1971 to become the UDA. Author Sarah Nelson stated that \\"the vigilantism of summer and autumn 1969 was one of the foundation stones of the Ulster Defence Association\\".Nelson, Sarah (1984). Ulster's Uncertain Defenders: Protestant Political, Paramilitary and Community Groups and the Northern Ireland Conflict. Belfast: Appletree Press. p. 82. A former British Army paratrooper, Payne had been interned in the early 1970s. He became commander of the UDA's C Company, 2nd Battalion Shankill Road, West Belfast Brigade, afterwards he commanded the Shankill Road brigade of the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), which was the \\"cover name\\" of the UDA's militant branch. Beginning in May 1972 (although the UFF was not \\"officially\\" formed until 1973),The Ulster Freedom Fighters were formed in 1973 as a \\"cover name\\" for the militant branch of the UDA, so the latter, who were then a legal organisation, could avoid being proscribed by the British government as part of their violent, retaliatory campaign against the nationalist population whom they believed was giving full support to the Provisional IRA, the group would abduct random Catholic men and women from nationalist areas, then beat, torture and kill them.Peter Taylor. (1999). Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. pp. 115‚Äì16.Sarah Nelson. (1984). Ulster's Uncertain Defenders: Protestant Political, Paramiltary and Community Groups and the Northern Ireland Conflict. Belfast: Appletree Press. pp. 117‚Äì27. Payne was described as the UDA's most violent and feared killer,Jack Holland, \\"Davy Payne, aka, 'the Psychopath' dies\\", Irish Echo, 26 March-1 April 2003. and was also a member of the Orange Order, belonging to the Old Boyne Island Heroes Lodge.Brian Kennaway. The Orange Order-A Tradition Betrayed, page 47 Journalist Kevin Myers called him \\"one of the most ferocious savages in the history of Irish terrorism\\". Payne was said to have invented the notorious \\"romper rooms\\" where the UDA interrogated and tortured their victims.Simon Pia.\\"Death in Details\\", The Scotsman, 10 July 2003. According to author Ian Wood, Payne was addicted to the use of knives and sadistically tortured his victims before killing themWood, Ian S. (2006). Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA. p. 13. this earned him the nickname of \\"The Psychopath\\". Payne served as the UDA's \\"Provost-Marshall\\", the officer in charge of maintaining internal discipline. Beginning in early 1973, there was an internal feud and power struggle within the UDA which would last until 1975. Its former leader, the West Belfast brigadier Charles Harding Smith, argued with Payne, and then ordered him off the Shankill Road on account of the latter's support of his rival, Andy Tyrie. Tyrie, who in 1973 had become UDA commander, retaliated against Harding Smith by promoting Payne to the rank of brigadier in 1974 and subsequently gave him command of the UDA's North Belfast Brigade. Although Tyrie was overall commander of the UDA, brigadiers in the organisation enjoyed a large degree of autonomy and regarded their own territory as \\"their personal fiefdoms\\".Taylor, p. 199 Payne was described by Wood as having been a friend of Tyrie.Wood, Ian S. (2006). Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA. Edinburgh University Press. p. 60. Fellow UDA member Glenn Barr believed that Payne on one occasion had saved his life > I owe my life to Davy Payne because there had been a plan within a section > of the UDA to have me killed because I had been part of a delegation which > had gone to Libya to have talks with Colonel Gadafy [sic] in 1974. Davy > Payne went to those people and told them I was under his protection and I > have no doubt this saved my life. Alleged killings and attacks On 21 July 1972, Payne, along with some of his UDA associates, allegedly carried out the double killing of Rosemary McCartney, a young Catholic singer from West Belfast, and her boyfriend, Patrick O'Neill. Earlier on this same day, the IRA had exploded 22 bombs in Belfast, killing nine people, and injuring 130. One of the dead included a member of the UDA, William Irvine (18). This day became known as Bloody Friday. The couple had been stopped at a UDA roadblock and taken to one of the \\"romper rooms\\" for a \\"grilling\\" (interrogation) which was presided over by Payne, who like his companions, wore a mask. According to the journalist Kevin Myers, Payne supervised the beating and torturing of O'Neill, who was repeatedly burnt with cigarette butts. After a card was found in Rosemary McCartney's bag which identified her as a singer, Payne asked her whether she was in fact an actual singer. After the woman replied in the affirmative, Payne told her to \\"prove it\\". When she inquired how, he answered \\"by singing\\". McCartney was forced to sing in front of Payne and the others, then she and her boyfriend were subsequently forced into a car and shot to death, supposedly by Payne. Their bodies were discovered the following day in an abandoned car in Glencairn. McCartney had been shot three times in the face. In June 1973, Payne reportedly took part in the double killing of Social Democratic and Labour Party Senator Paddy Wilson and his companion, Irene Andrews, a Protestant.Wood, Ian S. (2006). Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA. Edinburgh University Press. p. 105. Wilson had offered Andrews a lift home from a Belfast city centre pub. Following a telephone call to a newspaper from the UFF using their code name \\"Captain Black\\", Wilson and Andrews' mutilated bodies were found five hours later lying in pools of blood beside Wilson's car in a quarry off the Hightown Road. They had both been stabbed and hacked to death in what appeared to have been a frenzied attack. Wilson was stabbed a total of 30 times and his throat slashed from ear to ear; Andrews was knifed 20 times.Taylor, p. 118 The first-in-command of the UFF's Shankill Road brigade, John White was convicted of the crime after he had confessed to it in 1978. It was claimed that Payne would scream at those he wanted to frighten or intimidate: \\"Do you know who I am? I'm Davy Payne. They say I killed Paddy Wilson\\". Payne was never convicted of any of the murders that were attributed to him. He established the reputation of the UDA/UFF's notorious C Company, 2nd Battalion Shankill Road, West Belfast Brigade. This would eventually come under the control of Johnny \\"Mad Dog\\" Adair, who looked up to Payne as the biggest leading loyalist to take the war to the republican movement and a true hero to the loyalist people of Ulster. RUC Special Patrol Group (SPG) officer John Weir alleged that Payne had been involved in the Dublin car bombings on 17 May 1974 in which 26 people in three city-centre explosions were killed.Houses of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings (December 2003), The Barron Report 2003, p. 146. In 2003, Weir's allegations that Payne, along with senior Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) members, Billy Hanna and Robin Jackson, had led one of the UVF teams that bombed Dublin, were published in the Barron Report which were the findings of an official investigation into the bombings by Irish Supreme Court Justice Henry Barron. Payne, when questioned earlier, denied he had been involved in the car bombings,Houses of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence, and Women's Rights, Interim on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings (December 2003). The Barron Report 2003, p. 158. although he admitted to having met Weir in prison. Arrest and conviction Payne left the UDA in the mid-1970s over the continuing allegations that he had misappropriated UDA funds. Away from the group he set up as a community worker and also set up a number of youth training schemes. These initiatives, many of which were of a cross-community nature, briefly saw Payne held up as an example of a reformed character and he was praised by the Peace People and invited to speak in Dublin. Payne's relationship with Tyrie was damaged due to a speech Payne made warning young men away from paramilitary involvement. In April 1978 his house was shot at by UDA members. Soon after this attack, Payne's second career came to an end when he was investigated by a civil servant over allegations of fraud.Bruce, The Red Hand, pp. 253‚Äì54. However, rather than contest the allegations Payne closed down his operations and, having rebuilt his relationship with Tyrie, accepted his invitation to return as North Belfast Brigadier. Tyrie reportedly worried that the Brigade was making no money and also feared a small group of members who were carrying out a series of sectarian murders under their own steam and felt that Payne could restore order to the area. Payne was not popular with many local members, who resented his bullying techniques. In the 1980s, persistent allegations of stealing UDA funds were levelled against him and he made many enemies within the organisation. The UDA also accused him of complicity in the assassination of South Belfast brigadier John McMichael, who was blown up in a booby-trap car bomb planted by the IRA outside his Lisburn home on 22 December 1987.Wood, pp. 133‚Äì34 In that same year, the police were aware that he was involved in an operation to steal weapons from an army base. On 8 January 1988, he was arrested in Portadown after being stopped at an RUC checkpoint. At the head of a small convoy of vehicles, Payne was driving the \\"scout\\" car (an Austin Maestro) for his UDA colleagues whose own cars' boots contained the UDA's share of a large consignment of weapons which had been smuggled from Lebanon and destined for loyalist paramilitaries.Taylor, pp. 191‚Äì92 The load consisted of 90 Browning pistols, 161 AK-47s, 250 grenades, 6 RPG 7'S, 184 magazines and 11,000 rounds of ammunition, along with 200 lbs of deadly lebanese semtex. Fibres from Payne's clothing were found on the weapons, and his name had been used as a reference for hiring the cars.Newshound: Daily Northern Ireland news catalog. Retrieved 13 October 2009 According to journalist Peter Taylor, there was no doubt at the time that he had been set up by an informer within the UDA.Taylor, p. 192 Payne was sentenced to 19 years in prison. He did not, however, serve the full sentence. His succession as brigadier was not a smooth one although after a disagreement, Tyrie relented and allowed the North Belfast members to promote their own man as Brigadier rather than an outside candidate whom Tyrie had hoped to parachute in. Death Payne died of a heart attack in March 2003 at the age of 54. A widower, he was survived by two sons. After a service held on 19 March 2003 at his home in Snugville Street off the Shankill Road, several hundred mourners and over tens of hundreds of his members attended his funeral. It was said that he had the largest show of strength ever to be on the Shankill Road. 3 UFF gunmen fired AK47s and 3 young members of the UYM used handguns over his coffin outside his home in proper UDA military style. He was later cremated.\\"Ulster Today: Funeral of former Shankill UDA chief\\", The News Letter (Belfast, Northern Ireland). 20 March 2003; retrieved 10 October 2009 via Highbeam.

The series was first run on MediaCorp Channel 8 from 9 March to 11 May 2001 on Friday nights. The series is based on the 1999 book Eternal Vigilance: The Price of Freedom (published by Asiapac Books), which contains numerous eyewitness accounts of survivors of the Japanese occupation of Southeast Asia. In contrast with The Price of Peace, a similar television series aired on MediaCorp Channel 8 in 1997, In Pursuit of Peace focuses more on developing the main characters' stories, while the former places greater emphasis on the historical aspects of the Japanese occupation. Plot The series is set in Singapore and Malaya during World War II and depicts daily life before and during the Japanese occupation of Singapore from the perspectives of two families. The Huang family run an inn in Singapore. Huang Yitang married Li Huaniang, a Nyonya woman, and has two sons (Changfeng and Changman) and a daughter (Yinxiang) with her. The Huangs also adopted an orphaned boy, Changqing, and arranged for him to marry Yinxiang when they are grown up. Things get complicated as both Yinxiang and Changqing have their own love interests: Yinxiang is enamoured with Dahai, an anti-Japanese activist, while Changqing loves his cousin, Yang Xiaomei. Unknown to everyone, Chen Yong, an employee at the inn, has a crush on Yinxiang. The Huangs' neighbours, the Lin family, own a provision shop. Lin Songde lost his wife early and lives with his son (Lin Fan) and two daughters (Lin Yun and Lin Shan). The two families have arranged a marriage between Changfeng and Lin Yun when they were still young. Later, when the grown-up Changfeng and Lin Yun meet each other, they fall in love without knowing that they are already engaged. Lin Fan starts a romance with Ah-gui after saving her and her brother from a paedophilic businessman. Lin Shan is in a relationship with Warren, a British soldier, who abandons her later. Changfeng and Lin Yun are later killed in an air raid. Against his father's wishes, Lin Fan joins Dalforce and fights the Japanese during the Battle of Singapore. After the fall of Singapore, he flees to Malaya with Ah-gui, marries her and joins an underground resistance movement. Chen Yong secretly becomes an informer for the Kempeitai and infiltrates the resistance movement at the same time. He uses the Kempeitai to help him get rid of Dahai and Changqing so that he can get closer to Yinxiang and win her heart. Changqing survives, goes into hiding with Yang Xiaomei, and starts a family with her. When the Kempeitai threaten him with Yinxiang's life, Chen Yong turns vicious and betrays the resistance by leading the Kempeitai to their hideout in Malaya. In the ensuing battle, a pregnant Ah-gui sacrifices her life to save Lin Fan. Lin Shan encounters Nishimura, a Japanese military officer, falls in love with him and eventually marries him, much to her father's chagrin. However, she ends up as a sex slave after Nishimura is assassinated by his rivals. Lin Fan returns to Singapore to take revenge on the traitor who betrayed the resistance, and he warns Yinxiang after discovering that Chen Yong is the traitor. Yinxiang pretends to marry Chen Yong, fatally stabs him on their wedding night to avenge Dahai, and disappears from Singapore. In the meantime, Lin Fan encounters Ding Yueguang, a prostitute, and starts a romance with her after they escape death together on a few occasions. However, they never get together eventually. At the end of the war, the surviving members of the two families reunite, except Yinxiang, who sends them a letter saying she has gone to Hainan. Historical events Historical figures such as Goh Say Eng, Lim Boon Keng and Yamashita Tomoyuki are portrayed in the drama. One episode focuses on Goh Say Eng's internal struggles when he is torn between his role as an anti-Japanese activist and as a parent of a Japanese military officer he fathered years ago with his secret lover in Japan. In another episode, the Japanese force Lim Boon Keng to raise a \\"donation\\" of 50 million straits dollars and present it to Yamashita Tomoyuki in a public ceremony.

The principal photography was conducted in Vermont and the film was released directly to video on June 7, 2005 in the United States by the MTI Home Video media distributing company. Plot Deep in the Amazon Rainforest, a well-preserved woman dating from the ice age is found encased in amber. Her body is then loaded onto an airplane to be taken to a military facility where she can be studied by scientists. Dr. Thomas Goddard takes care of the woman on the plane, although fails to notice when her heating system malfunctions, causing it to create freezing temperatures in her tube, and it awakens her into an angry ice-monster. Meanwhile, at a nearby mountain ski resort, mountain worker Johnny has a one-night stand with Elaine, who's applying for a job at the resort the next day. Few people are left at the resort as its closed for the week, including Johnny, Elaine, Johnny's crush Tori, and her uncle Ed, who owns the resort, Johnny's friends Devlin, and Jessie, and fellow worker Audrey. As the plane flies over the mountain, the pilot, Mac, holds Goddard at gunpoint, intending to sell the specimen for ransom. However, the Ice Queen awakens, and kills Mac before causing the plane to crash into the mountain, creating an avalanche in the process, trapping Johnny, Tori, Elaine, Audrey, Devlin, and Jessie inside the hotel, and Ed in the parking lot. The plane slides into the hotel as well during the avalanche, trapping Goddard, and the Ice Queen inside. The Ice Queen first kills Devlin alone in the hallway before attacking Jessie in a bathroom, where he manages to temporarily subdue her. Goddard soon encounters the group, revealing that if they heat her up enough, she'll die. Johnny later encounters the Ice Queen, who is shown to have a sexual attraction towards him. Elaine is later attacked in the kitchen by the Ice Queen, and the others fight her, although she runs away. Audrey, and Goddard later find her in the dining room. Audrey attempts to fight her, but is killed while Goddard encourages his specimen to kill. The Ice Queen then attacks, and wounds Goddard, and chases Johnny, Tori, and Elaine through the hotel. The three attempt to reach the attic to escape to the surface, although Elaine is killed by the Ice Queen while Johnny, and Tori make it outside, and reunite with Ed. However, the Ice Queen follows them, and Johnny lures her into a nearby hot tub before scalding her to death. Johnny, Tori, and Ed then walk away from the scene, although, unbeknownst to them, an alive Goddard has made it to the surface, and takes a sample of the Ice Queen's remains, intending to clone her later on.

Williams wrote \\"Actually, only the opening scene where the military convoy gets attacked and the concept of the airplane crashing into a mountain side and causing an avalanche to cover the ski resort are mine\\", explaining that his original screenplay Avalanche Run went through major changes due to producers and directors rewriting the script.

It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. Mendelsohn won the directing prize for Judy Berlin at the 1999 Sundance International Film Festival. This was Madeline Kahn's final film appearance eleven months before her death on December 3, 1999. Plot Told in a series of vignettes, the film opens on the morning of the second day of school. Principal Arthur Gold (Bob Dishy) is married to Alice (Madeline Kahn), although interaction between them immediately hints that the union is unhappy. Alice babbles frequently, much to Arthur‚Äôs chagrin. Their son David (Aaron Harnick), who is thirty, is depressed after a failed attempt at being a Hollywood filmmaker. The school Arthur runs is employed by down-and-out teacher Sue Berlin (Barbara Barrie), who prepares her children to view the upcoming solar eclipse, secretary Bea (Anne Meara), lunch lady Marie (Julie Kavner), who discuss dreams and astrology, and bus driver Ceil (Judy Graubart). At the center of the story is aspiring actress Judy Berlin (Edie Falco), who is Sue‚Äôs daughter. Unlike many of the characters in the film, she is upbeat, excitable and enthusiastic. While on a walk, David runs into Judy, where they meet up again after having gone to high school together. Judy discusses her big plans for Hollywood and is overjoyed to hear David is a filmmaker. He refuses to tell her about his failure. During class, while her students are making paper cut outs in order to view the eclipse, Dolores Engler (Bette Henritze) wanders into the classroom and asks the children to look outside. Although a seemingly pleasant woman, she shows symptoms of dementia, as she is forgetful and emotionally imbalanced. When Sue asks her to leave, Dolores hits her and is removed from the classroom. David goes and visits the town‚Äôs historical society, where Judy is working as a museum demonstrator. She tells him she hates her job and then asks him out to lunch. As they eat, they discuss their dreams of filmmaking, where David says he hopes to make a documentary about a town similar to where they live. Judy is disillusioned by this. Arthur goes and checks on Sue, who at first assures him she‚Äôs fine before breaking down, and saying she will not play games, hinting at her romantic interest in him. He also appears to be interested romantically in her. The solar eclipse begins to occur, and the landscape takes on an ethereal, dreamlike appearance. Alice is greatly moved by the eclipse, and takes her cleaning lady Carol (Novella Nelson), on a walk, calling out to her neighbors in ghostly moans and pretending to walk on the moon. She stops by neighbor Maddie‚Äôs (Carlin Glynn) house to see her refurbished kitchen, to which Maddie informs Alice that she thought they were not on good terms after Alice called her months ago in a rage. Alice does not recall this incident, hinting that Alice might have a form of dementia herself. Then they see Arthur arrive home, before he hurries back to the school. Alice declares cryptically that her husband has left her. As the eclipse reaches totality, Sue dismisses her class and Arthur visits her again, where they share a brief kiss. Judy and David continue their walk, where they reminisce over high school and Judy admits she had a crush on David due to his quiet, misanthropic nature. They come to a playground where Judy sings an old childhood riddle as she frolicks among the equipment. When they return to the museum, David kisses Judy and then, seeing her unaffected by it, denounces her dreams of Hollywood by telling her the competitive nature of the film industry. Judy is disheartened and runs away. Alice and Carol continue their walk, until Carol is relieved of duty and drives off. Alice meets up with Mr. V (Peter Appel), who tells her of an upcoming appointment. Alice continues on, giving a monologue that shows her disconnect to reality and also her love for Arthur. Undeterred by David, Judy plans to leave on train for Queens. David catches her and apologizes and admits to hating goodbyes. Judy tells him that she will star in one of his movies someday and then boards the train and leaves. Alice and Arthur greet each other quietly in the streets, and Sue catches Dolores wandering around and tells her that everything will be alright, as the sun begins to show itself again, ending the film.

It covers chapters 23 to 37 of the biblical Book of Genesis, with only African actors. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. Plot There are three stories. First, there is Esau's hatred of his younger brother Jacob for taking his birthright. There is also the abduction and rape of their sister Dina by a Canaanite. The Canaanite falls in love with Dina and offers to make amends. Jacob demands that all the males in his tribe undergo circumcision, which they reluctantly agree to. However, while they are still recovering from the operation, they are set upon and slain to the last man. Finally, Jacob believes his favorite son, Joseph, to be dead, but later learns that he is alive in Egypt. Jacob and Esau settle their differences, and they all set out for Egypt.

Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 9 October 2016 He was also a gifted figure painter who was regularly invited to paint the staffage in compositions of fellow painters.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 626-631 Life The Flemish biographer Cornelis de Bie stated in his book of artist biographies Het Gulden Cabinet, published in 1661, that Adriaen van Stalbemt was born on 12 June 1580. No baptismal records from Antwerp's churches for the artist exist as his family was Protestant. After the fall of Antwerp in 1585, his family moved for religious reasons to Middelburg. Here he probably received his artistic training. Classical landscape with nymphs bathing in a grotto He returned to Antwerp after 1609, probably after the entry into effect of the Twelve Years' Truce, which heralded a cessation of hostilities between the Habsburg rulers of Spain and the Southern Netherlands and the Dutch Republic.Adriaen van Stalbemt at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He was admitted in 1610 as a master of the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. In 1617 he was elected dean of the Guild. In this role he was able to obtain the reinstatement of certain privileges of the chamber of rhetoric the Violieren, which was linked to the Guild. He established himself as a painter of landscapes but was also a capable staffage and animal painter. He worked on commissions for the art dealer Peter Goetkint II for whom he made cabinet paintings, i.e. small paintings on copper that were integrated into cabinets. On 5 May 1613, van Stalbemt married Barbara Verdelft, daughter of the art dealer Jan Verdelft. A daughter born to the couple died young and the couple remained childless. After his wedding the artist's career started to take off and the family was able to establish themselves in the fashionable city centre on the Meir. In 1616 Hans Mesmaeckers is registered as his pupil. Landscape with fables In 1633 the artist was active in London for about ten months. Cornelis de Bie reported that King Charles I of England had invited the artist to England. During his stay he painted two landscape views of Greenwich with King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria (still in the Royal Collection). The artist had converted back to Catholicism upon his wedding but had returned to the Protestant faith shortly before his death. He died on 21 September 1662 and was buried in an unconsecrated burial site in Putte. Work General Van Stalbemt was a versatile artist who was active as a painter as well as a printmaker. He was mainly known for his landscapes which typically included religious, mythological and allegorical scenes. Only a small number of his works is dated which makes it difficult to establish a chronology. One of the reference works for attributions is the Feast of the Gods in the Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden, which is signed and dated 1622.Adriaen van Stalbemt, A wooded landscape with an Allegory of the Four Elements at Christie's A View of Greenwich His style has been described as eclectic, as it shows the influences of various artists such as Jan Brueghel the Elder, Jan Brueghel the Younger, Hendrick van Balen, Paul Bril and Adam Elsheimer.K. Andrews, 'A Pseudo-Elsheimer Group: Adriaen van Stalbemt as Figure painter', in Burlington Magazine, CXV, 1973, pp. 301‚Äì6 His landscapes are also influenced by Gillis van Coninxloo.Adriaen van Stalbemt, Waldlandschaft mit Bauern at Lemptertz A work showing Jan Brueghel the Elder's influence is the Landscape with Fables (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp). This is reflected in van Stalbemt's meticulous brush technique and the miniature treatment of details. Alongside Abraham Govaerts, van Stalbemt is considered one of the best followers and imitators of Jan Brueghel the Elder. Various characteristics help distinguish his works from those of Breughel: to render foliage and the colour of the houses he used light yellow rather than pink as Jan Brueghel the Elder did.Adriaen van Stalbemt, Summer at Gallery De Jonckheere Other works are duller in colour and do not display the same meticulous brush technique. The composition David slaying Goliath (1618, Museo del Prado, Madrid) is a collaborative work with Pieter Brueghel the Younger, in which the figures were the work of van Stalbemt. One group of works previously attributed to Adam Elsheimer has been reattributed to van Stalbemt. The influence of Elsheimer, which is particularly apparent in the composition, is believed to have been passed on via David Teniers the Elder, who had worked for a period in Elsheimer's studio. Van Stalbemt's later work shows similarities with Hendrick van Balen's work. Protectors of the young artist Van Stalbemt was also active as a printmaker. A series of landscape prints by his hand represent respectively a coastal marine view with ships, a watermill, a windmill, ruins and a castle on a mountain. Gallery paintings Gallery paintings depict large rooms in which many paintings and other precious items are displayed in elegant surroundings. The earliest works in this genre depicted art objects together with other items such as scientific instruments or peculiar natural specimens. Frans Francken the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder started the genre by creating paintings of art and curiosity collections in the 1620s.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012 Some gallery paintings include portraits of the owners or collectors of the art objects or artists at work.Alexander Marr, 'The Flemish 'Pictures of Collections' Genre: An Overview', Intellectual History Review, 20: 1, (2010), p. 5 ‚Äì 25 The genre became immediately quite popular and was followed by other artists such as Jan Brueghel the Younger, Cornelis de Baellieur, Hans Jordaens, David Teniers the Younger, Gillis van Tilborch and Hieronymus Janssens. Diana and Callisto, Actaeon in the distance A number of gallery paintings have traditionally been attributed to van Stalbemt. This includes the composition The Sciences and the Arts and the reduced replica of the lower right hand corner of that composition called The Geographer and the Naturalist (both in the Prado). A Collector's Cabinet, which is similar to the paintings in the Prado, was sold at Sotheby's on 9 July 2014 as lot 57. Most art historians now appear to agree that these works should be attributed to Hieronymus Francken II as van Stalbemt's figures differ from those in these gallery paintings. The staffage in all of the gallery interiors is now seen as most probably the work of as yet unidentified figure painters. Other gallery paintings that were formerly attributed to van Stalbemt have also been re-attributed to Hieronymus Francken II. Even so, some art historians still are of the view that van Stalbemt was also active in this genre. For instance, some art historians still see the hand of van Stalbemt in one of the best known gallery pictures ‚Äì The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector's Cabinet (collection of The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland).Hieronymus Francken (II), A Collector's Cabinet at Sotheby's Notes Landscape with the ruin of an abbey External links * Category:1580 births Category:1662 deaths Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Category:People from Antwerp ","title":"Adriaen van Stalbemt"},{"id":"24640906","text":"Ian Spink (born 8 October 1947) is an Australian-British choreographer.

It consisted of a round wooden paddle-like bat with a handle, not unlike a ping- pong paddle, attached to the center of which was a piece of elastic band about three feet long. Attached to end of the elastic band was a rubber ball about an inch in diameter. The child would bat the ball as far as the elastic would allow it to travel. When it reached the furthest distance from the bat that the elastic would allow, it sprang back at the bat where it was hit again and again. The object of the game was to see how many times the child could hit the ball and have it return and be hit again. Children competed against themselves and others for the greatest number of successful hits. This is possibly the same thing as a paddle ball.

R. G., oder Versuch einer Abhandlung von der Verbindlichkeit Pommerschen Landen, sonderlich K√∂niglich-Schwedischen Antheils, mit dem Heilig-R√∂misch- Teutschen Reich. Garbe, Frankfurt/M. 1766, pp. 156-160. Background The Brandenburg-Pomeranian conflict about whether the House of Pomerania had to take the Duchy of Pomerania as a fief from the Electors of Brandenburg or as an immediate fief of the Holy Roman Emperors was temporarily settled in 1493, when John Cicero of the Brandenburgian Hohenzollern, and Bogislaw X of the House of Pomerania, had concluded the Treaty of Pyritz. This treaty discarded the obligation of the Pomeranian dukes to take their duchy as a fief from the Hohenzollern, as ruled in the prior Treaties of Prenzlau (1472/1479), but granted the Hohenzollern the right of succession in case the House of Pomerania became extinct. Heitz (1995), p.202 In Pyritz, John Cicero had hoped for prompt succession to the then childless Bogislaw X, but when children were born to Bogislaw,Materna (1995), p.260 he intrigued against him to prevent him from effectively gaining imperial immediacy.Stollberg-Rilinger (2008), p.81 Instead of taking sides in the Hohenzollern-Pomeranian dispute, Emperor Charles V invested both houses with the duchy and collected the respective tax from both.Stollberg-Rilinger (2008), pp.81-82 When Bogislaw X died 1523, he was succeeded by his sons Barnim IX and George I, who ruled togetherKrause (1997), p.43 and continued the dispute with John Cicero's successor, Joachim I Nestor.Stollberg-Rilinger (2008), p.82 After causing some sensation at the Imperial Diet's assemblies, various nobles of the Holy Roman Empire offered to mediate the conflict, and a successful mediation by the Dukes of Brunswick, Eric I and Henry IV, resulted in a treaty signed at Jagdschlo√ü Grimnitz, a hunting seat of the Brandenburgian electors in the Uckermark, north of Eberswalde. Provisions George I of Pomerania Joachim I Nestor accepted the imperial immediacy of the Duchy of Pomerania. The Pomeranian dukes Barnim IX and George I accepted the Electorate of Brandenburg's right of succession in the Duchy of Pomerania if the House of Pomerania died out. The Brandenburgers were to be informed prior to any investiture of the Pomeranian dukes, and were granted the rights to touch the flags the Pomeranians received from the Holy Roman Emperor during the ceremonial investiture. The Brandenburgian electors were further granted the right to have an envoy present at ceremonial receptions of allegiance oaths given to the Pomeranian dukes by the Pomeranian nobility. The Brandenburgian electors as vested remainders were also granted the right to be invested with the hereditary option of succession in Pomerania by the emperor. With every subsequent investiture of new dukes, the treaty was to be formally announced and renewed. In addition, the Brandenburgian electors were granted rights on the title and the coat of arms of the Pomeranian dukes, which they were allowed to show when and wherever the Pomeranian dukes themselves were not present. Implementation Investiture Emperor Charles V The provisions of the treaty regarding the investiture were put into effect at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530,Stollberg-Rilinger (2008), p.83 when the Pomeranian dukes Barnim IX and George I for the first time formally received their duchy as a fief. Emperor Charles V and the prince-electors were the first to enter the Diet, and after they had taken their seats, Joachim I Nestor formally announced that he protested against the investiture of the House of Pomerania, but would be satisfied if he was allowed to participate in the ceremony and touch the Pomeranian flags. The emperor replied that the protest is noted. George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, seconded the elector's protest. Then, the Pomeranian dukes entered the assembly with their entourage carrying the flags of Pomerania, Stettin, Kashubia, Wenden, Barth, R√ºgen, Wolgast, Usedom and Buckow, presented the flags to the emperor, and on their knees gave him the oath of allegiance. Elector Joachim I Nestor renewed his protest, and when the Pomeranian dukes received their flags from the emperor, he stepped forward and put his hands on each of them. This formalized procedure was thence repeated at every new investiture. Succession George William, Elector of Brandenburg The last duke of the House of Pomerania, Bogislaw XIV, died in 1637, during the Thirty Years' War.Croxton (2002), p.30 George William, Elector of Brandenburg, claimed succession based on the inheritance clause in the Treaty of Grimnitz. However, Bogislaw XIV had concluded an alliance with Sweden in the Treaty of Stettin (1630), and had determined that Sweden should govern the Duchy of Pomerania after his death. Sweden refused to hand over the duchy.Heitz (1995), p.226 An agreement was reached to partition the duchy into a Swedish and a Brandenburgian part in the Peace of Westphalia (1648),Heitz (1995), p.230 which was put into effect in the Treaty of Stettin (1653).Heitz (1995), p.232 Sources References Bibliography     * Category:Treaties of the Duchy of Pomerania Category:Treaties of the Margraviate of Brandenburg Category:1529 in the Holy Roman Empire Category:1529 treaties ","title":"Treaty of Grimnitz"},{"id":"24641022","text":"Jean-Claude Guiguet (; 22 November 1948 - 18 September 2005) was a French film director and screenwriter.

The field development is based on the single stationary Prirazlomnaya platform, which is the first Arctic-class ice- resistant oil platform in the world. Commercial drilling was planned to begin in early 2012, however it was delayed at least until the Spring of 2013 due to protester's \\"safety concerns\\". Safety concerns have been raised about Prirazlomnoye platform, citing use of decommissioned equipment (the 1984 TLP upper section of the rig), however Gazprom‚Äôs oil spill response plan for Prirazlomnaya was renewed in 2014, and most questions found its answers. The Arctic Prirazlomnoye field produced the 10 millionth barrel of Russian North Arctic Oil in March 2016. History The field was discovered in 1989. In 1993, the development license was issued to Rosshelf, a subsidiary of Gazprom, and the field was to be operational by 2001. In June 2000, Gazprom and German energy company Wintershall signed a memorandum on cooperation in developing the Prirazlomnoye field. Also Rosneft wanted to join the project. In 2002, the license was transferred to Sevmorneftegaz, a joint venture of Gazprom and Rosneft. Later Sevmorneftegaz became a wholly owned subsidiary of Gazprom. There is a plan to pass the Prirazlomnoye development to Gazprom Neft, an oil arm of Gazprom. The name Prirazlomnoye means \\"at the geological fault\\". Reserves Prirazlomnoye field has reserves of . Development The field development concept is based on the single stationary Prirazlomnaya platform. The oil platform, constructed by Sevmash shipyard in Severodvinsk, was expected to be completed by 2011 and after that the drilling would start. The Prirazlomnaya platform was equipped with the topside of the decommissioned 1984 tension-leg platform (TLP) Conoco's Hutton field, which was the first ever built tension-leg platform. Produced oil will be transported by double acting shuttle oil tankers Mikhail Ulyanov and Kirill Lavrov, built in Admiralty Shipyard and operated by Sovcomflot, to floating storage and offloading vessel Belokamenka, located in Kola Bay near Murmansk. Gazprom considers to build an oil refinery in Teriberka at the location of the LNG plant of the Shtokman's development for processing oil from Prirazlomnoye and Dolginskoye fields. The concept of the development was designed by Vniigaz Institute, a subsidiary of Gazprom. The estimated maximum annual oil production volume is expected to be 6.6 million tonnes. The total investment is expected to be about US$1.03 billion. The first oil from Prirazlomnaya The construction of the Prirazlomnaya took almost a decade. The platform installation was towed to the Pechora Sea in August 2011, however it took 2.5 years before the production started in December 2013. In 2014, Gazprom expects to deliver at least 300,000 tonnes of Arctic crude (ARCO). Environmental issues According to study of possible Arctic oil spill scenarios from the oil platform Prirazlomnaya completed by Russian scientists, together with environmentalists from Greenpeace and WWF-Russia Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund Gazprom is not prepared to deal adequately with a spill associated with oil production. The Russian Ministry of Emergency confirmed that Gazprom‚Äôs oil spill response plan expired in July 2012, making any drilling the company undertakes in the Arctic illegal until a new one is submitted and approved. On 24 August 2012, a group of Greenpeace activists under Kumi Naidoo scaled the platform and put up a banner \\"Don't kill the Arctic\\". On 18 September 2013, Greenpeace's ship Arctic Sunrise circled the Prirazlomnaya oil rig while three crew attempted to board the platform. In response, the Russian Coast Guard seized control of the ship and detained the activists. The ship was subsequently towed by a coastguard vessel to the Russian Arctic port of Murmansk. The crew consisted of thirty members from sixteen different nationalities. The Russian government has intended to charge the Greenpeace activists with piracy, which carries a maximum penalty of fifteen years of imprisonment. It was the stiffest response that Greenpeace has encountered from a government since the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior in 1985, said Phil Radford, executive director of Greenpeace USA. The Netherlands launched legal action to free 30 Greenpeace activists charged in Russia with piracy. Arctic Sunrise is a Dutch-flagged ship.

Life She was the youngest daughter of William Turner, a composer and countertenor who was a contemporary of Henry Purcell, and is best remembered for her association with the composer George Frideric Handel, in whose operas she sang.Grove On 6 September 1716 she married the organist John Robinson. They had a daughter who had a singing career, and other children who died young.A Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians, Dancers, Managers & Other Stage Personnel in London, 1660-1800. SIU Press, 1991. Page 26. Her first public performances were in 1718: in the April of that year she sang a cantata by Ariosti at the King's Theatre, and the year after she performed in a private concert, accompanied by Handel, as a replacement for Jane Barbier. The librettist John Hughes commented at the time that Evidently the concert did nothing to harm Handel's opinion of her, for in 1720 she performed (alongside Anastasia Robinson, with whom she is often confused) in the first season of the Royal Academy, where she performed in Porta's Numitore, Domenico Scarlatti's Narciso, and, most famously, created the role of Polissena in Handel's Radamisto, a role that shows Handel's confidence in her abilities: the role calls for a range of e' to a and for some virtuosic excellence at a high tessitura. It is likely that Turner Robinson was the \\"Mrs Robinson\\" who would regularly sing between the acts in the dramas at Drury Lane (late 1725 to late 1726), and who performed seven of Handel's operatic arias in her benefit on 28 April 1726. In a later benefit in March 1729 she included no fewer than 14 of Handel's works (the majority of which had been originally composed for Faustina Bordoni or Francesca Cuzzoni). In 1732 she sang in the first London performances of Handel's oratorios, as an Israelite woman in Esther. Notes References *Winton Dean: \\"Robinson, Ann Turner\\", Grove Music Online ed L.

Also, click analytics may happen in real-time or \\"unreal\\"-time, depending on the type of information sought. Typically, front-page editors on high-traffic news media sites will want to monitor their pages in real-time, to optimize the content. Editors, designers and other stakeholders may analyze clicks on a wider time frame to aid them in assessing the performance of written passages, design elements or advertisements etc. Click data may be gathered in at least two ways. Ideally, a click is \\"logged\\" when it occurs, and this method requires some functionality that picks up relevant information when the event occurs. Alternatively, one may institute the assumption that a page view is a result of a click, and therefore log a simulated click that leads to that page view.

His father, later vicar of Ealing, was chaplain first to the King's younger brother Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and, after his death, to the King's younger son, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn. He received his primary education at a school his father ran in Twickenham, before being sent to Merchant Taylors' School, London.Minchin, J. G. C., Our public schools, their influence on English history; Charterhouse, Eton, Harrow, Merchant Taylors', Rugby, St. Paul's, Westminster, Winchester (London, 1901), p. 194.

Alumni Oxonienses: The Members of the University of Oxford, 1715‚Äì1886 Oxford: Parker and Co., 1888‚Äì1892 Career Following his father and grandfather into the Church of England, he was ordained priest in 1798 by the Bishop of Salisbury and held various appointments until 1804, when he became vicar of Brighton. A busy fishing port and holiday resort, it was where the Prince of Wales, the future King George IV, spent much time and a friendship began between the two men which lasted for life. When the Prince became King in 1820, he was able to advance his friend, who was appointed Deputy Clerk of the Closet, Dean and Canon of Hereford and Canon of Salisbury Cathedral and of Chichester Cathedral. Four years later he was consecrated bishop of Chichester, giving up his posts at Brighton and Salisbury. In 1827 he was promoted to Clerk of the Closet and in 1828 was made a canon of St Paul's Cathedral, giving up his posts at Hereford. In the House of Lords, he was one of the bishops who voted against the Roman Catholic Relief Bill in 1829 and, while not speaking against the measure, opposed it in other ways. During the King's last illness, he was in constant attendance at Windsor Castle and was able to help with two matters on the king's conscience: his estrangement from his brother, the Duke of Sussex, and the possible breach of his coronation oath in allowing Catholic emancipation. In 1831 the new king, William IV, promoted him to the bishopric of Worcester, in fulfilment, as it was understood at the time, of a promise made by the late king. He then gave up his post at St Paul's, being succeeded by Sydney Smith. After the death of the king in 1837, he was replaced as Clerk of the Closet and had no further influence at court. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1831. He died on 24 April 1841, aged 67, in The Old Palace, Worcester and was buried on 3 May beside his wife in Hartlebury churchyard. His only published works were sermons preached for charitable purposes. Hartlebury church Family In 1797 at Twickenham he married Nancy (1774‚Äì1841), youngest daughter of John Wilkinson, a wealthy businessman who lived at Roehampton, and his wife Sibella Berdoe. They had nine children, of whom only four survived: *Maria (1801‚Äì1888), who in 1842 married the Worcester solicitor and MP William Laslett. They separated shortly after, without children, and the unhappy episode was fictionalised in the 1861 novel East Lynne. *Sybella Jane (1802‚Äì1879), who married the Sussex landowner Charles Peckham Peckham and had eight children.

It provides strong cryptography for the Apache v1.3 and v2 webserver via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) cryptographic protocols by the help of the Open Source SSL/TLS toolkit OpenSSL. The original version created for Apache v1.3 was initially created in April 1998 by Ralf S. Engelschall via porting Ben Laurie's Apache-SSL 1.17 source patches for Apache 1.2.6 to Apache 1.3b6. This version is under a BSD-style license. The version for v2.0 and later, in contrast, is maintained by Apache Software Foundation and licensed under Apache License 2.0. It is possible to provide HTTP and HTTPS with a single server machine, because HTTP and HTTPS use different server ports, so there is no direct conflict between them. It is either the maintainer who would run two separate Apache server instances (one binds to port 80, the other to port 443) or use Apache's virtual hosting facility where the maintainer can create two virtual servers which Apache dispatches: one responding to port 80 and speaking HTTP and one responding to port 443 speaking HTTPS. Differences between Apache versions The original mod_ssl in Apache 1.3 available at www.modssl.org is a third-party add-on package requiring additional steps in the compilation and configuration process. Also, the maintainer of the server needs to resolve additional system and Apache dependencies. Apache 2, in contrast, is a built-in module maintained by Apache Software Foundation, and mod_ssl can be easily activated in the compilation and configuration options.

He was in office from 7 April 1949 to 5 January 1951. N (2000).Sharma, N (2000). Transition from Feudalism to Democracy, Jaipur: Aalekh Publishers, , p. 62 Early life Hiralal Shastri was born at Jobner in Jaipur District in a peasant family. He completed his early education in Jobner. Hiralal passed the degree of Sahitya Shastri in 1920. In 1921, he stood first in the B.A. examination from Maharaja's College, Jaipur. He joined Jaipur State Service in 1921 and later became Secretary in the Home and Foreign Departments. He resigned from the service in 1927. Foundation of Banasthali Vidyapith In 1929, Hiralal Shastri selected a remote and backward village Banasthali, 72 km from Jaipur and founded 'Jeevan Kutir' there. Here he trained a group of social workers and endeavoured to implement a programme of rural reconstruction. On 6 October 1935 Hiralal Shastri and Ratan Shastri with active help and support of fellow freedom fighters like Mr. Durgadutt Harit founded Banasthali Vidyapith in memory of Hirala's daughter from his first marriage, Shantabai, who died at a very early age. From early childhood Hiralal Shastri had a burning desire to go to some village and devote his life to the service of the downtrodden. Though he joined Jaipur State Service in 1921 and had a meteoric rise to become Secretary in the Home and Foreign Departments, he resigned the same in 1927. While in administrative service he displayed qualities of hard work, efficiency and fearlessness. In 1929, in fulfillment of his childhood resolve, Hiralal Shastri selected a remote and backward village Banasthali, 45 miles from Jaipur and founded 'Jeevan Kutir' there. Here he trained a band of dedicated social workers and endeavoured to implement a programme of rural reconstruction. These workers later became the heralds of political awakening in many of the Rajputana States. Political career In 1937 he joined Jaipur Rajya Praja Mandal and he was twice elected General Secretary and twice President of it. In 1939 he led the Praja Mandal's Satyagraha for achievement of civil liberties and suffered a six-months imprisonment. In 1947 he was appointed General Secretary of the All India States Peoples Conference. In the same year he was elected to the Constituent Assembly.

He was never dropped, but did spend at least six matches away due to injuries including the whole 1953 seasons. He was one of the few Scottish players to escape untarnished by the 44-0 defeat by during the period. Elliot was the only Scot to be named by the South African rugby correspondent R.K. Stent amongst the best players who had faced the 1951-2 Springbok tour to the British Isles.McLaren (2005), p.76 Allan Massie talking of the 1950s, said: :\\"Elliot was my first Rugby hero, and for a long time in the Fifties, he was the only one a Scots boy could have... the Scottish sides he played in, especially in the Fifties, gave him little chance to display his attacking abilities. All the same, match reports of the time make frequent mention of Elliot bursting from the line-out to run thirty yards... He was undoubtedly the nearest thing to a forward in the classic All Black mould that Scotland produced in the twenty years after the war, for he was fast also, possessed all the basic skills, and breathed aggression. It was fitting that almost his last game for Scotland was against the All Blacks in 1954, when he captained the side that held the tourists to a single penalty goal.\\"Massie, pp. 185, 187 Bill McLaren remembers in 1947 going for a Scotland trial, and playing at the back of the line-out, :\\"the only time the ball was thrown anywhere near there and I got it I found myself enmeshed in a vice-like grip. The feeling was of two iron bands imprisoning my arms. The bands belonging to Douglas Elliot, one of the greatest Scottish wing-forwards, whose strength had been developed in his every-day life as a son of the soil. I was much impressed by the form of temporary paralysis he imposed on my arms and it did not surprise me that he remained Scotland's most capped wing-forward with 29 appearances until John Jeffrey gained his 30th cap in the second Test against the All Blacks in Auckland in June 1990.\\"McLaren (2005), p. 39 Farming career Elliot was invited to play with the British and Irish Lions, but could not afford to spend six months away from his farm; his offer to pay for his flights (the Lions generally went by boat in those days.) The amateur era was quite different, in both ethos and time, but as Elliot once told Bill McLaren, farmwork could take a lot of time too: :\\"prior to one Scottish game against at Murrayfield he had attended a brief Scottish team get-together on the Friday afternoon but, as his father was not well, Douglas drove back home to the family farm some way out of Edinburgh and the car ran out of petrol four miles from home. He ran all the way home for the petrol and back to the car, did some shearing and some other farmwork before dark, was up with the lark because a field drain had to be repaired which took two hours, then took off for Murrayfield to join the Scottish team just in time for kick-off. What is more, Scotland won!\\"McLaren (2005), p.149 McLaren says when selecting his all- time Scotland XV that \\"I believe, for instance, that Douglas Elliot (Edinburgh Academicals)... would still have made massive impact in the modern game although it might have irked him not a little that he would have to give far more of his time from farming to attend so many squad sessions.\\"McLaren (2005), pp.215-6 References ;Sources # Mclaren, Bill My Autobiography: The Voice of Rugby (2005) # Massie, Allan A Portrait of Scottish Rugby (Polygon, Edinburgh; ) Category:1923 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Midlothian Category:Rugby union flankers Category:Scottish rugby union players Category:Scotland international rugby union players Category:Edinburgh Academicals rugby union players Category:Barbarian F.C. players Category:Edinburgh District players Category:Scotland Probables players Category:Cities District players ","title":"Douglas Elliot"},{"id":"24641490","text":"Elections in South Ossetia gives information on elections and election results in South Ossetia.

Opened in 1913, the black colored bridge was the first bridge across the river at Corvallis and is now the third oldest bridge across the river. Owned by the state and maintained by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), the long span is of a through truss design and carries two lanes of traffic of Oregon Route 34 eastbound from Corvallis into neighboring Linn County. The bridge no longer is able to swing open. History About 1860 a ferry started crossing the Willamette River at Corvallis. Benton County legislators were able to secure approval to build a bridge at the site as early as 1889. Meanwhile, the county bought the ferry in 1902 and removed the crossing fee. Plans for the bridge across the river were created by Benton County in 1910, and in February 1911 the Oregon Legislature passed a bill that approved the plan to build the bridge. The county signed a contract with the Coast Bridge Company for the steel for a bridge in January 1912. Work began about June 1912 after a legal delay over funding was resolved, with Corvallis agreeing to pay a larger portion of the project. In November 1912, Corvallis residents passed a bond measure to allow for the city's portion of funding of the bridge. This vote was the first time women were allowed to vote in a Corvallis election. Construction was completed by the Coast Bridge Company on the project that would cost $70,000 to build. Andrew J. Porter was the designer of the span. Funds came from the city, Linn County, private donations, and the largest portion from Benton County. The span was completed in February 1913, with a dedication ceremony on March 11 attended by the mayors of Corvallis and Philomath, as well as the judges for Linn and Benton counties. Built as a vehicle crossing, the Oregon Electric Railway had tracks leading to the east side of the bridge shortly after the bridge opened. The road across the span was originally two-way, plus there was a sidewalk along the south side.The Van Buren Street Bridge. Benton County Historical Society. Sign in Riverfront Park, Corvallis, Oregon. On January 25, 1914, the span unexpectedly opened during a windstorm, and trapped a young man on the open swing span section until the bridge operators could row out to the center span and use the turn- key to put the span back into proper position. The state took over ownership of the span in 1938. In June 1952, the span was opened for the first time in 25 years to allow an Army Corps of Engineers vessel to pass, and the span opened for the final time in October 1960. In the 1980s the swivel became inoperable. The bridge was nominated for listing on the National Register of Historic Places about 2006. In March 2007, planned maintenance and re-painting began on the bridge, closing the bridge to traffic at times. The $2.5 million project was completed in October 2007. Replacement plans Entrance to the bridge from the west In the 1990s the Oregon Department of Transportation proposed options for replacing the bridge in order to alleviate traffic problems in downtown Corvallis. Funding was never secured and the project was dropped in 1993, but the plans were revived in 2004. Plans included options to move the existing structure to a park, leave it in place, and build a new span that could be located in a variety of locations along the river in downtown. These options were narrowed to two in 2006, one adding a bridge parallel to the existing bridge and the other building a curved bridge between the old span and the Harrison Street Bridge. The existing structure would have remained in-place under both options, and costs were estimated at around $18 million. If a new bridge were built, the state originally said they would no longer own and maintain the old bridge, which was proposed to be used for pedestrians and bicycles. Linn County's Board of Commissioners supported tearing down the old bridge and simply replace it with a new wider span. In June 2006, ODOT decided to keep the existing span in addition to the new bridge. Additional studies began in 2007 to determine which of the options for replacement would work best for fixing traffic issues across the river. Options now included adding a bypass north to connect with Oregon Route 99W. By May 2009, ODOT had two proposals, one of which would not build a new bridge near the existing span. Both options included adding a northern bypass that would connect to U.S. Route 20 and Oregon 99W. As of 2015 the plans for a new bridge had been set aside, with improvements to the south bypass and downtown exits for OR 34, OR 20, and 99 W intended to ease congestion instead. The future northern bypass is considered by planners to be a long term goal, as there is no schedule and none of the estimated $250 million cost has been budgeted. Details Western side of the bridge The bridge was the first bridge across the Willamette River at Corvallis. Carrying one lane of traffic eastbound, it connects Benton County on the west to Linn County on the east side of the Willamette. It carries Oregon Route 34 out of downtown Corvallis, with the Harrison Street Bridge to the north carrying OR 34 into downtown. The single lane creates traffic problems at the evening rush hour with three lanes of the highway narrowing to one lane to cross the bridge. A swing bridge, its main -span could swivel on its axis and open to allow river traffic to pass. This is accomplished by using a turn key placed into the turning bolt and rotating the bolt. Six people would rotate the key using a long wood rod that combined resemble a corkscrew. This would turn the wide gear that had 300 teeth along its circumference and the span would spin along 42 rollers constructed of steel. The operators could use two gears, one opened the span in 150 revolutions, while the other completed the job in 50 revolutions. When opened it provided of clearance on either side of the bridge. Van Buren Street Bridge is the last movable-span truss bridge constructed by the pin connection method located on the West Coast. Pins were used to connect the trusses, but the technique was abandoned after rivets came into usage. The bridge is also one of only two swing style bridges left in Oregon used for vehicle traffic, and is the third oldest bridge across the Willamette after the Steel and Hawthorne bridges in Portland. Overall, the bridge is long and is composed of three separate steel spans that rest on concrete piers. The swing span is a Pratt through truss, and the next longest part a long Parker through truss span on the western end. The eastern approach is a Warren pony truss that measures in length. There is also a long part on the far west end built of timber, which was originally a long steel pony truss. The bridge has of vertical clearance and is wide, which includes a sidewalk and a roadway.

Wrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to death, he was freed after almost two decades of hard labour at Scotland‚Äôs HM Prison Peterhead through the efforts of multiple journalists, lawyers, and writers, including Sherlock Holmes author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.Margalit Fox, \\"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and the Case of the Wrongfully Imprisoned Man\\", Medium, June 21, 2018.  Early life  He was born Oskar Josef Leschziner in Oppeln, Upper Silesia, Germany to a Jewish family. Around 1893, possibly to evade military service, he moved to London, where he purportedly worked as a bookmaker using various names, including Anderson, before settling on Slater for official purposes. He was prosecuted for alleged malicious wounding in 1896 and assault in 1897 but was acquitted in both cases.Leslie William Blake, 'Slater, Oscar Joseph (1872‚Äì1948)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 In 1899, Slater moved to Edinburgh and by 1901 was living in Glasgow. He was known to be a well-dressed dandy, who billed himself variously as a dentist and a dealer in precious stones, but was believed to earn his living as a gambler.

In December 1908, Marion Gilchrist, a spinster aged 83 years, was beaten to death in a robbery at West Princes Street, Glasgow, after her maid, Helen Lambie, had popped out for ten minutes.The Times, The Case Of Oscar Slater. Sir Herbert Stephen And The Evidence, 19 September 1912 Although she had jewellery worth ¬£3,000 (2015: ¬£) hidden in her wardrobe,The Times, \\"The Case of Oscar Slater,\\" 21 August 1912 the robber, who was disturbed by a neighbour, had rifled through Mrs. Gilchrist's personal papers and taken only a brooch. Slater left for New York five days after the murder and came under suspicion, as apparently before the murder, a caller to Gilchrist's house had been looking for someone called \\"Anderson\\", and Slater had coincidentally previously been seen trying to sell a pawn ticket for a brooch. The police soon realised that the pawn ticket was for an entirely different brooch and a false lead, but notwithstanding the contradictory evidence, still applied for Slater's extradition. While Slater was advised that the application would probably fail anyway, he voluntarily returned to Scotland to clear his name of the alleged crime.  Trial of Oscar Slater  At his trial presided over by Lord Charles John Guthrie, whose summing up was highly prejudicial, defence witnesses provided Slater with an alibi and confirmed that he had announced his trip to America long before the date of Mrs. Gilchrist's murder.The Times, Glasgow Murder Trial 6 May 1909 He was convicted by a majority of nine to six (five \\"not proven\\" and one \\"not guilty\\"). In May 1909, he was sentenced to death, with the execution to take place before the end of that month.The Times, Index 7 May 1909 However, Slater's lawyers organised a petition that was signed by 20,000 people, and the Secretary of State for Scotland, Lord Pentland, subsequently issued a conditional pardon and commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. Slater was to serve nineteen years at Peterhead Prison. The following year, the Scottish lawyer and amateur criminologist William Roughead published his Trial of Oscar Slater, highlighting flaws in the prosecution. The circumstantial evidence against Slater included his alleged \\"flight from justice\\". The prosecution's evidence and witnesses identifying Slater as a suspect, including maid Helen Lambie, were also criticized as fleeting and otherwise unreliable, prejudiced, tainted, or coached. In particular, Slater was conspicuously contrasted with nine off-duty policemen in a rigged identification parade. The Case of Oscar Slater Roughead's book convinced many of Slater's innocence; influential people included Sir Edward Marshall Hall; Ramsay MacDonald; (eventually) Viscount Buckmaster; and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In 1912, Conan Doyle published The Case of Oscar Slater, a plea for a full pardon for Slater. In 1914 Thomas MacKinnon Wood ordered a Private Inquiry into the case. A detective in the case, John Thomson Trench, provided information which had allegedly been deliberately concealed from the trial by the police. The Inquiry found that the conviction was sound, and instead, Trench was dismissed from the force and prosecuted on trumped-up charges from which he was eventually acquitted. Criminal Appeal (Scotland) Act 1927 1927 saw the publication of The Truth about Oscar Slater by William Park. The contents of the book led the Solicitor General for Scotland, Alexander Munro MacRobert, to conclude that it was no longer proven that Slater was guilty. An Act (17 & 18 Geo. V) was passed to extend the Jurisdiction of the then recently established Scottish Court of Criminal Appeal to convictions before the original shut-off date of 1926. Slater's conviction was quashed in July 1928 on the grounds that Lord Guthrie had failed to direct the jury about the irrelevance of allegations relating to Slater's previous character. After serving an almost two-decades long prison sentence of hard labour, Slater received only ¬£6,000 (2015: ¬£) in compensation. Aftermath Detective-Lieutenant Trench died in 1919, aged fifty, and never lived to see justice done. In the 1930s, Slater married a local Scottish woman of German descent thirty years his junior and settled in the seaside town of Ayr where he repaired and sold antiques. As an enemy alien (born German), Slater and his wife were interned for a brief time at the start of World War II, though Slater had long since lost his German citizenship and never returned to Germany. Most of Slater's surviving family, including his two sisters, ultimately died in the Holocaust. He died in Ayr in 1948 of natural causes. The lessons of the Slater miscarriage were considered, as late as 1976, by the Devlin Committee review on the limitations of identity parades. More recently, the Slater case has been revisited by several scholars and writers.

St. George's Church is a former parish church in Dublin, Ireland, designed by Francis Johnston, which is considered to be one of his finest works. It is located at Hardwicke Place, just north of the city centre, though when it was opened this was considered to be in Drumcondra.Gilbert, 1854. The elegant spire, high, became a landmark of the north inner city.Wright, Chapter 10. The building Early history Construction of the \\"New St. George's church, Drumcondra\\", at the end of Temple Street, Dublin (the street so named after the church) commenced in 1802 by the Church of Ireland for the parish of St. George, which had been established in 1793. There had been an \\"Old St. George's church, Drumcondra\\", in nearby Hill Street (the called Lower Temple Street) erected by Sir John Eccles.The Irish Times 28 Dec. 1898, p.6; The Irish Times 26 Nov. 1894, p.3; Gilbert Library: Dublin Corporation Reports 1892 Vol.I, p.370 & 1892 Vol.II, pp.421-2, 505; Ordnance Survey of Ireland / Government of Ireland 25 inch map of 1906-9 (St. George's Chapel & remains of disused graveyard, Hill St.) The Eccles family were patrons of the \\"new church\\". Another \\"Drumcondra Church\\" is the St. John the Baptist Church, in Church Street, Dublin. The original site acquired for the new church (donated by Luke Gardiner, 1st Viscount Mountjoy) was on Whitworth Road, but then the present site was selected, which at the time was open fields. A temporary chapel was built on the Whitworth Road site and the churchyard was retained when St. George's was completed - this site was later taken over by the Whitworth Hospital (later named Drumcondra Hospital). The Greek inscription on the portico, ŒîŒüŒûŒë ŒïŒù Œ•Œ®ŒôŒ£Œ§ŒüŒôŒ£ ŒòŒïŒ©, translates to 'Glory to God in the Highest'. It was a 'free church', within the Established Church, where no pew rents were paid and it survived on voluntary subscriptions. Twenty-two years after the church was built, problems developed when the wide roof began to splay further than it should, due to the strain of the wide-span timber trusses. Civil engineer Robert Mallet, whose father ran an iron foundry in Dublin, created cast-iron trusses to haul the church back into shape. Late history In the 1980s scaffolding had to be erected around the spire because the Portland stone was cracking due to expansion of the iron cramps that held it in place. The Church of Ireland, having tried in vain to raise funds for the restoration of the church, sold the building in 1991 to an actor, Mr Sean Simon, who had plans to turn it into a theatre.Irish Independent 14 May 2002. After its deconsecration, the bells (which Leopold Bloom heard ringing in Ulysses) were removed to Taney Parish church in Dundrum, while the ornate pulpit was carved up to decorate Thomas Read's pub in Parliament Street. After deconsecration The church in Temple Street then became the Temple Theatre, then a night-club, but further attempts were made to raise public funds for its restoration; first, in 1991, to celebrate Dublin's role as European City of Culture, and later from the Millennium Committee. In 2004 the building found a new purchaser who oversaw extensive restoration and renovation to provide office facilities. The parish Shortly after the construction of the church, in 1813, the population of the parish was 5,322 males and 7,690 females (these included Roman Catholics as well as Protestants).Government figures quoted in: An early Rector of St George's parish was Revd William Bushe, who, in 1823, invited Roman Catholics who were resident in the parish to discuss matters of faith. The church was filled for his series of evangelical Wednesday evening lectures which discussed the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. Rev. Charles Henry Minchin also served in the Church. Rev. Samuel Eccles was also a chaplain to the church. Rev. Cecil Faull also served the church as a curate, and then as Rector from 1971 until 1980.Who Will Save St George‚Äôs Rev. Faull, speaking in RTE in 1978, RTE Archives. The St. George's Widows home was connected to the Church as was the St. Georges Dispensary on Dispensary Lane, off Lower Dorset Street, with the priests of the parish and laypeople as trustees of the Dispensary. Early 20th century view of the church at the end of Hardwicke Street In the 20th century the parish grew steadily and was in the 1950s the largest in the Republic. At the time it was served by three other churches: St. Aidan's (Drumcondra Road Lwr and Dargle Road, Iron building from 1881, a new building designed by Richard Francis Caulfield Orpen CHURCH OF ST AIDAN (CI Richard Francis Caufield Orpen, Dictionary of Irish Architects. was consecrated in 1902, demolished in 1963), Dublin Female Penitentiary (St. Augustine's) on Berkely RoadSt. George's Parish Dublin www.libraryireland.com and the Free Church (Great Charles Street), in addition to the parish church. In 1936 the St. George's Brass Band was founded in the Church.St. Georges Brass Band Dublin www.hooley.ieSt. Georges Brass Band Website The Church of St. Thomas opened in Cathal Brugha Street in 1931, in 1966 St. Georges merged with the parish of St. Thomas's.In 1990 St. George's closed, and it became the parish church of St. George and St. Thomas. Civil parish The parish corresponded with the civil parish of the same name.Civil parishes. Notable parishioners In 1806, Sir Arthur Wellesley, famous a few years later as the Duke of Wellington, married Catherine Pakenham, daughter of the Earl of Longford, in the temporary chapel built on Whitworth Road. In 1812 the scientist Richard Kirwan was buried in the church. Roger Casement's mother, Anne, was baptised there on 16 September 1832 as was her sister Grace in 1841. The architect, Francis Johnston (architect), lived in nearby Eccles Street. In his garden he had built a Gothic church tower, whose bell he enjoyed ringing, but his neighbours persuaded him in 1828 to donate the bell to the new church he had designed. He was buried in St. George's churchyard, which was attached to the temporary chapel on Whitworth Road.Townley Hall history. - page 5 John Sullivan SJ who lived on Eccles Street, was baptised in St. Georges's later in life he converted to Catholicism and became a Jesuit. Percy Edwin Ludgate 1883‚Äì1922, notable as the second person to publish (in 1909) a design for an Analytical Engine, after Babbage, and who hence some consider a genuine Irish computer hero, attended St. George's Church.

Personal history Leake was born in Ceylon in 1865 to William Martin-Leake and Louisa Harriet Tennant. William was a civil engineer who was employed in Ceylon, but later became a coffee- planter. Louisa was the daughter of Col. Sir James Tennant of the Bengal Artillery. Leake was educated in Britain, at Clifton College\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p55: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 and Dulwich College, before matriculating to Selwyn College, Cambridge in 1885. He received his BA in 1888 and from 1889 to 1909 he was Assistant Master at his old school, Dulwich College. In 1909 he was ordained as a deacon, and then ordained as a priest in 1910 at Southwark Cathedral. From 1909 he held two positions at Dulwich, Assistant Chaplain of the College and Head of Dulwich Preparatory School. Leake held both posts until his retirement in 1937, but after portions of the school were unable to be evacuated owing to the air-raids of World War II, he returned to take charge of part of the school. His son Major Stephen Philip Martin-Leake died in Albania in WW2.CWGC: Stephen Philip Martin-Leake Leake was also a published writer, compiling a history of Arthur Herman Gilkes, a headmaster of Dulwich College; the book is titled Gilkes and Dulwich, 1885‚Äì1914: A Study of a Great Headmaster (1928). Rugby career Leake first came to note as a rugby player when he captained Dulwich College rugby team in 1883‚Äì1884; he was also captain of the college cricket team in 1884.Dulwich College, Sport dulwich.org.uk When Leake matriculated to Selwyn College he then represented Cambridge University. Leake won three sporting 'Blues' at University in 1885, 1886 and 1887, all awarded for rugby for playing in the Varsity Match. Cambridge won all three matches during this period, and although Leake did not score in any of the games he played well, especially in 1886 and 1887, setting up a late try in the 1887 game. On leaving Cambridge, Leake continued to play rugby and joined Harlequins. In 1890 while representing Harlequins, Leake was approached by William Percy Carpmael to join his newly formed invitational touring team, the Barbarians. Leake accepted and became a founding member of the club. Leake gained his first international cap during the 1891 Home Nations Championship, an away game to Wales at Rodney Parade. Leake had an excellent debut, setting up Christopherson's first try after eluding his Welsh counterpart Hugh Ingledew. England won 7‚Äì3, and Leake was rewarded for his confident start with selection for the next two games of the tournament. Leake, partnered at half back with John Berry, was part of a winning England team in the second game, against Ireland, but England lost to Scotland in the Championship decider. The next season, the English selectors chose the Bradford pairing of Emmott and Briggs at half back, and Leake never represented his county again. Leake is mentioned briefly in Hugh de Selincourt's fictional book Relams of Day; Selincourt would have been familiar with Leake as a past pupil of Dulwich College, a few years behind Leake.

The BK Whopper Bar is a limited service concept created by fast-food restaurant Burger King in 2009.  Format  The Whopper Bar is a high end concept designed to compete with fast casual and casual dining restaurants. The locations feature an open kitchen with a semi- circular metal counter top. The exposed kitchen allows customers to view the preparation of their foods. Decoration of the new locations is limited to plasma televisions playing looped videos of open flames. The concept is similar to the McCafe concept from rival McDonald's, and like the McCafe locations they are designed for malls, airports, casinos and other areas with limited space.  Menu  Whopper Bars are kiosk-type stores with a menu limited to the company's Whopper, TenderCrisp and Angus sandwiches; drinks; and desserts. The menu features higher-end ingredients and variants not sold in the normal Burger King locations. While international locations sold beer at the Whopper Bar locations, the company originally stated that it did not intend to do so at its North American locations. The company changed its mind with the opening of its second Whopper Bar location in the South Beach section of the company's home town of Miami; Burger King reported that it would be the only current American, national fast food chain selling beer in its home territory. In markets where alcohol can be sold at fast food restaurants, the company will be selling products from SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch including Budweiser, Bud Light and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed to target the important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because the company is known as a fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that the move is a practical one because the company is growing with its aging customer base.

A student of Giovanni Giordani, Frida de Reya, and Alice Psaconopulo, Batich first began exhibiting her artwork in the 1960s. She has contributed to several collective shows in Italy as well as internationally in New York, Salzburg, Udine and Dalmatia. She has, since 1993, devoted herself to the development of formal and existential content, the common thread that is the basis of her artistic search. She represents the capture of a moment in space and time that is projected in an abstract dimension. With wide brushstrokes and dense colour, she creates unreal places and uses both bright and more sober shades to, depending on their density, reproduce movement or fixed contemplation. In this special world, the artist has recently introduced \\"theatres\\"‚Äîscenes populated by \\"emancipated puppets\\" assembled in chaotic balance whose strings maintain their geometric autonomy. Her works have been associated with and inspired poems by such Italian major poets as Eugenio Montale,Alessandro Mezzena Lona Un viaggio nell'arte di Franca Batich inseguendo il vento, Il Piccolo, 28-11-2008. and Umberto SabaOmaggio a Umberto Saba, Il Piccolo, 2007.

The duke, who was ten years older than Charles,Massie writes \\"ten years older\\", which obviously is a mistake. was even wilder than the young king and incited the latter to outrageous acts. Together with a following of young people they galloped through Stockholm, yanking hats and wigs off people's heads. They threw out furniture from the palace windows and cherry pits at the king's ministers. Many of the stories about their doings were exaggerated and are thought to have been spread to discredit the duke. For instance, there is no proof to the story that they chopped the heads off calves, dogs, goats, and sheep, whereafter they were said to have thrown the carcasses through the palace windows. According to this story, the floors in the palace were slippery with blood running down the palace staircases. Popular discontentment grew with the king's and duke's excesses. One Sunday three pastors in Stockholm churches held sermons with the theme Woe thee, o land, when thy king is a child (). When Frederick returned home in August, Charles ceased his antics and returned to the business of government. He had a relapse when Frederick returned to Stockholm in 1699. During one drunken night a bear was killed when it fell through a window to the palace yard after having been forced to drink wine. Charles was quite drunk, and after this incident vowed never to drink strong alcohol again. He famously kept the vow, with a few exceptions, to the end of his days.

Two of her films of the 1990s ‚Äì Chronique d'une banlieue ordinaire and Une poste √† la Courneuve ‚Äì brought Cabrera early recognition. After reading one of her scripts at a screenwriting competition in 1990, producer Didier Haudepin recognized Cabrera as an emerging talent. His support led to the production of her first feature film, L'autre c√¥t√© de la mer, six years later. Work Political engagement spans Cabrera's diverse filmography, which includes documentaries, fiction works, and films combining the two genres. According to some critics, Cabrera does not make moral or ideological judgments about her characters or documentary subjects. Rather, she infuses her images with lyricism, love, and a sense of wonder, leaving judgment up to the viewer. Her fiction work deals with issues of family, motherhood, cultural assimilation, and national heritage. Cabrera's own pied-noir origins inform her interest in issues of assimilation and in the history between France and the Maghreb. Themes of utopia, doubt, and discouragement also recur across her work. Cabrera's first feature-length work of fiction, L'autre c√¥t√© de la mer, addresses questions of assimilation in contemporary French society. A wealthy French pied-noir travels to Paris for a cataract operation. The doctor who performs his surgery is Algerian-born but has lived in France since childhood. Through intimate depictions of these two characters and interactions with their families, Cabrera articulates enduring consequences of Algeria's 1962 struggle for independence. The film screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Cabrera made her second feature film, Nadia et les hippopotames, in 1999. Arte broadcast an edited version of the film with the title Retiens la nuit. The film combined documentary elements within a larger fictional framework. Much of the film, which takes place during the SNCF's 1995 general strikes, records actual railroad workers at night and in winter. Cabrera's filmic diary, Demain et encore demain, Journal 1995 (Tomorrow and Tomorrow Again), which premiered at the Berlinale, was one of the first features shot on video to see a theatrical release in France. The autobiographical film, made in 1995, alternately depicts the anguish and delight of its creator. Exploring the documentary as a therapeutic process, Cabrera inserts herself into the fabric of the film. Each of her various identities ‚Äì woman, mother, daughter, sister, lover ‚Äì informs a growing definition of what it means to be a filmmaker. This film represents a turning point in Cabrera's career. Between Demain et encore demain in 1998 and her second autobiographical film Grandir, which screened at ACID Cannes in 2013, all of her feature-length work was fictional. Folle Embellie in 2004 represents a venture into period fiction; the film is set in June 1940 amid Axis bombing campaigns. Against this backdrop Cabrera evokes a fairy tale about the refuge the natural world offers to the escapees of an asylum. The film features Jean-Pierre L√©aud and is based on a story Cabrera heard when she worked in a psychiatric hospital in the 1970s. Le Lait de la Tendresse Humaine is Cabrera's film that most explicitly addresses issues of motherhood. Marilyne Canto plays a victim of postpartum depression, who leaves her family without notice and hides in a neighbor's apartment. Critics praised the film for its use of color, its compassion for its characters, and its frank portrayal of a mother's struggle. Quand la ville mord was Cabrera's first literary adaptation; its plot comes from a novel by Marc Villard which was part of the \\"S√©rie Noire\\" crime fiction collection. Cabrera produced the film for the television station, France 2. The film was praised for its realistic depiction of a young African woman's forced sex work, for which Cabrera and the film's lead, A√Øssa Ma√Øga, met with former sex workers in Paris. Certain actors, such as Marilyne Canto, Yolande Moreau, Olivier Gourmet, and Ariane Ascaride, each appear in more than one of Cabrera's films. Sometimes she works with more famous actors, such as Patrick Bruel and Miou- Miou. Cabrera suggests that these actors' inclusion in her work subliminally recalls roles they played in previous films . She has consistently worked with the same crew since the 1980s, including her director of photography, H√©l√®ne Louvart. Cabrera has also acted in three films: Un petit cas de conscience by Marie Claude Treilhou, Douches froides by Antony Cordier, and Belleville-Tokyo by Elise Girard. Her films have received significant critical acclaim, a C√©sar nomination, and two nominations at the Cannes Film Festival.

The film tells the story of a deranged German surgeon who kidnaps three tourists and joins them surgically, mouth to anus, forming a \\"human centipede\\". It stars Dieter Laser as the creator of the centipede, Josef Heiter, with Ashley C. Williams, Ashlynn Yennie and Akihiro Kitamura as his victims. According to Six, the concept arose from a joke he made with friends about punishing a child molester by stitching his mouth to the anus of a \\"fat truck driver\\". Inspiration also came from Nazi medical experiments carried out during World War II, such as the crimes of Josef Mengele at the Auschwitz concentration camp. When approaching investors prior to filming, Six did not mention the mouth-to-anus aspect of the plot, fearing it would put off potential backers. Financiers did not discover the full nature of the film until completion. The film received generally mixed reviews from film critics, but it won several accolades at international film festivals. The film received a limited theatrical release in the United States on 30 April 2010. Two sequels, titled Full Sequence and Final Sequence, also written and directed by Six, were released in 2011 and 2015, respectively. The entire trilogy was compiled into a single film in 2016, titled Complete Sequence, which Six described as a \\"movie centipede\\" due to each Sequence leading into its successor while simultaneously working as a separate standalone film. Plot Lindsay (Ashley C. Williams) and Jenny (Ashlynn Yennie), two American tourists in Germany, are drugged and involuntarily detained by crazed surgeon Josef Heiter (Dieter Laser) when they seek help at his house after they get a flat tire. The women awake in a makeshift medical ward. They witness Heiter kill a kidnapped truck driver after Heiter informs him he is \\"not a match\\". Heiter secures a new male captive, Japanese tourist Katsuro (Akihiro Kitamura). The doctor explains that he is a world-renowned expert at separating Siamese twins, but dreams of making new creatures by sewing people together. He describes in detail how he will surgically connect his three victims mouth-to-anus, so that they share a single digestive system. After Lindsay tries to escape and fails, Heiter decides to make her the middle part of the centipede, the most painful position. Heiter performs the surgery, placing Katsuro at the lead, Lindsay at the middle and Jenny at the rear. He removes the front teeth of both women and mutilates the buttocks of Katsuro and Lindsay to provide access to the rectums, to which he grafts their mouths. He severs the ligaments of his victims' knees to prevent leg extension, forcing his victims to crawl. Each victim in the centipede is half-naked, where Katsuro and Lindsay are provided bottoms covered in bandages for healing purposes while Jenny is provided with underwear. All three segments‚Äô knees are bandaged for healing and for them to be able to crawl. Lindsay and Jenny are fastened with a strip of bandage to the buttocks of Katsuro and Lindsay respectively, fastening their heads to the anus of the person in front of them. Once the operation is complete, Heiter is delighted with his creation and takes the centipede to his living room to wake each segment of the centipede up, takes photos of each of them, and even passes a mirror around for the segments of the centipede to marvel at their new form. Heiter attempts to train his centipede as a pet by caging the centipede in a dog kennel, letting Katsuro eat dog food at dinner, and often belittling Katsuro with racist insults and beating him with a crop when he becomes rebellious. When Katsuro defecates, Lindsay is forced to swallow his excrement while the doctor watches in delight. However, he eventually becomes irritated after being kept awake by the constant screaming of a caged Katsuro (who, as the front part of the centipede, has his mouth free and is still able to speak) and by the constant moaning of the women. When the centipede attempted to escape when Heiter was swimming and fails, all three segments of the centipede are beaten with the crop. Heiter is displeased with the realization that Lindsay is constipated and Jenny is dying from sepsis during a checkup. When two detectives, Kranz (Andreas Leupold) and Voller (Peter Blankenstein), visit the house to investigate the disappearance of the tourists, Heiter comes up with an idea to add them as replacements for Jenny in a new creation; a four- segment centipede. He offers the two detectives water spiked with sedatives in hopes of knocking the two unconscious. After being given the water, the detectives become suspicious and obtain a search warrant for his home. When the detectives leave Heiter's home, the victims attempt to escape. Katsuro attacks Heiter in the process. Their attempt to escape ultimately fails. Katsuro confesses to the doctor that he deserves his fate because he had treated his own family poorly, then takes his own life by slitting his throat with a glass shard. Upon returning to Heiter's home, the detectives forcefully conduct separate searches as Heiter, injured, hides near his swimming pool. Kranz finds the ward along with Heiter's victims. Voller begins to feel ill from the earlier drugging, and Heiter stabs him with the scalpel pulled from his leg during Katsuro's attack. Upon finding Voller dead, Kranz is shot by Heiter with Voller's sidearm. Kranz responds by shooting Heiter in the head before dying. Back in the house, Jenny and Lindsay hold hands as Jenny dies. Lindsay sobs as she is left alone in the house, trapped between her deceased fellow captives. Her fate is left unknown. The film ends with the sounds of her sobbing while the camera pans to the roof of the house. Cast alt=The heads and upper bodies of three people side by side, posing for the camera smiling.

Casting for the role of Heiter took place in Berlin, and Six intended to cast Laser before he had even read for the part, after Six saw a DVD of one of Laser's previous films. Laser had previously appeared in over 60 mostly German-language films,Jason Solomons. (19 August 2010). \\"Film Weekly hooks up with The Human Centipede and experiences Pianomania\\". The Guardian. Guardian Media Group. Event occurs at 7:15‚Äì7:20. Retrieved 8 September 2010. including Der Unhold and Baltic Storm (he speaks German in parts of First Sequence as well). Upon meeting him in Berlin, Six gave Laser a shot-by-shot explanation of Heiter's scenes, and Laser, impressed by Six's dedication and passion, agreed to take part in the film. Laser contributed considerably to the development of Heiter's character. For example, because Heiter views the \\"centipede\\" as his pet, Laser felt that it was important that Heiter appear naked during a scene in which he swam in full view of his victims, because Laser said \\"you aren't ashamed to be naked\\" around a pet.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 56:50‚Äì57:05 * Ashley C. Williams as Lindsay, an American tourist, a friend of Jenny's, and the central section of the centipede. Auditioning for the roles of Jenny and Lindsay took place in New York City. Six said during the auditioning process, many actresses walked out of readings in disgust after hearing the full nature of the role.Berge Garabedian.

Others thought they would be able to take on the role, but found it was \\"too much\\" for them once they got onto their hands and knees behind another actor. Williams expressed concern about the nudity expected of her in the film, but took the role when she was assured it would be modest and of a non-sexual nature. * Ashlynn Yennie as Jenny, an American tourist, a friend of Lindsay's, and the rear section of the centipede. As with Williams, The Human Centipede was Yennie's first major film role. Yennie was one of several actresses to audition for the role, as the producers searched for an actress who would have good on-screen chemistry with Williams. Yennie was able to further develop her relationship with Williams when the pair shared an apartment in the Netherlands during filming.Stuart O'Connor. (1 September 2009). \\"FrightFest Interview ‚Äì The Human Centipede\\" . Screenjabber. Screenjabber.com. Event occurs at 1:55‚Äì2:30. Retrieved 28 March 2011. Yennie auditioned to Ilona Six, the film's producer and sister of Tom Six, and did not meet Tom Six, who had viewed tapes of her reading, until fitting for the centipede special effects in the Netherlands. Yennie was drawn to the role by the humanity throughout the story, referring to how the three victims of Heiter are unwillingly forced into their situation. She also said the story was so realistic it scared her.Stuart O'Connor, FrightFest Interview, 1:30‚Äì1:55 * Akihiro Kitamura as Katsuro, a Japanese tourist and front section of the centipede. Having already acted in or written for a number of films and television shows (including popular American television series Heroes), Kitamura was a relatively experienced actor compared to other cast members. He auditioned for the role of Katsuro via Skype from Los Angeles after the casting director saw him on television and recommended him for the role. The rest of the cast did not meet Kitamura until the day before shooting commenced. * Rene de Wit as Truck Driver, one of Heiter's victims. De Wit had previously worked with Six in his 2008 film I Love Dries.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 2:15‚Äì2:21 * Andreas Leupold as Detective Kranz, a police officer. * Peter Blankenstein as Detective Voller, a police officer. Production Writing The inspiration for the film's plot came from a joke that writer/director Tom Six once made to his friends about punishing a child molester they saw on TV by stitching his mouth to the anus of an overweight truck driver. Six saw this as the concept for a great horror film, and he began to develop the idea.Berge Garabedian, Sitges 09 Interview, 0:25‚Äì0:47 He has said he was heavily influenced as a filmmaker by the early works of David Cronenberg and Japanese horror films.Brad Miska. (29 April 2010). \\"Tom Six Answers Your Questions About 'The Human Centipede'\\". Bloody Disgusting. The Collective. Event occurs at 7:30‚Äì7:55. Retrieved 8 May 2010. Six has said he prefers horror films that are more realistic over \\"unbelievable\\" monster films, and that he gets \\"a rash from too much political correctness.\\" A major influence for The Human Centipede was Pier Paolo Pasolini's controversial 1975 Italian drama film Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom, which was notable for its scenes depicting intensely graphic violence, sadism, and sexual depravity, as was the work of Japanese director Takashi Miike. Six has also expressed his love of the works of David Lynch.Jason Solomons, Film Weekly... 9:05‚Äì9:15 Further inspiration came from Six's previous role as a director on the Dutch series of Big Brother, where he had been able to observe people who \\"did crazy things when they were alone and thought they were not (being) watched.\\"Jason Solomons, Film Weekly... 6:06‚Äì7:00 Six has stated that The Human Centipede is, to an extent, a reflection on fascism. Dieter Laser, who played the antagonist Dr Heiter, said during the promotion of the film that he felt the guilt of Nazi actions during the war had haunted ordinary Germans for generations, and that as a German whose father participated in the war, he often felt \\"like a child whose father is in jail for murder.\\" The inclusion of a German villain came from this, with Six citing both the German invasion of the Netherlands during World War II and the Nazi medical experiments as inspiration.Berge Garabedian, Sitges 09 Interview, 1:00‚Äì1:23 Laser stated in an interview with Clark Collis for Entertainment Weekly that he considered the film a \\"grotesque [parody] about the Nazi psyche\\". Heiter's name was an amalgamation of several Nazi war criminals, his surname (literally meaning \\"cheerful\\" in German) a combination of the names of Nazi doctors Fetter and Richter, and his first name coming from Josef Mengele, who carried out experiments on prisoners at the Auschwitz concentration camp.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 27:15‚Äì27:37 World War II also played an influence on the nationality of the other main characters who were American and Japanese.Stuart O'Connor, FrightFest Interview, 0:30‚Äì1:15 Six includes many horror film clich√©s in the first act, such as a broken-down car, lack of phone signalJason Solomons, Film Weekly... 4:15‚Äì4:40 and very na√Øve victims. Six did this in an attempt to lull audiences into thinking they are watching a conventional horror film, therefore making Dr Heiter's treatment of his victims more shocking.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 5:30‚Äì6:08 Six placed a Japanese male at the front of the centipede to create a language barrier between the doctor and the centipede. Throughout the film the characters (with the exception of Heiter who for the most part speaks to the centipede in English) speak in their native languages only (subtitled for the viewer into English where necessary). Katsuro, as the front part of the centipede, can only speak Japanese and therefore cannot speak with either the doctor or Jenny and Lindsay. Secondly, Katsuro's position in the centipede sets up the opportunity for the doctor and the male victim of the centipede to fight toward the climax of the film.Brad Miska, Tom Six Answers Your Questions, 9:17‚Äì9:36 Six stated in the director's commentary for The Human Centipede that he has a personal fear of hospitals and doctors, so he stretched out the scene where Heiter explains how he will create the centipede and the subsequent procedure to create his \\"own nightmare.\\"Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 30:32‚Äì30:53 While seeking funding for the film, Six pitched the idea of a surgeon who sewed people together.Brad Miska, Tom Six Answers Your Questions, 1:20‚Äì1:48 He did not initially reveal that the victims would be joined mouth-to-anus, as he believed this idea would stand no chance of receiving investments.Berge Garabedian, Sitges 09 Interview, 1:55‚Äì2:01 His backers felt that the idea of a surgeon sewing people together was original and Six received funding. However, they did not learn the exact details of the film until it had been completed. Six claimed that they were very happy with the finished film.Berge Garabedian, Sitges 09 Interview, 2:00‚Äì2:10 Before signing on, the actors were given an outline of the storyboard rather than a complete script. They were also shown sketches of how the centipede would be formed. Filming Although The Human Centipede is set in Germany, principal photography took place in the Netherlands due to the neighbouring countries' similar landscapes.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 0:45‚Äì0:53 Heiter's home, where most of The Human Centipede takes place, was a villa in the Netherlands found by the production team. The property was in a residential area and not surrounded by woodland as it appears in the film, but by other houses. This meant the filmmakers had some difficulty ensuring that the other houses did not appear in shot.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 12:03‚Äì12:24 Some conversion of the property took place prior to filming, such as a cinema room which was converted to form Heiter's basement operating theatre,Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 17:50‚Äì18:15 with real hospital beds and intravenous drips rented from a local hospital.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 21:40‚Äì21:48 The paintings of conjoined twins that were displayed throughout the house were painted by Tom Six, which he felt contributed to the atmosphere in the house.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 15:10‚Äì15:43 The hotel room scene near the beginning of the film was filmed in a hotel suite at a location near Amsterdam.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 3:30‚Äì3:40 The film was shot almost entirely in sequence, which Yennie stated helped the actors to develop their characters throughout the film. The opening scene, which only featured Laser and de Wit, was shot on the last day of filming.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 2:29‚Äì2:35 Laser remained in character as Heiter throughout the filming process, often shouting at the rest of the cast on set, and wherever possible staying away from the other actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation.Dan Persons.

He only ate food he had brought onto the set himself,Dan Persons, Mighty Movie Podcast, 11:50‚Äì11:55 eating mostly fruit. He contributed dialogue for his character and selected many of his character's outfits from his personal wardrobe.Dan Persons, Mighty Movie Podcast, 12:45‚Äì13:10 Six claims that the jacket Heiter wore, which was bought by Laser, was a genuine jacket worn by real Nazi doctors.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 26:40‚Äì26:48 Laser was also happy for the other actors in The Human Centipede to add their own ideas to the film. For example, when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser. During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the centipede eats dog food from the floor alongside him.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 53:15‚Äì53:48 Laser also unintentionally hurt Williams during the scene where Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a pause in shooting.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 20:09‚Äì20:27 The Nazi influence behind Heiter led to the use of classical music when the doctor is \\"training\\" his centipede. The music was deliberately played at low quality to simulate the music coming from a loudspeaker, in much the same way as music was sometimes played in Nazi concentration camps.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 51:20‚Äì51:41 Many of the sound effects in The Human Centipede were created by manipulating meat. For example, the sound of a nose being broken was made by snapping bones within cuts of raw meat. Due to the discomfort of spending long periods on their hands and knees, the actors playing the centipede were given massages at the end of each day of filming.Dan Persons, Mighty Movie Podcast, 15:30‚Äì15:40 Yennie stated that she and Williams experienced jaw pain from holding a bit in their mouths during filming, but overall she did not feel that the physical side of filming had been excessively difficult.Stuart O'Connor, FrightFest Interview, 2:33‚Äì2:53 Effects Heiter attempts to \\"train\\" his completed human centipede. The use of bandages in The Human Centipede allowed the filmmakers to imply a more graphic and disturbing idea than is actually shown on screen.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 32:15‚Äì32:23 The Human Centipede contains relatively few gory images; little of the surgical procedure is depicted directly, no excrement is shown on screen, and according to Kim Newman in Empire, it is \\"never quite as outrageous as it threatens to be.\\" Six stated that he wanted the film to be as authentic as possible and claimed to have consulted a Dutch surgeon during the creation and filming process, resulting in the film being \\"100% medically accurate.\\" Six said that the surgeon initially wanted nothing to do with his film, as he felt Six was \\"crazy\\" and the idea had \\"nothing to do with medical science.\\" However, the surgeon changed his mind and decided that he liked the idea, and so came up with a method of creating a human centipede.Brad Miska, Tom Six Answers Your Questions, 2:30‚Äì3:00 Six has claimed that the central and rear members of the centipede could survive for years by supplementing their diet with an IV drip. The special effects team was led by Rob and Erik Hillenbrink, father and son. They designed the final composition of the centipede from sketches provided by the consulting surgeon.Dan Persons, Mighty Movie Podcast, 6:30‚Äì8:30 The actors who made up the centipede wore hardened underwear, compared by Yennie to shorts,SeanD.

Six kept secret how the centipede would be formed as long as possible, and Yennie claimed that even her make-up artist did not know, asking Yennie what kind of \\"suit\\" the actors would be wearing. When Heiter is operating on his victims, Jenny's teeth were digitally removed in post-production.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 43:36‚Äì43:47 However, other effects were relatively simple to create. Heiter's \\"three dog\\" was created by digitally editing an image of three Rottweilers to create an image of dogs joined together.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 1:38‚Äì1:50 Colour grading was used extensively throughout the production of The Human Centipede. For example, at the end of the film when Lindsay is left between the dead bodies of Jenny and Katsuro, their skin tones were lightened to further emphasise that they were dead and Lindsay was still alive.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 1.25:16‚Äì1.25:25 The rain when Jenny and Lindsay's car breaks down was added digitally in post-production.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 5:15‚Äì5:25 The filmmakers had not been granted permission to film at the roadside location, but went ahead against the authorities' wishes as Six felt the location in the woods was ideal for the scene.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 4:40‚Äì5:01 When Heiter's window is repaired after Lindsay's escape attempt, the use of a tracking shot through the window pane required the reflection of the crew to be digitally removed from the glass.Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 45:30‚Äì45:48 The film contains a large number of long tracking shots;Tom Six, Director's Commentary, 0:54‚Äì0:59 Six has cited the influence of Takashi Miike who also uses many tracking shots in his films. Release Promotion During promotion for The Human Centipede, press materials claimed that the film was \\"100% medically accurate\\". Six and the producers frequently stated that the film had been described as \\"the most horrific film ever made,\\" and many writers, such as Karina Longworth of LA Weekly magazine and Jay Stone of the Calgary Herald, described the film as torture porn. Roger Ebert, writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, stated that he felt the film had been \\"deliberately intended to inspire incredulity, nausea and hopefully outrage.\\" However, writing in The Guardian, David Cox noted that he had been unable to trace the source of this quote as the \\"most horrific film ever made\\" and had contacted Six to attempt to ascertain the origin of the judgement. Six claimed that the statement had originally been made by The Sun newspaper in the United Kingdom. However, Cox was unable to trace any article making this claim. When asked by Cox as to what Six regarded as the \\"most horrific\\" film, Six stated he in fact believed it to be Pier Paolo Pasolini's Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom. Theatrical The Human Centipede was released in the United States without an MPAA rating. It was released theatrically in New York City on 30 April 2010 and had a limited release in the US shortly afterward, distributed by IFC Films. Throughout 2009, the film was included in several film festivals around the world including the London FrightFest Film Festival, Leeds International Film Festival, Sitges Film Festival, and Screamfest Horror Film Festival. Six remarked on how many film festival audiences reacted strongly to the film, sometimes almost vomiting in the cinema aisles. To Six's amusement, Spanish audiences often found the film funny, and laughed throughout screenings.Berge Garabedian, Sitges 09 Interview, 3:55‚Äì4:30 Six claimed that the \\"buzz\\"Berge Garabedian, Sitges 09 Interview, 4:35‚Äì4:50 surrounding the film led to several studios approaching him to discuss its distribution.

Reception Critical response The Human Centipede received mixed reviews. Review aggregator web site Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 50% approval rating based on 94 reviews, with an average rating of 5.15/10; the general consensus states: \\"Grotesque, visceral and hard to (ahem) swallow, this surgical horror doesn't quite earn its stripes because the gross-outs overwhelm and devalue everything else.\\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 33, based on 15 reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Giving the film three stars out of five, Empire writer Kim Newman stated that \\"underneath an extremely repulsive concept, this is a relatively conventional horror movie.\\" Variety Magazine writer Peter DeBurge criticised the film's lack of social commentary, stating that it could not \\"be bothered to expand upon its unpleasant premise, inviting audiences to revel in its sick humor by favoring Dr. Heiter ... and characterizing the victims as shallow expendables.\\" Writing in Entertainment Weekly, Clark Collis was broadly positive about Dieter Laser's performance as the Doctor, and praised Six's direction, saying Six \\"has put together his nightmare yarn with Cronenbergian care and precision.\\" Collis said The Human Centipede was \\"without question one of the most disgusting horror films ever made.\\" Writing in The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw gave the film three out of five, saying that, whilst \\"entirely deplorable and revolting,\\" the film was \\"sort of brilliant\\". Total Film writer Jamie Russell gave the film four stars out of five, calling it \\"Shocking, funny, disturbing... a throwback to the glory days of Cronenberg.\\" Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph was generally negative about the film, stating, \\"The Human Centipede has its moments, but they're largely obscured by umpteen holes in the plot as well as by reams of exposition,\\" and that it was \\"an ultimately underwhelming affair that's neither sick or [ ‚Å†sic ‚Å†] repellent enough to garner the cult status it so craves.\\" The New York Times review by Jeannette Catsouli noted that whether the film was \\"a commentary on Nazi atrocities or a literal expression of filmmaking politics, the grotesque fusion at least silences the female leads, both of whose voices could strip paint.\\" Writing in the Chicago Sun Times, Roger Ebert did not assign the film a star rating (not to be confused with awarding it zero stars), stating, \\"I am required to award stars to movies I review. This time, I refuse to do it. The star rating system is unsuited to this film. Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine.\\" Critics and a doctor have dismissed Six's claim that the film was \\"100 percent medically accurate\\" as \\"ludicrous\\" and \\"rubbish\\".David Farrier. \\"Full interview with Human Centipede doctor ‚Äì Video\\" . TV3. MediaWorks New Zealand. Event occurs at 0:03‚Äì0:07. Retrieved 5 September 2010. Dr John Cameron, speaking to TV3 News in New Zealand, gave an interview about the feasibility of a human centipede, stating how he believed it would be difficult for a join between different people to heal and form a connection, and how the centipede would quickly die from lack of nutrition.David Farrier, Full Interview with Human Centipede doctor, 1:11‚Äì1:51 John Martin, a former Hollywood film executive and CEO of Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas, said Six's claims of 100 percent medical accuracy should be viewed with reference to the kind of shock gimmicks that film producers had long used to attract attention. Martin compared Six's claims to those of Kroger Babb and William Castle, who had also made \\"grand promises\\" about what they were putting on screen, in a bid to lure audiences. Accolades Despite mixed reviews, the film won several awards in 2009 during advance screenings at various international horror film festivals, including Best Picture/Movie at Fantastic Fest (Austin, Texas), Screamfest Horror Film Festival (Los Angeles), and the Sainte Maxime International Horror Film Festival. Laser won Best Actor in the horror category at Fantastic Fest and the film won the award for Best Ensemble Cast at the South African Horrorfest Film Festival. Sequels Each film or \\"sequence\\" in the Human Centipede franchise acts as both a standalone project and as a segment in a larger 4.5 hour film, with the trilogy serving as a 'Movie Centipede'. When Tom Six began creating the Human Centipede sequels, he envisioned a trilogy that works as a \\"movie centipede\\". Each sequel opens with the ending of the previous film, as the events of that film influence said sequel. Although every film works as a standalone movie, they can all be connected to form a single 4.5 hour-long film. While promoting The Human Centipede, Six stated that he had started work on a sequel to First Sequence, titled The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence). Shooting on a similar budget to the first film,Jason Solomons, Film Weekly... 10:45‚Äì10:53 Six stated the sequel would be a much more graphic, disturbing and even \\"shittier\\" film; First Sequence being \\"My Little Pony compared with part two.\\"Jason Solomons, Film Weekly... 10:35‚Äì10:45 Yennie stated at the May 2010 Weekend of Horrors that the sequel would contain \\"the blood and shit\\" that viewers did not see in the first film. The plot of Full Sequence involved a centipede made from twelve people, featured a largely British cast, and was given the tag-line \\"100% medically inaccurate\\".Jason Solomons, Film Weekly... 10:10‚Äì10:30 The plot of Full Sequence involves a man who, after becoming sexually obsessed with a DVD recording of First Sequence, decides to create his own human centipede. The film had been planned for a DVD release in the United Kingdom. However, upon submitting the film to the BBFC for classification, the film was rejected due to content that was \\"sexually violent and potentially obscene\\". The BBFC's report criticised the film as making \\"little attempt to portray any of the victims in the film as anything other than objects to be brutalised, degraded and mutilated for the amusement and arousal of the central character, as well as for the pleasure of the audience,\\" and that the film was potentially in breach of the Obscene Publications Act, meaning its distribution in the UK would be illegal. Bounty Films, the UK distributor, appealed the decision, and the film was eventually passed with an 18 certificate in October 2011. To achieve the 18 rating, thirty-two cuts were made from the film, removing two minutes and thirty-seven seconds from the original version. The third and final film in the trilogy, The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence), received a limited theatrical release on 22 May 2015. The film features the largest human centipede in the series, composed of five hundred victims, as Six says, \\"each film is a reaction to the other. And the film got so big, it was a pop culture phenomenon, and people wanted more: a bigger centipede, helicopters and things‚Ä¶ it had to be bigger and bigger. And what I did, I used the idea and almost made a parody on the human centipede films itself.\\" As Full Sequence was intended to make First Sequence look like My Little Pony in comparison, Final Sequence was intended to make Full Sequence resemble a Disney film. The movie features the tag-line \\"100% Politically Incorrect\\". Both Dieter Laser and Full Sequence star Laurence R. Harvey returned in starring, albeit different, roles. The Human Centipede (Final Sequence) was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards in the categories of \\"Worst Director\\" and \\"Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off, or Sequel\\", respectively. It was also named the second worst movie of 2015 by Entertainment Weekly and The A.V. Club. In 2016, a compilation film of the entire trilogy titled The Human Centipede (Complete Sequence): The Movie Centipede was released, running a total of 275 minutes. Parodies A number of parodies of the film have been made. A pornographic parody, directed by Lee Roy Myers and titled The Human Sexipede, was released in September 2010. It starred Tom Byron as Heiter, who joined three people mouth-to-genitals. The South Park episode \\"HUMANCENTiPAD\\" saw character Kyle Broflovski unwittingly agreeing to become a part of a \\"Human CENTiPAD\\" after failing to read the full details of an Apple user license agreement. The website Funny or Die featured a sketch where the freed victims of a human centipede, now separated, but scarred physically and mentally, argue at a survivors' meeting. The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence) actress Bree Olson starred in a parody of the franchise that was directed by Graham Rich. Popular sketch comedian, actor, and YouTuber Brandon Rogers wrote and directed a parody titled Human Centipede: A Day in the Life, published to YouTube on June 3, 2011. Graphic novel In January 2016, Tom Six revealed on Twitter that production of a graphic novel adaptation of The Human Centipede was underway, along with posting an image of a test printed copy. It was also stated the graphic novel was going to be available in English, Spanish, German, French, and Japanese upon release but Six implied it would be translated into other languages later. The release for the graphic novel was stated to be in 2017, but it wasn't released that year. On 27 March 2018, Six again posted on Twitter that the graphic novel was ready, and he is seeking a distributor for it. Later in May 2019, in an interview with Bloody Disgusting, Six said that the graphic novel, along with a behind-the-scenes book of the first film, is set to be released on the 10th anniversary of the series, which he reiterated on Twitter. As of 21 September 2019, it is yet to be released. The story of the graphic novel will feature the events of the first film but it will display things that occurred before, and an epilogue that will shed light on the fate of the character Lindsay. Future Although Tom Six openly stated he viewed The Human Centipede as a trilogy, he told Bloody Disgusting in an interview that if he had to make a fourth installment he did have some ideas. Six said, \\"If I had to make a fourth one, which I might do in 20 years from now, who knows, it will be about connecting all starving Africans on the African continent done by a charity organization, to solve the hunger problem. Or about aliens connecting the whole human race!\\" Tom Six later revealed that he had written a script for a potential spin-off film titled The Human Caterpillar, a reference to a scene from The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence) where sewed prison inmates had their limbs amputated so they resemble a caterpillar. Furthermore, Six stated that the concept of The Human Centipede would appear in future projects in some form.

It was founded as the main daily newspaper for the Yugoslav-occupied Slovenian Littoral, previously known as the Julian March. However, with the Yugoslav retreat from Trieste in early June 1945, and the establishment of the Free Territory of Trieste in September 1947, the newspaper became the herald of the Slovene community in Trieste and in other areas of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region. The legal predecessor of the Primorski dnevnik was the Partizanski dnevnik, published illegally during World War II. The Partizanski dnevnik was published between November 1943 and May 1945 by the Slovenian partisan resistance in the Slovenian Littoral, first in Cerkno and then in Gorenja Trebu≈°a. After the liberation of Trieste by the Yugoslav Partisans on 1 May 1945, the headquarters was moved to Trieste, and its current name was adopted.

It is a sequel to the original Space Harrier. Plot The Space Harrier returns to stop an evil tyrant from corrupting the peaceful Land of the Dragons by finding Euria, the missing heir to the throne. The player character can run across the ground or fly using his flight belt. There are thirteen game stages, and the player fights an evil captain at the end of each stage. After completing all 13 stages, the player must then fight each of the captains, one at a time in sequence; after that, the evil king then comes after the player to prevent the player from ending his tyranny over the Land of the Dragons. Gameplay Space Harrier 3-D is a fast-paced three-dimensional action game. Like the original, the game involves a superhuman hero who runs and flies towards a forever distant background on a checkerboard-styled ground. As the playing field moves forward, enemies come from behind and from the far distance to attack the character, by either firing a projectile or trying to crash into him. The player must also dodge large objects in his path, some of which can be destroyed. One hit from an enemy or a crash into these large objects will cause the player to lose a life.

It is based on Deflate lossless data compression algorithm that uses a combination of the LZ77 algorithm and Huffman coding. This module provides the DEFLATE output filter that allows output from Apache HTTP server to be compressed before being sent to the client over the network. It also provides a filter for decompressing (inflating, uncompressing) a gzip compressed response body.mod_deflate also provides a filter for decompressing a gzip compressed response body Limitation The mod_deflate module does not have a lower bound for file size, so it attempts to compress files that are too small to benefit from compression. This results in files smaller than approximately 120 bytes becoming larger when processed by mod_deflate. Compatibility You can check a server to see if it is sending out compressed data, and compression compatibility of your browser for example here. When textual content compressed using mod_gzip, it should maintain its MIME-type, according to their recommended media type: * HTML: text/html * XHTML: application/xhtml+xml * CSS: text/css * JavaScript: application/x-javascript Alternatives The mod_gzip module is similar to mod_deflate, for Apache v1 and v2. A mod_gz module was independently developed by Ian Holsman. This module implements a gzip compression filter for Apache 2.0, providing similar functionality to mod_gzip. One important difference between the two modules is that mod_gzip includes its own gzip implementation, whereas mod_gz relies on an external zlib library. In PHP, a similar effect is achievable for the output of PHP scripts with: * the ob_gzhandler() and the gzencode() functions; * zlib.output_compression option in the php.ini file. CherryPy offers the Gzip filter, which uses the zlib module of Python standard library. License The mod_deflate module is part of Apache v2, licensed with Apache License 2.0. History Module level content compression for Apache started with mod_gzip, which is an external extension module, since Apache 1.3. The developers of the Apache 2.0.x servers have included mod_deflate in the codebase for the server to perform a similar GZIP-encoding function. Early versions provided lesser amount of compression than mod_gzip.Comparison of mod_deflate and mod_gzip Starting with Apache 2.0.45, the compression level of mod_deflate is configurable using the DeflateCompressionLevel directive. This directive accepts values between 1 (fastest compression speed, lowest compression ratio) and 9 (slowest compression speed, highest compression ratio), with the default value being 6. This change made the compression in mod_deflate comparable to mod_gzip out of the box.

His father taught him virtues of hard work, entrepreneurship, forthrightness, audacity, sincerity, dynamism, liberal disposition, prudence, modesty and strong religious inclination. Education In training, practice and expertise, Na‚ÄôAbba is a political scientist and a policy architect. He obtained a bachelor's degree in Political Science from the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in 1979. His early education was at Jakara Primary School, Kano where he obtained his First School Leaving Certificate in 1969. He later attended Rumfa College, Kano for his West African School Certificate and was also at School of Preliminary Studies, Kano, between 1974 and 1976, before gaining admission into Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in October, 1976. He completed a postgraduate programme on Leadership and Good Governance at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University in the United States in 2004. He served as Speaker of the House, and led several international bodies on parliament at the wake of the millennium. He has also attended, chaired and presented papers at several international seminars, conferences on politics, parliament, development and good governance. Among them were Conference of Presiding Officers of National Parliaments held in New York in 2000; West African Speakers Conferences held in 2000 and 2001 in Ouagadougou and Abuja respectively; Commonwealth Parliamentary Association annual conferences held variously in 1999, 2000, 2001 at Trinidad and Tobago, London and Melbourne, Australia and several others. Private sector experience After his university education and a one-year compulsory National Youth Service, prior to his branch into politics, Ghali, in 1980 joined his father's chain of companies. His business interests ranged from importation of goods, manufacturing to publishing. Thus, at first he became, Secretary, Na‚ÄôAbba Commercial Trading Company Limited and Later: * Managing Director, Manifold Limited * Director, Quick Prints Limited * Managing Director, Hinterland Resources Limited  Political ascendancy  As a Political Science student of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, he was elected as an executive committee member of the ABU chapter of the revolutionary People's Redemption Party established in the Second Republic by the maverick politician, Mallam Aminu Kano. As a student of Mallam Aminu school of good governance, nation building and transparency in politics he became a notable politician in Kano state and Nigeria in general. He joined the People‚Äôs Democratic Party (PDP) in 1998 during its formative period. He emerged the party's candidate in April 1999 National Assembly election in Kano Municipal Federal Constituency of Kano state and won the election to represent the Federal constituency in the House of Representatives. With the victory and support of other House members-elect from Kano and North West geo-political zone, he pursued the role as Speaker of the House. Although he amassed substantial support from his colleagues and party leaders, he bowed to counsel and conceded to Ibrahim Salisu Buhari, who later emerged as first Speaker of Fourth Republic House of Representatives. He was thus appointed the House Committee Chairman on Appropriations. Buhari's tenure was short-lived. Following his resignation due to certain misdemeanors, the House was thus faced with the arduous challenge of electing a leader that has the capacity and political will and skill of instilling sanity in the House, restoring its integrity and designing and pursing veritable legislative framework. The mantle of leadership fittingly fell on Ghali Umar Na‚ÄôAbba. The House collectively struck an unprecedented consensus and made Ghali the Speaker.  Speaker of the House of Representatives  Na'Abba is often praised as an influential Speaker of the House. This is on account of his courage, dynamism, constructive outspokenness, resolute pursuit for legislative independence and revolutionary approach towards the running of the House during his era as speaker. Upon election as speaker, Na‚ÄôAbba made clear his broad roadmap. These include; * Robust defence of the independence of the legislature * Commitment to the concept of separation of powers * Protection of the rule of law and the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria * Designing and actualization of effective legislative framework * Driving realistic legislative governance to resonate good governance and quality national development * Passage of good laws, resolutions and policies to essentially provoke people-focused development * Efficient management of public fund through healthy budgetary regime that holds full budget implementation in high premium * Pursuit of enhanced service delivery; curtailing of government waste and scaling down to the minimum, the rate of corruption in public places * Holding the executive arm of government fully accountable to the people To ensure a successful accomplishment of the above enumerated goals Na‚ÄôAbba, working in a close knit with other principal officers of the House with Hon Chibudon Nwuche as his Deputy embarked on the following measures; * Putting in place critical pillars and mechanisms that resulted in effective take-off of a parliament that was non-existent for 16 years following military interregnum * Designing a four-year revolutionary but realizable legislative agenda code named; House Contract with Nigeria. House Contract with Nigeria which was launched by Na‚ÄôAbba-led House with fanfare and resolve contained specific details of activities, programmes and policies the House planned to embark on, to meet the basic needs of the people, improve public welfare and sectoral development * Developing Minimum Infrastructure Bills, a broad and integrated legislative master plan evolved to drive infrastructural development in Nigeria * Shut doors to executive interference in parliamentary affairs * Regular exposure of ills in government, in so doing, unflinchingly engaging Ministers and other heads of government agencies through investigative hearings and public hearings * Profound scrutiny of budgetary framework, making robust adjustments where necessary * Forging effective and cordial relationship with the media and civil society groups to ensure the promotion of the young parliament * Strengthening of House committees and emboldening of committee heads to take on Ministers and agency heads on policy issues and level of budget implementation * Regular interface with Auditor-General and Accountant-General of the Federation and Minister of Finance to scrutinize government books for immediate action * Revitalization of plenary sessions which threw up healthy, electrified and animated debates with immense results. It is on record that Ghali's House plenary sessions remain the most vigorous and vibrant in this Fourth Republic and remarkable in the number of quality bills passed. * Fashioning out a cohesive, inclusive, mutual, thinking and participatory House, richly endowed with ideas. The matchlessness about Na‚ÄôAbba and his House was the ability to mobilize more than two-thirds majority at any given time * Mobilization of more than 300 members out of 360 to overturn President Obasanjo's veto on bills such as NDDC, etcetera and so on. Na‚ÄôAbba's House remains the only House that has been able to overturn a President's veto on a bill. * Regular debate on the state of the nation. 2002 debate resulted in the House's far-reaching resolution to commence impeachment proceedings against President Obasanjo to tame him over his growing appetite for constitutional breaches. * Cataloguing of 32 impeachable offences of President Obasanjo. Na‚ÄôAbba's House remains the only House that has so taken on the President in far reaching fashion towards checkmating civilian dictatorship and gross constitutional breaches. The executive arm of government, particularly the presidency, did not approve of his leadership. Consequently, greater part of Na‚ÄôAbba's tenure witnessed grand plots by the Presidency to oust him, so as to replace him with a compromising legislator. This severed the relationship between the House and the Presidency. He survived till the end of his four-year tenure on June 3, 2003. In August 2002, the House gave president Olusegun Obasanjo an ultimatum to either resign or face impeachment action. As speaker, Na‚ÄôAbba said the House would not withdraw the resolution. Na'Abba was the leader of the impeachment movement. It was reported that Obasanjo gave members of the House inducements to bring charges against Na'Abba.  International parliamentary positions  Although manifestly dynamic and proactive at home as speaker, Na‚ÄôAbba ensured that he replicated the same at international level. This accounted for the numerous but particularly critical parliamentary positions he occupied at international level during his four-year stint as speaker. A checklist includes: * Vice President, Conference of Speakers of West African Parliaments * Vice President, Global Parliamentarians on Habitat * Vice President, African Region, Commonwealth Parliamentary Association * Vice President, African Parliamentary Union * President Conference of Speakers of West African Parliaments * President, African Region, Commonwealth Parliamentary Association * President, African Parliamentary Union * President, African Regional Council, Global Forum for Parliamentarian on Habitat It is however on record that based on his leadership attributes, exceptional commitment to duty and towering performance and enhanced results, he was elevated from being the Vice President of the following regional parliamentary bodies - Conference of Speakers of West African Parliaments; African Region, Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and Africa Parliamentary Union - to president, all in 2000 and 2001. These offered him a rare opportunity to significantly redefine, reshape and drive African parliamentary diplomacy and development, fundamentally desired in the wake of the new millennium in 2000. As the President of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, Africa Region, he took Nigeria back to the body and thus Nigeria's name was removed from abeyance. Countries that are ruled by the military are put in abeyance by such bodies.  2003 Re-election bid  In April 2003, he sought a re-election into the House of Representatives on the platform of People's Democratic Party. The Presidency that brazenly lost the battle of removing him as Speaker extended the animosity to his re-election bid. The Presidency's fear was that given his level of performance in four years in the House and his high popularity rating, if he should be allowed to win the election to return to the House he would logically re-emerge Speaker. Essentially, this resulted in the regrettable conspiracy to ambush him to lose the election. This time again, the backlash of the perfidy expanded and consumed PDP in the state as the party lost to All Nigeria People's Party.  Political philosophy and re- alignment  Na‚ÄôAbba's idea of a political party is one founded on: * Justice, fairness, equity, providing for mass participation and fundamentally operating on liberal and collaborative platform. * It also involves a platform that holds accountability and transparency in high premium, carrying all members along at all times * Boasting of manifestoes that are designed and implemented to meet the critical needs and aspirations of the people thereby engendering good governance and national development Following the manipulations orchestrated by some of the party leaders which resulted in his loss of 2003 National Assembly election and perceived growing injustice in the party at that time which made the party to fall far short of his idea of a political party as enumerated above, Na‚ÄôAbba decided to leave the party in protest with other like minds for Action Congress of Nigeria in 2006. When it became obvious that the key leaders who perpetuated the injustice had begun to give way, he returned to PDP, three years later. As an affirmed progressive politician, the obvious derailment of PDP yet again in 2014 as evidenced in the mass exodus of leaders from the party forced Na‚ÄôAbba to leave the party after consulting widely and plausibly. He joined the All Progressives Congress (APC), a coalition political platform for politicians of progressive bent desirous of positive change. Predictably, APC has succeeded in displacing PDP at federal level and several states.  Awards  In recognition of his outstanding record in politics, pioneering parliamentary independence and development of the legislature and profound defence of democracy, rule of law and the constitution, Na‚ÄôAbba has bagged a flood-gate of awards from the government, civil society groups, organized labour, students unions, private business organizations, political associations and even foreign government agencies and so on. These are some of his awards: * National Honors Award of Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic (CFR) awarded by Goodluck Jonathan, President of Nigeria in 2010 * Award for building a formidable foundation for legislative Arm of government awarded by the People's Democratic Party(PDP), the ruling party at that time * Honorary Citizen of Kansas City, Missouri, USA * Man of Integrity Award by Students Union of University of Nigeria, Nsukka * Award of Excellence for upholding the tenets of democracy in Nigeria by Abuja Council of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) * Defender of democracy by Bayero University Students Union * Appreciation and Commendation Award by Nigeria Association of Indigenous Petroleum Exporters and Importers * Certificate of honour by Institute of Personnel Management of Nigeria * Millennium Gold Award for youths development by International Youth Congress * Pillar of Nigeria's Legislative Award by Law Students Society, University of Jos * Millennium Hero Award by All Northern Youths Forum  References  Category:Speakers of the House of Representatives (Nigeria) Category:Living people Category:1964 births Category:People's Redemption Party politicians Category:People's Democratic Party members of the House of Representatives (Nigeria) Category:Politicians from Kano State Category:Action Congress of Nigeria politicians ","title":"Ghali Umar Na'Abba"},{"id":"24642281","text":"Abdelhamid Kermali Stadium is 40,784 capacity stadium currently under construction in Baraki, Algeria, a suburb of Algiers.

He is notable for his criticism of the United States Constitution as well as excessive presidential power and has been widely quoted on such topics as the Second Amendment, gay marriage, nominations to the Supreme Court, and other legal issues. He has called for a Second Constitutional Convention of the United States. Early life Levinson is Jewish. He received a B.A. degree from Duke University, a J.D. degree from Stanford University, and a Ph.D. degree from Harvard University. Academic career Levinson was a member of the department of Politics at Princeton. Levinson taught law at Georgetown, Yale, Harvard, New York University, Boston University, Central European University in Budapest, Panth√©on-Assas University, the Hebrew University in Jerusalem., Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem London, Auckland and Melbourne. In 2001, Levinson was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2010, he was given the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Law and Courts Section of the American Political Science Association. In 1980, he joined the University of Texas School of Law at Austin, Texas where he is also a professor of government. He holds the W. St. John Garwood and W. St. John Garwood, Jr. Centennial Chair in Law. Books, scholarship, activism Levinson is quoted often in publications about numerous topics involving law. Levinson has described himself as \\"a card-carrying A.C.L.U. member who doesn't own a gun\\" who has argued that the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution limits the government's authority to regulate private gun ownership. Levinson's opinions on Constitutional Law have been reported in the media including his opinions about Second Amendment cases. Levinson has been a panelist on programs sponsored by the Association of American Law Schools and has spoken on topics alongside prominent lawyers such as Kenneth W. Starr. Levinson has been identified as a \\"prominent liberal law professor\\" and been grouped with other professors including Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard and Akhil Reed Amar of Yale. Levinson's opinion has been cited during the nominating process for Supreme Court nominees. Levinson has been critical of Supreme Court justices who have stayed in office despite medical deterioration based on longevity; for example, Levinson criticized Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist for a \\"degree of egoistic narcissism\\" by declaring six weeks before his death of his intention to stay on. Levinson has called for term limits for Supreme Court justices along with a growing list of \\"scholars across the ideological spectrum.\\" He has published comments critical of life tenure for Supreme Court justices. Levinson is particularly noted for his \\"seminal article\\" in the Yale Law Journal entitled The Embarrassing Second Amendment. He argued that the Second Amendment doesn't offer either gun rights or gun control advocates a refuge. He argued \\"society must decide the issue of gun control on practical as well as on constitutional grounds ... the issue is to what extent does the Second Amendment permit the Government to do what it wants in controlling firearms, just as we have to establish the extent to which it can limit speech or break into your house without a warrant. Levinson has criticized liberal lawyers as treating \\"the Second Amendment as the equivalent of an embarrassing relative whose mention brings a quick change of subject.\\" He has argued that the Constitution protects some personal ownership of firearms but admits that \\"courts are likely to rule that Congress can do almost anything short of an outright prohibition of owning guns.\\" Levinson's article was cited in Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' concurring opinion in Printz v. United States. Levinson taught a course called Torture, Law and Lawyers at Harvard Law School in 2005. Levinson has written essays in The New York Times. Levinson edited Torture: A Collection (2005). A reviewer commented: \\"What's most striking about these essays is that despite their abstract and theoretical content, they generally do not contradict the depiction of actual interrogators described by Mackey and Miller. The wall between the liberal campus and a conservative, utilitarian-minded military breaks down because the questions are so serious that few of this book's contributors want to engage in polemics, and few ‚Äì to their credit ‚Äì ever seem completely comfortable with their own conclusions.\\" Levinson has been a critic of the unitary executive and excessive presidential power. In the magazine Dissent, he argued that \\"constitutional dictators have become the American norm.\\" Presidents \\"have an incentive to declare emergencies\\" and assume \\"quasi-dictatorial powers,\\" wrote Levinson. Levinson was highly critical of president George W. Bush who he regarded as possibly the \\"absolutely worst president.\\" Levinson notes that President Obama seems likely to repeat the pattern of expansive presidential power. He wrote an essay titled \\"The Decider Can Become a Dictator\\" in which he criticized a system which allows presidents to make dictatorial decisions of great consequence without providing ways to discipline those who display bad judgment. Levinson commented about a ban on gay marriage proposed by former President George W. Bush in legal terms as a Constitutional issue. Levinson has criticized the Constitution (invoking comparisons to Thomas Jefferson) for what he considers to be its numerous failings, including an inability to remove the President despite lack of confidence by lawmakers and the public, the President's veto power as being \\"extraordinarily undemocratic\\", the difficulty of enacting Constitutional amendments through Article 5 and a lack of more representation in the Senate for highly populated states such as California. He also criticizes the primary process in which important states which aren't considered \\"battleground states\\" are ignored by presidential candidates. He's often called for a Second Constitutional Convention: \\"We ought to think about it almost literally every day, and then ask, 'Well, to what extent is government organized to realize the noble visions of the preamble?' That the preamble begins, 'We the people.' It's a notion of a people that can engage in self-determination.\\" Levinson's book Our Undemocratic Constitution: Where the Constitution Goes Wrong (and How We the People Can Correct It) calls for \\"wholesale revision of our nation's founding document.\\" Levinson appeared on the Bill Moyers television program in 2007. Levinson's research interests include American Constitutional development, Constitutional design, law, religion, multiculturalism, society, and theories of Constitutional Interpretation. Levinson participates in a blog called Balkinization which focuses on constitutional, First Amendment, and other civil liberties issues as well as a blog called Our Undemocratic Constitution. With Jeffrey K. Tulis, he is co-editor of the Johns Hopkins Series in Constitutional Thought and also of a new series, Constitutional Thinking at University Press of Kansas. Publications    * Pdf.

It is a self-actuated masturbation aid with controllable strokes. The machine works with or without an erection. Metro has described it as a sex toy \\"for the serious onanist\\". In addition to masturbation, the Venus 2000 may also be used for orgasm control practices such as edging or forced orgasm. Creation The Venus II was invented by Rick Gellert, with the assistance of Valentin Tsitrin, a Russian engineer. Gellert has written: > ...It seems male desire for sexual activity ranges from needing an orgasm > once in many weeks to wanting several in a day. [...] after hundreds of > variations, I developed a product unique enough so that I was awarded patent > #5501650. The device was marketed as Venus II from October 1993 to April 1998. Gellert and Tsitrin presented their device to Abco Research Associates in 1993 (also manufacturer of the Sybian), and Abco helped them launch and market it. As a result, Abco became the primary marketer of the Venus II. In April 1997, Abco purchased the Venus II patent along with all manufacturing and marketing rights. This led to the launch of an improved version, Venus 2000. In 2014 Abco modified the name of the product to Venus by Sybian. They also refer to the product as Venus For Men. Mechanics The Venus 2000 consists of a main box linked to a cylindrical \\"receiver\\" that fits over the penis by a connecting hose. The \\"receiver\\" superficially resembles the teat cup of a milking machine, and contains an inner and outer chamber separated by a cylindrical flexible rubber liner. Only the outer chamber is linked to the main box, with the inner chamber open at one end, ready for the insertion of the penis. Unlike a milking machine, the other end of the Venus 2000's inner chamber is not connected to a suction hose, but instead covered by a cap that contains a one-way valve that leads to the open air. The main box contains a gearmotor which drives a reciprocating diaphragm. Air moves to and from the outer chamber of the \\"receiver\\" via the hose. The device works by sucking in the shaft of the user's penis when the tip is placed against the Venus 2000's opening before activation, using the partial vacuum created by the removal of air from the inner liner via the one-way valve at the closed end of the receiver. The amount of air in the system is adjustable and determines the stroke length. Most men can adjust it to move the full length of the shaft. A significant amount of personal lubricant is needed to be added within the liner for the machine to operate correctly. The system is controlled during operation by two small control boxes. One of them is an electrical control box, with a speed adjustment knob, attached to the main box by an electrical cable. The other is a pneumatic control box, linked by a rubber tube to the diaphragm chamber, and has two push-buttons, one to add air to the system, and the other to remove air from the system. The final adjustment possible is an internal adjustment that can be used to change the amplitude of the pumping motion, but this is not available in operation, as adjusting it requires the main box of the machine to be dismantled and reassembled. For best operation, all the components of the \\"receiver\\" need to be sized for the penile dimensions of the user. To this end, the plastic receiver bodies are available in a variety of tube lengths and diameters, and the rubber liner material also comes in a variety of diameters. Specifications *Dimensions: 6\\" high, 8\\" wide and 9-1/2\\" long and weighs 11 pounds. *Gearmotor: The unit is powered by a 1/16 HP ‚Äì 15:1 ratio gearmotor made by Bodine Electric Co. *Diaphragm: Air is moved by a specially designed and molded diaphragm. It has the ability to push and pull air at a high speed. *Personalized stroke-length adjustment: The V2000 has an internal adjustment point with 5 possible settings that controls the amount of airflow. The unit setting is based on the size of receiver used.

The album was recorded in the summer of 1959 at the No.1 studio, Abbey Road, London, and issued by the 'His Master's Voice' label, a subsidiary of EMI, which was run at this time by Norman Newell. It features a cast that was formed for this recording only; this cast did not perform the show live in any theatre production. The album features the debut recordings made by Shirley Bassey for EMI, here she performs two songs in the role of Julie LaVerne. Previously she had successfully recorded at Philips Records but in 1959 her partner and manager Kenneth Hume arranged a contract with EMI/Columbia. These are also her first recordings made and released in stereo. The album also features the actress Dora Bryan, who appeared in films from the mid-1950s. She was later frequently seen on British television, most recently in the BBC series Last of the Summer Wine. The album was originally issued in two formats, a long-playing album in mono and stereo and as a two EP set, which featured highlights from the recording. A CD release was issued in mono by the Australian EMI company AXIS in the mid-1990s; it was finally issued in stereo in 2005 on the EMI label Classics For Pleasure where it appeared on a collection of Jerome Kern compositions such as Music in the Air and Roberta titled Kern - Show Boat etc..

The presence of writing among the Meiteis is assumed to go back to the Kangleipak state under king Loiyumba in the early 12th century.Naorem Sanajaoba, Manipur Treaties and Documents-Vol I,1993, New Delhi. Book I: \\"Twelfth Century Meetei Constitution To Pemberton Report\\". The Meitei script is a Brahmic abugida. It is known only from the Puya manuscripts discovered in the first half of the 20th century. Manuscripts of the 18th and 19th century used the Bengali alphabet. The existence of the Meitei script in the 15th- century hinges on the authenticity of an inscription dated to the reign of Senbi Kiyamba.According to K.B. Singh, The Meiteis of Manipur (1989 [1962]), p. 157, an archaic form of the script had developed by the 11th century, and it was in use until the early 18th century, when it was replaced by the Bengali script. By contrast, O.Tomba, The Need to rewrite Manipuri History, Imphal, 1993, claims that the script is a development of c. 1930, with all supposedly older documents being deliberate forgeries (Frans Welman, Out of Isolation ‚Äì Exploring a Forgotten World (2011), 468f.) Puyas Meitei Puya manuscripts have been discovered by scholars, beginning in the 1930s. These are chronicles, and evidence that Hindus arrived from the Indian subcontinent with royal marriages at least by the 14th century, and in centuries thereafter, from what is now modern Assam, Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Dravidian kingdoms, and other regions. Another manuscript suggests that Muslims arrived in Manipur in the 17th century, from what is now Bangladesh, during the reign of Meidingu Khagemba. Meitei literature documents the persistent and devastating Manipur‚ÄìBurma wars. Suppression of Meitei Literature After the adoption of Hinduism as state religion under Gharib Nawaz (1717), it appears that the Puyas were \\"burnt completely\\" at Kangla Uttra under royal orders, in either 1729 or in 1732. The Puya manuscripts discovered in the 20th century at best have a tenuous connection with the texts burned under Gharib Nawaz. Like the Hindu and Jain Puranas, the extant Puyas contain cosmology, genealogies of gods and goddesses, and royal chronicles. Epic poetry The Numit Kappa (\\"Shooting the Sun\\") is a mythological text in narrative verse. It was published in English translation by T.C. Hodson (1908).T.C. Hodson, The Meitheis, 1908, London. Appendix II, page 180. A translation into modern Meitei was published in 1908.Chanam Hemchandra, Numit Kappa, translated and rendered into modern Meeteilon, 2008, Imphal, Manipur. Ougri (also known as Leiroi Ngongloi Eshei) is a poem written in archaic Meitei.Ningthoujongjam Khelchandra, History of Ancient Manipuri Literature, Pub-Manipuri Sahitya Parishad, 1969. Khamba Thoibi is regarded as the greatest epic poetry in Meitei literature. The work is composed by Hijam Anganghal of Samurou. Translations of other-language works The Tirukkural, an ancient Tamil work on secular ethics, was translated into Meitei for the first time in 2012 by Soibam Rebika Devi. Chronicles The Nigthourol Shingkak is a work written under Gharib Nawaz, written in the mode of \\"predictions\\" made during the rule of Khagemba (r. 1597-1652) and thus foretelling the birth and reign of Gharib Nawaz and his religious reforms. The Cheitharol Kumbaba or \\"Royal Chronicle\\" is a text written down in the early 19th century, under Jai Singh, the puppet king installed after the Burmese invasion, purportedly based on an older copy which was no longer available. It contains day-to-day transactions and occurrences the state.\\"The manuscripts collected by W. Yumjao Singh consist of literary, historical, astronomical, astrological and miscellaneous other works of which mention may be made of Cheitharon Kumbaba, the Ningthourol Shingkak, the Poireiton Khunthokpa, Dharani Samhita, Srimat Bhagabat. The Cheitharol Kumbaba or the royal chronicle has been the most valuable for historical investigations, as it professes to record all the important daily transactions and occurrences of the State.... By orders of Jai Singh this book was rewritten as the former copy was no more available then\\". \\"The Nigthourol Shingkak is a work written in the way of prediction. It professes to predict all important events that would happen from the time of Khagemba downward. It, therefore, professes to be a work of the early 17th century. It is an anonymous work, and in this book, we see for the first time Gharib Niwaz's having had some Naga connection in his childhood.\\" Jyotirmoy Roy, History Of Manipur, 1958, p. 8.

His father was an architect for the London County Council, his mother a saleswoman for Madame Gray at Machinka & May, London. In his teens, he adopted his mother's maiden name, Hardy ‚Äì and always cited her as the inspiration for his chosen professional path. Amies was educated at Brentwood School, Essex, leaving in 1927. Although his father wanted him to attend Cambridge University, it was his ambition to become a journalist. His father relented and arranged for a meeting between his son and R. D. Blumenfeld, the editor of the Daily Express. His father was mortified when Blumenfeld suggested his son travel around Europe to gain some worldly experience. After spending three years in France and Germany; learning the languages, working for a customs agent and then as an English tutor in Antibes and later Bendorf, Germany ‚Äì Amies returned to England, where in 1930 he became a sales assistant in a ceramic wall-tile factory, after which he secured a trainee position as a weight machine salesman with W & T Avery Ltd. in Birmingham. It was Amies' mother‚Äôs contacts in the fashion world, and his flair for writing, that secured him his first job in fashion. It was his vivid description of a dress, written in a letter to a retired French seamstress, which brought Hardy to the attention of the owner of the Mayfair couture house Lachasse on Farm Street, Berkeley Square, as the wearer of the dress was the owner's wife. He became managing director at the age of 25, in 1934. In 1937, he scored his first success with a Linton tweed suit in sage green with a cerise overcheck called ‚ÄòPanic‚Äô. ‚ÄòPanic‚Äô was to be his debut into the fashion bible Vogue and was photographed by Cecil Beaton. By the late 1930s, Hardy was designing the entire Lachasse collection. His second celebration creation was ‚ÄòMade in England‚Äô, a biscuit-coloured checked suit for the Hollywood ing√©nue Mildred Shay. He left Lachasse in 1939 and joined the House of Worth in 1941. At the outbreak of World War II, he had been recruited into military intelligence because of his fluent German and French. He listed among his accomplishments on his application mountaineering, shooting, boxing and sketching. Amies saw service in the Special Operations Executive or SOE. Posted to SOE Headquarters in Baker Street in London, Amies was put in charge of the Belgium section and worked with the various Belgian resistance groups organising sabotage assignments. Amies rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. SOE's commander Major General Colin Gubbins did not regard a dressmaker as suitable military material, but his training report stated: \\"This officer is far tougher both physically and mentally than his rather precious appearance would suggest. He possesses a keen brain and an abundance of shrewd sense. His only handicap is his precious appearance and manner, and these are tending to decrease.\\" glbtq: arts: Amies, Sir Hardy ‚Ññ 14 Savile Row On 12 November 1945; Virginia, the Countess of Jersey (erstwhile Hollywood film star and the first Mrs. Cary Grant), who had been a former client during Hardy‚Äôs days at Laschasse, financed Hardy Amies move to Savile Row. The following January, Amies established his own couture fashion house business: Hardy Amies Ltd. Although Savile Row is the home of English bespoke tailoring, the Hardy Amies brand developed to become known for its classic and beautifully tailored clothes for both men and women. Hardy‚Äôs business quickly took off in the postwar years when customers, who had been deprived of couture for the preceding years, snapped up his elegant, traditional designs. Hardy was quoted at the times as saying, ‚ÄúA woman's day clothes must look equally good at Salisbury Station as the Ritz bar‚Äù. Amies was vice-chairman of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers from 1954 to 56, and chairman from 1959 to 60. Hardy Amies was located at 14 Savile Row since 1946,https://www.luxurylifestylemag.co.uk/style-and-beauty/taking-it-back-to- basics-with-hardy-arnies/, Taking it back to basics with Hardy Amies until early 2019 when the store closed permanently. Commercial success Amies was successful in business by being able to commercially extract value from his designs, while not replicating his brand to the point of exploitation. Amies was one of the first European designers to venture into the ready-to- wear market when he teamed up with Hepworths in 1959 to design a range of menswear. In 1961, Amies made fashion history by staging the first men's ready-to-wear catwalk shows, at the Savoy Hotel in London. The runway show was a first on many levels as it was both the first time music was played and for the designer to accompany models on the catwalk. Amies also undertook design for in-house work wear, which developed from designing special clothes for the England 1966 World Cup team, the 1972 British Olympic squad; and groups such as the Oxford University Boat Club and London Stock Exchange. During the mid-1970s, he ventured into interior design, including designs for Crown Wallpaper. In 1974, Amies was entered into the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame.Vanity Fair 2001: A Space Odyssey In 1967, Amies was commissioned by director Stanley Kubrick to design the costumes for his film 2001: A Space Odyssey. The collection allowed Amies to design totally futuristic fashions. In 2001, the standard attire was a business-as-usual approach to the corporate fashion. There were no neck-ties as they were in zero gravity. The Russian women scientists wore dark conservative clothing, reflecting their own conservative values. Although Kubrick's 2001 wardrobe was practical, it still reflected the mid-1960s slender look. The military and spacecraft uniforms were as common as they are now, with no dramatic changes. American women in 2001 retained roles they held in the 1960s as Hotel receptionists and air stewardesses. The women wore space-age travelling hats while carrying hand bags. According to 'Setting the Scene' by Robert S. Sennett (Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers, 1994), many design elements of the film seem to reflect swinging London c. 1968, rather than the imagined future. The stewardesses' uniforms, designed by Hardy Amies, look like the uncomfortable unisex pant suits that were being promoted in the late 1960s. An epic science fiction film, it demonstrated the immense range of Amies' design ability, and was nominated for four Academy Awards ‚Äì receiving one for visual effects. The film was an inductee of the 1991 National Film Registry list.https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film- registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/ Amies' work was seen in a handful of other films of the 1960s: he dressed Albert Finney in Two for the Road, Tony Randall in The Alphabet Murders, Joan Greenwood in The Amorous Prawn and Deborah Kerr in The Grass is Greener. Queen Elizabeth II Amies is best known to the British public for his work for Queen Elizabeth II. The association began in 1950, when Amies made several outfits for the then Princess Elizabeth's royal tour to Canada. Although the couture side of the Hardy Amies business was traditionally less financially successful, the award of a Royal Warrant as official dressmaker in 1955 gave his house respectability and publicity. One of his best known creations is the gown he designed in 1977 for Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee portrait, which he said was \\"immortalised on a thousand biscuit tins.\\" An estimated 500 million people watched the day of events on television. Knighted in 1989, Amies held the Warrant until his death in 2003. He gave up visiting The Queen himself in 1990 so that his Design Director Ken Fleetwood could create for the Queen until 1996. The House of Hardy Amies was still designing for her under Design Director Jon Moore until 2002.Jon Moore Design Director 1996-2002 ABC of men's fashion Having written a regular column for Esquire magazine on men's fashion, in 1964 Amies published the book ABC of Men's Fashion. Amies's strict male dress code ‚Äì with commandments on everything from socks to the summer wardrobe ‚Äì made compelling reading: When in July 2009, the Hardy Amies designer archive was opened on Savile Row, the Victoria & Albert Museum reissued the book. Hardy Amies' ownership In May 1973, Hardy Amies Ltd. was sold to Debenhams, which had already purchased Hepworths who distributed the Hardy Amies line. Amies purchased the business back in 1981. In May 2001, Amies sold his business to the Luxury Brands Group. He retired at the end of the year, when Moroccan-born designer Jacques Azagury became head of couture. In November 2008, after going bankrupt, the Hardy Amies brand was acquired by Fung Capital. Hardy Amies has been owned since 2008 by No.14 Savile Row, which in turn is owned by Fung Capital which is the private investment holding company of the Fung family who are separately the controlling shareholders of publicly listed Li & Fung Limited and Trinity Limited. In 2018 Hardy Amies went into administration for the second time and a buyer was being sought for its operations and intellectual property rights in it 2019. The company had been operating at a loss for some time.https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/09/hardy-amies-fashion- house-falls-into-administration, Hardy Amies fashion house falls into administration The Savile Row store was closed in March 2019 and the space taken over by Hackett London in June as its flagship store.

The building is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It was designed by the Chester architect John Douglas, and the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner describes it as \\"a brilliant group of brick houses\\". Location The houses stand on the east side of Grosvenor Park Road, Chester. This road leads south to the main entrance of Grosvenor Park. Immediately to the north of the houses is Zion Chapel (originally Grosvenor Park Road Baptist Church), which was also designed by Douglas and built around the same time in a complementary architectural style. History Grosvenor Park had been developed in the 1860s on land given to the city of Chester by Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, who also paid for its design by Edward Kemp. Its entrance lodge had been designed by Douglas. Both the marquess and his successor, the 1st Duke of Westminster, were concerned that the maintenance and improvement of the approach to the park should be carefully handled. A scheme for building houses on the approach had been prepared in 1872, but this was not carried out. Towards the end of the decade, the terrace of houses was built, with Douglas as architect, developer and landlord. Architecture The building consists of six joined houses, each of which is different, with a turret at each end; the left turret is surmounted by a ball finial and that on the right has a weathervane. The terrace is built in Ruabon red brick with terracotta dressings, and plaster panels on the top floor. Each house has three storeys, the top storey of which consists either of a gabled projection from the roof, or in the case of the right hand house, a dormer. The roofs are steeply sloping and made of red-brown clay tiles. The middle four houses have projecting one- or two-storey canted bays containing windows which are either mullioned, or mullioned and transomed. Large ribbed brick chimneys rise from the roof. The architectural style has a mix of Gothic and vernacular elements.

In 1997, the first policy guideline specific to telecommunications and postal sector liberalisation was issued based on the Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation (2003‚Äì2007). This policy guideline was developed by the Kenya Posts and Telecommunication Corporation (KP&TC;) and the Ministry of Transport and Communications. It set out the role of the sector in national development, stated the policy objectives and identified targets as well as strategies to be pursued. The desired market structure for liberalisation was also articulated in the policy. This policy guideline led to the transformation of the telecommunications and postal sector, the creation of the Kenya Communications Act (KCA, 1998) and the Postal Corporation Act (1998). Prior to 1998, the KP&TC; was the sole provider of basic telecommunications services. Telkom Kenya was created in 1999 as a separate legal entity from the previous postal and telecommunications statutory body and is slated for privatisation. The proliferation of mass media, economic demands and pressure from donors as well as civil society forced the government to review the laws governing the media with a view to liberalising the airwaves, abolishing of restrictive media laws, and harmonisation of Kenya Post and Telecommunication Act and Kenya Broadcasting Acts. (Mureithi, 2002) Initially the government split KP&TC; into two entities through the Kenya Communication Bill (1997) and the Postal Corporation Bill (April 1997). However Kenyan government created the telecommunication regulator at the same time that the telecommunications and postal arms of the PTT ministry were spun off as separate operating entities through the Kenya Communications Act of 1998. This move led to the dismantled of KP&TC; into the Communications Commission of Kenya, Telkom Kenya Limited and Postal Corporation of Kenya as well as the formation of to serve as the policy advisory arm of the Government on all matters pertaining to the ICT, National Communications Secretariat was also formed. In 2000, the Ministry of Information, Transport and Communications prepared a cabinet paper on broadcasting with the status of a sector policy statement. Following that, in 2001 the ministry prepared a draft broadcasting bill and broadcasting policy, however the 2 documents never got approved by parliament. In 2004 the Ministry of Information and Communications published the draft national ICT policy. It was adopted in 2006 and it aimed at creating an enabled and knowledge based society by using ICTs to improve the livelihoods of Kenyans.http://www.information.go.ke.

Targobank AG is a German bank mainly active in retail banking and is headquartered in D√ºsseldorf. Since 2008 it is part of the French Cr√©dit Mutuel Bank Group. Before the bank was part of the American Citigroup which in 2010 became Citibank Privatkunden AG & Co. KGaA and until 1991 it had been active under the name Kundenkreditbank. History In 1926 the Kundenkreditbank (KKB) in East Prussian K√∂nigsberg was the first bank in Germany which offered loans to private consumers. In the same year the American The National City Bank of New York, which came out of the City Bank of New York founded in 1812, opened a branch in Berlin at Unter den Linden Boulevard in the course of its international expansion. In 1935 the KKB moved its headquarters to D√ºsseldorf. With the beginning of World War II the American bank closed its Berlin branch and since 1953 has a branch in Frankfurt am Main. After The National City Bank of New York merged with the First National Bank in 1955 it changed its name to First National City Bank (of New York). In 1973 The First National City Bank took over the KKB Kundenkreditbank in Germany and kept the name KKB for its German retail banking arm until the 1990s. Since 1976 The First National City Bank was active in the USA under the name Citibank and in 1991 the bank also renamed its German business to Citibank Privatkunden AG and in 2003 to Citibank Privatkunden AG & Co. KGaA. Since the early 2000s the German Citibank was known for giving out loans with too high interest to private customers with bad credit rating. Acquisition and rebranding Targobank branch In July 2008 it was announced that the French cooperative bank Cr√©dit Mutuel was going to buy the then crisis-shaken German retail banking branch of the Citibank. The price was 4.9 billion Euro and the in the financial year 2008 generated profits until the moment of takeover. In December 2008 Citibank sold its German branch to Cr√©dit Mutuel. The brands Citi, Citibank and Citibank with Arc Design were kept for a little while by Cr√©dit Mutuel under the license of the Citigroup Inc. Citibank itself with its wholesale banking under the name Citigroup Global Market Deutschland AG stayed in Frankfurt am Main. On February 22, 2010 the Cr√©dit-Mutuel-subsidy formally changed its name to Targobank and was re-structured by Cr√©dit Mutuel. The word Targo is purely an artificial word which was created for the business by ad writer Manfred Gotta and was meant to raise worldwide acceptance of the company. Sponsorship Targobank took over the sponsorship deal with Werder Bremen which was started by Citibank, after a transition message of \\"So geht Bank heute\\" (\\"That's how today's banking goes\\"). Acquisition of a majority of the former Karstadt- Quelle-Bank Valovis In December 2013 \\"Targobank\\" announced the acquisition of the retail banking arm of \\"Valovis Bank\\". Since May 30, 2014 especially the credit card business with around 800 000 customers belongs to Targobank. The system integration proceeded until mid-2016. Acquisition of the GE Commercial Finance In August 2016 the under the name GE Commercial Finance active leasing- and factoring business of the German GE Capital, a financial branch of the General Electric company, was acquired and ever since operates under the name Targo Commercial Finance. Structure of the former Citibank In Germany the Citibank was represented among others by the following corporations: * Citibank Privatkunden AG & Co. KGaA headquartered in D√ºsseldorf which was formed in 2003 in a re-structuring process of the Citibank Privatkunden AG. In September 1991 the German Citicorp subsidy was active under the name Citicorp-TochterCitibank after it took over the Kundenkreditbank (KKB) and its customer base. * Citicorp Dienstleistungs GmbH headquartered in Duisburg. In 1999 the Citicorp Dienstleistungs GmbH was founded as a subsidy of the Citibank Privatkunden AG. * Citicorp Deutschland GmbH in D√ºsseldorf as Management Holding of other corporations in Germany. * In 2001 the founding of the Citifinanzberatung GmbH headquartered in D√ºsseldorf followed which employs mobile customer consultants. In 2006 it was the fastest growing subsidy. The number of staff of the Mobile Sales Force (as field workers are called at Citibank) amounted in the end of 2008 to around 230 staff members. Online Banking/Mobile Banking Targobank accounts can be managed online via e-banking or via a mobile phone app. In addition, accounts can be managed via phone calls with an interactive voice response. For transaction authorization a variety of TAN procedures are offered; one can choose between indexed TANs (iTAN), a mobile TAN (mTAN) via SMS and authorizing via app (easyTAN). Others With the Targobanks Girocard customers can also draw cash in France at Cr√©dit Mutuel and Cr√©dit Industriel et Commercial without charge as well as at Targobank in Spain and Beobank in Belgium. Criticism The image of the former Citibank in the German press was ambivalent. Admittedly Citibank was awarded as ‚Äúmost customer-oriented bank in Germany 2006‚Äù (awarded by the University of St. Gallen, the Handelsblatt and Steria Mummert Consulting), but at the same time it was regularly criticized due to its lending practice (e.g. consumer protection and Plusminus). Due to its bad image in 2004 Citibank initiated a new international campaign Unsere gemeinsame Verantwortlichkeit. In the course of the breakdown of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008 the Citibank Germany once again received bad press. According to numerous media reports certificates by Lehman Brothers were sold especially in Citibank branches as a secure investment to private customers ‚Äì among them many pensioners ‚Äì who as a result were confronted with the total loss of their investment. It is said that in Germany alone about 50,000 people were affected and the majority were Citibank customers. According to media reports, financial experts accuse the Citibank as leading sales partner of Lehman Brothers of providing fresh capital for the investment bank by massively pushing sales of Lehman certificates in Germany. On May 28, 2009 the Citibank announced a successful end after long negotiations with the consumer assistance office NRW, with which the bank agreed on a curtesy arrangement of 27 million Euros. This agreement was positively reflected on by the media, but the syndicate of Lehman-victims criticized the agreement as insufficient and mainly beneficial for the bank. They criticized that the curtesy offer would only equal 5% of the approximate total damage of 475 million Euros and even according to Citibanks own calculations around two thirds of damaged customers would get nothing. The compensation model looks at a multi-step refund of 30 up to 80% for those cases which are about existence threatening sums and it involves extensive exclusion criteria. The detailed criteria were published on the website of the consumer assistance office NRW. In fall 2009 the consumer assistance office proved in random tests with 15 banks that they don't forward their massively dropped refinancing costs to their customers. For the Extra- Account of the Citibank the overdraft interest was 16.99%. In 2010 the consumer assistance office cautioned three banks due to their practice. One of the banks signed a declaration to cease and desist; against the other two ‚Äì Targobank and Sparda-Bank M√ºnster ‚Äì the consumer assistance office went to court. In December 2011 the regional court D√ºsseldorf decided that the interest clause of the Targobank was illegitimate and the Targobanks try to have the judgment reversed by the Higher Regional Court failed. Due to the rebranding of the Citibank into Targobank consumerists criticized in 2010 that the change from KKB to Citibank in 1991 didn't change the criticism of the credit business, the business model would only aim to find new credit users to turn them into long term debtors.

History The company was founded in 1954 by Angulugaha Gamage Hinni Appuhamy.A G Hinniappuhamy had his early education at St. Aloysius College, Galle. While still in his teens, he left his school and home and migrated to Colombo to seek his fortunes. After opening his own tea kiosk on Maliban Street, Pettah, in 1935 he converted the shop into a small hotel. Appuhamy opened his second hotel at First Cross Street and then moved it to a larger premises in Norris Road. He subsequently opened hotels at Baseline Road, another at Norris Road and at Chatham Street. He invited his brothers, A. G. Wickramapala and A. G. Jinadasa to join him in managing the expanding business. Appuhamy then opened a bakery, which initially sold bread but later added hand made biscuits to their range. One of the first biscuits produced was the Maliban Marie biscuit. In order to satisfy the demand he purchased a biscuit cutter from India to assist in the biscuit manufacturing. Appuhamy bought of land at Kirulapana, where they established a dairy (which was later shifted to Nawala). The Kirulapana property was then used to commence the hand-operated bottling of Maliban Mineral Waters. He also entered into the ice cream industry, opening the Maliban Cream House in Colpetty. In 1945 after World War II the assets of the businesses carried out by the three brothers were incorporated into Maliban Hotels Limited. The business included six hotels, one tearoom, an ice cream parlour, a mineral water company and bakery. The company the purchased a plant from Baker Perkins and on 5 August 1954 Maliban Biscuits commenced full- scale production. The bakery section of Maliban Hotels Ltd was subsequently converted into a limited liability company, Maliban Biscuit Manufactories Ltd. In 1965, the company's operations were shifted to a new factory complex, which was constructed on a site in Ratmalana. The Company also has the distinction of being the first food company to achieve the National Quality Award in 1996. In 1970, Hinni Appuhamy died leaving his company to his son, Rathnapala Samaraweera. In the 1970s and 1980s the company had over 85% of the Sri Lankan biscuit market. The company now employs over 1,250 people and works continuous 24-hour shifts, producing 25 million packs of biscuits per annum and exporting their products to over 35 countries.

It is a Federal style cobblestone farmhouse built between 1828 and 1830. It is constructed of medium-sized field cobbles and is one of 13 surviving cobblestone buildings in Henrietta. Connecticut residents James and Rebecca Tinker arrived in Henrietta in 1812 with their six children (two more would be born later). Initially, they lived in log cabins that had been previously built on the site, but had their own home built starting in 1828, using the cobblestones they collected as they cleared the fields. Like many cobblestone structures in New York, it was constructed by masons whose work on the Erie Canal had recently ended and who needed work. Construction took two years. The farm surrounding the home started small but at one point expanded to more than 200 acres. Five generations of the Tinkers' descendants lived in the home, until 1991. (Even after donating the home, the residents continued to live in a wooden addition in the rear of the main house until 2010.) In 1991, the home and surrounding were transferred to the Town of Henrietta. See also: Much of the surrounding land is now the Tinker Nature Park, maintained by the town, with hiking trails and a nature center. The house now serves as a museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Among the architectural features are twin parlors and a spiral staircase.

The attack killed nine soldiers, nine militants and two civilians and was a major escalation in Pakistan's domestic insurgency.\\"[Pakistan Primer Pt. 2 From Kashmir to the FATA: The ISI Loses Control] ,\\" Global Bearings, 28 October 2011. One militant was wounded and captured by security forces. Soon after the attack, the militants infiltrated the security buildings where 22 civilian and military officials were held hostage by the militants. The Pakistan Army immediately launched a hostage rescue operation led by the SSG Division, Army Special Forces and the 13th Regular Regiment.  Background  The Pakistan Army and Pakistani officials have speculated that the attack could have been in retaliation for a series of planned operations in South Waziristan. A report published in The News International on 5 October, quoting Interior Department Punjab, had forewarned that militants wearing army uniforms would carry out an attack on GHQ. \\"If they fail to enter as per the first plan, then as an alternative they will drive the vehicle to the allegedly broken wall of the GHQ and jumped down into the compound using a ladder\\". The Daily Jang also reported on a possible threat. Initial attack The attack began when 10 militants, wearing camouflaged army uniforms and armed with \\"sophisticated weapons\\", attacked a checkpoint at the army base. They arrived in a white van and attacked the compound with guns and hand grenades; at least three explosions were heard during the assault. During the attack, five militants and six soldiers were killed. The army dead included a brigadier and a lieutenant colonel. The attackers then took 42 hostages, said to include civilians and senior military personnel, to a location near the headquarters. As the militants took over the security buildings, they took more than 42 people at gunpoint. The majority of them were civilian officials and unarmed military personnel. Due to prohibition of bearing weapons inside the GHQ Headquarters, the militants easily took control of the buildings. The Pakistan Army quickly planned the hostage rescue operation. After limited hours of preparation, the hostage operation was launched under the code name of Operation Janbaz. This was followed by deploying Pakistan Army Special Forces, 13th Regular regiment, and the SSG Division. The operation was led by the SSG Division's teams, while the Army Special Forces also participated in the operation. The Special Forces and SSG Division's teams stormed the buildings, and a heavy gun battle ensued. Well-armed Pakistani forces, cleared the building in the first phase of the operation. The first 20 military personnel and civilian hostages were rescued by the Army Special Forces, and 3 injured militants were captured. After that, the remaining hostages were then rescued by the Pakistan army's Special Forces and the SSG Division. Among the hostages were 22 who were being guarded by a suicide bomber, who failed to blow himself up and was subsequently killed. During the attack, which took place at 0600 hrs., four militants, two commandos, and three hostages (two civilians and one soldier) were killed. Three commandos later died of their injuries. One militant was captured; he was named as Mohammed Aqeel (alias Dr. Usman), and was said to be the leader of the group and the mastermind of the 3 March attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team. Aqeel was arrested in a building separate from the other militants, and five hostages were rescued from him. He had also tried to blow himself up and was injured in the process. Photographs of two of the attackers were released to the general public for identification. Investigations Police raided a house at Dhok Awan, Model Town Humak where the militants had stayed, and arrested the owner, Azam Qazi, as well as the property dealer who rented the house to the attackers. Several sets of Pakistani Army uniforms, maps of sensitive locations, fuses and detonators used in explosives, material used in making suicide jackets, and several identity cards were found at the safe house. Two pairs of trousers, two jeans, and over 10 pairs of Shalwar Kameez and slippers were also found. Evidence showed that at least 10 people were present at the house before the attack. The rent agreement was also found, which said the house was rented for Rs. 10,000 on 9 September. The attackers apparently stayed there for 20 to 25 days. Police also arrested another mastermind the attacks, Qari Ishtiaq, who is said to the commander of Punjabi Tehrik-i-Taliban. He was arrested from Bahawalpur on the information provided by the Hijratullah who has been jailed for 10 years due to his role in Lahore police academy attacks. 7 other militants were arrested from different parts of Punjab on his information him. Responsibility A first information report (FIR) was registered at Royal Artillery Bazaar (R.A Bazaar) Police Station against Mohammad Aqeel, alias Dr. Usman, for the attack. FIR no. 674 was registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA). It alleged murder, attempted murder, and possession of explosives and illegal arms. A Tehrik-e- Taliban (Amjad Farooqi Group) claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to an AFP reporter. The call was made by TTP spokesman Azam Tariq. > As long as Pakistan continues its operation against the Taliban, we will > also keep continuing such attacks We claim responsibility for the attack on > GHQ. It was carried out by our Punjab branch... We have the capability to > strike at any place in Pakistan Analysts have said the leader, Dr. Usman, is a member of the HUJI or the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, acting in concert with the TTP. According to ISPR, the attack was planned in South Waziristan, and 5 out of the 10 attackers belonged to Baitullah Meshud's group. According to Time, 5 of the 10 attackers were from Punjab. As such, the attack is believed to be one of the first major attacks attributed to the Punjabi Taliban, former state-supported militants now operating with the Taliban.\\"[Pakistan Primer Pt. 2 From Kashmir to the FATA: The ISI Loses Control] ,\\" Global Bearings, 28 October 2011. Senior officials of the army were the prime target of the attacks. They were to be held hostage in order to secure the release of 100 already detained militants. Subsequent airstrikes Following the attacks, the Pakistan Air Force retaliated with two airstrikes on suspected militant targets in South Waziristan on Sunday evening, 11 October. According to Pakistani intelligence officials, five militants were killed. On the night of 11 October, Pakistan Air Force fighter jets pounded various hideouts of militants in South Waziristan, killing 13 Taliban fighters.http://thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=88854 In the meantime, Pakistani UAVs and surveillance planes were intermittently flying over various areas of North and South Waziristan. Media blackout Two news channels, Geo TV and Samaa, were taken off the air for an hour. A message from Pakistan's media regulatory body appeared on those channels announcing it was temporarily suspending transmission of \\"independent news TV channels\\" until further notice. 15 October attacks On 15 October, several more attacks were carried out against government buildings in areas across Pakistan. Four gunmen attacked the Federal Investigation Agency building in Lahore; seven police and attackers were killed in the assault. Also attacked were two police academies and a police station in Kohat. Reaction * Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani strongly condemned the attack. Interior Minister Rehman Malik said in a statement, \\"We have been left no other option except to go ahead to face them\\". He called on all so-called terrorists to surrender and they \\"might expect leniency\\". He praised the \\"great expertise\\" of the Pakistani Army in dealing with the attack on GHQ. Police have increased security within the nearby Pakistani capital of Islamabad. * United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in London that she wished to \\"point out this shows the continuing threats to the Pakistani government and the very important steps that the civilian leadership, along with the military, are taking to root out the extremists and prevent violence and direct assaults on the sovereignty of the state\\".

His younger brother Jack Finucane also became a Holy Ghost priest, and a sister of theirs became a nun. Biography Early life Finucane was born on April 26, 1932, in the city of Limerick, Ireland. He was educated by the Congregation of Christian Brothers until 1950. He joined the Holy Ghost Fathers in Kimmage Manor, and studied Philosophy, Theology and Education in University College Dublin. He was ordained, in Clonliffe College, in 1958. Career Finucane contributed humanitarian aid during the Nigerian Civil War (also known as the \\"Nigerian-Biafran War\\"), from 1967-1970. The Nigerian government had blocked food supplies to the successionist state of Biafra causing starvation in the country. This was reported on international television stations and received worldwide condemnation. In an effort to save the population from starvation, Finucane organized food to be sent through makeshift airstrips, including one at Uli, Bafaria, and cargo trips with other Dublin-based workers. This led to the formation of the organisation Concern Worldwide in 1968. Finucane worked with Concern for 41 years and viewed his mission as \\"love in action\\". Finucane was banished from Nigeria in January 1970. Following this, he gained a diploma in development studies and a Masters of Arts degree in Third World poverty studies from the Swansea University. In 1971, he was again giving food supplies to the population during the operations which were ongoing in Bangladesh and flew often with Mother Teresa during the drop-offs. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) invited Finucane to lead a survey of people displaced in Southeast Asia. During the 1980s and 1990s Finucane led aid agency Concern Worldwide, becoming involved in the response to famine in Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia and Rwanda. While in Somalia, he was in a convoy that was attacked which resulted in the death of nurse Valerie Place. Published biography Finucane's biography, Aengus Finucane: In the Heart of Concern, written by Deirdre Purcell was published by New Island Books in January 2015. Death Finucane died of cancer on 6 October 2009 in a Dublin Spiritan Fathers' nursing home in Kimmage Manor at the age of 77. His funeral was held at the Church of the Holy Spirit, Kimmage and was attended by hundreds. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Miche√°l Martin and Minister for Overseas Development, Peter Power dubbed him as a \\"tireless force for good across the globe for more than four decades\\".

I-RTX is derived from resiniferatoxin (RTX). Etymology I-RTX is an iodinated form of resiniferatoxin, which is produced by the Moroccan succulent Euphorbia resinifera. I-RTX is iodinated at the 5-position and is therefore also called 5-iodoresiniferatoxin. Sources I-RTX can be prepared from RTX by electrophilic aromatic substitution. Iodide substitutes the 5-position. Chemistry Iodination of RTX at the 5-position changes the toxin from an TRPV1-receptor agonist into an TRPV1-receptor antagonist, with only a little lower affinity for TRPV1 than RTX. As RTX, I-RTX belongs to the daphnane family of molecules.Seiple, I.B. (2007). Daphane, tigliane, ingenane and diterpenes, Retrieved 10 October 2009, from The substance is soluble in DMSO and in ethanol. Binding of I-RTX is dependent upon temperature and pH value, as has been shown in research with HEK 293 cells expressing TRPV1. The optimal pH value is around 7.8 to 8.0 and binding increases markedly with temperature up to 37 ¬∞C and then decreases at higher temperatures. Target Initially, iodoresiniferatoxin was thought to be a competitive antagonist of the TRPV1 receptor with high affinity (Kd = 4.3 ¬± 0.9 nM to HEK 293/VR1 and Kd = 4.2 ¬± 1.0 nM to rat spinal cord membranes), but recent research indicated also partial transient agonistic characteristics in the thermoregulatory system in mice, especially in higher concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 ŒºM. The TRPV1 receptor encodes a protein of 838 amino acids forming a calcium-permeable channel that is activated by capsaicin but also by noxious heat and low extracellular pH. TRPV1 receptors are expressed in many systems in the central and peripheral nervous system, and have a particularly important role in signal conduction in afferent pain pathways. Mode of action The proposed molecular mode of action of TRPV1 antagonists is blocking of the channel pore. Several studies using either capsaicin, pH values < 6 or heat as the agonist have shown that I-RTX works as a strong competitive TRPV1 antagonist in vitro. Recent studies also revealed partial TRPV1-agonist-like effects of I-RTX in the thermoregulatory system in mice, increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. It also exerts weak, partial agonism on recombinant TRPV1 in vitro. This agonistic effect could be due to metabolization whereby I-RTX would be deiodinated, converting it into RTX with its respective characteristics. In vivo, I-RTX showed analgesic activity in the capsaicin pain test. I-RTX thus is able to block TRPV1 mediated nociceptive and neurogenic inflammatory responses. Toxicity In mice, I-RTX induces dose- dependent hypothermia in vivo. A statistically significant difference was reported at doses > 0.1 Œºmol/kg. The maximal effect was found with a dose of 1 Œºmol/kg, 60 to 100 minutes after administration. No lethality has been reported in this study. Therapeutic use Clinical research is done on the use of I-RTX as an analgesic agent, although several drawbacks have been mentioned: complex chemical structure, high costs of production, and relatively unfavourable pharmacokinetic characteristics.

In that year, there were only 136 African-American Certified Public Accountants (CPA's) out of a total of 100,000 in the United States. This group wanted to establish an organization to address the concerns of minorities entering the accounting profession and to make a commitment to professional and academic excellence. The following nine individuals who met that month were determined to \\"make a difference\\" and let their voices be heard. The National Association of Black Accountants (NABA, Inc.), is an American nonprofit professional association that represents the interests of more than 200,000 black professionals in furthering their educational and professional goals in accounting, finance, and related business professions. Student members are served throughout the organization's 200 chapters around the country. NABA's membership includes entry and mid-level accountants, auditors and financial professional, senior-level managers and executives, firm partners, as well accounting, finance, business, and IT students. About half of NABA's members work in corporate America, with the remainder serving in nonprofit, government, academic, and international arenas. Forty percent hold advanced degrees and 45% hold professional certifications. NABA is also made up of corporate members who represent hundreds of African American-owned CPA firms around the country. Mission NABA's motto is ‚ÄúLifting As We Climb,‚Äù which is embodied in its official logo depicting two interlocked hands, with one pulling the other up. The image denotes both the political struggle the organization faced at its founding and the goal of helping future generations of accounting professionals. The organization came into existence during a period of time in which blacks and other minorities faced obstacles in being recognized and being promoted in the profession. It became a vehicle through which minority professionals could be assisted as they climbed the corporate ladder, obtained the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) designation, and prepared for partnership in top firms. Moreover, the organization's operating model encourages veteran professionals to incubate and mentor students entering the profession. Through a number of programs and partnerships with like-minded organizations, conferences, publications, as well as advocacy, NABA aims to: * Promote and develop the professional skills of members * Groom college students entering the accounting profession and attract younger students to the profession * Provide opportunities for members to fulfill their civic responsibilities * Promote public confidence in members, their credentials, and the professional services they provide * Represent the interests of members in educational, political, and social domains * Ensure long-term financial stability and provide adequate resources for chapter, regional, and national programs Organizational structure The association is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit membership organization. There are two classes of membership: student and professional. Professional members may also opt to obtain the Lifetime Member designation. The 160 student chapters are named by their college or university and fall under the auspices of the nearest of the 48 professional chapters. A National Board of Directors, which includes regional leaders, governs the entire organization. The headquarters is in Greenbelt, Maryland. History NABA was established in 1969 by nine African American accountants in New York City, and for forty years has addressed the systematic challenges faced by minority accounting professionals. In 1969, there were 100,000 people who held the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) designation‚Äìonly 150 The Status of the Black CPA: Twenty Five Year Update, Journal of Accountancy, Vol. 170, 1990 of them were African American. That same year, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants‚Äîthe professional body that awards CPAs‚Äîpassed a resolution on the lack of diversity in the accounting profession and established the Minority Initiative Committee, which along with NABA, continues to study and provide solutions that eliminate the barriers to success in the profession by people of color. Today, through the efforts of NABA, the AICPA, and other interested groups, there are more than 200,000 African Americans participating in the field of accounting, of which more than 5,000 are CPAs. As a leader in the business community, NABA continues to create opportunities to enlarge the pipeline of African Americans into every level of accounting and finance, as it recognizes that the growth of the blacks in the profession remains a significant challenge. Minorities make up slightly more than 25%2009 Trends in the Supply of Accounting Graduates and the Demand for Public Accounting Recruits, AICPA, 2009 of enrollments in bachelor's degree programs: 11.5% African American, 7% Asian, 6% Hispanic, 1% American Indian/Alaskan Native, and 6.5% of mixed or unknown ethnicity. At the master's level, African American enrollment falls to just 6%. Challenges of African Americans in Obtaining the CPA Given the importance of the CPA designation in reaching top levels of the profession, NABA extends significant resources to help its members achieve this mark and to study the factors that impose barriers to obtaining it. In June 2007, NABA, along with Howard University's Center for Accounting Education, held the first CPA Examination Summit 2007 CPA Examination Summit: Insights into Increasing the Number of African American CPAs, NABA, Inc. and Howard University Center for Accounting Education, 2007 at NABA's Annual National Convention. The convening gathered participants from public accounting, industry, and academia to explore why‚Äîdespite their increasing numbers in college degree programs‚Äîgrowing numbers of African Americans were not sitting for or passing the CPA examination. The Summit unearthed a number of issues, including generational challenges, lack of black CPA role models, and exam mechanics. A second Summit in 2008 led to the creation of several programs within NABA and other organizations to resolve these issues, with financial supportCPA Examination Summit ‚Äì Insights Into Increasing the Number of African-American CPAs: Part 2, NABA, Inc. and Howard University Center for Accounting Education, 2008 from accounting firms Ernst & Young and Deloitte. Programs and Initiatives NABA's programs consist of professional development, networking opportunities, job placement, continuing education, technical training, national and regional conferences, and public service initiatives. * The Center for Advancement of Minority Accountants (CAMA) recruits, develops, and supports talented minorities interested in accounting, finance, and related business fields through partnerships among NABA chapters, corporations, and colleges and universities. * CPA Bound grew out of NABA's President's Advisory Council to increase the number of African American CPAs. In concert with Howard University and Becker CPA Review, the program offers an intensive seven-week Boot Camp for young professionals preparing to sit for the CPA exam. CPA Bound also hosts the annual CPA Examination Summit to monitor progress of efforts to increase the number of minorities passing the exam. * NABA's Accounting Career Awareness Program (ACAP) is an annual one-week residency program for high school students to be introduced accounting, finance, and general business concepts. * For professional members, NABA provides continuing professional education credits (CPEs) through technical sessions held throughout the year and at the Annual National Convention. NABA is registered with the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy as an official sponsor of continuing professional education. * NABA hosts a three-tiered Leadership Development Institute that helps participants bridge the gap from mid-to-senior-to executive levels of business leadership. The institutes take place in conjunction with NABA's Annual National Convention. * Student members of NABA have access to its National Scholarship Program, which has offered more than $7.1 million in support since beginning in 1987. The Distinguished Collegian Award is the organization's highest student honor and recognizes NABA students who are making a difference in their chapters and communities. The Student Case Study Competition is a rigorous challenge between student teams who research, develop, and prepare oral presentations that address accounting and business topics. The competition takes place each year at NABA's Annual National Convention. * Community service is an important part of NABA membership. Each year, members take time away from the Annual National Convention and complete an outreach mission as part of NABA's Day of Service. It began when NABA's convention took place in New Orleans in 2009 and will continue in 2010 in Houston. Moreover, NABA professional members annually cosponsor IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program sites to help low-to-moderate income people prepare their tax returns. * NABA also partners with the AICPA to bring comprehensive consumer financial literacy education to youth, students, and low-to-moderate income families. Conferences Each year, the Association hosts five regional conferences in the fall for students. In addition to professional development sessions, students receive scholarships and apply for internships. Seniors are scheduled for onsite interviews for employment following graduation. Each June, NABA convenes the general membership for large-scale networking sessions and student development opportunities, leadership training, professional awards, student case competition, the NABA Day of Service, and scholarship awards.

In Ireland the surname is almost exclusive to Ulster and particularly to counties Antrim and Down. Here they are of Scottish origin where the surname is most common in Galloway. Many of the Galloway Adairs settled in Ulster during and after the Plantation. A few of the name in Ireland may be of the family name √ì D√°ire. There is another theory that \\"In about 1380, Robert Fitzgerald owned lands around Adare in Ireland. There he fought a family duel with Gerald, the white knight, a distant cousin. Although Robert Fitzgerald's father was the Earl of Desmond, the Fitzgeralds did not see Robert as a nobleman. It was unacceptable for him to kill a knight. A powerful group was against Robert. Robert became a fugitive, relocating to Wigtownshire in south western Scotland. To cover his tracks, Robert took as his surname 'Adare' after the town near his lands back in Ireland. Upon arriving in Scotland, Robert learned that the King of Scotland had placed a bounty on the head of a man named 'Currie'. Currie was outlawed as a thief and pirate. The King promised Currie's castle, deemed nearly impregnable, to whoever would bring him the head of Currie. Robert Adare watched over Dunskey Castle for several days until Currie came out one evening. Robert followed Currie, and engaged the pirate in mortal combat, slaying him at the head of Colfin Glen.

Life He was the eldest son of Sir Rowland Hill, 1st baronet, who was also a first cousin of Thomas Hill, of Tern, (today Attingham Park); his mother was Jane, daughter of Sir Brian Broughton, 3rd Baronet, of Broughton, by Elizabeth Delves. The Hills of Hawkstone owed their status and fortune to the \\"Great Hill\\", the Hon. Richard Hill (1655-1727), diplomatist and statesman, great-uncle of Sir Richard Hill. His nephew, Rowland, was a distinguished soldier, created first Viscount Hill of Hawkstone (d. 1842), and his brother was the Evangelical preacher, also named Rowland Hill. Richard Hill was educated at Shrewsbury School, Westminster School and Magdalen College, Oxford. He became a writer of religious tracts, a patron of Methodists and tolerant of Dissenters, who supported George Whitfield against John Wesley. In Parliament he was a supporter of William Pitt the Younger. Nathaniel Wraxall writes that he was > \\"one of the most upright, honest and disinterested men who ever sat in > Parliament‚Ä¶ but his religious cast of character laid him open to ‚Ä¶ ridicule. > His manners were quaint and puritanical, his address shy and embarrassed. He > possessed, however, a most benevolent disposition, together with a great > estate, which enabled him to gratify his generous and philanthropic > feelings.\\" Hill developed the landscape garden at Hawkstone as one of the most notable and visited of the day, with its features of follies and grottos, and column surmounted by a statue of his ancestor, Sir Rowland Hill, the first Protestant Lord Mayor of London. He created a garden of epiphany, a landscape that would display God's majesty in the natural grandeur of Shropshire's rugged hills: \\"the smooth lawns gave it beauty; the lake and the ruin made it picturesque; and the craggy hills singled it out as one of the very few sublime gardens in the country.\\" It had a 10-mile circuit of novel features, including scenes representing Switzerland and Tahiti. Its excited visitor was left perched on a ‚ÄòRaven‚Äôs Shelf‚Äô, below which cliffs dropped hundreds of feet. Sir Richard Hill's estate was large even by the standards of the day, but not without difficulties in its administration. In 1790 his steward, George Downward, was found negligent, but Hill did not discharge him. Extravagance continued: in 1796 Hill did not flinch from a very expensive parliamentary contest with his Attingham kinsmen, William Hill, and in 1816 the Hawkstone estate was hit hard by the failure of Thomas Eyton, receiver general of Shropshire.

The building occupies a full block along Beekman Street with the addresses 38 Park Row to its west and 145 Nassau Street to its east. It was designed by Norris G. Starkweather in a combination of the Queen Anne and neo-Grec styles, as an iron-framed structure. The Potter Building employed the most advanced fireproofing methods that were available when the building was erected between 1883 and 1886. These features included rolled iron beams, cast iron columns, brick exterior walls, tile arches, and terracotta. The Potter Building was also one of the first iron-framed buildings, and among the first to have a \\"C\\"-shaped floor plan, with an exterior light courtyard facing Beekman Street. The original design remains largely intact. The building replaced a former headquarters of the New York World, which was built in 1857 and burned down in February 1882. It was named for its developer, the politician and real estate developer Orlando B. Potter. The Potter Building originally served as an office building with many tenants from the media and from legal professions. It was converted into apartments from 1979 to 1981. The Potter Building was designated a New York City landmark in 1996 and is also a contributing property to the Fulton‚ÄìNassau Historic District, a National Register of Historic Places district created in 2005.  Site  The Potter Building is in the Financial District of Manhattan, just east of New York City Hall, City Hall Park, and the Civic Center. The building abuts Park Row for about to the west, Beekman Street for to the south, and Nassau Street for about to the east. The northern wall abuts 41 Park Row on the same block for The Morse Building and 150 Nassau Street are across Nassau Street, while 5 Beekman Street is across Beekman Street. The corner of Park Row and Beekman Street is at an acute angle. The Potter Building's addresses include 35‚Äì38 Park Row, 2‚Äì8 Beekman Street, and 138‚Äì145 Nassau Street.  Design  The 11-story Potter Building is arranged in a mixture of styles, including the Queen Anne, neo-Grec, Renaissance Revival, and Colonial Revival styles. As a result, it stands out from the surrounding buildings. The Potter Building's architect, Norris Garshom Starkweather, was known for designing churches and villas in the mid-Atlantic states. The building measures tall from sidewalk to roof, with finials extending upward another . The original design remains mostly intact. The Potter Building employed the most advanced fireproofing methods available at the time of construction, due to its predecessor having burned down. This included the use of rolled iron beams, cast iron columns, brick exterior walls, as well as tile arches and terracotta. Five iron companies provided the material. The fireproofing is insulated by the brick- and-terracotta facade.  Form  The Potter Building is U-shaped, with a \\"light court\\" within the two arms of the \\"U\\", facing outward toward Beekman Street. The building is one of the city's oldest extant structures with a light court. The Real Estate Record and Guide said that \\"the rooms on each side are made symmetrical in spite of the irregularity of the lot; the irregularity, of course, appearing in the court itself\\". A writer for the Fireman's Herald stated that the court split the facade so that \\"it looks almost like two buildings\\". There is a fire escape in the middle of the light court.  Facade  At the time of the Potter Building's construction, the facades of many 19th-century early skyscrapers consisted of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, midsection, and capital. The base comprises the bottom two stories, the midsection included the middle seven stories, and the capital was composed of the top two floors. The base has an iron facade and the remaining stories have a red brick and terracotta facade. Each side has similar ornamentation, containing column capitals, pediments, corbels, panels, and segmental arches made of terracotta. The ornamental detail is elaborately designed in the classical style and includes massive capitals atop the vertical piers, as well as triangular and swans'-neck pediments. The piers divide the facades into multiple bays, which each contain two windows on each floor. The piers, clad with brick above the second floor, are wide at the base, with a uniform width for the building's entire height, but range in thickness from at the first floor to at the eleventh floor. They contain concealed flues that ventilate the gases from the building's furnaces into hidden chimneys underneath the finials atop each pier. The lintels on the upper stories, clad with terracotta, consist of four parallel wrought-iron beams with a width of between flanges. The lintel beams sit atop iron plates embedded within the masonry of each pier and anchored with a twisted iron strap. Because of the presence of elevator lobbies at the northern end of the building, the northernmost bays on Park Row and Nassau Street are wider. At Park Row and Beekman Street, a 270-degree-wide column rounds out the corner. The Potter Building is among the oldest remaining buildings in New York City to retain architectural terracotta. The terracotta was sculpted by the Boston Terra Cotta Company and was more highly detailed than in other contemporary buildings. At the time, there were no terracotta companies in New York City, and four other firms competed to supply the building's terracotta. The structure ultimately included of terracotta. An 1888 brochure for the New York Architectural Terra Cotta Company, which the building's developer Orlando B. Potter founded with his son-in-law Walter Geer, stated that the Potter Building was \\"an example of the best use of terra-cotta, both for constructive and ornamental purposes\\". Boston Terra Cotta Company superintendent James Taylor supervised the placement of the terracotta. The fourth and eighth floors contain windows ornamented with terracotta segmental arches; the third, fifth, sixth, seventh, and tenth-story windows contain terracotta corbels; and the eleventh-story windows have terracotta hoods.  Features  The foundation walls of the Potter Building were thick and sunken to a depth of . The underlying bedrock layer was more than below the ground, so the foundations were placed on separate pier footings. The site is above groundwater. During the construction of the New York City Subway's IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line () underneath Beekman Street in 1915, the southern elevation was underpinned using concrete-and- steel tubes sunk to a depth of , underneath the groundwater level. The exterior columns are made of iron. All of the above-ground floors were built on girders made of rolled iron. The girders were thick and range from long. The floor beams, thick, sit atop the flanges of each girder; their centers are set apart, and most of the beams have a uniform length of . Flat brick arches were placed within each set of floor beams and were leveled with concrete, brick, and stone aggregate. The floors were finished with wood, while the ceilings were finished in plaster. Potter's original plans for the building were for the first floor to contain bank offices and for the upper floors to be used by other businesses. He wished for the Potter Building to be \\"an ornament to the neighborhood\\". Inside were originally 351 suites that could be used by up to 1,800 people at a time. The ceilings of each story are high. The building's upper floors were later converted into apartments of each, though the apartments retained the walls.  History  Context The Potter Building lot, and the adjoining lot immediately to its north (which is occupied by 41 Park Row), was the site of the Old Brick Church of the Brick Presbyterian Church, built in 1767-1768 by John McComb Sr. Starting in the early 19th century and continuing through the 1920s, the surrounding area grew into the city's \\"Newspaper Row\\"; several newspaper headquarters were built on Park Row, including the New York Times Building, the Park Row Building, the New York Tribune Building, and the New York World Building. Meanwhile, printing was centered around Beekman Street. When the Brick Presbyterian Church congregation moved uptown to Murray Hill in 1857, Orlando B. Potter, a politician and a prominent real estate developer at the time, purchased the southern half of the Old Brick Church lot. Potter erected a five-story Italianate stone building on the lot for $350,000 (equivalent to $ million in ); it became the first headquarters of the New York World, which was established in 1860. Potter purchased the building outright in 1867. A fire broke out in the World building around 10:00 p.m. on January 31, 1882, supposedly because of a draft of wind from the nearby Temple Court Building. The fire destroyed much of the block within a few hours, killing six people and causing more than $400,000 in damage (equivalent to $ million in ); The World building was said to have \\"made itself notorious the country over for burning up in the shortest time on record\\", and it took a week to examine the wreckage, Several days after the fire, the Real Estate Record and Guide said that \\"the ground is so valuable that it will no doubt be immediately built upon\\".  Construction  1893 depiction of the Potter Building Potter sought to replace the burned-down edifice with a fireproof structure, having incurred more than $200,000 of losses (equivalent to $ million in ) in addition to loss of income. By mid-February 1882, Potter was planning to construct an 11-story building at the site of the old World building, which he specified should be fireproof. In 1883, Starkweather presented plans for the structure, of which the first two stories would have an iron facade and the remainder would have a brick facade. Potter decided to defer construction for one year due to the high cost of acquiring materials. Construction of the foundation started in April 1883. To test the relative strength of iron versus wooden floor beams, Potter built two small, nearly-identical structures, one with each material. After setting them on fire for two to three days, Potter determined that the iron structure was more suitable for use, since the iron floor suffered little damage compared to the totally-burned wooden floor. Plans for the Potter Building were filed with the New York City Department of Buildings in July 1883, at which point it was supposed to cost $700,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). Construction was underway by mid-1884. Workers were hired by the day, rather than contracted for the entire project. Since the World building fire had occurred during the construction of Potter's 750 Broadway building in NoHo, further uptown, workers from the 750 Broadway project were also contracted to work on the Potter Building. Construction was delayed in May 1884 due to a bricklayers' strike, and the costs increased to $1.2 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Work was also delayed by a painters' and carpenters' strike in 1885. The building was finally completed in June 1886.  Use  Detail of the facade At the time of its completion, the Potter Building was among the tallest in the area, towering above every other structure except the New York Tribune Building. The Boston Globe called the Potter Building \\"the tallest straight-wall building in the world\\". The 1892 King's Handbook of New York City stated that newspapers, magazines, insurance companies, and lawyers occupied 200 offices within the building. The newspaper tenants included The Press, a Republican Party-affiliated penny paper, as well as The New York Observer. The Potter Building was also occupied by paper manufacturers Peter Adams Company and Adams & Bishop Company, the Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association insurance company, and the Otis Elevator Company. In addition, Potter occupied the top floor, and his New York Architectural Terra Cotta Company also had offices in the building. Potter died in 1894, and the building was given over to his estate. O.B. Potter Properties acquired the building from Potter's estate in 1913. The Potter Building, along with some of the Potter estate's other properties (such as the Empire Building), was sold in 1919 to the Aronson Investing Company. The building's ownership was then transferred several times within a decade: the Parbee Realty Corporation acquired the structure in 1923, followed by A.M. Bing & Son in 1929, and the 38 Park Row Corporation in 1931, before Parbee re- acquired the Potter Building the following year. The Seaman's Bank for Savings acquired the structure at a foreclosure auction in 1941, and four years later, sold it to Beepark Estates. Tenants throughout this time included the United States Housing Authority, accountants, and lawyers. The 38 Park Row Corporation purchased the building in 1954. The New York World and Tribune buildings immediately to the north were demolished in the 1950s and 1960s, and Pace College (later Pace University) built 1 Pace Plaza on the site of the latter. The university also acquired the Potter Building and other nearby buildings in 1973, with plans to destroy them and build an office tower. These plans did not proceed and Pace sold the building in 1979 to a joint venture named 38 Park Row Associates, composed of Martin Raynes and the East River Savings Bank. 38 Park Row Associates converted the building into residential cooperatives and gave it to the 38 Park Row Residence Corporation in 1981. Following the residential conversion, a structural engineer noted that the facade had \\"significant deterioration particularly in the mortar jointings\\". The Potter Building's co-op board subsequently arranged for a renovation of the facade in 1992-1993, to be carried out by Siri + Marsik and Henry Restoration. The Potter Building, along with the Manhasset Apartments and 110 East 42nd Street, was made a New York City designated landmark on September 21, 1996. A controversy ensued in 1999 when the Blimpie restaurant at the Potter Building's ground level decided to place outdoor seating on Nassau Street, which had recently been converted from a weekday-only pedestrian zone into a full-time pedestrian plaza. Residents of the Potter Building complained that the seating violated a city ordinance on sidewalk cafes. In 2005, the Potter Building was designated as a contributing property to the Fulton‚ÄìNassau Historic District, a National Register of Historic Places district.  Critical reception  Lower Manhattan's late-19th century skyscrapers generally received mixed reception, and the Potter Building was especially criticized by professional architectural journals. A Real Estate Record and Guide writer remarked in 1885 that \\"there is not an interesting or refined piece of detail in the whole building\\". The critic also said that the building's design focused too much on its vertical aspect, though this contrasted with the opinions of many other contemporary critics, who generally saw vertical emphasis favorably. In 1889, a writer for the same magazine compared the Potter Building with the Times Building at 41 Park Row, saying that the Potter Building's architect \\"contrived to make [it] appear at once monotonous and uneasy\\". There were also positive reviews of the design. An 1885 Carpentry and Building article stated that the building was \\"one of the most conspicuous new buildings in the lower part of New York City\\", because of its juxtaposition of iron with brick and terracotta. The King's Handbook described the Potter Building as being among the city's \\"great and illustrious monuments of commercial success\\", while an 1899 architecture guidebook said that the Potter Building's \\"design is unusual and perhaps excessive in detail, but has great interest in the disposition of its masses.\\" Later, in 1991, New York Times writer David W. Dunlap described the Potter Building as \\"almost hallucinatory in its Victorian encrustation\\". Architectural writers Sarah Landau and Carl Condit characterized the Potter Building as \\"distinguished above all by its ruggedly picturesque red brick and cast-iron-clad outer walls abundantly trimmed with terra-cotta\\".

Plot summary Doctor Robert Cromwell (played by Lyle Talbot) is charged with murder when a patient dies after an experimental operation to remove a brain tumor. His pilot friend, Donald Evans (Frank Hawks), convinces \\"Doc\\" to join him on a trans-Pacific trip as a means to start a new life. They plot a flight path across the Bering Strait, but rough weather blows them off course and they end up in Alaska. There the doctor is faced with a new dilemma. Mark Armstrong (Henry B. Walthall) begs the doctor to attempt the operation on his son Jim (Jason Robards Sr.) who is crippled by a similar brain tumor. When the doctor refuses, Mark accuses him of wanting his son to die, because he is in love with Jim's fianc√©e, Klondike (Thelma Todd). \\"Doc\\" acquiesces, at Klondike's insistence. Although having none of the facilities of a hospital, he believes that the operation is less likely to succeed, the longer it is delayed. The operation seems to be a partial success. But now Jim will do anything to keep \\"Doc\\" from taking Klondike back to the States with him, even using his genius with electricity to electrocute him.

It is frequently common in practice, partially driven by the widespread poverty in many sub-Saharan African countries, and is one of the drivers for the prevalence of AIDS in Africa. (36.9% in sub-Saharan Africa) Senegal and C√¥te d'Ivoire permit the operations of brothels. In other countries, prostitution may be legal, but brothels are not allowed to operate. In some countries where prostitution is illegal, the law is rarely enforced. Transactional sexual relationships are particularly common in sub-Saharan Africa, where they often involve relationships between older men and younger women or girls. In many cases, the woman in a transactional sexual relationship may remain faithful to her boyfriend, while he may have multiple sexual partners. In both of these cases, transactional sex presents an increased risk of HIV infection. As a result, transactional sex is a factor involved in the spread of AIDS in Africa. This page uses the UN system of subregions. Central Africa Angola Prostitution in Angola is illegal and prevalent since the 1990s. Prostitution increased further at the end of the civil war in 2001. Prohibition is not consistently enforced. Many women engage in prostitution due to poverty. It was estimated in 2013 that there were about 33,00 sex workers in the country. Many Namibian women enter the country illegally, often via the border municipality of Curoca, and travel to towns such as Ondjiva, Lubango and Luanda to work as prostitutes. Cameroon Prostitution in Cameroon is illegal but tolerated, especially in urban and tourist areas. In the capital, Yaound√© the main area of prostitution is the neighbourhood of Mini Ferme. UNAIDS estimate there are 110,000 sex workers in the country. Cameroon attracts sex tourism from the West, especially for child prostitution. The Cameroonian government has attempted to stop this trade by agreeing to multilateral agreements such as charters against sex tourism, like signing up with the Universal Federation of Travels Agents Associations (UFTAA). Central African Republic Prostitution is legal and common in the Central African Republic. Procuring or profiting off the prostitution of others is illegal, as is coercing people into prostitution. Punishment is a fine and up to one year in prison, or 5 years if the case involves a minor. Human trafficking and Child prostitution is a problem in the country. A study published in 2017 found that about two thirds of the prostitutes in the capitol, Bangui, worked part-time to supplement their income or to pay school and college fees. Some of the full- time prostitutes visit hotels, bars and nightclubs looking for wealthy clients, especially French men. They are known as \\"pupulenge\\" (dragonflies) or \\"gba moundjou\\" (look at the white). Those who work in the poorer neighbourhoods are known as \\"kata\\". Chad Prostitution in Chad is illegal, but common, especially in the urban centres and the south of the country. UNAIDS estimates there are 1,200 prostitutes in the country. Many are from Cameroon. Like many Sub-Saharan African countries, HIV is a problem in Chad. Sex workers are one of the high risk groups. Lack of understanding of the infection, low usage of condoms and poor access to healthcare contribute to a HIV prevalence rate of 20%. This figure is likely to be higher in the Lake Chad area. Democratic Republic of the Congo Prostitution in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is legal but the Congolese penal code punishes pimping, running a bawdy house or brothel, the exploitation of debauchery or prostitution, as well as forced prostitution. Activities that incite minors or promote the prostitution of others have been criminalised. UNAIDS estimated there are 2.9 million sex workers in the country. Many Congolese prostitutes are from abroad or homeless children who have been accused of witchcraft. During the colonial era and the years that followed independence, the Ministry of Health issued calling cards identifying professional sex workers and provided them with medical health checks. However, this system was abandoned in the 1980s. Public order laws are sometimes used against sex workers. Street prostitutes report harassment, violence and extortion from the police. Equatorial Guinea Prostitution in Equatorial Guinea is illegal. UNAIDS estimate there to be about 6,000 prostitutes in the country. Sex trafficking is a problem in the country. Some Chinese women engage in prostitution in Equatorial Guinea. Gabon Prostitution in Gabon is illegal. UNAIDS estimate there to be about 400 prostitutes in the country. Sex trafficking is a problem Gabon. During his trial in Paris in 1995, Italian fashion designer Francesco Smalto admitted providing the then President of Gabon, Omar Bongo with Parisian prostitutes to secure a tailoring business worth $600000 per year. Republic of the Congo Prostitution in the Republic of the Congo is illegal but commonplace. The government doesn't enforce the prohibition effectively. Sex trafficking is a problem in the country. East Africa Burundi Prostitution in Burundi is illegal but is commonplace and on the rise. Prostitution is prevalent in all areas of the country, and especially in the largest city and former capital, Bujumbura, and prior to the security crisis in 2015, the tourist areas around Lake Tanganyika. UNAIDS estimate there are 51,00 prostitutes in Burundi. Many women have turned to prostitution due to poverty. Previously law enforcement made little effort to curb prostitution. Political pressures, including from the mayor of Bujumbura, Freddy Mbonimpa, have led to crackdowns all over the country. HIV, sex trafficking and child prostitution are problems in the country. Comoros Prostitution in Comoros is illegal. It is openly practices in the hotels frequented by foreign nationals. UNAIDS estimate there are 200 prostitutes on the islands. Comoros is a source country for children subjected to sex trafficking within the country. Women and girls are reportedly subjected to sex trafficking in Comoros. Comorians may be particularly vulnerable to transnational trafficking due to a lack of adequate border controls, corruption within the administration, and the existence of international criminal networks involved in human smuggling. Djibouti Prostitution in Djibouti is illegal, but tolerated. UNAIDS estimate there are 2,900 prostitutes in the country. Many work from bars and nightclubs. The is a red-light district in Djibouti City. Due to its strategic position, troops from United States, China, France, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Italy. Russia, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom are stationed in bases in Djibouti. The presence of these troops increases the demand for prostitution. During an investigation in 2015, it was found almost half of the Engineering Department of the Tennessee Army National Guard had used prostitutes whilst stationed in Djibouti. Eritrea Prostitution in Eritrea is legal and regulated. Official figures state there are around 2,000 prostitutes in the country, who are not allowed to operate near schools, hospitals, and churches. According to the 2009 Human Rights Reports, security forces occasionally follow women engaged in prostitution and arrest those who had spent the night with a foreigner. Some women enter prostitution due to poverty. Prostitutes are known locally as \\"shermuta\\" in Arabic, or \\"mnzerma\\" and \\"me'amn\\" in Tigrinya. Ethiopia Prostitution in Ethiopia is legal, but procuring (operating brothels, benefiting from prostitution, etc.) is illegal according to Article 634 of the Ethiopian Penal Code, as revised May 2005.\\"2008 Human Rights Reports: Ethiopia ‚Äì Section 5 Discrimination, Societal Abuses, and Trafficking in Persons\\", United States Department of State website (accessed 26 May 2009) Many feel it has contributed to the increased incidence of AIDS.Kathleen Griffin, \\"Ethiopia ‚Äì HIV/AIDS\\", Canadian Community Newspapers Association (accessed 26 May 2009) UNAIDS estimate there are over 19,000 prostitutes in the major cities. Ethiopia has become a magnet for sex tourism, including child sex tourism. In 2015, Ethiopian scriptwriter and film director, Hermon Hailay, directed the film Price of Love, which was inspired by her experiences growing up close to prostitutes. Kenya Prostitution in Kenya is widespread. The legal situation is complex. Although prostitution is not criminalised by National law, municipal by-laws may prohit prostitution. (Nairobi banned all sex work in December 2017). It is illegal to profit from the prostitution of others, and to aid, abet, compel or incite prostitution. (Sections 153 and 154 of the Penal Code). Many foreign men and women take part in sex tourism, which is thriving at resorts along Kenya's coast.

Related activities such as soliciting, procuring, living off the earnings of prostitution or keeping a brothel are prohibited. Public Order laws are also used against prostitutes. There are recent laws against \\"consorting with female prostitutes\\". People caught paying for sex with children under 14 can face criminal penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment.

Mozambique Prostitution in Mozambique is legal and widely practised, and the country also contains illegal brothels. The majority of the population remains below the poverty line, a situation which provides fertile soil for the development of prostitution. The arrival of peacekeepers operating under the auspices of the UN resulted in an increase in the prostitution industry. In 1992, prostitution in Mozambique had reached such proportions that the post of mediator was created between the military on the one hand and pimps and prostitutes on the other. The problem of prostitution in Mozambique came under international discussion for the first time in the mid 1990s, when the deputy head of the UN mission Behrouz Sadri accused UN peacekeepers of buying sex from underage prostitutes.

South Sudan Prostitution in South Sudan is legal but related activities such as soliciting or brothel-keeping are illegal. Since independence from Sudan in July 2011, prostitution has expanded considerably, mainly due to an influx of prostitutes from nearby African countries. In the capital, Juba, the number of prostitutes rose from a few thousand at the time of independence to an estimated 10,000 in 2014. Juba has a large percentage of foreign residents including aid workers and UN personnel. Many of these are single men, or married men living away from home.

A number of women's groups supported this as strengthening marriage.S Jacobs, T Howard. Women in Zimbabwe: Stated policy and State action, in Haleh Afshar 9ed. Women, State, and Ideology: Studies from Africa and Asia. SUNY Press, 1987 Northern Africa Algeria Prostitution in Algeria is legal but most related activities such as brothel keeping and solicitation are criminalised. As a result of Arabization of the country, the rise of Islamism and the civil unrest following the economic downturn caused by the 1980s oil glut, brothels were banned in 1982. This forced many of the prostitutes to work on the streets. There are however two brothels that continue to operate under the former French occupation rules of registration and medical examination with the complicity of the Algerian authorities. Egypt Prostitution in Egypt is illegal. Police department officially combats prostitution but, like almost all other countries, prostitution exists in Egypt.

Some are working as prostitutes in Libya to pay off debt bondage in the hope of travelling on to Italy. Morocco Prostitution has been illegal in Morocco since the 1970s. In 2015 the Moroccan Health Ministry estimated there were 50,000 prostitutes in Morocco, the majority in the Marrakech area.

Many were burnt down, in other the prostitutes were turned out and the buildings wrecked. All but those in Tunis and Sfax were closed, those two being saved by the action of locals preventing the fundamentalists entering the areas until police and military arrived.

Most prostitutes are Namibian, but there are also a significant number from Zambia, Botswana and Angola. Most women work independently and few have pimps. Most prostitutes in Namibia meet their clients either on the street or in bars. Bars often have a room on the premises for the prostitutes to use, and brothels usually have a bar, so the line between a bar and a brothel is often blurred. Some, more up-market, sex workers are contacted by cell phone or the internet and work in high-end clubs and hotels.

In 2017 the government ordered a clampdown on prostitution throughout the country. Nigeria Prostitution in Nigeria is illegal in all Northern States that practice Islamic penal code. In Southern Nigeria, the activities of pimps or madams, underage prostitution and the operation or ownership of brothels are penalised under sections 223, 224, and 225 of the Nigerian Criminal Code.

It is located on Al Waab street between the Hyatt Plaza and Sports City and has over 200 stores, including many famous brands in the U.S., U.K., Italian and German markets. Inside, the interiors are Italianate-themed both as an Italian hill town, but also with a 150-meter long indoor canal with gondolas.\\"Q.media Decaux awarded advertising contract for the Villaggio mall in Qatar\\" July 8, 2009, AME The Mall was partially re- opened on September 20, 2012, after meeting strict safety standards following the May fire that resulted in 19 lost lives. Portions of the mall remain closed as a result however, the food court, ice rink, movie theater, Carrefour hypermarket, and many stores are open for business with more opening as they are able to restock their shelves. Gondolania Theme Park The mall contains the Gondolania Theme Park, an indoor theme park which includes the Gondolania Ice Rink, one of two ice hockey rinks in Qatar, which is the home of the Qatar Ice Hockey League and the regional Desert Cup tournament. It is the only Olympic-size rink in Qatar. Also included are a ten pin bowling center and a roller coaster. 2012 fire On 28 May 2012 at around 11 A.M. a major fire broke out in the Villaggio Mall, triggering an alarm described by an eyewitness as being \\"a very benign fire alarm, almost like a door bell\\". At first many were not worried as there had been a recent false alarm. As the fire engulfed the Gympanzee nursery, the entrances to the nursery became blocked by smoke, trapping 13 children and four staff inside. Firefighters from the Qatari Civil Defense force were forced to break a hole in the roof of the mall to attempt a rescue. Along with the 17 trapped in the nursery, two firefighters were killed. The victims included children from Spain, New Zealand, France, Japan, South Africa and The Philippines; along with three Filipino teachers and one teacher from South Africa. There were also 17 injured persons as a result of smoke inhalation, most of them members of the Qatari Civil Defense force. A total of 19 people lost their lives - 13 being children; three of them triplets from New Zealand.http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/may/28/new-zealand-triplets- age-2-among-qatar-mall-dead/ The investigation committee revealed that an electrical fault at the Nike store as the cause of the deadly fire. It also found that all parties concerned had lacked adherence in varying degrees to related laws, systems and safety measures. The father of the killed triplets later said proper post-mortems weren't carried out on his children, despite the presence of \\"highly flammable paint and illegal flammable mouldings\\" at the mall. He blamed a closed emergency exit at the mall's daycare centre for the children's deaths. It is still unclear whether or not Gympanzee was operating without a license from the Supreme Educational Council, as they had recently relinquished licensing duties to the Ministry of Social Affairs. An official at the ministry claimed that no license had ever been issued by their offices.  Response and trials  Shortly following the fire, Qatar's Attorney General, Dr. Ali al-Marri, issued the arrest of five people in connection with the incident, as well as the detention of both the manager and assistant manager of Villaggio, Tzoulios Tzoulio and Rami Itani, respectively. The assistant director of mall security, Mohammed Abdul Rahman, was also detained in connection with the case. In June 2013, a lower court found five defendants guilty of involuntary manslaughter, and sentenced each to six years in jail (the maximum allowable sentence). Rami Itani and Mohammed Rahman were both acquitted. Husband and wife co-owners of Gympanzee, Sheikh Ali bin Jassim al-Thani and Iman Al-Kuwari were among those convicted, along with Tzoulios Tzoulio and Abdulaziz bin Mohammed al-Rabban. The last guilty verdict fell to Mansour Nasir Fazza al-Shahwani, the Ministry of Business and Trade employee that issued Gympanzee its permits, Mr. al-Shahwani was sentenced to five years in jail. Co-owner of Gympanzee, Sheikh Ali bin Jassim al-Thani, is Qatar's ambassador to Belgium and is part of the powerful al-Thani family, his wife, Iman al-Kuwari, is the daughter of the then-Minister of Culture, Art, and Heritage, Hamad Bin Abdulaziz Al-Kawari. Abdulaziz bin Mohammed al-Rabban is a private-businessman who owns the Qatari Company for Real Estate and Commercial Projects (Villaggio). During his closing arguments, which are reported to have lasted approximately five hours, Mr. Rabban's defense attorney claimed that his client didn't own any shares in the mall and was not a partner in the company that owned the mall. Despite these claims, Mr. Rabban remained listed on the mall's website under ‚Äúkey people‚Äù as Villagio's chairman. Mr. Rabban's defense attorney's tactics were heavily criticized by one of the parents of the victims that attended the hearing: > ‚ÄúIt is quite frustrating how the defense lawyer continues to make a mockery > out of court, joking around inappropriately and wasting time. Additionally, > what‚Äôs absurd is for him to the pin the blame on the Nike store employee,‚Äù > Raghda Kabbani ‚Äì who lost her three-year-old daughter Hana in the fire.‚Äù  Appeal process and acquittal  During the appeal process, all those convicted remained free and able to travel; this was most clearly evident in the case of Sheikh al-Thani who remained in Brussels as a diplomat despite being convicted of manslaughter nearly two years prior. Furthermore, all defendants were absent from the final appeal hearing. During the hearing, Judge Abdalrahman al-Sharafi declared that he would be excluding all testimonies given by the victim's family as evidence, claiming that one cannot be a witness and a plaintiff in the same case. Judge al-Sharafi further agreed with the owners of Gympanzee in their claim that it was not technically nursery, but an ‚Äúentertainment centre‚Äù. This decision fell inline with the civil employee that decided to license it as such. After establishing that Gympanzee was an entertainment centre rather than a nursery, the co-owners were fare less criminally-accountable under Qatari law. On the 26th of October, 2015 Qatar's Appeals court overturned all five convictions and dropped all charges. The decision was met with shock and disappointment by the families of the blaze victims. During the judge's five-hour reading of the verdict some victim's family members reportedly stormed out of the court in anger. While Mr. Rabban was also cleared of his involuntary manslaughter charge, the court found that his company was guilty of the same crime and, as such; Villaggio and its insurance company would have to pay a fine of only $5,500, and compensation to the victim's families.

A contemporary of John Blow and Henry Purcell, he is best remembered for his verse anthems, of which over forty survive. As a singer, he was a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal from 1669 until his death.Grove Life Turner's association with the Chapel Royal began in the early 1660s, when he joined the choir there as a boy soprano. In 1666 his voice broke, but the year after he became master of the choristers at Lincoln Cathedral. In 1669, however, he rejoined the Chapel Royal as a countertenor, and upon the death (1672) of Henry Cooke (who had earlier cared for Turner in the year between his voice breaking and his appointment at Lincoln) became a member of the King's Private Musick. His career as a court singer continued to prosper, and he sang in works by Blow and Purcell, including the solo alto parts in the St Cecilia's Day performances of 1687 (ode by G. B. Draghi), 1692 (ode by Henry Purcell), and 1695 (ode by John Blow). An appointment as vicar- choral of St Paul's Cathedral (1687) led to another as lay vicar of the choir of Westminster Abbey (1699). After 1696 he was normally referred to as \\"Dr Turner\\", having been granted an honorary degree from Cambridge University in June of that year.Grove Music The substantial bulk of Turner's compositions were written before 1700, and belong, for the most part, to the genre of sacred music. Amongst these works are hymns and chants, six services, more than 40 anthems (some of which include parts for string instruments), and a Latin motet. He contributed songs and incidental music to at least five plays, including songs and a choral scene for Thomas Shadwell's The Libertine.Grove He composed more than fifty secular songs, a great majority of which were published.C. L. Day and E. B. Murrie, English Song Books 1651‚Äì1702: a Bibliography (London, 1940) He also composed a small amount of instrumental music, including a handful of works for the keyboard.

Accident The Turkish Airlines F-27 departed from Esenboƒüa Airport at 16:20 EET (14:20 UTC) for a flight to Adana. The pilot reported en route passing Aksaray and estimated to arrive in Adana at 17:40 local time. At 17:28, the pilot reported at FL175 and requested a clearance to approach. At 17:40 the flight was cleared to and was asked to report crossing and . Nothing more was heard from the flight. It appeared the plane had crashed at AMSL some from the Adana radio range at Bolkar Mountains of southeastern Taurus mountain range. The probable cause of the accident was that the pilot was unable to keep track of his exact position or to maintain exact altitude in avoiding cumulus cloud, and associated turbulent conditions.

After brief work in the Civilian Conservation Corps, Gibbs enlisted in the U.S. Navy from Macon, Georgia in 1935. He re-enlisted when his four-year period of enlistment expired. During his time in the Navy, Gibbs married Joyce Powell on September 26, 1953, in Portsmouth, Virginia. The Gibbs's had a daughter, Leilani R. (Gibbs) Henry and a son, E.

Gibbs noted the unfriendly attitude of two of the officers on the U.S.S. Bear but praised the captain and the spirit of co-operation among most of the Navy and civilian members of the expedition. On January 14, 1940, the U.S.S. Bear anchored in the Bay of Whales. Gibbs wrote in his journal: > I was the first man aboard the ship to set foot in Little America and help > tie her lines deep into the snow. I met Admiral Byrd; he shook my hand and > welcomed me to Little America and for being the first Negro to set foot in > Little America. Gibbs helped to establish West Base (Little America III), near the Bay of Whales, and East Base on Stonington Island, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula. He twice made round trips between the United States and Antarctica. During the expedition, Gibbs helped catch Adelie penguins for the Smithsonian Institution. This was dangerous work because the men had to work from a rowboat in fog with a non-working radio. Only the sounding of the ship's horn gave the men bearings to find their way back to the ship. The captain of the Bear, Lieutenant Commander Richard H. Cruzen, commended Gibbs twice: first, \\"at meritorious mast for his zeal, initiative, and untiring industry, entailing much personal sacrifice,\\" during the preparation period for the Antarctic duty and second, at the end of the expedition, \\"for his outstanding zeal and energy, and for the unusual spirit of loyalty and cooperation which he has invariably displayed under trying conditions encountered during the assignment of this vessel to duty with the U.S. Antarctic Service.\\" World War II During World War II, Gibbs served in combat in the Pacific. He was a gunner on the U.S.S. Atlanta. During the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on November 13, 1942, the Atlanta was sunk by enemy fire from the Japanese battleship Hiei and a torpedo from the Japanese destroyer Akatsuki, killing about a third of the 3,000 member crew. After a night in shark-infested waters, Gibbs and the other survivors were rescued. Post-war Gibbs remained in the U.S. Navy until 1959 when he retired as a chief petty officer. Among other awards, Gibbs received the Navy Good Conduct Medal, the Asiatic- Pacific Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, National Defense Service Medal and the silver United States Antarctic Expedition Medal. Later career After Gibbs retired from the Navy, he moved to Minneapolis, graduating from the University of Minnesota in 1963 with the degree of Bachelor of Science in Education. The Gibbs family then moved to Rochester, Minnesota, where Gibbs worked in the personnel department at IBM for 18 years. He also was housing administrator and international assignment representative for IBM. Gibbs then founded his own employment company, Technical Career Placement, Inc., which he operated until 1999. Civil rights and civic leadership Gibbs became a civil rights leader and helped organize the Rochester, Minnesota Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He worked for civil rights in Rochester and on a national basis. Later, the Rochester, Minnesota branch of the NAACP presented Gibbs with the George Gibbs Humanitarianism Award. Gibbs's daughter, who plans to publish a book about her father, has said that he was very persuasive, noting that only about 50 of the 350 members of the local NAACP chapter were black. Gibbs also worked with the Minnesota-North Dakota NAACP Conference. Gibbs was president of the Rochester Kiwanis and the Rochester chapter of the University of Minnesota Alumni Association. Gibbs was a chairman of Boy Scout Troop 21 and the United Negro College Fund for southeast Minnesota. He was a member of Christ United Methodist Church. In 1974, Gibbs was denied membership in the Rochester Elks Club, which made headlines and eventually led to breaking the color barrier at that club, an accomplishment also made by Gibbs at service clubs in Rochester. George W. Gibbs Jr. died on his 84th birthday, November 7, 2000.

Goodwin is known for recording Vivekananda's speeches, and it is thought that without his efforts most of Vivekananda's works would have been lost. During his lecture tour in the United States, Vivekananda's disciples could not find a stenographer who could keep pace with his rapid speech. Therefore, his friends and admirers engaged a very expensive court-reporter, J. J. Goodwin.  Early life and early career  Goodwin was born on 20 September 1870 at Batheaston, England. His father Josiah Goodwin was a stenographer and an editor of the Birmingham Advertiser, the Wilts Country Mirror and the Exeter Gazette. Goodwin worked as a journalist from the age of fourteen, and had an unsuccessful journalistic venture in Bath in 1893. He left Bath and travelled to Australia, and later on, to America. Gooodwin mentioned about his early days in a conversation with Swami Saradananda and Mahendranath Dutta. He was a resident of a village near Bath. He had a widowed mother and two unmarried sisters. He knew short hand and used to earn his living as typist in England, Australia and America. He loved cricket, football and also gambling. Swami Vivekananda had joked about him that he was wrongly named as Goodwin and should have been named as Bad Win, alluding to his love of gambling.  Relationship with Swami Vivekananda and service to Vedanta  In America Swami Vivekananda in London in 1896. After his influential speech at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions, Swami Vivekananda travelled around America on a lecture tour. During the tour, Vivekananda's admirers wished to record his lectures and an advertisement was published in December 1895 in two New York newspapers, the Herald and the World. In response to the advertisement, twenty-five-year-old Goodwin applied for the job. He became one of Vivekananda's staunchest followers and played an important role in recording Vivekananda's ex tempore speeches. After the first week Goodwin refused any money, saying, \\"If Vivekananda gives his life, the least I can do is to give my service.\\" He accepted only what was necessary for his basic subsistence.\\"Publisher's note\\" in , p.11 Goodwin was a hard worker amidst Vivekananda's strenuous schedule: after taking the lectures stenographically, he would type them and hand over the manuscript to the newspapers and Brahmavadin and used to get prepared for the same work on the following day. Goodwin was appointed by the Vedanta Society of New York and he rented a room across the street from Vivekananda's. In the weeks between December 9 and December 23 Vivekananda gave at least 20 classes. These lectures were taken down in shorthand by Goodwin. He transcribed them and prepared full lectures for press, while short articles were prepared by another disciple Kripananda. Goodwin then went with Vivekananda to Detroit and the expenses of Goodwin was defrayed by Sara Bull who sent him $100. Goodwin was also very intimate with Sara Bull and he wrote to her about the Swami's activities and all information pertaining to his lectures and other issues. Goodwin also accompanied the Swami to his lectures in Harvard and took down his lectures. Sara Bull mentioned Goodwin and the Harvard lectures in a letter that she wrote to Mr. E.T Sturdy in England, another disciple of Swami, writing I am much pleased with the Harvard Pamphlet and Professor Everett's preface. Mr. Goodwin supplied us with the material. He is most important aid to the Swami's work, earnest, intelligent and tactful. In England Goodwin also accompanied the Swami to London in the summer of 1896 where they were joined by Swami Saradananda, a brother disciple of Swami Vivekananda. They were guests of Mr. E.T Sturdy and were joined by Mahendranath Dutta, brother of Swami Vivekananda. Goodwin had a most cordial relationship with Swami Saradananda and also encouraged him to give his first lectures in England. Mahendranath describes his impressions about J. J Goodwin that Good was twenty three or twenty four years old but he looked like that of a thirty five as he had a hard life. His heart was simple and sweet. He loved verbal jousting and if he got no chance to argue with someone he was not happy. He was an ardent British Nationalist and loved cricket and all sports. Goodwin was also a great friend and admirer of Sara Bull. He supported her during her mediation in the conflict between the Vedanta Society of New York and Mr. E.T Sturdy of London over the publishing rights of the books of Vivekananda, esp. his book on Raja Yoga. In England Sturdy was jealous of Goodwin and Goodwin did not get along with Mrs. Muller, another English disciple and host of Vivekananda. Swami Vivekananda wanted Goodwin to start more active work in America, by publishing a magazine and assist others in the study of Vedanta. Goodwin went with Swami Saradananda to America and arrived there on July 2, 1896. Sara Bull supported both Goodwin and Saradananda during their stay in New York and later in Boston. Goodwin acted as Saradananda's guide in Boston. He even opined against Saradananda teaching Raja Yoga. He was sent back to assist Swami Vivekananda and to take down notes for the final series of lectures in England and accordingly he went back to London. He left for India along with Swami Vivekananda and his English disciples, notably the Seviers. In India Goodwin reported to Sara Bull on the rousing welcome received by Swami Vivekananda in India on his arrival. The first of the letters was written on January 22, India is mad with enthusiasm for him (Swami Vivekananda). Telegrams pour in. The people regard him in every sense of the word, as a Divine Incarnation - as I do - and are constantly worshiping him. When Vivekananda came to Calcutta Goodwin accompanied him and served him. Sarat Chandra √áhakravorty, a disciple of Swami Vivekananda and author of the Diary of The Disciple narrated in his book about his first meeting with the Swami where he also mentioned about Goodwin being ever ready to serve the Swami. Goodwin accompanied Vivekananda in his tours in India in 1897 and took short hand of his lectures from Colombo to Almora. Goodwin later went to Madras and became a Brahmachari. He helped in the publishing of Brahmavadin and worked with Alasinga Perumal, another disciple of Swami Vivekananda. To earn his living he had taken up a temporary job of a correspondent of a local newspaper Madras Mail. Later he went to Ooty where after playing a game of cricket in rain he caught illness and died from the same on 2 June 1898 at the age of 27 years. Legacy In August 1898, Swami Vivekananda wrote the poem Requiescat in pace in memory of Goodwin. The poem began: ::Speed forth, O soul! upon thy star-strewn path, ::Speed, blissful one, where thought is ever free, ::Where time and sense no longer mist the view, ::Eternal peace and blessings be on thee! J.J Goodwin is remembered and honored as a disciple of Swami Vivekananda to whom are owed most of the lectures of the Swami which are written down accurately. Vivekananda had said on Goodwin, He is chosen for my work. What would I do without him! If I have a mission, he is indeed a part of it.  Death  Goodwin died on 2 June 1898 at the age of 27. was cremated at Ootcamund (ooty) Christian crematory. Soon after Vivekananda, who was in India at that time, was informed about it. Very recently, in the same year, Vivekananda had received the news of Indian yogi Pavhari Baba's death too. According to Vivekananda researcher Pravrajika Vrajaprana after receiving the death news of Goodwin, Vivekananda was \\"visibly disturbed\\". In August 1898 Vivekananda wrote in tribute: > With infinite sorrow I learn the sad news of Mr. Goodwin's departure from > this life, the more so as it was terribly sudden and therefore prevented all > possibilities of my being at his side at the time of death. The debt of > gratitude I owe him can never be repaid, and those who think they have been > helped by any thought of mine ought to know that almost every word of it was > published through the untiring and most unselfish exertions of Mr. Goodwin. > In him I have lost a friend true as steel, a disciple of never-failing > devotion, a worker who knew not what tiring was, and the world is less rich > by one of those few who are born, as it were, to live only for others. Goodwin's mother and sister wrote to Swami Vivekananda in reply to his condolence letter, thanking him for the influence for good Vivekananda had been to Goodwin. Swami Saradananda reported in his letter to Sara Bull on June 5, 1898, that Goodwin died on Thursday of typhoid fever. Alasinga Perumal also wrote a letter to Swami Vivekananda informing about the news of Goodwin's death. Sara Bull instructed Alasinga to collect the belongings of Goodwin and take care of necessary legal matters. Alasinga had noted that there were only a few belongings off Goodwin, a bicycle (out of order), a watch and a few papers. Sara also wrote a letter that was published in Brahmavadin on June 16. A part of her letter wrote, After his experience in New York as stenographer to the Swami, with whom he lived day and night for months, the beauty of life's highest realization, knowledge of the soul and of God, came to him as we know. His entire devotion to the Swami as the servant and friend was the fruit of his new hope and belief and the Swami's public lectures as recorded by Mr. Goodwin are his permanent contribution to us. This young man embodied the integrity and honour of the gentleman to enemy and friend alike, in brief; he was a true Englishman with the spirit of sympathy, responsive to the noble and divine wherever he found it, at home or abroad. An obituary was also published in Lahore Tribune which was also published in Indian Mirror. Lahore Tribune mentioned about his trips with Vivekananda to Lahore and Jammu in 1897.

Kazimierz Jasi≈Ñski, Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w ma≈Çopolskich i kujawskich, Pozna≈Ñ - Wroc≈Çaw 2001, p. 105. of Inowroc≈Çaw (; c. 1245 - October/24 December 1287), was a Polish prince, member of the House of Piast, duke of Inowroc≈Çaw during 1267-1271 and 1278-1287, and ruler over Bydgoszcz during 1267-1269 and 1278-1287. Early years Ziemomys≈Ç was the second son of Casimir I of Kuyavia and his second wife Constance, daughter of Henry II the Pious. In 1257 his mother died, and his father soon married for the third time with Euphrosyne, daughter of Casimir I of Opole. Ziemomys≈Ç's stepmother soon caused conflicts in the family with her attempts to obtain territorial benefits for her own children (the eldest of them was the future Polish king W≈Çadys≈Çaw the Elbow-high) in detriment of Ziemomys≈Ç and his older full-brother Leszek the Black; some chronicles even accused Euphrosyne of attempting to poison both stepsons. Reign After his father's death in 1267 Ziemomys≈Ç inherited the district of Inowroc≈Çaw. At the beginning of his reign in the small principality, he managed to survive the invasion of the considerable forces of King Ottokar II of Bohemia, who was bounded to a Crusade against Lithuania. Was probably at this point that Ziemomys≈Ç established close contacts with the Teutonic Order and Sambor II, Duke of Pomerelia, alliances which soon brought to him serious troubles - the revolt of his own subjects. The conflict clearly emerged after Sambor II (his father-in-law since 1268) loaned Ziemomys≈Ç some German knights. This preference to foreigners disliked the local knighthood,Benedykt Zientara: Spo≈Çecze≈Ñstwo Polski od X do XX wieku, 1999, p. 198. and caused an armed conflict led by the bishop of Kujawy, Wolimir, in 1269. The rebels called the very known anti-German Boles≈Çaw the Pious to help them. Boles≈Çaw took Radziej√≥w, Kruszwica and the castle in Bydgoszcz. Only through rapid action did Ziemomys≈Ç and the grant to further privileges to Bishop Wolimir allowed him to regain temporary control of his lands. In 1271, Ziemomys≈Ç was involved in the Pomerelian affairs, in which he supported father-in-law Sambor II against Mestwin II. This decision triggered another invasion of Boles≈Çaw the Pious, which combined with another revolt of his subjects forced Ziemomys≈Ç to escape. Ziemomys≈Ç recovered his lands only in 1278 as a result of an agreement between Boles≈Çaw the Pious and Leszek the Black in LƒÖd, where Leszek II returned Inowroc≈Çaw to his brother only after he promised to take distance himself from all his German advisors. Despite the end of the conflict, Boles≈Çaw the Pious kept Radziej√≥w and Kruszwica. The complete normalization of Ziemomys≈Ç's rule took place two years later at the Congress of Rzepka, where after an agreement with Mestwin II, was stipulated that after his death the castellany of Wyszogr√≥d had to return to Inowroc≈Çaw. The final break with his pro-German policy was in 1284, when Ziemomys≈Ç supported his brother Leszek in a war against the Teutonic Order. The details of this conflict are unknown. Ziemomys≈Ç also began the process of giving Town privileges to his subjects, endowing them upon Gniewkowo. Ziemomys≈Ç died between October and 24 December 1287.Siemomys≈Ç (Siemaszko) Inowroc≈Çawski (Kujawski) in poczet.com [retrieved 18 February 2015]. It is unknown where he was buried, although is assumed that it happened in the capital of the duchy, Inowroc≈Çaw.  Marriage and issue  Probably in 1268, Ziemomys≈Ç married Salomea, daughter of Duke Sambor II of Pomerania.Janusz Bieniak, Salomea They had six children: # Euphemia (d. young, 3 March 1268/78). # Fenenna (ca. 1268/77 ‚Äì 1295) married Andrew III of Hungary. # Constance (1268/80 ‚Äì 8 August 1331), a nun.POLAND, Medieval Lands # Leszek (1275/76 ‚Äì after 27 April 1339). # Przemys≈Ç (ca. 1278 ‚Äì November 1338/16 February 1339). # Kazimierz III of Gniewkowo (1280/84 ‚Äì 22 August 1345/13 May 1350).

Its opposite is Albanophilia. History and origin Albanophobia in the 19th century Realising the seriousness of the situation and the danger of a general uprising, Re≈üid Mehmed Pasha invited the Albanian beys to a meeting on the pretext that they would be rewarded for their loyalty to the Porte.. Two of the main leaders, Veli and Arslan Bey, accepted the invitation and went together with their followers to meet with Re≈üid Mehmed Pasha at his headquarters in Monastir. On their arrival there, the Turkish commander led them into an enclosed field when they saw Turkish forces aligned in ceremonial salute parade. In fact, this was an ambush, and upon a sign from the pasha, the soldiers opened fire on the surprised Albanian beys and their personal guards. All the Albanians who had entered the field, some four to five hundred, were killed, while Arslan tried in vain to escape. He was killed by Ottoman forces after a short pursuit.. In 1889, Spiridon Gopƒçeviƒá published an ethnographic study titled Old Serbia and Macedonia that was a Serbian nationalist book on Kosovo and Macedonia and contained a pro-Serbian ethnographic map of Macedonia. Gopƒçeviƒá's biographer argues that he did not actually go to Kosovo and the study is not based on authentic experiences. Within scholarship Gopƒçeviƒá's study has been noted for its plagiarisms, manipulations and misrepresentations, especially overstressing the Serbian character of Macedonia. Gopƒçeviƒá's views on Serbian and Albanian populations in Kosovo and also the issue of the Arnauta≈° theory or Albanians of alleged Serbian (descent) have only been partially examined by some authors..\\"In 1889 the journalist Spiridon Gopƒçeviƒá (1855-1936) published an allegedly scientific, but for all intents and purposes Serbian nationalist monograph on Macedonia and \\"Old Serbia\\" (i.e. Kosovo). Gopƒçeviƒá‚Äôs biographer nevertheless argues that the monograph is not the result of authentic experiences and that he was never in Kosovo. While his manipulations with respect the allegedly Serbian character of Macedonia have already been the topic of exhaustive research, his views on the mutual relations between the Serbian and Albanian populations of Kosovo, in particular with respect to the contested notion of so- called Arnauta≈°\\" (Albanians of alleged Serbian (descent), have been only addressed superficially by various authors. Whatever the final judgment might be, Gopƒçeviƒá‚Äôs monograph represents a singular attempt to combine sympathies for the cultural development of the Serbian nation with the aspirations of Austria-Hungary as a Great Power in the Balkans.\\" Noted for being an ardent Serbian nationalist, his book Old Serbia and Macedonia is seen as a work that opened the path for unprecedented Serbian territorial claims in the region.

Weimar 1813. ‚Äú. The Expulsion of the Albanians was a lecture presented by the Yugoslav historian Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá (1897‚Äì1990) on 7 March 1937. The text elaborates on the ethnic composition dynamics of Kosovo and other Albanian populated areas within Yugoslavia from medieval times to present. While explaining why any previous methods put in place by the Yugoslav authorities to overturn the ethnic majority of the Albanians in those areas, such as slow colonization or agrarian reforms, had failed so far, it suggested in details a radical solution, the mass expulsion of Albanians. The expulsion was seen by ƒåubriloviƒá as a geopolitical measure, as to prevent potential Albanian irredentism. 20th century A series of massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars were committed by the Montenegrin Army, Serbian Army and paramilitaries, according to international reports. During the First Balkan War of 1912‚Äì13, Serbia and Montenegro during the war with the Ottoman forces (many Albanians were among the Ottoman forces) and after expelling the official Ottoman Empire's forces in present-day Albania and Kosovo - committed numerous war crimes against the Albanian population, which were reported by the European, American and Serbian opposition press.Leo Freundlich: Albania's Golgotha Most of the crimes happened between October 1912 and summer of 1913. The goal of the forced expulsions and massacres of ethnic Albanians was a statistic manipulation before the London Ambassadors Conference which was to decide on the new Balkan borders. According to contemporary accounts, between 20,000 and 25,000 Albanians were killed or died because of hunger and cold during that period.Archbishop Laz√´r Mjeda: Report on the Serb Invasion of Kosova and Macedonia Most of the victims were children, women and old people and were part of an warfare of extermination. Aside from massacres, civilians had their lips and noses severed. Albanophobia in the literature Karl May represents the Albanian stereotype in some of his works. Especially in the novel \\"Through the Land of Shippers\\", published in 1892. In a criticism of this novel, Michael Schmitt-Some cited these stereotypes in 1995, the reasons for their origin and their later use. Collective characteristics of the Albanians: positive (will to independence, powerful demeanor, seriousness, complexity towards the enemy); negative (inhospitable, relentless, cold, hate, revenge, anger, mutual suspicion, isolation, fragmentation, rejection of state authority, rejection of common law, right of the stronger) Origins and forms The term \\"Albanophobia\\" was coined by Anna Triandafyllidou on a report analysis called Racism and Cultural Diversity in the Mass Media published in 2002. Although, the first recorded usage of the term comes from 1982 in The South Slav journal, Volume 8 by Albanian author Arshi Pipa.The South Slav journal, Volume 8 page 21, Arshi Pipa (1982). The report by Triandafyllidou represented Albanian migrants in GreeceBy Anna Triandafyllidou, Racism and Cultural Diversity In the Mass Media, Robert Schuman Centre, European University Institute, pp. 149 and was followed by other researchers like Karyotis in Greece and Mai in Italy. The hyphenated form \\"Albano-phobia\\" is used on some references (including Triandafyllidou), apparently with the same meaning. Albanian stereotypes that formed amid the creation of an independent Albanian state, and stereotypes that formed as a result of massive immigrations from Albania and Kosovo during the 1980s and '90s, although they may differ from each other, are still both considered Albanophobic and anti-Albanian by many authors such as Triandafyllidou, Banac, Karyotis. Albanophobia signifies a wider range of concepts that could be roughly grouped in two main categories: * Albanophobia as xenophobic - referring to stereotypes in countries with a considerable number of Albanian immigrants like Greece, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, France and United States. * Albanophobia as nationalistic - referring to stereotypes in countries with active disputes with Albanian ethnicity in the region, most commonly ex- Yugoslav countries (Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro). The second is more likely to be associated with the term anti-albanianism.  Greece  The stereotype by some in Greece of Albanians as criminal and degenerate in Greece has been subject of a 2001 study by the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights (IHFHR) and by the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC).(EUMC Nov. 2001, 25, 38 n. 85) It is considered that prejudices and mistreatment of Albanians to be still present in Greece. According to a 2002 statement of the IHFUR, the Albanians are the most likely ethnic group in Greece to be killed by Greek law enforcement officials. In addition, the EUMC singles out ethnic Albanians as principal targets of racism. Furthermore, the EUMC found that undocumented Albanian migrants \\"experience serious discrimination in employment, particularly with respect to the payment of wages and social security contributions\\". Albanians are often pejoratively named and or called by Greeks as \\"Turks\\", represented in the expression \\"Turkalvanoi\\".Millas, Iraklis (2006). \\"Tourkokratia: History and the image of Turks in Greek literature.\\" South European Society & Politics. 11. (1): 50. \\"The 'timeless' existence of the Other (and the interrelation of the Self with this Other) is secured by the name used to define him or her. Greeks often name as 'Turks' various states and groups‚Äîsuch as the Seljuks, the Ottomans, even the Albanians (Turkalvanoi)\\".Megalommatis, M. Cosmas (1994). Turkish- Greek Relations and the Balkans: A Historian's Evaluation of Today's Problems. Cyprus Foundation. p. 28. \\"Muslim Albanians have been called \\"Turkalvanoi\\" in Greek, and this is pejorative.\\" Albanians in Greece are also classified in terms as \\"savage\\", while the Greeks view themselves as \\"civilised\\".Nitsiakos, Vassilis (2010). On the border: Transborder mobility, ethnic groups and boundaries along the Albanian-Greek frontier. LIT Verlag. p. 65. \\"The few exchanges also bear the imprint of the above structural asymmetry and reflect the level of development of the two countries. While mainly agricultural and dairy products (drugs and weapons are a separate chapter) flow in from Albania, mostly uncontrollably, from Greece to Albania we have, in addition to money, a flow of a great gamut of material goods and products, from simple items of everyday use and consumption, to electrical equipment and cars. One may say that, whereas Albanian products represent \\"nature\\", Greek ones represent \\"civilization\\", a dichotomy that characterises the differences of the two groups from the point of view of the Greeks: Albanians are classified as \\"savage\\", while Greeks as \\"civilized\\", a fact that expresses, of course, the general racist attitude of the Greeks.\\" Prejudicial representations of Albanians and Albanian criminality (see Albanian mafia) by the Greek media is largely responsible for the social construction of negative stereotypes, in contrast to the commonly held belief that Greek society is neither xenophobic nor racist.Diversity and equality for Europe Annual Report 2000. European Monitoring Centre of Racism and Xenophobia, p. 38 In March 2010, during an official military parade in Athens, Greek soldiers chanted \\"They are Skopians, they are Albanians, they are Turks we will make new clothes out of their skins\\". The Civil Protection Ministry of Greece reacted to this by suspending the coast guard officer who was in charge of the parade unit, and pledged to take tough action against the unit's members.  Italy  Albanophobia in Italy is primarily related to the Albanian immigrants mainly young adults who are stereotypically seen as criminals, drug dealers and rapists. Italian media provide a lot of space and attention to crimes committed by ethnic Albanians, even those just presumed.  Switzerland  Not infrequently, the Albanian diaspora in Switzerland is affected by xenophobia and racism. Many integration difficulties and criminal offenses of some criminal Albanians has caused many Swiss to be prejudiced against Albanians, which has led to fear, hatred and insecurity. Political parties that publicly oppose excessive immigration and the conservatism of traditional Swiss culture - in particular the Swiss People's Party (SVP) - strengthen this negative attitude among many party supporters. These parties have already launched a number of popular initiatives, which were referred to by the Albanians as discriminatory. In 1998, the Zurich SVP created an election poster with the words \\"Kosovo Albanians\\" and \\"No\\" in large letters when it came to financing an integration project for Albanians. In 2009, the Swiss People's Initiative \\"Against the Construction of Minarets\\" was adopted by the Swiss people. Many Muslim Albanians were outraged by this result and expressed their rejection. In 2010, the so-called \\"expulsion initiative\\" followed, which was also adopted by the voters. According to the law, foreigners who have committed serious crimes should be expelled from the country. The initiative on foreigners crime should thus reduce the crime rate and make the naturalization of foreigners more difficult. The \\"Sheep's Poster\\" designed by the SVP attracted international attention and was again described by many immigrant organizations in Switzerland as discriminatory. Economic integration continues to present difficulties for Albanians in Switzerland. In October 2018, Kosovo's unemployment rate was 7.0% and in Macedonia population 5.3%, well above the figure for the rest of the permanent resident population. A study by the Federal Office for Migration justifies this with in part low vocational qualifications among the older generation and the reservations that Albanian youth are exposed to when entering the world of work. In the 1990s, many well- qualified Albanians, because of unrecognized diplomas, with jobs such. B. in construction or in the catering trade, in which the unemployment is generally higher. This also has implications for the social assistance rate, which is higher for ethnic Albanians, with significant differences depending on the country of origin. The most affected are people from Albania. In contrast, the number of students with Albanian descent is increasing today. In 2008, only 67 people were enrolled at Swiss universities, there are already 460 in 2017. Albanologists and migration researchers today assume that the integration and assimilation of Albanians is increasing, analogous to the development of Italians in Switzerland. In its annual report, Amnesty International stated in 2010 that the \\"anti-minaret initiative\\" stigmatized Albanian Muslims in Switzerland and increased racism in Switzerland in general  Montenegro By 1942, the city of Bar became a home of many Serbians and other refugees who were forced to flee from Kosovo and to escape the violence done by Albanian units. Many of these joined the Partisan forces and participated in their activities at Bar. The victims were Albanian recruits from Kosovo, who had been pressed by the Yugoslav Partisans into service. These men were then assembled in Prizren and marched on foot in three columns to Bar where they were supposed to receive short training and then sent off to the front. The march took the rugged mountain ranges of Kosovo and Montenegro to reach its destination. Upon arrival locals reported that these men, who had marched a considerable distance, were \\"exhausted\\" and \\"distressed\\". The column of men which stretched a few kilometres were then gathered on the Barkso Polje. At one point, in Polje, one of the Albanians from the column attacked and killed one of the Yugoslav officers, Bo≈æa Dabanoviƒáa. Very soon after that somebody from the column threw a smuggled bomb at the commander of the brigade. This created a panic among the Partisans. The guards watching over the recruits then fired into the crowd killing many and prompting the survivors to flee into the surrounding mountains. In another case, several hundred Albanians were herded into a tunnel, near Bar, which was subsequently sealed off so that all of those trapped within the tunnel were asphyxiated. Yugoslav sources put the number of victims at 400 while Albanian sources put the figure at 2,000 killed in Bar alone. According to Croatian historian Ljubica ≈†tefan, the Partisans killed 1,600 Albanians in Bar on 1 April after an incident at a fountain. There are also accounts claiming that the victims included young boys. Other sources cited that the killing started en route for no apparent reason and this was supported by the testimony of Zoi Themeli in his 1949 trial. Themeli was a collaborator who worked as an important official of the Sigurimi, the Communist Albanian secret police. After the massacre, the site was immediately covered in concrete by the Yugoslav communist regime and built an airport on top of the mass grave.  North Macedonia  Ethnic tensions have simmered in North Macedonia since the end of an armed conflict in 2001, where the ethnic Albanian National Liberation Army attacked the security forces of North Macedonia with the goal of securing greater rights and autonomy for the ethnic Albanian minority. The Macedonian Academy for Science and Art was accused of Albanophobia in 2009 after it published its first encyclopedia in which was claimed that the Albanian endonym, Shqiptar, means \\"highlander\\" and is primarily used by other Balkan peoples to describe Albanians, if used in South Slavic languages the endonym is considered derogatory by the Albanian community. The encyclopaedia also claimed that the Albanians settled the region in the 16th century. Distribution of the encyclopedia was ceased after a series of public protests. On 12 April 2012, five ethnic Macedonian civilians were shot dead allegedly by ethnic Albanian in an attack known as the ≈Ωelezarsko lake killings. On 16 April 2012, in the wake of the attack, an anti-Albanian protest was held in Skopje by ethnic Macedonians in which the participants were recorded chanting \\"a good Shqiptar is a dead Shqiptar\\" and \\"gas chambers for Shqiptars\\". On 1 March 2013 in Skopje, a mob of ethnic Macedonians protested against the decision to appoint Talat Xhaferi, an ethnic Albanian politician, as Minister of Defence The protest turned violent when the mob started hurling stones and also attacking Albanian bystanders and police officers alike. The police reports 3 injured civilians, five injured police officers and much damage to private property. Although the city hospital reported treating five heavily injured Albanian men, two of which are on Intensive-care unit. During this protest part of the mob burned the Albanian flag. On the 108th anniversary of the Congress of Manastir the museum of the Albanian alphabet in Bitola was vandalized, the windows and doors were broken. A poster with the words \\"Death to Albanians\\" and with the drawing of a lion cutting the heads of the Albanian double-headed eagle was placed on the front doors of the museum. One week after this incident, on the day of the Albanian Declaration of Independence graffiti with the same messages, as those of the previous week, were placed on the directorate of Pelister National Park. Serbia The origins of anti-Albanian propaganda in Serbia started by the end of 19th century and the reason for this was the claims made by Serbian state on territories that were about to be controlled by Albanians after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.By Ivo Banac, The national question in Yugoslavia - origins, history, politics, page 293 By the late nineteenth century, Albanians were being characterized by Serbian government officials as a \\"wild tribe\\" with \\"cruel instincts\\". Others from Serbia's intelligentsia such as the geographer Jovan Cvijiƒá referred to Albanians as being \\"the most barbarous tribes of Europe\\".Stefanoviƒá, Djordje (2005). \\"Seeing the Albanians through Serbian eyes: The Inventors of the Tradition of Intolerance and their Critics, 1804-1939.\\" European History Quarterly. 35. (3): 472. \\"Officials of the Serbian Ministry of Foreign affairs described Albanians as a 'wild tribe' with 'cruel instincts'.... A number of Serbian intellectuals and journalists added to the angry hate propaganda that seemed to culminate during the preparations for the Balkan Wars. Cvijiƒá argued that 'there is a general consensus that the Albanians are the most barbarous tribes of Europe'. Another intellectual described the Albanians as 'European Indians' and 'lazy savages'.\\" Whereas politician Vladan ƒêorƒëeviƒá described Albanians as \\"modern Troglodytes\\" and \\"prehumans, who slept in the trees\\" with still having \\"tails\\" in the nineteenth century.Gay, Peter (1993). The Cultivation of Hatred: The Bourgeois Experience: Victoria to Freud (The Bourgeois Experience: Victoria to Freud). WW Norton & Company. p. 82. \\"In 1913, Dr. Vladan Djordjeviƒá, a Serbian politician and expert in public health, characterized Albanians as bloodthirsty, stunted, animal‚Äîlike, so invincibly ignorant that they could not tell sugar from snow. These \\"modern Troglodytes\\" reminded him of \\"prehumans, who slept in the trees, to which they were fastened by their tails.\\" True, through the millennia, the human rail had withered away, but \\"among the Albanians there seem to have been humans with tails as late as the nineteenth century.\\"\\" On the eve of the First Balkan War 1912, Serbian media had implemented a strong anti-Albanian campaign.Dimitrije Tucoviƒá, Srbija i Arbanija (in Izabrani spisi, book II, pp. 56) Prosveta, Beograd, 1950. Throughout the 1930s, anti-Albanian sentiment existed in the country and solutions for the Kosovo question were put forward that involved largescale deportation. These included Yugoslav-Turkish negotiations (1938) that outlined the removal of 40,000 Albanian families from the state to Turkey and another was a memorandum (1937) entitled \\"The Expulsion of the Albanians\\" written by a Serbian scholar Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá (1897-1990). The document proposed methods for expelling Albanians that included creating a \\"psychosis\\" by bribing clergymen to encourage the Albanians to leave the country, enforcing the law to the letter, secretly razing Albanian inhabited villages, ruthless application of all police regulations, ruthless collection of taxes and the payment of all private and public debts, the requisitioning of all public and municipal pasture land, the cancellation of concessions, the withdrawal of permits to exercise an occupation, dismissal from government, the demolition of Albanian cemeteries and many other methods.ƒÜubriloviƒá, Vaso, The Expulsion of the Albanians: Memorandum 1937 Aleksandar Rankoviƒá, the Yugoslav security chief had misgivings and a strong dislike of Albanians. Following the Second World War and until 1966, Rankoviƒá upheld Serbian control of Kosovo through repressive anti-Albanian policies. According to Olivera Milosavljeviƒá, from the mid-1980s along with Albanian name were used words such as \\"genocide\\", \\"oppression\\", \\"robbery\\" and \\"rape\\", while negative connotation was carried by mention of this national minority in political speeches. Modern intellectuals according to Milosavljeviƒá write about Albanians mainly within stereotype framework about theirs hatred towards Serbs which is \\"congenital\\" and with desire for their destruction, which is a product of their dominant characteristic such as \\"robbery\\" and \\"primitivism\\".Olivera Milosavljeviƒá; (2002) U tradiciji nacionalizma ili stereotipi srpskih intelektualaca XX veka o \\"nama\\" i \\"drugima\\" p.218-219; Helsin≈°ki odbor za ljudska prava u Srbiji During the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, on some occasions activities undertaken by Serbian officials in Kosovo have been marked as albanophobic.By Neboj≈°a Popov, Drinka Gojkoviƒá, The road to war in Serbia: trauma and catharsis, pp. 222 The Serbian media during Milo≈°eviƒá's era was known to espouse Serb nationalism while promoting xenophobia toward the other ethnicities in Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians were commonly characterized in the media as anti-Yugoslav counter- revolutionaries, rapists, and a threat to the Serb nation.International Centre Against Censorship. \\"Forging War: The Media in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia- Herzegovina\\". International Centre Against Censorship, Article 19. Avon, United Kingdom: Bath Press, May 1994. P55 During the Kosovo War, Serbian forces continually discriminating Kosovo Albanians: A survey in Serbia showed that 40% of the Serbian population would not like Albanians to live in Serbia while 70% would not enter into a marriage with an Albanian individual. In 2012, Vuk Jeremiƒá, a Serb politician made comments on Twitter about the rights and wrongs of the Kosovo dispute and compared Albanians to the \\"evil Orcs\\" of the movie The Hobbit.Barlovac, Bojana (19 December 2012). \\"Jeremic Likens Kosovars to 'Hobbit's' Evil Orcs\\". Balkan Insight. Retrieved 16 May 2015.

Marcum remains missing and is presumed dead, while the other three bodies were recovered in remote Colorado and Utah locations. Kimball has boasted to friends of multiple other murders, but authorities have uncovered no direct evidence corroborating his claims. Background Kimball was born in Boulder, Colorado. He was convicted of check fraud after stealing over $50,000 from an optometrist who shared an office with his mother, an insurance agent. Kimball was sentenced to prison for fraud, but was released in 2003. His early release came after he convinced FBI agents that he would work for them as an informant. In prison, Kimball had befriended fellow convict Steve Ennis who was allegedly plotting to kill his estranged girlfriend Jennifer Marcum. Given that Marcum was expected to testify in an important trial about a methamphetamine distribution ring, FBI agents agreed to work with Kimball. Kimball went on to kill Marcum and three others. Kimball is currently serving his sentence at Colorado State Penitentiary. Other crimes In September 2010, it was reported that the FBI was investigating Kimball as a possible suspect in the murder and mutilation of a woman found in Westminster, Colorado, in October 2004, while Kimball lived in the area under FBI supervision. In December 2010, Kimball told a cousin that he had been proposed as a suspect in the West Mesa murders in New Mexico, which were committed during the same 2003-2005 time period. He denied involvement. Popular culture The CBS News series 48 Hours outlines Kimball's case in an episode titled \\"Hannibal Unmasked\\", originally aired April 2010.

The special significance of Angadipuram to laterites is that it was here that Dr. Francis Buchanan-Hamilton, a professional surgeon, gave the first account of this rock type, in his report of 1807, as \\"indurated clay\\", ideally suited for building construction. This formation falls outside the general classification of rocks namely, the igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary rocks but is an exclusively \\"sedimentary residual product\\". It has a generally pitted and porous appearance. The name laterite was first coined in India, by Buchanan and its etymology is traced to the Latin word \\"letritis\\" that means bricks. This exceptional formation is found above parent rock types of various composition namely, charnockite, leptynite, anorthosite and gabbro in Kerala. It is found over basalt in the states of Goa, Maharashtra and in some regions of Karnataka. In Gujarat in western India, impressive formations of laterite are found over granite, shale and sandstone.. Apart from its use as bricks in building construction, it has other substantial economic value, since it has been established that laterites are closely juxtaposed with aluminium ore (bauxite), iron ore and nickel ore mineral deposits in many parts of Kerala. A monument giving details of the Laterites over a pedestal made of laterite The GSI has erected a monument at Angadipuram (see picture) where the laterite formations were first identified, as one of the 26 monuments declared as National Geological Monuments, on the occasion of the \\"International Conference on Laterization\\" held in 1979. Angadipuram is also well known as a pilgrimage centre for its famous temples, the Thirumandhamkunnu temple and the Tali temple. Geography Kerala agro- ecological zones map Angadipuram is situated in the Malappuram district, which lies in northern Kerala, and is bounded on the north by Wayanad and Kozhikkode districts, on the northeast by Tamil Nadu, on the southeast and south by Palakkad District, on the southwest by Thrissur District, on the west by the Arabian Sea, and on the northwest by Kozhikode District (see Kerala eco zones map). The geographical distribution of laterite is not limited to Angadipuram in Malappuram district but it is also found in the midland regions and highlands of Kerala. Its occurrence extends to Aleppey, Quilon, Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam, Trichur and Cannanore districts. Overall, in the landform of Kerala which has seven landscape ecological zones, laterites account for a major share of 50%. This land form comprises lateritic mesa, mounds, slopes and ridges. This dominant laterite setting is delimited between altitudes and (though found up to elevation and extends from the northern end to the southern tip of the state. Further, as the topography changes a few kilometers from the sea to the east, there are numerous valleys called elas where patches of paddy fields, coconut and arecanut groves are seen. Incidence of laterite in other parts of India is reported in the states of Karnataka Maharashtra and Gujarat. Apart from India, its global occurrence in the form of vast deposits of lateritic bauxites with rich production is reported in Australia, Brazil, Guinea, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela. ;Climate The intense southwest Monsoon rainfall in Kerala (average annual rainfall is 3,107 mm) coupled with high temperatures (mean annual temperatures range from 25 to 27.5 ¬∞C in the coastal lowlands to 20 to 22.5 ¬∞C in the eastern highlands) and lush vegetation (belongs to the Malabar Coast moist forests of a tropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregion of southwestern India) has accentuated the chemical processes over the base rocks, which has resulted in the formation of laterites. In view of these conditions, the laterization process, which results in formation of laterites, is called the \\"Tropical disease of rocks\\".\\"GSI\\" p. 46 Structure Laterite formation cut into blocks for building construction Laterite is a residual product created by the natural process of rocks weathering in the hot humid climatic conditions and interaction with water, oxygen and carbon dioxide. In simple terms, it is a soil formation linked to the parent rock material that has evolved because of various powers of nature in the same manner as other types of soils such as alluvial soil, regular soil and red soil. It is also inferred that paleoclimate dating back several million years has been a causative factor in laterite formation. The residue usually consists of enriched iron, aluminum and titanium oxides in varying proportions. The residue is pitted and porous in appearance. Buchanan, who discovered this formation in Kerala, in his report of 1807 observed: > It is diffused in immense masses, without any appearance of stratification > and is placed over the granite that forms the basis of Malayala. It is full > of cavities and pores and contains a large quantity of iron in the form of > red and yellow ochres. In the mass, while excluded from air, it is so soft, > that any iron instrument readily cuts it, and it is dug up in square masses > with a pick-axe, and immediately cut into the shape wanted with a trowel or > a large knife. It, very soon after, becomes as hard as brick, and resists > air and water much better than any bricks that I have seen in India‚Ä¶ \\"GSI\\" pp. 46, 47 In the midland region of Kerala where lateritic soil is predominant, laterites form a residual deposit due to weathering of either crystalline or sedimentary rocks with thickness varying from . They also form plateaus. These laterite plateaus are attributed to various phases of uplift of the land in terraced formations in this region. However, in Malappuram, Kozhikode and Kannur districts in the plateau region, laterites are of greater thickness. It is also noted that top layer of laterite, over the crystalline rocks, is very compact. It is also reported by GSI that in Kerala: > Quartz veins, joints and fractures can be traced from the top to the bottom > of the laterite profile. The laterite profile over pyroxene granulites, > metaultramafites and gneisses are characterised by relict foliation that > conforms to those of the subjacent rocks which indicate the in situ nature > of the laterite. Porous and spongy texture is discernible in laterites, > after meta-ultramafites. Laterite derived from Tertiary sedimentary rocks is > well indurated at the top for about . Downwards, the profile grades into > soft laterite with remnants of gritstone and culminates into a zone of > variegated clay. ;Chemical composition It has been inferred from chemical analysis of Angadipuram laterites that they are a derivative of charnockite. The laterite which occurs at an average elevation of about in the Angadipuram area have an admixture of pyroxene granulite, charnockite and migmatite. The results of the chemical analysis of samples of these laterites indicate the following composition.\\"GSI\\" p. 47 * SiO2 \\\\- 32%, Al2O3 ‚Äì 29.38%, Fe2O3 ‚Äì17.38%, TiO2 ‚Äì 2.05%, Na2O ‚Äì 0.95%, KO ‚Äì 0.27%, CaO ‚Äì 0.3% and MgO ‚Äì 0.2% Spatial variations have been recorded in the chemical composition of laterites in Kerala. Economic uses The economic importance of laterites comes from the mining of metals, particularly nickel and aluminium. Bauxite is an aluminium-rich laterite variety, which is commercially in demand. Bauxite patches are found with laterites overlying for a thickness varying from about . Worldwide resources inventory indicates that laterites are a major source of nickel and account for 70% of resources. But nickel production from this source is limited to about 40% of the total world production. Pepper one of the commercially important spices of Kerala is grown in red laterites as it provides well drained conditions with good water holding capacity. It is also rich in humus and essential plant nutrients. Access Angadipuram has a flourishing tourist industry because of its famous temples and is located about from Malappuram on the road to Palghat. It is an important railway station on the Shoranur ‚Äì Nilambur railway line. The main road from Palghat (Palakkad) to Calicut (Kozhikode) passes through Angadipuram via Perinthalmanna. Perinthalmanna is the taluk headquarters located from Angadipuram. The nearest airport is Calicut (Kozikode), away.\\"GSI\\" p. 48 Gallery File:Abandoned laterite quarry.

Each division was to be under the administration of one of the Home Commands, and Western Command formed what became the 13th (Western) Division. It was followed by 19th (Western) Division of K2 in September 1914. Second World War Increasing concern during the 1930s about the threat of air attack led to large numbers of units of the part-time Territorial Army (TA) being converted to anti-aircraft (AA) gun and searchlight roles in the Royal Artillery (RA) and Royal Engineers (RE), and higher formations became necessary to control them.

Senator Thuli Mswane and NGOs Eswatini AIDS Support Organisation (SASO), Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Taskforce (SWEAT) and Mpumalanga Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) have recommended that prostitution be legalised in Eswatini, in order to allow it to be regulated to reduce harm to the prostitutes and limit the spread of HIV. Sex trafficking, child prostitution and HIV are problems in the country. Overview It was estimated that there were around 4,000 sex workers in the country in 2015, with the highest concentrations in Matsapha, Manzini, Malkerns and Ezulwini. Most sex workers are Mozambican or Swazi.Swaziland. State.gov (8 March 2006). Retrieved on 2011-04-02. It is reported that sex workers are subject to abuse and forced sex by police. Some prostitutes occasionally travel to other countries, especially Maputo in Mozambique, to work on a temporary basis. Many women and children turn to prostitution because of poverty. After European settlement; westernisation, the development of urban centres and migrant labour, especially in the mining areas, saw a rise in prostitution. Sex tourism by South Africans occurred in the 1970s, not only further increasing the demand for prostitution, but instigating a move by the sex workers from the mining areas to urban hotels. Eswatini was more liberal than South Africa and had no apartheid laws. In 2001, sex workers in Manzini started to offer clients sexual services on credit. During a 2007 survey, sex workers said their clients included business people, church pastors, Government officials (MPs, cabinet ministers), lawyers, lecturers, police officers, soldiers, foreigners, tourists, doctors and truck drivers. HIV HIV/AIDS in Eswatini was first reported in 1986 but has since reached epidemic proportions due in large part to cultural beliefs which discourage safe-sex practices. Coupled with a high rate of co-infection with tuberculosis, life expectancy has halved in the first decade of the millennium. Eswatini has the highest prevalence of HIV as percentage of population 19‚Äì49 in the world as of 2016 (27.2%). Sex workers are a high risk group and HIV prevalence was estimated at 60.5% in 2014. Many clients are reluctant to use condoms and will pay more for unprotected sex. Sex trafficking Eswatini is a source, destination, and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Swazi girls, particularly orphans, are subjected to sex trafficking, primarily in Eswatini and South Africa. Traffickers reportedly force Mozambican women into prostitution in Eswatini, or transport them through Eswatini to South Africa. Some Swazi women are forced into prostitution in South Africa and Mozambique after voluntarily migrating in search of work. Reports indicate a downturn in the textile industry following loss of eligibility under the African Growth and Opportunity Act in 2015 has led textile workers to follow promises of employment in neighbouring countries, potentially increasing their vulnerability to trafficking. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Eswatini as a \\"Tier 2 Watch List\\" country.

Enemies of the Mind  These are the fundamental tenets of Kali Yuga . The more each individual fights them, the longer will be the life of Dharma in this yuga. # Lust or desire (Sanskrit: ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ) ‚Äì Kama # Anger (Sanskrit: ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§ß) ‚Äì Krodha # Greed (Sanskrit: ‡§≤‡•ã‡§≠) ‚Äì Lobha # Attachment (Sanskrit: ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§π) ‚Äì Moha ‚Äì emotional attachment or temptation # Arrogance (Sanskrit: ‡§Æ‡§¶) ‚Äì Mada ‚Äì ego or pride # Jealousy (Sanskrit: ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø) ‚Äì Matsarya ‚Äì envy or jealousy According to Hindu scriptures, these bind the soul to the cycle of birth and death and keep it confined in this material world (confines of Maya or relative existence). Especially the first three are said to pave the way towards hell. The first two bring about difficult experiences we face in our lives.. The Mada or Ahankar, the false ego, all our actions in the world are for selfish ends. Hence there is no other factor causing the illusory duality of differentiation between 'us' and 'them' and the repeated pain and delusion it entails than the psychological ego-sense. When the materially identified ego has sided with the materialistic forces of creation (Maya), it is said to have the following faults: kama, krodha, lobha, moha, mada and matsarya. Also called evil passions, man's spiritual heritage constantly gets looted by these internal thieves (and their numerous variations), causing him to lose knowledge of his True Being. If a person is virtually a prisoner of arishadvargas (the six internal enemies), then his life is completely governed by destiny. As a person moves ahead on the path of Self-Realization, the grip of destiny over him loosens and he gets more and more leverage to change his destiny. When a person identifies himself with the Self, then he becomes part of the power of destiny. Merely his power of Sankalpa is good enough to materialize and change any situation either for good or bad according to his Sankalpa. Doubt has positive and negative nature, this is the opposite of the nature of an object. According to Naiyayikas, knowledge is based on perception (anubhava), which is valid. But those based on remembrance (Smriti), doubt, error, and hypothetical argument are invalid. Similar unique or rare features in an object create doubt as to where its from and perhaps when exhibited from within a person's mind or from delusions, its validity. \\"Sometimes real and false create doubt or doubt arises about the appearance of false as real.\\" (See also Maya) Like any scene of a mirage, if it is perceived then it might not be real, but if it is not perceived it can be felt or experienced. \\"Unattainability of the truth of the real, as well as the unreal, creates doubt of its reality.\\" Understanding of Shadripu According to Hindu belief, without experiencing these Shadripu at the fullest a person cannot understand the meaning of the Love which is the soul. These enemies of mind pull the human from all the sides away from the soul and make the life of the human miserable. To overcome this misery every human needs to experience all these Shadripu's and understand the consequences which later teach the person the importance of love and divinity. A human who controls all these Shadripu's even at some of the extent later enjoy's the power of peace.

This building used to be the home of the school of Mathematics and Physics. Macquarie science reform movement refers to the successful transformation of the degree system at Macquarie University in 1979 which followed an academic and political campaign initiated in 1977.F.

Macquarie University, founded in 1964, adopted a degree structure modeled after the Oxbridge tradition where all graduating students were awarded a BA regardless of their field of study, with the exception of law students. Many science students saw this as a disadvantage and began to mobilize for reform of the degree structure. Thus, in 1977 a student organization, known as Students for a Science Degree (SSD), was formed with physicist Frank Duarte as chairman. SSD enlisted the support of science students, student politicians, science academics, and professional science institutions. Among the senior science professors that openly supported the SSD led reform movement were Ronald E. Aitchison (Electronics), Frederick Chong (Mathematics), Brian F. Gray (Chemistry), John G. Hawke (Chemistry), Richard E. B. Makinson (Physics), Ronald H. Vernon (Geophysics), and John C. Ward (Physics). Support was particularly strong at the former school of Mathematics and Physics. The BSc campaign lasted almost two years, and most of it is documented in the _Arena_ student newspaper.F. Duarte and B. Bulliman, A what from where?, Arena 10(7), 1 (1977).F. Duarte and M. Brandt, BSc at Macquarie?, Arena 11(9), 3 (1978).F. Duarte, What's been happening with the BSc, Arena 11(11), 9 (1978).F. Duarte, The Macquarie outlook, Arena 11(13), 5 (1978).F. Duarte, AUS the redundant singularity, Arena 12(1), 12 (1979). In 1977 a front page newspaper article read: \\"A student revolt is underway at Macquarie University against an outmoded degree system.\\" The campaign winded down only when the Academic Senate of Macquarie University approved, almost unanimously, a science degree (BSc) on 11 September 1979.C. Parfitt, Macquarie University approves BSc degree, The Sydney Morning Herald, 13 September 1979. A perspective on the science reform movement is given in the book Liberality of OpportunityB. Mansfield and M. Hutchinson, Liberality of Opportunity: A History of Macquarie University (Macquarie University, Sydney, 1992). which was co-authored by Bruce Mansfield, a former professor of history and Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the University. In this account it is subtly implied that the reform movement might have been under the tutelage of J. C. Ward: \\"Ward was vocal in his denunciation of the trivia that filled up Senate agendas‚Ä¶ suitably then, it was a close student associate of Ward‚Äôs, physics PhD student Frank Duarte, who began to mobilize student opinion in favor of a change.\\" This suggestion of influence is not corroborated in any of the numerous contemporaneous articles on the subject. Besides, Ward‚Äôs own description of events states that: \\"there arose quite spontaneously from the students themselves a demand that they be allowed to graduate as Bachelor of Science.\\"J. C. Ward, Memoirs of a Theoretical Physicist (Optics Journal, Rochester, 2004). His account gives no hints of tutelage, or influence, on the student leadership, when \\"the sciences revolted.\\" In 1980, Greg Sheridan described the duel between the sciences and the Macquarie establishment as a \\"nasty, bitter bureaucratic struggle\\" won by the reformers and their allies.G.

First World War Army Order No 324, issued on 21 August 1914, authorised the formation of a 'New Army' of six Divisions, manned by volunteers who had responded to Earl Kitchener's appeal (hence the First New Army was known as 'K1'). Each division was to be under the administration of one of the Home Commands, and Scottish Command formed what became the 9th (Scottish) Division. It was followed by 15th (Scottish) Division of K2 in September 1914. The 64th (2nd Highland) Division was established in the Command by 1915 after the departure of 51st (Highland) Division for France.

Taxonomy The genus Desmostachya was originally published as Eragrostis sect. Desmostachya in The Flora of British India 7: 324. 1897. Somehow two prominent botanists, Joseph Dalton Hooker (1817‚Äì1911) and Otto Stapf (1857‚Äì1933), were originally each credited separately as the naming authority for the taxon (the type specimen for this section of Eragrostis being Eragrostis cynosuroides (Retz.) P.Beauv., itself based on a previous species taxon, Poa cynosuroides Retz.). It is generally accepted that Eragrostis sect. Desmostachya Hook.f. is the correct name for the taxon. However, E. sect. Desmostachya Stapf is accepted as the basionym for the genus name Desmostachya. A year after it was published as a section of Eragrostis, Desmostachya was published as a genus in its own right in Flora Capensis 7: 316. 1898.

History Following her launch at Appledore's yard in early 2003, Coruisk left on her delivery voyage on 2 August. She carried out berthing trials on the Clyde before taking over the Mallaig to Armadale route on 14 August. She was officially named at Armadale by Baroness Ray Michie of Gallanach at a special ceremony. Initial technical problems required to resume the service for some time. On 24 August, Coruisk lost power and struck a reef at the Mallaig harbour entrance, losing one of her propulsion units. She went to the Clyde for repairs and did not return to Mallaig that season. The following winter season at Dunoon was only slightly more successful, with slow berthing and many passenger complaints adding to her worsening reputation. Subsequent seasons have been less eventful. A temporary modification is made for the winter seasons to accommodate the gangways at Wemyss Bay and Rothesay. Layout The design of Coruisk is unique. As well as bow and stern ramps, allowing drive-through operation, she also has a port side ramp, allowing side-loading on the Clyde in winter months. The bow ramp is protected by an open visor, similar to those found on Orkney and Shetland inter-island ferries. Clearance on the car deck is . Above the car deck are two passenger decks, one containing the main lounge areas with toilets and a small shop/kiosk. A small external deck area on the same level, both fore and aft of the lounges, has stairways leading to the open deck above. Crew accommodation is on the upper deck. Sitting even further up, the bridge gives the master a view down over bow and stern. Schottel electric azimuth thrusters incorporate rotating pods protruding beneath the hull, with two propellers on each. Although similar to Voith Schneider units, the vessel proved much harder to control and manoeuvre. Service Until 2016, Coruisk was the sole vessel on the Mallaig to Armadale service in summer, relieving on the Upper Clyde in winter (when adds Armadale to her Small Isles roster). Since 2011, when the company's Dunoon service became passenger-only, Coruisk mainly relieved at Rothesay. During the winter period, Coruisk often provides a support service for the Argyll Ferries service from Gourock to Dunoon. In March 2014 she ran into the pier at Dunoon sustaining serious damage but managed to make her own way to Greenock to be assessed for repairs. In 2016, Coruisk became the second vessel on the Oban‚ÄìCraignure route alongside during the summer timetable period. She was replaced at Mallaig for the 2016 season by the much smaller , and (in between the latter's Lochboisdale‚ÄìMallaig sailings). This reshuffling of the Mallaig fleet has been largely criticised by campaigners calling for Coruisk to remain at Mallaig with . In January 2017, it was announced that Coruisk would remain on the Oban‚ÄìCraignure route for a second summer season: the Skye crossing being operated by and . This arrangement is expected to continue until enters service on the Ardrossan to Brodick ferry crossing in late 2021 and Hull 802 enters service on the Uig Triangle in summer 2022. Coruisk is expected to return to the Mallaig to Armadale route in summer 2023, partnering .

Plants grow up to tall, usually with many stems emerging from the base of the plant, and forming a tuft. The spikelets (groups of flowers) are several-flowered, with reduced upper florets. The lemma tips have between two and five teeth. Described in 1886, the genus contains five species native to California and Baja California. All plants are associated with vernal pools. Plants sprout when the pools are full but grow and flower after the pool bed has dried. These annual grasses, known generally as Orcutt grass, are all rare and federally protected in the United States. Taxonomy Orcuttia was circumscribed by George Vasey in 1886, based on a collection of O. californica made by Californian botanist Charles Russell Orcutt, for whom the genus is named. The type locality was near San Quintin Bay in Baja California. O. californica was not collected again until 1922. Orcuttia greenei was described by Vasey in 1891 from collections near Chico, Butte county, but it was later transferred to Tuctoria (an anagram of Orcuttia). Hoover surveyed the genus in 1941. Orcuttia is the type genus of the tribe Orcuttieae, which also includes Tuctoria and the monotypic genus Neostapfia. Description Orcuttia californica spikelet Orcuttia species are annual plants with fibrous roots, and, in maturity, they produce leaves that are sticky and aromatic (similar to lemon). The odour may deter predation by insects and rodents, and the sticky coating may reduce desiccation. Elongated juvenile leaves are produced before the culm (stems). The culms have a pithy interior, and stand erect to ascending (rising upwards) to decumbent (lying along the ground with the tip ascending), and occasionally become prostrate (lying trailing along the ground). The leaves feature little or no differentiation into sheath and blade; as the grass dries, the blade portion either remains flat or rolls inward. The plants grow in tufts, with culms reaching a height of up to , in the case of O. pilosa. The inflorescence is spike-like, exserted (projecting beyond) at maturity, and the spikelets are distichous, meaning they are arranged in two opposite rows. The spikelets comprise several flowers and are laterally flattened, with glumes that have between 2 and 5 irregular teeth. There are 4‚Äì40 florets, which break above the glumes, and, in maturity, between the florets. The lemmas are prominently 5-nerved (referring to a strand of vascular and supporting tissue in a leaf or similar structure); these end in prominent teeth that are 1/3 to 1/2 or more the length of the lemma. Each individual tooth is flanked on either side of the strong central nerve by an additional weaker nerve, which extends about halfway to the base of the lemma. The palea (scales) are well-developed, and have 2 nerves; there are no lodicules. There are three white or pinkish anthers, which are borne on long, slender, ribbon-like filaments at anthesis. The pistil has two elongate filament-like styles that originate from the apex of the ovary; these are stigma-like for 1/3 to 1/2 of their length, and the stigmatic hairs are short and sparse. The caryopsis (a dry one-seeded fruit in which the ovary wall is united with the seed coat) is oblong to elliptical, and slightly flattened. Species Orcuttia viscida * Orcuttia californica - California Orcutt grass (endangered). * Orcuttia inaequalis - San Joaquin Valley Orcutt grass (threatened) * Orcuttia pilosa - hairy Orcutt grass (endangered) * Orcuttia tenuis - slender Orcutt grass (threatened) * Orcuttia viscida - Sacramento Orcutt grass (endangered) Ecology and distribution All species of Orcuttia are associated with vernal pools, typically those ranging from or more in length or diameter. Before germination, seeds must be immersed in the pool mud for several months. Seedlings start as aquatic plants, first developing floating leaves, and then growing taller as the water level drops. Flowering begins within days after the water has dried out. Their seeds remain viable for several years, germinating only after their habitats have been flooded. A particular pool may have no Orcuttia plants for several dry years, but after heavy winter rains a large population may develop as the habitat dries during the spring and summer. Recreational misuse, urban development, and extensive development of irrigated agriculture has destroyed many of the specialised habitats for Orcuttia species, and they are federally and state-listed species of concern.

Morphology As with Armenoceras, Nybyoceras has a medium to large, straight shell.(Teichert 1964) Its primary diagnostic feature is its ventral siphuncle which the septa across obliquely.(Flower 1957,Teichert 1964) Ventrally, the septal necks are short and free, or recumbent for a short distance. Dorsally the brims are definitely recumbent.(Flower 1957) The connecting rings are broadly adnate to the septa ventrally at the posterior ends of the segments and dorsally at the anterior (adoral) ends.(Teichert 1964) Flower (1957) described the canal system within the siphuncle as being primarily of the single arc type, like Armenoceras, and with interconnecting tubes. Teichert (1964) describes the canal system as being reticulate to curved and branching.  Phylogengy and distribution  Nybyoceras is derived from Wutinoceras according to Flower (1976) although there is a possibility of its being derived from an early Armenoceras (Flower 1968). Nybyoceras ranges from the Middle Ordovician (Chazyan equivalent) in northeast China to the early Upper Ordovician Cobourg-Eden-Red Stage tn North America, (Flower 1976) and according to Flower (1968, 1976) left no descendant genera. Teichert on the other hand, earlier (1964) indicated that Nybyoceras gave rise to the Ordovician Selkirkoceras and to the Silurian Megadisocosorus.

Based on a story by Humphrey Pearson, the film is about the daughter of a US Army general who becomes involved with a suspected communist agitator. Plot Drue Van Allen, the daughter of an American general, is in love with communist graduate student Leonard Arner. When Leonard is ejected from a college campus for speaking to the students, a newspaper photographer takes a picture of him in Drue's car and prints it on the front page. When Drue refuses to listen to reason, the general tricks her into boarding an airplane bound for Mexico, supposedly to see her aunt Betty off, then locks her in. She is stuck in Juarez with no money to get home. After a rowdy soldier, Jeff overhears a border policeman warn her not to try to cross into the US, Jeff, whom she nicknames \\"Uncle Sam\\", strikes up a conversation, telling her he thinks she should be shot. Despite their disdain for each other, they run up a large bar bill, but neither has any money. They skip out and drive away; then Drue tells him he has stolen a government car. When they reach a border crossing, Jeff tries to stop, but Drue presses the gas pedal and they speed into Texas. They manage to evade their pursuers, but crash into a tree. They later kidnap P. J. Rooney, an easy-going, henpecked husband, to ride in his homemade trailer. He is glad to get away from his wife, Edith. They eventually con Baldy, a caretaker, into believing they are friends of his employer, Colonel Turner, and letting them stay in Turner's house. After Jeff and Drue dance, he tells her he now loves her; after thinking it over, she kisses him before they turn in for the night, in separate rooms. She later sneaks out and tries to drive away, but the authorities show up and arrest them both. General Van Allen gets Drue out of jail. He is worried about a newspaper story reporting that Drue and Leonard are going to get married and also about information he received from an immigration official that Leonard is not a citizen, but rather a suspected \\"paid propagandist\\" in the country on a student visa. When the general realizes that Drue has feelings for Jeff, he sends for Jeff. After speaking to him informally, the general sends him down to a meeting at which Leonard is supposed to speak. Jeff pretends to have changed his opinion to get Arner to let him talk to the audience. He starts out agreeing with Leonard's position, then shows people what he really stands for. A riot breaks out, and Arner is taken into custody for deportation. Drue realizes she is in love with Jeff. They get married and honeymoon in P.J.'s trailer.

The film was made to cash in on the rise of radicalism in US colleges in the 1930s. Filming started in June 1935. The film features the song \\"I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now\\", sung by Edwards. It was one of the first anti- communist movies made in the US. This saw it re-released in 1948 with the rise in anti-communist feeling. The film is also known by its reissue title Her Enlisted Man. Critical response Writing for The Spectator in 1935, Graham Greene praised the film, describing it as \\"one of the best comedies of the screen since It Happened One Night\\", and characterizing the acting of Stanwyck and Young as \\"admirable performances\\".

Current research by the Ordnance Survey is attempting to understand the landmarks, streets, open spaces, water bodies, landforms, fields, woods, and many other topological features. These commonly used descriptive terms do not necessarily use the official or current names for features; and often these concepts of places don't have clear, rigid boundaries. For example, sometimes the same name may refer to more than one feature, and sometimes people in a locality use more than one name for the same feature. When people refer to geographical regions in a vernacular form they are commonly referred to as imprecise regions. Regions can include large areas of a country such as the American Midwest, the British Midlands, the Swiss Alps, the south east of England and southern California; or smaller areas such as Silicon Valley in northern California. Commonly used descriptions of areas of cities such as a city's downtown district, New York's Upper East Side, London's square mile or the Latin Quarter of Paris can also be viewed as imprecise regions. Vernacular region Beyond \\"vernacular geography,\\" a \\"vernacular region\\" is a distinctive area where the inhabitants collectively consider themselves interconnected by a shared history, mutual interests, and a common identity. Such regions are \\"intellectual inventions\\" and a form of shorthand to identify things, people, and places. Vernacular regions reflect a \\"sense of place,\\" but rarely coincide with established jurisdictional borders.[Scheetz, George H.] \\"Whence Siouxland?\\" Book Remarks [Sioux City Public Library], May 1991. Examples of vernacular regions in the United States include Tidewater, also known as Hampton Roads, Siouxland, and the Tri-City area of Batavia, Geneva, and St. Charles, Illinois. Another can be the American South, since it can be non-officially considered as the confederate states of the U.S. Civil war, where the climate is warm and has limited snow, or by being below a certain latitude. Research The World Wide Web is a major source of geographical information submitted by non- specialists. The British Ordnance Survey is sponsoring research at the Universities of Cardiff and Sheffield, the aim of which is to study the use of vernacular geography, and to investigate how information mined from the Web can be used to generate an approximate spatial boundary for an imprecise region. The existing technology for accessing geographical data is not well adapted to the unstructured, largely text-based resources of the Web. Spatial information on the Web can be categorized geographically according to the textual content, but a major problem for GIS developers wanting to use this resource is the vague and imprecise nature of place names that are commonly employed within web documents. In pursuit of delineating vernacular regions, trigger phrases are used by the researchers to capture regular linguistic patterns, which identify relationships between geographic locations. For example, the trigger phrase ‚ÄúX is located in Y‚Äù can be \\"Birmingham is located in *\\" or \\"* is located in Birmingham\\". The completed trigger phrase is then submitted to a search engine. For each search, up to 100 results are retrieved. Duplicate results are then removed based on the URL, and snippet text and the search result is used to find candidate region members. From these results, geo-references are extracted and assigned spatial coordinates. A bounding box is then applied and the bounding box is used to find coordinates of other regions and points, apparently lying outside the candidate region. Thus it is possible to compute a boundary for the imprecise region using the points inside and outside.  Public participation tool  Cardiff University launched a web questionnaire together with mapping tools to capture people's perception of Vernacular Geography in Great Britain.

The substance did not receive interest until its potential as a dehydrogenation agent was discovered. A single-step chlorination from 2,3-dicyanohydroquinone was reported in 1965.

It crosses a small wadi, known in Hebrew as the Ayalon River, on the old road leading south to Lod and Ramla.Petersen, 2001, p. 183 The bridge is named after the village of Jindas, which until 1948 stood east of the bridgeThe Israeli Association \\"Zochrot\\", which keeps an online record of all villages and towns destroyed or depopulated during the 1948 Palestinian exodus, records the date of Jindas' occupation by the newly-founded Israeli army as July 1, 1948 . and may have been the Crusader-period \\"casal of Gendas\\" mentioned in a Latin charter dated 1129 CE.Clermont-Ganneau, 1896, vol.2, p. 117, who quotes the Cartulaire g√©n√©ral de l'ordre des Hospitaliers, no.84 It is the most famous of the several bridges erected by Sultan Baybars in Palestine, which include the Yibna and the Isdud bridges.Petersen, 2008, p. 297 History Inscription from 1273 CE Transcription of the inscription by Clermont-Ganneau in 1888 The present structure dates to AH 672/AD 1273, but is believed to be constructed on Roman foundations.O‚ÄôConnor, 1993 It was first studied in modern times by Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, who noted that an Arabic chronicle had referred to the construction by Baybars in AH 672 of two bridges of a significant nature \\"in the neighbourhood of Ramleh\\".Clermont-Ganneau, 1896, vol.2, pp.110‚Äì117 The second of these two bridges is thought to be the Yibna Bridge. Clermont-Ganneau concluded that the bridge was built using masonry reclaimed from the Church of Saint George, which had been destroyed in the Crusader-Ayyubid War. On the west and east faces of the bridge are two nearly identical inscriptions, flanked by two lions (or leopards). The inscription on the east reads as follows: > Bismallah..., and blessings on their lord Muhammad, his family and his > companions. The building of this blessed bridge was ordered by their master, > the great Sultan al-Malik al-Zahir Rukn al-Din Baybars, ibn Abd Allah, in > time of his son their Lord Sultan al-Malik al-Said Nasir al-Din Baraka Khan, > may Allah glorify their victories and grant them His grace. And that, under > the direction of the humble servant aspiring to the mercy of Allah. Ala al- > Din Ali al-Suwwaq, may Allah grant grace to him and his parents, in the > month of Ramadan, the year 671 H. [March‚ÄìApril 1273 C.E.] Ala al-Din Ali al-Suwwaq was the same official charged with overseeing the construction of the Great Mosque of Lydda three years earlier.Petersen, 2001, p. 184 In 1882 the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine noted that Jisr Jindas had a representation of two lions and an Arabic text. It further noted that it appeared to be \\"Saracenic work\\".Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, pp. 264‚Äì5 Description The bridge is over long and wide, and runs north-south. It consists of three arches and two central piers, with the central arch wider than the two other arches. Baybars panthers or lions In his native Turkic language, Baibars' name means \\"great panther\\". Possibly based on that, Baibars used the panther as his heraldic blazon, and placed it on both coins and buildings. On the Bridge of Jindas, the lions/panthers used play with a rat, which may be interpreted to represent Baibars' Crusader enemies. According to Moshe Sharon, the lions on Jisr Jindas are similar to the ones on the Lions' Gate in Jerusalem, and Qasr al-Basha in Gaza. All represent the same sultan: Baybars. The Gaza lions were created with interlocking lines suggesting leopard spots, however, the felines' outline is similar. Sharon estimates that they all date to approximately 1273 C.E.Sharon, 2009, p. 58 and pl.6.

In 1934 he was revealed to have been in a conspiracy with Thomas James Wise (1859‚Äì1937) to purvey large quantities of forged first editions of Georgian and Victorian authors. Early life Henry Buxton Forman was born in Camberwell, south London on 11 July 1842, the third son of George Ellery Forman (born Plymouth in 1800, died London in 1869), a retired Royal Naval surgeon and his Sussex born wife Maria Courthorpe. At the age of ten months his family moved to Teignmouth in Devon and he was educated at a Royal Naval School in New Cross where Edmund Gosse was a contemporary and lifelong acquaintance although not an intimate. Whilst at school he adapted the sobriquet Harry by which he was afterwards known. He returned to London in 1860 and lived with his brothersHis older brother Alfred William Forman, later a published poet was the first person to translate into English the librettos of several Richard Wagner's operas including Der Ring des Nibelungen(1877), Tristan und Isolde (1891), Parsifal (1899), and Tannh√§user (1919). He married the actress Alma Murray in 1876 in Stockwell in south London after joining the Post Office at 18 years of age. Career as a civil servant Harry Buxton Forman pursued a successful career in the Post Office starting as supplementary class clerk in the Secretary's Office at St.Martin's-le-Grand in April 1860. He served as acting surveyor of British Post Offices in the Mediterranean in 1883 and thereafter served as principal clerk from 1885 and second secretary advancing to controller of the packet services. In 1897 he received the CB for his services to the Post Office retiring in 1907 after 47 years' service. He attended as a representative of the United Kingdom four Postal Union Congresses ‚Äì at Paris in 1880, at Lisbon in 1885, at Vienna in 1891, and at Washington in 1897. He was one of the earliest workers on behalf of the Post Office Library and Literary Association, and was its secretary for several years. Editor of Shelley and Keats It is as an authority on the lives and works of Percy Shelley and John Keats that Forman is largely remembered. His literary endeavours began in 1869 with a series of anonymous articles in William Tinsley's eponymous Tinsley's Magazine later reprinted in 1871 as Our Living Poets. This resulted in a friendly relationship with Dante Gabriel Rossetti and a fateful encounter with another poet Richard Hengist Horne, the subject of an early known forgery. This success resulted in regular articles for the London Quarterly Review and a series of articles including four on Ibsen in 1872. Buxton Forman became interested in the philosophy of free thinking as expounded in the works of Auguste Comte (1798‚Äì1857) and he met his wife Laura Sell√©, the daughter of the musician Dr William Christian Sell√© at a positivist lecture also attended by George Eliot with whom he became acquainted. Many positivists looked to Shelley and Keats as examples of free thinking and in 1876 Buxton Forman published an edition of the Poetical Works of Shelley, followed in 1880 by Shelley's Prose Works. In 1878 he edited the Letters of John Keats to Fanny Brawne, and in 1883 the Poetical Works and Other Writings of John Keats which ran to five volumes. He proved a gifted textual editor although the criticism he printed included much that is trivial.Dictionary of National Biography, Harry Buxton Forman (1842‚Äì1917) He also contributed to the study of Shelley with an uncompleted Shelley Library that included a number of first editions and rare writings( as well as a number of his own passed- off forgeries). Other Shelley related material included an Essay in Bibliography in 1886, the Letters of Edward John Trelawny (1910), and Thomas Medwin's Life of Shelley, the latter work being scrupulously re-edited to remove many of Medwin's inexactitudes. He followed up his edition of Keats' poetic works with Three essays by John Keats (1889), Poetry and Prose by John Keats: a book of fresh verses and new readings (1890), and a one-volume edition of the Poetical Works of John Keats (1906). He took an active interest in the purchase and establishment of the Keats and Shelley House in Rome, and presented to it a large number of his books. His passion for Shelley and Keats resulted in collaborative work with others and articles on a number of minor poets such as Thomas Wake and Charles Jeremiah Wells. He contributed articles on Wade and Horne and verses of his own in W R Nicol and TJ Wise's Literary Anecdotes of the 19th Century (1805‚Äì1896) and for A H Miles's Poets and Poetry of the 19th Century Forman made and prefaced the selections from Wade, Wells, Horne, and William Morris. Literary forgeries In 1887 an association with a London commodity broker and book collector Thomas James Wise saw the first of many illegal printings by Wise and Buxton Forman. The origins began in November 1886 when Edward Dowden published a biography of Shelley. It printed a considerable number of poems for the first time that Forman and Wise decided to print separately as Poems and Sonnets inventing the Philadelphia Historical Society as a cover. It was the start of a full scale conspiracy with numerous forgeries over the next fifteen years that were printed in London with templates that stated otherwise. They specialised in early pamphlets, supposedly privately published, of poets some of whom such as Rossetti and Swinburne were still living. Many of the forgeries were printed by the firm of Richard Clay & Sons who had printed legitimate facsimile issues of works by Robert Browning and Percy Shelley. These were \\"creative forgeries\\" in that they were not copies of works that existed but were presented as works that could or should have existed. Dates, places of publication, publishers (as distinct from printers) led the collecting world to believe in the 'rare private' editions. Buxton Forman and Wise forged publications by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, George Eliot, John Ruskin, Matthew Arnold, Alfred Tennyson, George Meredith and William Thackeray and many others. Many of these forgeries were sold by Buxton Forman [though there is little published evidence of sales] and Wise to collectors across the English speaking world and it would be forty years later that their fraud would be discovered by John Carter. The extent of the forgeries was such that the Brayton Ives sale in New York in 1915 contained twenty four forgeries, for example. Elizabeth Barrett Browning and the Reading Sonnets Forman and Wise's most famous forgery is of The Sonnets from the Portuguese by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, a lifelong literary passion of Buxton Forman, (that bore fruit in editorship by Forman of ' Aurora Leigh' and Elizabeth Barrett Browning and her Scarcer Books in 1896), but apparently not deep enough to stop him tampering with the most celebrated literary love story of Victorian England. The sonnets were written by Barrett Browning to Robert Browning during their courtship and their intensity were of lasting literary interest. The first appearance of the poems was in the second edition of Elizabeth's Poems in 1850. However in 1894 an earlier 1847 private edition began to appear in literary journals. This originated from Forman and Wise and was published in London (although it had a Reading frontispiece) having been printed by the firm of Richard Clay & Sons.The so named Reading Sonnets proved to be the achilles heel of the conspiracy when the fraud was exposed in 1934. Final years Forman was seriously ill in 1906 with an undisclosed malady and he retired from the Post Office in 1907. He no longer wished to continue his illegal partnership with Thomas Wise, but was in too deep to disassociate with him completely. He had several literary projects to occupy him. He published Letters of Edward John Trelawny in 1910. He transcribed the Shelley Note Booksfrom twenty-five notebooks inherited by Sir Percy Shelley from his mother. This was a prodigious exercise in patient and meticulous transcription. Most of the note books ended up being sold to American collectors, a striking indication of the popularity of Shelley at the turn of the twentieth century in the USA. His last book was The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley by Thomas Medwin, a new edition that Medwin had extended but left unpublished. The frontispiece portrait of Shelley is in fact a copy of Leonardo da Vinci's Head of Christ with slight alterations. Forman died after a long illness on 15 June 1917 and his ashes were sprinkled on the River Teign, which flows near his Devon childhood home. He left his funeral instructions in a published verse: :Let the prison'd litch-fire batten on the tissues :Leaving naught but ashes, clean and grey and pure :Gather, friends, the handful that from the furnace issues, :Cushion them in crane-bill, and bear them to the Moor. :Ashes of her poet, bear them to one land, :Take them up to Dartmoor and strow them through his own land, :Rush them through the harbour and lose them in the Main!St.Martin's-le-Grand, The Post Office Magazine 1917 Exposure as a forger The exposure of Harry Buxton Forman as a forger in 1934 was driven by two book sellers Graham Pollard and John Carter. They became suspicious of Browning's Reading Sonnets and began to gather more and more evidence that the pamphlet was not as it purported to be. Chemical analysis of the paper showed that it contained a chemically constituted wood pulp, a process that was not used in England before 1874. In addition the typeface in minor respects indicated a late 19th Century use and via some sterling detective work Carter and Pollard traced the publishing source to Richard Clay and Sons. In turn this led to further investigation into various publications being offered for sale by Herbert Gorfin, a prominent bookseller. When it became apparent that Gorfin knew nothing of the forgeries Pollard and Carter persuaded him to expose the source of the publications. Thus Thomas Wise and Harry Buxton Forman were outed as literary forgers. Pollard and Carter published their findings in 1934 in ‚ÄòAn Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets‚Äô Forman Bibliography (selected) * Our Living Poets, Tinsley‚Äôs Magazine articles, London (1869) * Our Living Poets: An Essay in Criticism, Tinsley, London (1871) * Poetical works of Shelley, edited by H Buxton Forman (1880) * Prose Works of Shelley, edited by H Buxton Forman (1880) * Letters of John Keats to Fanny Brawne, (1878) * Poetical Works and Other & Writings of John Keats (1883) * An Essay in Bibliography (1886) * Three Essays by John Keats (1889), * Poetry and Prose by John Keats: a book of fresh verses and new readings (1890) * Sir Stevenson Arthur Blackwood (1893) * The Building of the Idylls; a Study in Tennyson (1896) * Elizabeth Barrett Browning and her scarcer books (1896) * The Books of William Morris, edited by H.

College- grade was officially defined as \\"work of an academic standard customarily demanded of engineering-school students.\\" With successive designations of Engineering Defense Training (EDT), Engineering, Science, and Management Defense Training (ESMDT), and ESMWT, the program was operated by the U.S. Office of Education from October 1940 through June 1945, with 227 colleges and universities providing about 68,000 courses for close to 1,800,000 students at a total cost of some $60 million ($940 million today's dollars).Cardozier, V. R.; Colleges and Universities in World War II, Praeger Publishers, 1993, p. 178 History In mid-1940, before America officially entered World War II, it was brought to the attention of U.S. Congress that the civilian effort supporting the expected conflict would require far more engineers than were then available or could be produced through normal programs at colleges and universities. As part of the budget preparation, Congress tasked John W. Studebaker, then U.S. Commissioner of Education and head of the Office of Education (predecessor of the United States Department of Education), to develop a program to help alleviate this crisis. Studebaker asked Andrey A. Potter, Dean of Engineering at Purdue University, to assist in developing this program and in preparing a proposal to Congress. A National Advisory Committee ‚Äì composed of academic leaders and industry officials ‚Äì first met on September 20‚Äì21, 1940. On October 9, a bill authoring the Engineering Defense Training (EDT) program with initial funding of $9 million (equivalent to $138 million in 2008) was passed by Congress and quickly signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The bill authorized the Office of Education to contract with engineering schools throughout the U.S. to offer \\"intensive courses of college grade, designed to meet the shortage of engineers in activities essential to national defense.\\" Roy A. Seaton, Dean of Engineering at Kansas State College, was appointed to direct the program. Twenty-two regional advisors, each a prominent engineering educator, served without pay as coordinators. Courses under the EDT program began on December 9, 1940. During the remainder of the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 1941, about 120,800 individuals enrolled in 2,260 courses offered by 144 institutions. In July 1941, the Labor-Federal Security Appropriations Act, authorized the addition of chemistry, physics, and production-related courses to form an integrated ESMDT program. Funding was increased to $17.5 million ($270 million equivalent in 2008), and Dean George W. Case from the University of New Hampshire, replaced Seaton as the program director. During the next year, enrollment increased to nearly 450,000 men and women in about 7,800 courses offered by 196 colleges and universities. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) and the entry of the U.S. into World War II, the War-Time Commission was formed within the Department of Education to be responsible for this and other special training activities. The program was again renamed, becoming ESMWT, and continued as such through June 1945. The annual enrollment in ESMWT averaged nearly 600,000 in some 13,000 courses. Ultimately, 215 colleges and universities participated, with the offerings given in more than 1,000 towns and cities. Courses and academic credit The primary objective of the program was to prepare persons for professional positions in defense activities. The authorization required the courses to be of \\"an academic standard customarily demanded of engineering-school students\\", distinguishing them from offerings of trade or technical schools. They were limited to engineering, physics, chemistry, and management subjects directly needed in defense activities It is noted that many of the ESMWT courses, although of \\"college grade\\" at that time, might not be recognized as such in engineering and science programs today. At most colleges and universities in the early 1940s, engineering education greatly emphasized practical applications as opposed to theoretical analysis. It was somewhat the same in many undergraduate physics and chemistry programs. Although there might be progressively higher-level courses in a subject, each ESMWT course was to be complete in itself and designed to convey some stated, applicable knowledge set. While prerequisites were listed for courses, these were mainly to indicate the background needed to understand the subject matter, and the pursuit of a course was not limited to persons having these prerequisites. The participating colleges and universities were fully responsible for determining the local needs and developing courses to meet these needs. The relationship of these courses to the regular courses in a degree program was also under the responsibility of the offering institution. Regular faculty members taught most of the courses. Although requiring considerable preparation, this was welcome work for most professors; between the draft and volunteering, college enrollment was a small fraction of normal. Some courses required instructors to have a highly specialized knowledge, and practitioners from industry were then used. The matter of granting academic course credit for the special courses was an issue from the beginning. The Office of Education recommended against academic credit, reasoning that since the courses were paid by the government, this might \\"constitute a Federal subsidy to the participating college\\", a forbidden practice in that day. It was recommended, however, that knowledge of a subject gained through these courses be recognized, by examination or otherwise, for students in regular college programs, allowing them to excused from that subject, with or without credit. The Engineers‚Äô Council for Professional Development (ECPD), then the accrediting body for engineering programs and predecessor of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), also had reservations concerning academic credit. Following much debate, it was left to each school to make any credit-related decisions and, in the end, most decided against directly granting academic credit, primarily citing the imbalance of applications over theory in most ESMWT courses. After being prepared by the offering institution, course outlines, schedules, and other information were submitted to the ESMWT Washington staff for approval, and the cognizant school was required to permanently maintain the same type of records on presented courses as those kept in regular academic programs. Students and recognition By law, admission to ESMWT courses was open to students without regard to age, sex, or race. With this, and without enforcement of prerequisites, there was a great diversity of students in the various offerings. It was not uncommon to find students in their early teens using the ESMWT program to accelerate their entry into engineering and science jobs. On the other end of the age spectrum, many of the students were in mid-life, preparing for a change of work field or refreshing their earlier education. Perhaps the greatest diversity was in the number of female students. Prior to the 1940s, there were few women working in industry science and even less in engineering. The entry of women into defense jobs is well known through \\"Rosie the Riveter\\", but those in wartime engineering and related work are not often recognized; however, thousands entered professional work after being prepared through this program. Under the initial EDT, women constituted less than 1 percent. With the addition of science and management courses, there were about 9 percent under ESMDT. After the start of the war and ESMWT, the numbers participating in the program increased to 22 percent. Many engineering schools that had earlier been all- male, first accepted women when they began the program. Conversely, a number of previously female colleges ‚Äì including Bryn Mawr College, Skidmore College, and Wellesley College ‚Äì participated in the program and had their first male students. (Some of these schools later reverted to all-female). Throughout the program, about 75 percent of the enrollments were in engineering subjects. After a series of courses in a particular subject area, many of the students, especially those having an earlier background in science and/or mathematics, were placed in regular engineering positions with industry or government agencies. These were sometimes referred to as \\"instant engineers.\\" A 1950 survey of practicing engineers found that there were many more than the sum of those in 1940 plus those graduating from engineering colleges in the 1940-50 decade; much of this difference was attributed to persons who gained this classification through the ESMWT program. Many schools considered graduation from ESMWT courses to have great significance. As an example, at North Carolina State University the Chancellor often personally awarded certificates to the graduates. The Office of Education requirements were that students of any race would be admitted to ESMDT courses. Unfortunately, African-Americans were not well represented either in the participating institutions or as students. Howard University did have a relatively large program for the District of Columbia area; this was led by Herman R. Branson of the Physics Department who had a distinguished post-war career in academia. Noteworthy offerings From June 23 to August 29, 1941, electrical engineering student J. Presper Eckert assisted in teaching a 10-week ESMDT course in electronics at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering. The course had 30 students, 16 of whom held Ph.D. degrees. Among the students was John W. Mauchly. Eckert and Mauchly then teamed in developing the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC), America's first large-scale digital computer. Courses in industrial chemistry and metallurgy were in great demand. Harry J. Sweeney, then Chief Metallurgist for the giant Republic Steel, stated, \\"I don‚Äôt know what we would have done without the ESMDT courses; about 75 percent of our new professionals were trained through this program.\\" Aircraft played a vital role in World War II. During 1940, Cornell University started courses in aircraft structures and stress analysis at Buffalo, New York, for Bell Aircraft and Curtis Wright. One of these, starting December 9, was the first EDT-sponsored course in the U.S. By the end of the first year, more than 800 students were attending these classes. In 1941, the University of Texas started a series of ESMDT courses in aeronautical engineering. These were so successful that the next year a full Department of Aeronautical Engineering was formed. For the aircraft industries of Los Angeles, Maurice J. Zucrow of University of California, Los Angeles, taught ESMWT courses on jet propulsion and gas turbines, introducing hundreds of aeronautical engineers to this critical technology of post-war propulsion. Across the nation, some of the most attended courses were in electronics and radio communications. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Tufts College, Northeastern University, Boston University, and Boston College joined forces to offer the ESMDT/ESMWT program; Dean Edward L. Moreland of MIT served as the coordinator. Much of it was in support of the Radiation Laboratory at MIT where microwave radar was being developed and the electronics firms in the northeast area. Rutgers University was one of the few participants that included labor-management courses in its ESMWT offerings. These brought workers to the Rutgers campus in unprecedented numbers. The coordinator, Norman C. Miller stated, \\"The spirit of patriotism, sacrifice, and co- operation that imbued both labor and management in service to the war effort was clearly evident in these courses.\\" This effort carried into the post-war era with the establishment of the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Rutgers, References *Records of the Engineering, Science, and Management (ESMWT) Program, Section 12.5.7, Records of the Office of Education, The National Archives *\\"Answers to Questions Pertaining to Engineering Defense Training\\", Pamphlet from the EDT Washington Office, U.S. Office of Education, Oct. 1940 *\\"Minutes of Meeting, Resolution Concerning EDT Programs and Courses\\" Committee on Engineering Schools, Engineers‚Äô Council for Professional Development, June 1941 *\\"Answers to Questions (Revised Edition)\\", Pamphlet from the ESMDT Washington Office, U.S. Office of Education, Aug. 1941 *Armsby, Henry H.; \\"ESMWT ‚Äì An Experiment in Streamlined Higher Education\\", The Journal of Higher Education, Vol 13, No 2 (Feb. 1944), pp. 86‚Äì94 *Blank, David M., and George J.

In 1890 Hooper became one of the original members of the Barbarians Football Club. Personal history Hooper was born in Stonehouse, Gloucestershire in 1869 to Charles Henry Hooper, and was educated at Clifton College,\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p90: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 where he was head boy, before matriculating to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1888. He received his BA in 1891, and in 1914 he emigrated to Hong Kong where he practised as a solicitor. With the outbreak of World War I, he served in the Hong Kong Special Police Force. He returned to England later in his life, dying in 1950 at Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, from a cerebral haemorrhage.http://www.cliftonrfchistory.co.uk/internationals/england/hooper/hooper.htm Clifton Rugby Football Club History Rugby career While at Clifton College, Hooper played both rugby football and cricket for the college team. After entering Cambridge, Hooper joined the University team, and played in the Varsity Match of 1890. The Cambridge team for the 1890 encounter contained several players that would go on to play at international level, and Gregor MacGregor, Thomas Storey, Randolph Aston and Charles Nicholl, would all join Hooper as original members of the Barbarians later that season. The Varsity Match ended in a draw, with both teams scoring a goal, in a match that was postponed on three occasions due to fog. Hooper with the first touring Barbarians. Hooper is front row, second from left In the 1890/91 season, Hooper was approached to join the newly formed invitational touring club the Barbarians. In accepting, Hooper became one of the team's original members and represented the team on the pitch nine times. Although only appearing in one winning team, he scored four tries, including two in the win over Devonshire in April 1891. Away from the playing field, Hooper also represented the Barbarians as a committee member. On leaving University, Hooper joined Middlesex Wanderers, and as a member of this team he was selected to play at county level with Gloucestershire and later England. Hooper won all three of his caps for England during the 1894 Home Nations Championship. After the events of the 1893 encounter with Wales, England decided to emulate the Welsh tactic and switched from three three-quarter players to four three-quarter players. Hooper came into the three-quarters at centre along with Samuel Morfitt, who was also making his team debut. The first match of the tournament was against Wales, and the Welsh played a messy and confused game, that despite winning most of the scrums were unable to utilise their backs properly.Griffiths (1982), pg 65. England won 24‚Äì3, with Hooper making a mark during the game, from which Ernest William Taylor scored a goal. Hooper's second international match was played with home advantage at the Rectory Field against Ireland. England failed to learn from the Welsh mistakes of the previous match, and concentrated too much on heeling from scrummages, which allowed the Irish to play a spoiling game.Griffiths (1982), pg 66. With good dribbling skills the Irish camped for most of the first half of the game in English territory. Despite England taking the lead with a few minutes remaining, Hooper was caught in possession under his posts, and when the ball ran loose, Irish forward Edmund Forrest collected the ball and scored a winning dropped goal. For Hooper's final international, England were without their inspirational captain Richard Lockwood, who had marshalled the English three-quarters in the opening two games. His position was filled by the inexperienced Walter Jesse Jackson, and the without Lockwood's pace and skill the backs were unable to manufacture any scoring opportunities from the possession the forwards produced.Griffiths (1982), pg 67. Even down to 14 men, Scotland were still the stronger team, and won the match 6‚Äì0, taking the Calcutta Cup. Hooper never represented England again. The following season, Middlesex Wanderers folded, and Hooper joined Richmond.

The formation of nearly 20 sandstone rocks in the valley of the Fr√§nkische Saale dates back to the early Triassic period.  Origin of the caves  The \\"Wichtelh√∂hlen\\" consist of a particular type of sandstone (Buntsandstein) typical for the area. They have their origin in the leaching of the Fr√§nkische Saale. The so- called caves are merely cracks and voids between the broken slabs of sandstone. (for detailed information, please see \\"External links\\")  Natural environment  The \\"Wichtelh√∂hlen\\" are special protected environmental area ('gesch√ºtzter Landschaftsbestandteil'). Small animals are looking for protection during wintertime while they are making their hibernation or winter rest. The caves are located in the neighbourhood of the \\"Man and Biosphere Reserve Programme Rh√∂n\\". They are under the special supervision of the local natural Conservation Office.  Legend  The place is shrouded in legend. People used to believe that actual goblins lived in the small caves and helped a miller close to the caves. But after the miller mistreated the goblins, they returned to their caves while the miller spent the rest of his life in poverty.

Their intention was to found a band which combines hard and aggressive riffs and the sensitivity of classical music combined with memorable vocals and choruses as achieved by the classical Heavy Metal bands. The debut album Revolution Rising has been recorded in studios in France, Italy and Germany and has been mixed and mastered by Markus Teske (Vanden Plas, Mob Rules, Dominici, Symphony X and Red Circuit). Because the vast distances and other obstacles between the original band members made it impossible to play live. By the end of 2007 the line up of Civilization One began to change. Only two of the original members Chity and bassplayer Pierre-Emmanuel Pelisson (Maladaptive, Ex-Heavenly) stayed and guitarist Christian Muenzer (Majesty, Ex-Necrophagist) joined the band as the lead guitarist. He was followed by Boern Daigger (Majesty, R:I:P) as the second guitarist. It took slightly longer to find a drummer. Beginning of 2008 Holly Rodammer (Ex- Ancient Ceremony, Ex-Hellmasters) was announced as the new drummer. During the process of the changes in the line-up the band got the attention of the presenters and the first bookings for the first festivals in 2008 were placed due to the overwhelming response of the media regarding the PogPower UK Pre-Party 2007. In November 2008 and October 2009 Civilization One followed the invitation of TNL (the biggest Radio station for Rock Music in Sri Lanka), and performed as the main act at the ‚ÄúTNL Onstage Finals‚Äù show in Colombo. This is an absolute novelty, never before had a Western Heavy Metal band performed in Sri Lanka. Due to several reasons the band line-up changed again in 2009. Guitarists Nicklaus Bergen (MINIER Nicolas) and Oliver Marmann and drummer Michael Stein are replacing the previous musicians. The band has finished recording its second album, Calling the Gods.

Nineteenth century Colchester Garrison, command headquarters from 1866 to 1905 Great Britain was divided into military districts on the outbreak of war with France in 1793.Robert Burnham and Ron McGuigan, The British Army Against Napoleon: Facts, Lists and Trivia, 1805‚Äì1815 (2010) p. 7. In the first half of the 19th century the command included the counties of Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire and Hertfordshire. It was based in Colchester. Disbanded after the Napoleonic Wars, the Eastern District Command was re- created in 1866Pevsner, p 282 and was based at Flagstaff House in Colchester. In January 1876 a ‚ÄòMobilization Scheme for the forces in Great Britain and Ireland‚Äô was published, with the ‚ÄòActive Army‚Äô divided into eight army corps based on the District Commands. 1st Corps was to be formed within Eastern Command, based in Colchester. This scheme disappeared in 1881, when the districts were retitled ‚ÄòDistrict Commands.Army List 1876‚Äì1881. Twentieth century The 1901 Army Estimates introduced by St John Brodrick allowed for six army corps based on six regional commands. As outlined in a paper published in 1903, IV Corps was to be formed in a reconstituted Eastern Command, with HQ at London.Col John K. Dunlop, The Development of the British Army 1899‚Äì1914, London: Methuen, 1938. Lieutenant General Lord Grenfell was appointed acting General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOCinC) of IV Corps in April 1903. First World War Pall Mall (second building on the left), command headquarters during the First World War Army Order No 324, issued on 21 August 1914, authorised the formation of a 'New Army' of six Divisions, manned by volunteers who had responded to Earl Kitchener's appeal (hence the First New Army was known as 'K1'). Each division was to be under the administration of one of the Home Commands, and Eastern Command formed what became the 12th (Eastern) Division. It was followed by 18th (Eastern) Division of K2 in September 1914. During the First World War, HQ Eastern Command was in London: initially at Horse Guards,Hart's Army List, January 1916 then (from February 1916) at 50 Pall Mall, London;Jeffery, p. 198 in 1919 it moved to 41 Queen's Gardens, Bayswater.Hart's Army List, July 1919 Second World War Luton Hoo, command headquarters from 1941 to 1945 At the outbreak of the Second World War, the headquarters was again located at Horse Guards,Patriot Files but by October 1939 it had moved to Hounslow Barracks.Hart's Army List, October 1939 At that time Regular Troops reporting to the Command included 4th Infantry Division.

In 1954 a single-storey blockhouse was built at Wilton Park in Beaconsfield, to provide a protected Eastern Command headquarters for use in the event of war; however in 1957 this provision was superseded by plans for Regional Seats of Government.Subterranea Britannica In 1968, Eastern Command was dissolved and merged into a reconfigured Southern Command. The new HQ Southern Command was established at Hounslow, and the last GOCinC Eastern Command took over as GOCinC Southern Command. In 1972, Southern Command, together with the other two geographic commands, was merged with Army Strategic Command to form a new command: UK Land Forces (UKLF).  Command Training Centres  Between 1941 and 1943, each regional command of the British Army formed at-least one training centre which trained those recruits preparing to move overseas.

He made his first balloon flight at the age of 20. He commissioned a copy of the 1902 Wright No. 3 glider but had only limited success. He was regarded as France's foremost promoter and sponsor of aviation, offering prizes (Coupe d'Aviation Ernest Archdeacon and the Deutsch de la Meurthe-Archdeacon prize), commissioning designs, and organising tests and events. His most lasting contribution to aviation is the A√©ro-Club de France, the oldest aero-club in the world, which he co-founded in 1898. On 29 May 1908, Archdeacon became the first aeroplane passenger in Europe when he was piloted by Henry Farman at Ghent. Early life Archdeacon was born and raised in Paris, and studied law for a career at the bar. His passionate interest in science led him to also study ballooning and aviation, and in 1884, at age 20, he made his first balloon flight. Motoring Archdeacon was a keen sporting motorist, taking part in many of the main events of the period. In 1894 he finished 17th in the world's first motor race, driving his Serpollet steamer from Paris to Rouen, covering the distance of in 13 hours. In 1896 he finished 7th in the Paris-Marseilles- Paris Trail driving a Delahaye. Covering the 1710 km in 75 hours 29 minutes 48 seconds. The event had 14 finishers from around 32 starters. In 1897 he finished 20th in the Paris-Dieppe Trail on 24 July driving a Delahaye. Covering the 170.8 km in 5 hours 41 minutes 15 seconds at an average speed of 30 kilometres per hour. The event had 43 finishers from over 45 starters. In 1899 he finished 8th in the Nice-Castellane-Nice race on 21 March driving a Delahaye, covering the 120.7 km in 3 hours 40 minutes. The Aero Club of France On 20 October 1898, in partnership with the oil magnate Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe. Archdeacon founded the A√©ro-Club de France, which is still the official authority of the organization of sports aviation in France. Other founding members included the Marquis de Fonvielle, Count Henri de la Vaulx and Count Henri de la Valette. The first president of the Aero Club in 1900 was the Marquis Jules-Albert de Dion. Sponsor of aviation In April 1900, the A√©ro-Club de France announced the 'Deutsch de la Meurthe' prize of one hundred thousand francs for the first flying machine to complete the round trip from Saint-Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back in less than thirty minutes. On 19 October 1901 Alberto Santos-Dumont won the prize in his airship No 6. After learning about the Wright brothers glider flights from Octave Chanute's lecture to the Aero Club de France on 2 April 1903, Archdeacon decided to further encourage the development of aviation in France. He was encouraged to do this by the pioneer French aviator Captain Ferber, who had written to Archdeacon demanding \\"Do not let the aeroplane be achieved in America first.\\" Archdeacon donated 3000 francs to the \\"Archdeacon committee!\\" of the A√©ro-Club de France to sponsor aviation competitions. Gliders In 1903, Archdeacon commissioned an imperfect copy of the 1902 Wright glider from Monsieur Dargent at the military balloons and airships workshop at Chalais- Meudon. It was a biplane with an ash framework covered with silk and braced with piano wire, and lacked the provision for lateral control that was the key to the success of the Wright Brothers' aircraft. It was described in La Vie au Grand Air: The first experiments with this glider were conducted in April 1904 on the dunes at Merlimont near Berck-sur-Mer, piloted by Gabriel Voisin and Captain Ferber. In March 1905, he commissioned a second glider from Voisin. In its unmanned first test, towed by a car, it broke apart in the air. A third glider, the Voisin-Archdeacon floatplane glider was then commissioned from Voisin. This aircraft marked the introduction to European aviation of the Hargrave cell, based on Lawrence Hargrave's box-kites:Gibbs-Smith, C. H., The Rebirth of European Aviation: London, HMSO, 1974. , p. 159 it was a three-bay biplane with side-curtains between the wings, a double-cell biplane tail and a forward elevator, and was fitted with a pair of floats. It was successfully tested on the River Seine at Boulogne-Billancourt using a boat to tow it between the bridges of Saint-Cloud and S√®vres. It rose to about above the Seine and flew about , but was damaged in its next test and never flew again, although further attempts were made on Lake Geneva in September.Gibbs-Smith, C. H., The Rebirth of European Aviation: London, HMSO, 1974. , p. 158 Heavier-than-air powered flight In 1903 Ernest Archdeacon and the A√©ro- Club de France announced the Coupe d'Aviation Ernest Archdeacon, a silver trophy for the first flight of more than twenty-five metres by a 'heavier- than-air' craft. Later, the A√©ro-Club de France offered a prize of 1500 francs to the first person to fly . In October 1904, Ernest Archdeacon joined Deutsch de la Meurthe to offer a prize of 50,000 francs for the first heavier-than-air flight around a one kilometre closed circuit. The sum represented about 20 times the annual earnings of a Parisian professional worker. Archdeacon and de la Meurthe understood that apart from the Wrights (see below), all heavier- than-air flights had been in a straight line. The prize was intended to encourage the development of an airplane that could turn, so the prize winner would have to fly a closed circuit. The 25 metre prize was won by Alberto Santos-Dumont on 23 October 1906 at Bagatelle. He went on to win the 100 metre prize on 12 November 1906. The 1 kilometre prize was won by Henri Farman on 13 January 1908, at Issy-les-Moulineaux. Archdeacon A√©romotocyclette Anzani Archdeacon's 'A√©ro-Moto-Cyclette', September 1906 In 1906 Archdeacon commissioned a propeller-driven motorcycle, the A√©romotocyclette Anzani, which achieved a timed speed of 79.5 kilometres per hour at Ach√®res-la-For√™t. This a√©romotocyclette, based on a 'Buchet' motorcycle, was equipped with a 6-horsepower Anzani engine driving a propeller mounted on a steel tube. There is no evidence that he applied for a patent. Scepticism toward the Wright brothers In November 1905 the Wright Brothers had written a letter to George Besan√ßon, the editor of l'A√©rophile describing their recent achievements in detail. The letter was published in the Paris sporting daily newspaper l'Auto on 30 November 1905, since Besan√ßon was not able to publish it himself without delay. This news polarized members of the Aero Club de France. A minority, including Besan√ßon, Ferber and Henry Kapf√©rer, believed the claims of the Wright Brothers, but the majority, led by Archdeacon, thought that they were false. In 1906 the anti-Wright brothers sceptics in the European aviation community had converted the press. European newspapers, especially in France, were openly derisive, calling them bluffeurs (bluffers). Archdeacon was publicly sceptical of the brothers' claims in spite of published reports; he wrote several articles and stated that \\"the French would make the first public demonstration of powered flight\\". On 10 February 1906 the Paris edition of the New York Herald summed up Europe's opinion of the Wright brothers in an editorial: \\"The Wrights have flown or they have not flown. They possess a machine or they do not possess one. They are in fact either fliers or liars. It is difficult to fly. It's easy to say, 'We have flown.'\\" In August 1908, after Wilbur Wright's demonstrations at Les Hunaudi√®res race course near Le Mans, Archdeacon publicly admitted that he had done them an injustice. Aeroplane passenger Archdeacon in Farman's Voisin Biplane in May 1908 Ernest Archdeacon is widely cited as the first aeroplane passenger in Europe when he was piloted by Henry Farman at Ghent on 29 May 1908.Gibbs-Smith, C. H., The Rebirth of European Aviation: London, HMSO, 1974. , p. 254 The total flight was . Charles E. Vivian says he was preceded on 29 March by Leon Delagrange, who was also flown by Farman.

The town was called Oxford after the school's prestigious British cousin, which graduated the two founders of Methodism, John and Charles Wesley. The college was named after John Emory, an American Methodist bishop who inspired people . Events preceding the chartering of Emory College began in 1783, when the Georgia State legislature provided for the founding of \\"a college or seminary of learning.\\" However, general support of education in Georgia was meager until the 1830s, when an educational fad in Germany inspired Georgia Methodists to create a school for manual labor. At the Georgia Methodist Conference in 1834, a preacher known as \\"Uncle Allen\\" Turner suggested that Georgia Methodists should develop their own school rather than support Randolph-Macon in Virginia.English, Thomas H. Emory University 1915‚Äì1965: A Semicentennial History (Atlanta: Emory University, 1966). As a result, the Manual Labor School was created in Covington, Georgia in 1835. On December 10, 1836, the Georgia General Assembly granted the Georgia Methodist Conference a charter to Emory College, named for John Emory, a popular bishop who had presided at the 1834 conference but had died in a carriage accident in 1835. Two years after the chartering, the college opened its doors, and on September 17, 1838, the college's first president, Ignatius Alphonso Few, and three faculty members welcomed fifteen freshmen and sophomores. For the duration of the nineteenth century, Emory College was a constricting academic environment. By signing their names into the Matriculation Book, students were bound to obey the \\"Laws and Statutes of the College\\", which bound students to their rooms during study hours, and forbade them from leaving the town limits without the president's consent and engaging in immoral activities. Until the presidency of Warren Candler in the 1890s, Emory prohibited intercollegiate sports. He thought the practice \\"evil, only evil, and that continually\\", his principle objection being the cost of intercollegiate athletic programs, the temptation of gambling, and the distraction from academics. However, he was not unalterably opposed to athletics, and during his presidency he raised funds for the first gymnasium at Emory and oversaw the creation of the nation's first model intramural program. Emory College was closed briefly during the Civil War. In the autumn of 1861, every student left to fight, and the college's trustees closed for the duration. During the war, the college's buildings saw duty both as a Confederate hospital and Union headquarters. When Emory reopened in January 1866, the school's library was destroyed and its small endowment was depleted. Only with the aid of a state G.I. Bill could students afford to resume their education. In the years following the Civil War, Emory, along with the rest of the South, struggled to overcome financial devastation. The first step toward financial stability came in 1880, when Emory President Atticus G. Haygood preached a Thanksgiving Day sermon expressing gratitude for the end of slavery captured the attention of George Seney, a Brooklyn banker and Methodist. Seney gave Emory College $5,000 to repay its debts, $50,000 for construction, and $75,000 to establish a new endowment. Over the years, Seney invested more than a quarter-million dollars into Emory College, helping to erect the administration building in Oxford that bears his name. Under the direction of President Haygood's direction, Emory College began to offer many technical and professional subjects in addition to courses required for degrees. By the turn of the century, Emory had evolved its traditional liberal arts program into a broad curriculum encouraging students to pursue degrees in science, study in theology and law, and even learning and expertise in technology and tool craft. The technology department was launched by President Isaac Stiles Hopkins, a polymath professor at Emory College, who was later convinced by state legislators to become the first president of what is now the Georgia Institute of Technology. The university was in an unincorporated area until the City of Atlanta annexed it in 2018 at the request of the university administration; this was done partly to expedite mass transit links in the future. Move to DeKalb County Candler Library In 1914, after a long struggle between the Vanderbilt University Board of Trust and the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church South over control of the university, the Board of Trust won a decision in the Tennessee State Supreme Court. The church subsequently severed its relationship with the university and forged plans to create a new Methodist university in the Southeast with a school of theology. The General Conference decided to charter one university east of the Mississippi River, and one to the river's west (Southern Methodist University).Vanderbilt University and Southern Methodism by Frank Gulley, prodigy.net. Retrieved February 20, 2008. It was Asa Griggs Candler, the founder of The Coca-Cola Company and brother to former Emory President Warren Candler, who persuaded the church to build the new university in DeKalb County, and to make Emory the nucleus. He endowed the school with one million dollars and a gift of 75 acres (304,000 m¬≤) of land in the newly emerging Druid Hills community, located northeast of downtown Atlanta in DeKalb County. The campus is less than a mile from the current Atlanta city limits. For Asa's generosity, the campus library at the east end of the quadrangle‚Äîrecently restored to its original 1920s appearance‚Äîwas named after him. Matheson Reading Room In light of these developments, Emory College was rechartered by DeKalb County on January 25, 1915, as Emory University. Within three months of Asa's endowment, in September 1914, the first unit of the university‚Äîthe school of theology‚Äîhad begun classes. Henry Hornbostel was chosen to design many of the buildings on Emory University's new campus. His designs incorporated local stone and materials, including marble and red terracotta tile, which established the institution's unique architectural character. By September 1919, Emory University had created a school of law, medicine, business, and graduate studies. In time, schools of nursing and dentistry would join the university, although the dental school has since been closed and replaced with a school of public health. Doctoral studies at Emory University were established in 1946, and the school has continued to strengthen its graduate and professional schools since. In 1949, Alben Barkley returned to Emory to receive an honorary LLD degree and give the commencement address, the first Emory event to be televised. Emory Junior College at Valdosta Plans for an additional campus in Valdosta, Georgia began to be developed in the mid-1920s, when that town's leaders offered Emory of land; a distinctive, white-columned building that housed classrooms and administrative offices; and a $200,000 endowment.\\"Emory Junior College at Valdosta .\\" \\"Emory University.\\" Retrieved on May 26, 2009 In 1928 the Emory Junior College at Valdosta was founded, welcoming its first class of fifty freshman in September of that year. Two years later, sixteen students made up the first graduating class. In 1931, the college completed construction of its first dormitory, allowing students to live on-campus rather than at local inns and family homes. During World War II enrollment plummeted as students left to join the military. Emory administrators decided to close the campus for the remainder of the war, but when Valdosta leaders objected, they compromised by moving the remaining students and faculty to the DeKalb County campus. The school reopened in 1946, and, due to the G.I. Bill and an aggressive recruiting drive, managed a record enrollment of 247. Additional classrooms and dorms were brought from a nearby Air Force base to help adjust to the increase. When the Georgia State Women's college (now Valdosta State University) began to admit men in 1950, the Valdosta campus's fate was sealed. By 1953, just 65 students were enrolled. Emory could not compete with the lower in-state tuition offered by Valdosta State, especially without the support system enjoyed by the larger DeKalb County campus. When the junior college closed its doors in 1953, the facilities were given to the University System of Georgia and are now also part of Valdosta State. World War II During World War II, Emory was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. Expansion since 1950 Clock tower at Cox Hall Formerly an all- male school, in 1953 Emory officially became a coeducational institution. Although it had previously admitted women under limited circumstances, the university had never before had a policy through which they could enroll in large numbers and as resident students. Shortly after, in 1959, sororities first appeared on campus. In 1962, in the midst of the American Civil Rights Movement, Emory embraced the initiative to end racial restrictions when it asked the courts to declare portions of the Georgia statutes unconstitutional. Previously, Georgia law denied tax-exempt status to private universities with racially integrated student bodies. The Supreme Court of Georgia ruled in Emory's favor and Emory officially became racially integrated. In the 1970s, the university embarked on an ambitious building program, substantially improving its facilities. Due largely to the generosity of Robert Woodruff, the president of The Coca-Cola Company, the U.S. Center for Disease Control opened on Clifton Road, next to Emory. The presence of the CDC was a major reason why the American Cancer Society moved its headquarters to Atlanta, and also made it possible for Emory, in 1990, to launch its first new school in fifty years: the Rollins School of Public Health. During this time, the university also built a series of new concrete brutalist structures, including the Robert W. Woodruff Library in 1969, the Sanford S. Atwood Chemistry Center in 1974, the Goodrich C. White Hall in 1977, and the Paul Rudolph-designed William R. Cannon Chapel in 1982. The course of Emory's history changed dramatically when, in November 1979, Robert and George Woodruff presented the institution with a gift of $105 million in Coca-Cola stock. At the time this was the largest single gift to any institution of higher education in American history, and it made a profound impact on Emory's direction in the next two decades, boosting the university to the top ranks of American research universities. Another important factor in the university's growth over the last two decades has been its location in metropolitan Atlanta. The Emory campus in the historic Druid Hills neighborhood shares the Clifton Corridor with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Cancer Society. A few miles away is the Carter Center. Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, winner of the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize, is a University Distinguished Professor and occasionally visits classes and lectures students. Each year, Carter has a town hall meeting at the university, in which he gives a lecture and answers questions from Emory students and members of the Atlanta community. The latest additions to the Emory campus include the Rollins School of Public Health, the O. Wayne Rollins Research Center, the Michael C. Carlos Museum (designed by Michael Graves), the Roberto C. Goizueta Business School, the Whitehead Biomedical Research Building, the Mathematics and Science Center, the Donna and Marvin Schwartz Center for the Performing Arts, a recent expansion to the business school that was completed in 2005, as well as the continuous expansion of Emory University Hospital. Emory in autumn Emory's six libraries have also seen enormous growth over the 1990s as they increased their holdings to more than 3.1 million volumes. The Special Collections Department of Woodruff Library houses the papers of the British poet Ted Hughes, as well as an extensive Irish collection (William Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory, Maud Gonne, Seamus Heaney, and several contemporary Irish writers). Emory's Special Collections also has concentrations on southern imprints and writers (James Dickey, Alfred Uhry, Mary Hood, and certain papers of Huey Long, for example), and a growing concentration of African American papers, including the work of activist Malcolm X and the Hatch/Billops Collection. Recently, author Salman Rushdie, who has joined the faculty as a Distinguished Writer in Residence, announced he will donate his extensive archive to Woodruff Library. The Michael C. Carlos Museum houses a permanent collection of some 18,000 objects, including art from Egypt, Greece, Rome, the Near East, the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Oceania as well as European and American prints and drawings ranging from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century. Twenty-nine galleries are maintained for permanent collections, and eight galleries present special exhibitions from all periods. Emory has received four of the 100 largest donations in higher education history. Emory is the only university with two donations among the fifteen largest in higher education history. These records are tracked by the Chronicle of Higher Education. Many of these donations stemmed from the school's close ties to the Coca-Cola Company and its leaders. The largest donation to Emory was for $295 million, received in 1996 from the Lettie Pate Evans, Joseph B. Whitehead, and Robert W. Woodruff Foundations. Other large donations include: * $50 million: July 9, 2007. From the O.

Emory is generally considered a shortlist member of the so-called \\"Southern Ivy League\\" and consistently ranks among the top universities in the United States. In 2004, Emory University's endowment was ranked 8th in the nation at an estimated $4.4 billion. Emory University recently completed a strategic planning process in 2005 led by Emory President James W. Wagner, Provost Earl Lewis and Executive Vice President Mike Mandl. After broad consultation with the entire Emory community, the comprehensive plan was put forward and approved by the Board of Trustees. The anticipated $3 billion plan will strengthen Emory University's programs in specific areas focused on key themes centered on major world issues. On November 16, 2006, the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation announced that it would give Emory $261.5 million over four years to enhance the Emory Clinic, establish a Presidential Fund to provide seed money for the strategic plan, and to renovate the Woodruff Health Sciences Administration Building. On September 15, 2008, The Emory Wheel reported that the Emory Board of Trustees had officially changed the name of Emory College to College of Arts and Sciences and the name of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences to Graduate School. The former ends the founding Emory College name after 172 years.Molly Davis \\"Two Emory Schools Renamed \\"The Emory Wheel\\" Retrieved on May 26, 2009 175th Anniversary Emory celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2011.

Retrieved on June 1, 2017. Compare this with the address of Emory University (2016 home page states: \\"201 Dowman Drive, Atlanta, Georgia 30322 USA\\") and the location of its buildings. In 2016 Mark Niesse of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote that the general public outside of the Atlanta held the assumption that the university was in the city, and the university stated in a press release that year that \\"Emory already promotes its location as Atlanta, is known internationally as being located in Atlanta, routinely recruits faculty and students to Atlanta, and has an Atlanta address and zip code\\". In 2016 the university stated that it intended to petition to be annexed into the City of Atlanta; in 2017 the university leadership formally submitted its petition. One factor that the annexation could have is expedite the construction of a MARTA line that serves the university since Atlanta sales taxes would now be collected in the annexed area. To comply with the requirement that an annexed area be adjacent to the existing city limits, the university purchased a residence partially within the then-city limits. The residence had a price of $345,000, and the property had of space. The residence is the only area connecting the university property with the rest of the city. The city government also entered into a settlement with the DeKalb County government to settle a dispute, paving the way for the annexation. Due to the taxable revenue involved, there was a dispute over whether the area would remain in the DeKalb County School District or transition to Atlanta Public Schools. The area ultimately went to APS, and as part of a 2019 settlement Emory would help establish school-based clinics for DeKalb schools. The City of Atlanta annexed Emory's campus effective January 1, 2018, a part of its largest annexation within a period of 65 years; the Atlanta City Council voted to do so the prior December.

It did not fly until 1939, by which time competitor aircraft had gone into service. Design and development The Lat√©co√®re 570 was the French company's response to the specification of a four-seat bomber (B4) in the programme A-21 of November 1934. This called for an aircraft that could deliver, for example, a 1000 kg (2,200 lb) bomb load over a range of 1,500 km (940 mi), have a maximum speed of 400 km/h (250 mph) at about 4,000 m (1,200 ft) and to be able to reach this altitude in 15 minutes. The latest devices were specified, such as variable-pitch propellers, retractable undercarriage and retractable dorsal and ventral gun turrets. Nine manufacturers responded but only Lat√©co√®re and three others produced prototypes. These were the Amiot 341, the Lior√© et Olivier LeO 45 and the Romano 120. The Lat√©co√®re 570 was an aerodynamically clean, all-metal low cantilever wing monoplane with two radial engines and a twin tail. The wings were broad at the root and had straight edges, but narrowed continuously outwards to small-chord elliptical tips, mostly through the strong forward sweep of the trailing edge. This latter carried ailerons with flaps inboard. The two 1,125 hp (840 kW) Hispano-Suiza 14Aa engines were conventionally mounted on the forward wing spar with long- chord cowlings, driving variable-pitch propellers of opposite handedness. The engine fairings extended further rearwards below the wing than above to house the retracted undercarriage legs with their single wheels. The tailplane and elevator narrowed only slightly, ending with vertical surfaces that extended only upwards, unlike the typical endplate fins of the period which also reached below the tailplane. Both rudders and elevators had trim tabs. The fuselage was a monocoque structure of roughly elliptical cross section with a flattened bottom. There was extensive glazing in the nose for the navigator/bomb aimer with the radio operator behind. The pilot's enclosed cockpit was slightly behind the leading edge of the wing and a long way behind the nose, restricting his view at take-off. Immediately behind him on the port side of the fuselage at mid-chord was a vertical bomb stack, filling the whole height of the fuselage. There was an access corridor down the starboard side, but another bomb could be mounted below its floor. There were also internal bomb mountings in the wing roots at this position. Behind this bomb bay and near the wing trailing edge was the upper (dorsal) SAM AB5 retractable turret with an Hispano 20 mm cannon; slightly further aft and at the trailing edge was a matching but inverted AB6 retractable ventral turret, similarly armed. The upper turret was manned by the fourth crew member and the lower one by the radio operator. A single jack extended and retracted these turrets together; the upper one was glazed to enable its gunner to keep watch even when it was retracted. The Lat√©co√®re 570 prototype took a long time to get into the air compared with its competitors. Construction began at Lat√©co√®re's Toulouse works from about April 1937, but during that year the Toulouse-Montaudran region was seriously disrupted by industrial action and it was decided to complete the aircraft at the Bayonne factory. It finally flew in until August 1939, piloted by Yves Lascombe. The 570 went for trials at CEMA d'Orleans- Bricy early in 1940, though by then the Amiot 351 and Lior√© et Olivier LeO 45 were already in service. It was found to have good flying characteristics, though its performance vis-√†-vis the other B4 machines was somewhat disappointing. The 14Aa engines were by this time performing reliably, despite an unhappy beginning in the other B4 prototypes. By June 1940 the sole 570 was in German hands at Bricy, but not judged worth flying.

The basement museum is now a branch of the Historical Museum of the City of Cracow ‚Äì the name being \\"Muzeum Historyczne Miasta Krakowa ‚Äì Ulica Pomorska\\". There are two sections ‚Äì the exhibition of \\"occupied Krakow\\" (Krakow w latach 1939‚Äì1956) and the \\"gestapo cells\\". The execution cell has \\"Dulce et Decorum est Pro Patri mori!\\" inscribed on its wall.\\"Muzeum Historyczne Miasta Krakowa ‚Äì Ulica Pomorska\\". Pamphlet in Polish At least one of the 108 Martyrs of World War Two was known to have been interrogated at this location and Polish General Stanislaw Rostworowski was killed in the building on 11 August 1944.Monika Bednarek and Jacek Salwinski (2003) Pomorska Muzeum Historyczne Miasta Krakowa English summary pp.85 'Gestapo Cells' The Branch of The Historical Museum of the City of Krak√≥w at 2 Pomorska Street in the Silesian House, was founded in 1981 and its primary purpose is to take care of historical places of tortures of many thousands of Poles during World War II ‚Äì the former detention cells of Gestapo in Krakow. Those cells, kept in the former shape, are a proof of tragic days of German occupation in 1939‚Äì1945. However the most important themes of Krakow's history of this period are being presented on the permanent exhibition \\"People of Krak√≥w in times of terror 1939-1945-1956\\". For many years our museum has been researching Krak√≥w's history from the period of the German occupation and Stalin's times. For 2 years the Museum has been collaborating with the Little Poland History Fans Society \\"Rawelin\\". The purpose of this collaboration is popularization of the Krak√≥w's history of the times. In November 2006 together we opened the air-raid shelter. [see the report] The building at 2 Pomorska Street was built between 1931 and 1936 by the initiative of Western Territories Defense Society. There was both pupils' hostel and a hostel for Silesian youth visiting and studying in Krakow (therefore a name \\"Silesian House\\"). From 13 September 1939 until 17 January 1945, the building was occupied by German police formations and was the Headquarters of the Security Police and Security Service for the Krakow's District. After the war, Silesian House was turned over for administration to League of National Defense, which, as the time passed, became the formal owner of the building. Since 1981, it's the only place of national memorial site from the World War II period in Krakow having a museum status.Museum's History at the Museum's Home page  Notes   See also  * Stanis≈Çaw Rostworowski on Polish Wikipedia  External links  * How to get there?

There are many different families. They are found throughout the world in various habitats, ranging from ephemeral pools to the largest lakes, and from small seeps and springs to major rivers. The great majority of freshwater gastropods have a shell, with very few exceptions. Some groups of snails that live in freshwater respire using gills, whereas other groups need to reach the surface to breathe air. In addition, some are amphibious and have both gills and a lung (e.g. Ampullariidae). Most feed on algae, but many are detritivores and some are filter feeders. According to a 2008 review of the taxonomy, there are about 4,000 species of freshwater gastropods (3,795-3,972). At least 33‚Äì38 independent lineages of gastropods have successfully colonized freshwater environments. It is not possible to quantify the exact number of these lineages yet, because they have yet to be clarified within the Cerithioidea. From six to eight of these independent lineages occur in North America.Dillon R. T. (2006). Chapter 21. Freshwater Gastropoda. pages 251-259. In: Sturm C. F., Pearce T. A. & Vald√©s A. (eds.) (2006).

In the United States, commonly available species include ramshorn snails such as Planorbella duryi, apple snails such as Pomacea bridgesii, the high-spired thiarid Malaysian trumpet snail, Melanoides tuberculata, and several Neritina species.  Parasitology  Life cycle of two liver fluke species which have freshwater snails as intermediate hosts Freshwater snails are widely known to be hosts in the lifecycles of a variety of human and animal parasites, particularly trematodes or \\"flukes\\". Some of these relations for prosobranch snails include Oncomelania in the family Pomatiopsidae as hosts of Schistosoma, and Bithynia, Parafossarulus and Amnicola as hosts of Opisthorchis. Thiara and Semisulcospira may host Paragonimus. Juga plicifera may host Nanophyetus salmincola.Adams A. M. (2006). Foodborne trematodes. In: Ortega I. R. (ed.) (2006). Foodborne parasites. . page 178. Basommatophoran snails are even more widely infected, with many Biomphalaria (Planorbidae) serving as hosts for Schistosoma mansoni, Fasciolopsis and other parasitic groups. The tiny Bulinus snails are hosts for Schistosoma haematobium. Lymnaeid snails (Lymnaeidae) serve as hosts for Fasciola and the cerceriae causing swimmer's itch.Chandler A. C. & Read C P. (1961).

Old Book of Tang, vol. 143.) was a general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty. After the death of his father Li Quanl√ºe (ÊùéÂÖ®Áï•) in 826, Li Tongjie tried to take over Henghai Circuit (Ê©´Êµ∑, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei), which his father had been the military governor (Jiedushi) of, and he rejected a subsequent imperial edict for him to serve at a different circuit. A subsequent imperial campaign against him ensued, defeating him in 829. He surrendered, and was executed by the imperial official Bo Qi (ÊüèËÄÜ).  Background  It is not known when Li Tongjie was born. His father Li Quanl√ºe was originally named Wang Rijian (ÁéãÊó•Á∞°), but in 822, soon after Wang Rijian was made the military governor of Henghai, then- reigning Emperor Muzong gave Wang Rijian the imperial surname of Li and the new personal name of Quanl√ºe. Li Tongjie thus must have been born with the surname of Wang as well, although it is not known whether the personal name of Tongjie was also a changed one.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 242. While Li Quanl√ºe served as military governor, Li Tongjie served as his deputy.  Campaign against imperial forces  In 826, during the reign of Emperor Muzong's son Emperor Jingzong, Li Quanl√ºe died. Li Tongjie seized control of the circuit, and he bribed the military governors of the nearby circuits, hoping that they would intercede on his behalf so that the imperial government would agree to have him succeed his father. Initially, the imperial government took no action, and after Emperor Jingzong was assassinated around the new year 827 and was succeeded by his brother Emperor Wenzong, Li Tongjie was hopeful that the new emperor would consider letting him remain in control of Henghai. He sent his secretary Cui Congzhang (Â¥îÂæûÈï∑) and his brothers Li Tongzhi (ÊùéÂêåÂøó) and Li Tongsun (ÊùéÂêåÂ∑Ω) to the capital Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Wenzong, claiming to be willing to follow imperial orders.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 243. In response, however, Emperor Wenzong ordered that Wu Chongyin the military governor of nearby Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), himself a former military governor of Henghai,Old Book of Tang, vol. 161. be made the military governor of Henghai. To placate Li Tongjie, Emperor Wenzong made him the military governor of Yanhai Circuit (ÂÖóÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong). Fearing that the military governor of the nearby circuits would encourage Li Tongjie to resist, Emperor Wenzong bestowed honorific titles on Shi Xiancheng the military governor of Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), Li Zaiyi the military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing), Kang Zhimu (Â∫∑ÂøóÁù¶) the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong), and Wang Tingcou the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). Li Tongjie refused to follow the imperial edict, claiming that the soldiers would not permit it. Emperor Wenzong ordered a general campaign against him, and ordered Wu, Wang Zhixing, Kang, Shi, and Li Zaiyi, as well as Li Ting (ÊùéËÅΩ) the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (Áæ©Êàê, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) and Zhang Bo (ÂºµÊí≠) the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei) to converge on Henghai. Shi considered aiding Li Tongjie, because one of his children was married to one of Li Quanl√ºe's children. However, after the chancellor Wei Chuhou warned Shi, and Shi's own son Shi Tang (Âè≤Âîê) advised against aiding Li Tongjie, Shi Xiancheng did not do so, and sent troops against Li Tongjie, commanded by Shi Tang and the officer Qi Zhishao (‰∫ìÂøóÁ¥π). Only Wang Tingcou sought to help Li Tongjie, and while his forces did not engage imperial forces, he mobilized his forces and stationed them at his borders with Weibo, to try to distract the Weibo troops. Wang Tingcou also supplied Li Tongjie with salt and food supplies. Wang Tingcou also tried to bribe the Shatuo chieftain Zhuye Zhiyi (Êú±ÈÇ™Âü∑ÂÆú), seeking for Zhuye to ally with him to aid Li Tongjie; Zhuye refused. Meanwhile, Wu had initial success against Henghai troops, but died in winter 827; the imperial government initially named Li Huan (ÊùéÂØ∞) the military governor of Baoyi Circuit (‰øùÁæ©, headquartered in modern Linfen, Shanxi) to succeed Wu, but after Li Huan not only reported to the battlefield slowly but was also allowing his soldiers to pillage the countryside on the way, Emperor Wenzong instead named Fu Liangbi (ÂÇÖËâØÂºº) the military governor of Xiasui Circuit (Â§èÁ∂è, headquartered in modern Yulin, Shaanxi), and then the imperial guard general Li You (after Fu died on the way to the front) as his replacement. The imperial generals became stalemated against Li Tongjie. Whenever they had minor victories, they exaggerated their success. To placate them, the imperial government rewarded them handsomely, and it was said that the wealth of the Yangtze River-Huai River region became drained in order to reward them. However, the imperial troops were eventually wearing Li Tongjie down. Wang Tingcou, seeing that he was unable to save Li Tongjie by himself, persuaded Qi to turn against Shi Xiancheng and Shi Tang. Around the near year 829, Qi mutinied and headed toward Weibo's capital prefecture Wei Prefecture (È≠èÂçö). Emperor Wenzong sent the official Bo Qi (ÊüèËÄÜ) to Wei Prefecture to comfort Shi Xiancheng and the troops, and further diverted troops from Yicheng and Heyang (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Luoyang, Henan) Circuits to help Shi Xiancheng battle Qi Zhishao. Subsequently, Shi Tang and Li Ting joined their forces and defeated Qi Zhishao, who fled to Chengde.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 244. In spring 829, Li You captured one of the Henghai prefectures, De Prefecture (Âæ∑Â∑û, in modern Dezhou, Shandong), and the De garrison fled to Chengde. Li Tongjie, seeing that he was nearing defeat, sent letters to Li You, offering to surrender. Li You agreed to accept his surrender and reported this to the imperial government; he also sent his officer Wan Hong (Ëê¨Ê¥™) into Henghai's capital Cang Prefecture (ÊªÑÂ∑û), to take over control of the city from Li Tongjie. Emperor Wenzong sent Bo to the front to comfort the troops, but Bo, believing that Li Tongjie might be planning treachery, instead rode into Cang Prefecture with several hundred cavalry soldiers. He found an excuse and executed Wan, and then seized Li Tongjie and his family members, beginning to escort them to Chang'an. On June 1, hearing rumors that Wang Tingcou was planning to launch a raid to free Li Tongjie, Bo beheaded Li Tongjie and sent his head to Chang'an. (The generals, angry that Bo appeared to be planning to claim all of the credit, submitted various accusations against Bo; further, as Li You became seriously ill soon after hearing the news of Bo's killing of Wan, Emperor Wenzong remarked, \\"If Li You dies, it is Bo who killed him!\\" Li You soon thereafter died, and Emperor Wenzong ordered Bo to commit suicide.) Li Tongjie's mother Lady Sun, his wife Lady Cui, and his son Li Yuankui (ÊùéÂÖÉÈÄµ) were all delivered to Chang'an. Emperor Wenzong pardoned them, but sent them to Hunan Circuit (ÊπñÂçó, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan). Li Tongzhi and Li Tongsun, who were not born of Lady Sun, were also spared, but were exiled with their mothers.New Book of Tang, vol. 213. It was said that in the aftermaths of the campaign, Henghai was covered with bones, and only about 30-40% of the population remained.

It is also included in his Literary Pocket-Book and published on its own as The Months. The work places emphasis on the season of autumn as a time for justice and prosperity, and influenced John Keats's poem \\"To Autumn\\". The emphasis on both works is on a temperate landscape and the positive political aspects of living in such a place. The work also stresses the sickness that is connected to a temperate landscape, which is related to the physical problems that Keats was suffering from at the time. Background In 1819, Hunt's The Calendar of Nature was printed in his periodical the Examiner. The poem describes the artistic connections to each of the months, descriptions of festivals, and a discussion about nature. Hunt also included the calendar in his collection the Literary Pocket-Book, a combination of poems and other material by Hunt and others. The work was first printed in January 1819, and,Roe 2005 pp. 308, 313 by 1823, there were five collections under the title.Holden 2005 p. 134 The work was later published in 1821 under the title The Months. The 1821 edition contained a preface which declared, \\"The good-nature with which this Calendar was received on its appearance in 1819 ... has induced its republication in a separate form, with considerable additions\\".Roe 1997 qtd. p. 266 The 1821 edition also included the final two stanzas of John Keats's poem \\"To Autumn\\" with the claim that \\"A living poet has happily personified autumn in some of the pleasantest shapes under which her servants appear\\". Months The work quotes Percy Bysshe Shelley and discusses the works of Edmund Spenser.Roe 1995 pp. 203‚Äì204 The calendar also refers to Shelley regarding autumn when it states: \\"The poet still takes advantage of the exuberance of harvest and the sign of the Zodiac in this month, to read us a lesson on justice\\".Roe 1995 qtd. pp. 203‚Äì204 For September and autumn, Hunt connected the harvest and the month's zodiac symbol, Libra, in order to discuss justice. In particular, he said that autumn had \\"a certain festive abundance for the supply of all creation\\".Roe 2005 qtd. p. 321 Additionally, Hunt brings up Shelley's poems Convito and The Revolt of Islam in order to discuss autumn, abundance of crops, and revolution. The plenty that comes from the time period is supposed to bring peace to warring people.Roe 1995 p. 205 Hunt also describes the natural events that take place during autumn: \\"This is the month of the migration of birds, of the finished harvest, of nut-gathering, of cyder and merry-making, and, towards the conclusion, of the change of colour in trees. The swallows, and many other soft-billed birds that feed on insects, disappear for the warmer climates, leaving behind only a few stragglers, probably from weakness or sickness, who hide themselves in caverns and other sheltered places, and occasionally appear upon warm days.\\"Bewell 1999 qtd. p. 178 Themes September, for instance, was used to promote the ideas of the commonwealth along with Hunt's views on Justice. The specific discussion on September came between a discussion of the Peterloo Massacre and a discussion of people on trial for sedition. Hunt wished to promote peace and liberty, with a direct connection to nature. This view influenced Keats's \\"To Autumn\\", with its emphasis on \\"Merry Old England\\" and the reaction against the political violence of the time.Roe 2005 pp. 321‚Äì322 The works are similar in that they emphasize the same images, such as the animals and activities found during autumn.Roe 1995 p. 203 When Hunt republished parts of Keats's poem, he added an emphasis on justice through association with Hunt's own claims about autumn.Roe 1997 p. 266 Keats, like Hunt, emphasized a temperate landscape in his works. Hunt's description of autumn suggests vitality, though he also describes sickness. In turn, he is commenting on the dietary habits and other aspects of the land. It is possible that the temperate landscape is in opposition to the tropical, and that the political implications are that tropical countries are less free while temperate ones are more so. As such, the extremes in the tropical climate reflect the political extremes that cause problems. The descriptions of temperate climates are also connected to medical aspects of British life, possibly representing various illnesses that befall people during autumn. People like Keats sought other climates in order to try to overcome their sicknesses. However, Keats and Hunt reveal a preference for the British landscape, and this influenced the construction of \\"To Autumn\\".Bewell 1999 pp. 178‚Äì182 Notes References * Bewell, Alan.

This coat has a regular hood. This is a coat designed for people who stay outdoors for a long time on cold days, such as soldiers and laborers. Background This coat was first produced in 1971 by the Logistics Corps for the Israel Defense Forces soldiers, and is a part of the Israel Defense Forces mess dress. It replaced the heavy woolen Greatcoat and the United States Battledress coat. The original Doobon coat colors were olive for most soldiers and blue for the air force and navy. These are almost the only colors it comes in, to date, although Khagor (\\"◊ó◊í◊ï◊®\\") Ltd. received a concession to use the brand Doobon for coats sold both to the IDF and to civilians. Civilian use Outside the army, this coat is worn mostly by Israeli civilians who have to stay outdoors for long hours on winter time, and by those who belong to Zionist groups that manifest opposing trendy and fashion clothing.On Liora Rosenfeld-blumgarten book, ‚Äò‚ÄôBlood oranges‚Äô‚Äô, the pesticide agent says \\"in that respect, that of dressing, my job is most convenient: mat jeans, flannel shirts, Doobon military coat on rainy days. Only very rarely, when I am going to meet for the first time with a customer, who, I was told was a specifically successful dairy farming or chicken coop, or one who considers himself to be a real businessman, I am slightly improving my clothing. \\" The Doobon coat is a sign of Modern Orthodox Judaism and residents of the Israeli settlements, as well as for socialist Zionists, including Kibbutz members. The Doobon coat symbolizes being an Israeli in the work of various artists, including those of Yehonatan Geffen. In his Ballad of Druze, he rhymed the words Druze (in Hebrew \\"Droozy\\" ◊ì◊®◊ï◊ñ◊ô) and Uzi, and phrased \\"Well, with the Doobon and the Uzi, who can see he is a Druze?\\" Combat use The Argentine Army ordered in the early 1980s some 200,000 parkas of a commercially produced version of the Dubon, made under contract in Israel by ISREX Ltd, which were issued to Argentine infantry units during the Falklands War, but later they produced their own version.Van Der Bijl & Hannon, Argentine Forces in the Falklands (1992), pp. 18-19; 40-41; 43; 45-46.

It was previously used by Route 410 to Rehovot, and was known as the Jumping Bridge due to a bump in the middle of the bridge which caused cars to jump if speeding. It is now a part of a recreation ground, next to a new bridge carrying the Route 410. History The downstream-facing side of the bridge in 2010 The bridge was one in a series of bridges built by Sultan Baybars in Egypt and Palestine. It was first studied in modern times by Clermont-Ganneau, who noted that an Arabic chronicle had referred to the construction by Baybars in 672 AH of two bridges build of a significant nature \\"in the neighbourhood of Ramleh\\". The chief purpose of these bridges was to ease communication for his armies between Egypt and northern Syria.Clermont-Ganneau, 1896, ARP II, pp. 110‚Äì117 The second of these two bridges is thought to be the Jisr Jindas. According to Clermont-Ganneau, the bridge was built in 671‚Äì672 AH (1273‚Äì1274).Clermont-Ganneau, 1896, ARP II, p. 174; Reinecke, 1992, II, 38 No. 170. Both cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 318 The Archaeology of Society in the Holy Land cites the completion date as 1273.Levy, 1995, p. 517 Max van Berchem, who examined it in the late 19th century, found that the bridge contained large amount of reused Crusader masonry, some of which carried mason¬¥s marks.Clermont-Ganneau, 1896, ARP II, p. 182 Also cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 318 Description The bridge is long, and wide.Petersen, 2001, p. 318 It comprises three arches, two central piers with triangular upstream- facing cutwaters and downstream-facing buttresses with sloping cills. It is very similar in design to the more well-known Jisr Jindas, apart from the width of the piers.Petersen, 2010, p. 297 The bridge has a more than 2:1 arch- span to pier-width ratio versus approximately 1:1 at Jisr Jindas. The bridge does not contain any decoration or inscriptions, similar to that found on Jisr Jindas. However, according to Andrew Petersen there is \\"a possible inscription or signature\\" on a stone at the south end. See also *Daughters of Jacob Bridge References Bibliography   *Petersen, A.

Lodish's research focuses on cell surface proteins and other important areas at the interface between molecular cell biology and medicine. Biography Dr. Lodish received his A.B. degree Summa Cum Laude and with Highest Honors in Chemistry and Mathematics, from Kenyon College in 1962, and his Ph.D. degree in genetics with Dr. Norton Zinder from the Rockefeller University in 1966. Following two years of postdoctoral research at the M.R.C. Laboratory of Molecular Biology with Drs. Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick (winners of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 2002 and 1962, respectively), he joined the faculty of the MIT Department of Biology. He was promoted to Professor in 1976, and in 1983 was appointed Founding Member of the new Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research by Founding Director David Baltimore (winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 1975).Founders In 1999, Dr. Lodish also became Professor of Biological Engineering in the new MIT Department of Biological Engineering. Dr. Lodish has served on advisory panels for the U.S. National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation and the American Cancer Society. He was Chair of the advisory board of the Division of Basic Sciences of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and of the Lerner Research Institute of the Cleveland Clinic. He has served on the advisory boards of several other institutions, including the Biozentrum of the University of Basel, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, the Center for Molecular Biology Heidelberg (ZMBH) in Germany, the Life Sciences Institute of the University of Michigan, and the PEW Scholars Program in Biomedical Sciences. Currently he serves on the Visiting Committees of the California Institute of Technology Division of Biology and of the Engineering Division of the University of California Santa Barbara. From 1989 through 2007 Dr. Lodish was a member of the Board of Trustees of Kenyon College, and currently is an Emeritus Trustee. Dr. Lodish is a member of the Board of Trustees of Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital, where he also is Chair of the Research Committee of the Board of Trustees. He is also Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center, the group charged with oversight of the state‚Äôs 10 year, $1 billion investment in the life sciences. Dr. Lodish is the lead author of the textbook Molecular Cell Biology. The sixth edition was published in 2007 and the book has been translated into ten languages. The seventh edition appeared in 2012. During the 2004 calendar year Dr. Lodish served as President of the American Society for Cell Biology. Dr. Lodish was a founder and scientific advisory board member of Genzyme, Inc., Arris Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, and Allozyne, Inc. He has served on the Scientific Advisory Board for the Eisai Research Institute in Massachusetts and on the Scientific Advisory Board of Astra and then AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals. He has testified as an expert witness in several high- profile biotechnology patent trials in Federal Court, notably Amgen vs. TKT Aventis in 2000 and Amgen vs. Roche in 2007. Research Initially, Dr. Lodish's work focused on translational control of protein synthesis and on development of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. Beginning in 1973, his laboratory has concentrated on the biogenesis, structure, and function of several important secreted and plasma membrane glycoproteins. He defined the biosynthesis and maturation of the vesicular stomatitis virus and other plasma membrane glycoproteins, identified the intracellular organelles that mediate recycling of the asialoglycoprotein and transferrin receptors, and clarified the role of pH changes in delivery of iron to cells and recycling of the transferrin receptor. His group has elucidated steps in folding and oligomerization of several proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum, showed that exit of newly made proteins from this organelle requires that they be properly folded, and developed probes for measurement of the redox state within the endoplasmic reticulum. His research group was the first to clone and sequence mRNAs encoding a mammalian glucose transport protein, GLUT1, and then GLUT2 and the insulin- responsive GLUT4, an anion exchange protein, a transporter for free fatty acids, the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptors, intestinal sucrose-isomaltase, the erythropoietin receptor, two subunits of the TGF√ü receptor, and several adipocyte-specific proteins including adiponectin (formerly Acrp30). These have been used to define the structure, biosynthesis, and cellular functions of these and related proteins and to identify and characterize related genes that encode proteins with important physiological functions. Current efforts of his group focus on: #Erythropoiesis ‚Äì activation of and signal transduction by the erythropoietin receptor in erythroid progenitor cells, and the regulation of transcription, apoptosis, cell division, and enucleation during erythropoiesis. #Hematopoietic stem cells ‚Äì characterizing new marker cell surface proteins and new growth factors for their expansion in culture #The functions of adiponectin, an adipocyte-produced hormone that potently enhances glucose and fatty acid metabolism by muscle, and a family of adiponectin homologs. #Elucidating the roles of microRNAs in regulating hematopoiesis and fat and muscle cell development and metabolism Awards Dr. Lodish is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences, and served as Chair of the National Academy Section on Cellular and Developmental Biology. He is also a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology, and an Associate (Foreign) Member of the European Molecular Biology Organization. Dr. Lodish received a MERIT award from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. He is also a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, an honorary D.Sc. from Kenyon, the Stadie Award from the American Diabetes Association, and the 2010 Mentoring Award from the American Society of Hematology.

It is loosely based on a short story by Ray Bradbury (which in turn was based on his 1948 radio play for the CBS show Suspense) with a script written by Merwin Gerard. The film was produced by Universal Television and originally aired as an ABC Movie of the Week on January 29, 1972. It features John Williams's last score (to date) for a TV movie. Plot De Havilland plays Laura Wynant, a wealthy former mental patient who has travelled to her country estate to recuperate. While there, she discovers, when hearing faint calls for help, that a woman has been buried alive on her property. Wynant tries to inform others of what she has found but nobody believes her, and her family begins to suspect a relapse in her mental condition. Because her hands are nearly crippled by arthritis, she is not able to dig the woman up herself. She tricks a local boy into assisting her by telling him she is digging for a lost earring, but when he is scared by the cries of the buried woman she is forced to tell him the truth, which results in a confrontation with the lad's angry father. While going door-to-door to seek help she encounters the buried woman's husband, who had buried her after striking her on the head with a shovel and thought her dead. Wynant is confined to her home under doctor's orders but, in a fit of desperation, experiences enough recovery from the arthritis to provide strength in her hands. She begins to dig up the buried woman, who is still alive. Just then the murderous husband arrives on the scene, intending to bury his wife's body thoroughly. He comes up behind Wynant and is about to strike her with the shovel when the buried woman grabs Wynant's hand and pulls herself up out of the ground. The husband is petrified, giving the authorities just enough time to arrive on the scene and save Wynant and the buried woman.

It was set up to examine how the three branches of the U.S. federal government might reconstitute themselves after a catastrophic attack (decapitation strike) on the nation's capital, and to make recommendations for constitutional and statutory changes that would facilitate the continuity of government. Former presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford served as its honorary co-chairmen. Recommendations In 2003 the Commission published its first report, which dealt with the death or incapacitation of several members of Congress in the event of a terrorist attack.brookings.eduaei.org It recommended a constitutional amendment to allow Congress to legislate for the temporary appointment of members of both houses of Congress in case a large number of members were either killed or rendered unable to perform their duties. The United States Senate already is covered by measures that allow replacements to be readily made to fill vacancies. The commission warned that it takes an average of four months to stage the special election needed to fill a vacancy in the United States House of Representatives, which meant that an attack on members of the House could kill or incapacitate so many members of the body that it would not be able to operate at all and might appear illegitimate if it did so. A major attack could mean that Congress would have to confirm a Vice President or fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States without the needed quorum to perform its obligations.Clymer, Adam. \\"THREATS AND RESPONSES: CONGRESS; Panel Calls for Amendment to Fill House Seats in Emergency\\", The New York Times, June 6, 2003.

Martin took on the stage name of Nino as part of the Texas rap group PKO (Pounds, Keys and Ounces). Martin distributes music under the umbrella of Big Ballin Records Billboard Magazine, vol 111 no. 12 and Youngsta Records. He has also used various other outside companies to distribute a series of albums of popular music. P.K.O. As a teenager, Martin grew up in San Antonio. In the mid-1980s, he made friends with Mark \\"Magic\\" Outing and together, along with Robert \\"AK\\" Hill and childhood friend Ted \\"K-Sam\\" Meadows, they formed the nucleus of the rap group PKO (Pounds, Keys- or kilos, and Ounces, a reference to the weights at which drugs are bought and sold). PKO performed at local nightclubs and parties and developed a strong fan base. They began to release singles under their independent label, Youngsta Records. In 1992, PKO gained notoriety when CNN interviewed the group about the controversy surrounding their underground hit single Shoot the Police. After the release of the single, PKO recorded their first full length EP, Don't Fuck With Texas. In 1994, they released The Good, the Bad, the Mafia, which has sold 300,000 units to date and peaked at #64 on Billboard's album charts. After their CNN appearance, PKO performed with N.W.A, the Geto Boys and Too Short. Master P invited PKO to contribute a single to the October 31, 1995 release of Down South Hustlers: Bouncin' and Swingin'. PKO is credited with track #9 on the album, Got It Sowed Up. The album reached #139 on Billboard 200 and #13 on Billboard's Top R&B;/Hip-Hop charts. Martin and fellow PKO member \\"Magic\\" Mark recorded a diss towards DJ Quik entitled San Antonio Ain't Shit Like Compton in response to Jus Lyke Compton, a track on which DJ Quik compared San Antonio to Compton. The track San Antonio Ain't Shit Like Compton appeared on 1994's Tha Good, Tha Bad, Tha Mafia. PKO declined recording deals with major labels and remained an independent label. Throughout the 1990s PKO released their own albums as well as those of other artists on their label, Youngsta Records. Martin later went solo, and his debut album, Nino, sold 100,027 units and hit #84 on the Billboard Rap Charts. PKO is most remembered as the Southern/Texas group equivalent to NWA.

A larger variant, the Falco EVO, is capable of carrying larger payloads is also available. Neither system is designed to carry weapons, The launch customer, Pakistan, reportedly wanted the Falco armed, a request that Italy rejected. Development * The Falco UAV's maiden flight took place in December 2003 and Galileo Avionica had completed platform qualification in late October 2004. Over 40 hours of flight-testing had been completed by then at the Salto di Quirra test range in Sardinia. Validation of flight controls had been completed in September 2004. Testing of the onboard systems was planned to be started in early 2005 and integration of the electro-optical sensor suite planned for July 2005. Radar installation was scheduled to begin in 2006. * In January 2007 it was reported that Galileo Avionica had finished factory acceptance tests and was ready to deliver the first production Falco UAV System to its launch customer, then believed to be Pakistan. The production version of the Falco UAV used a modified powerplant developing 80 hp (60 kW), supplied by UAV Engines. * In March 2009 it was reported that a modified version named Falco Evo, evo meaning evolution, was being offered. It features larger tail booms and wings which almost double wingspan to 12.5 m and increase payload from 70 kg to 100 kg. The Falco Evo's first flight was expected to take place by mid-2010. * At the time Selex ES officials refused to identify the customer, but it was known that Pakistan had ordered 5 systems, including a total of 25 Falco UAVs with spare flight units and ground control stations (GCS). Two systems were in service by March 2009, two more had been delivered and the final assembly of the last system was being undertaken in Pakistan. * In August 2009 it was reported that the Falco UAV had completed flight-tests while being launched by a catapult launch system, the Robonic MC2555LLR pneumatic launcher.

The family's last male heir died in 1717, bringing an end to the House of Eggenberg.  History  The origin of the Austrian noble house of Eggenberg is shrouded in darkness. The Counter-Reformation with its struggles between the Catholic court of the Habsburgs and the Protestant nobility belongs to those moving times in which the destiny of some families changed abruptly. While old, Protestant-minded nobles lost power and their native lands, families loyal to the emperor were raised to new nobility and garnered great wealth. A good example of this is the meteoric rise of the Eggenberg family. They had become rich vintners in Radkersburg, and then expanded their operations to be financiers to the nobility and local lords loyal to the emperor.  Ascendancy of a merchant family  Ulrich Eggenberger (‚Ä† 1448) is the first documented member of the family, who is mentioned in his function as a Graz municipal judge for the first time in 1432. Two sons of Ulrich, Hans and Balthasar, then divided the family into two lines. Hans founded the Radkersburg (later Ehrenhausen) line and Balthasar was the patriarch of the main Graz line, which then also developed a branch in Augsburg. Upon the death of his father, Ulrich, Balthasar Eggenberger (‚Ä† 1493) inherited a stately property and successfully continued the commercial business and coin-minting operations. Under Balthasar, the business connections to the Habsburg imperial court also developed. Emperor Frederick III, for the most part residing in Graz, appointed Balthasar the mint master of Graz in the Duchy of Styria, Laibach (today Ljubljana) in the Duchy of Carniola and Sankt Veit an der Glan in the Duchy of Carinthia. This narrow connection with the imperial house and Balthasar's distinctive economic talent led naturally to a substantial increase of the Eggenberger wealth and fortunes. The 15th century was marked by warmongering discussions and threats by Hungarian and Ottoman Turk aspirations. In this time of political instability Balthasar, in the way of a true businessman, plied both sides against the middle. Thus, he was also made director of the royal finance chamber of Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus, archrival of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. It is believed that this connection with the Hungarian king led to the noble appearance of the family coat of arms (three crowned ravens bearing a crown in their beaks) for the still middle-class family of merchants. Corvinus is Latin for raven and Corvinus‚Äô own coat of arms is a single raven bearing a ring in its beak. In 1463, through his accumulated wealth and influence, Balthasar Eggenberger acquired the property to the west of Graz which he developed into the family seat and forms the area on which Eggenberg Palace sits today. In 1470, the Gothic chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary, constructed under Balthasar, was acknowledged in a Papal indulgence and still today forms the center of the baroque palace arrangement constructed under the great-grandson of Balthasar, Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg.  The Augsburg branch  A son of Balthasar's from his first marriage to Radegunde Seidennater (‚Ä† before 1480), Christoph Eggenberger (‚Ä† 1520), moved to Augsburg with his youngest sister, Radegund (‚Ä† after 1508) where business opportunities appeared more favorable and competition with children of Balthasar's second marriage to Barbara von Pain (‚Ä† 1518), who developed the main lineage in Graz, wouldn't be a factor. The Augsburg line died out in the 17th century.Heydendorff, W. E. ‚ÄúDie F√ºrsten und Freiherren zu Eggenberg und ihre Vorfahren‚Äù. Graz: Verlag Styria, 1965. pp. 51‚Äì53.  The Ehrenhausen lineage  The House of Eggenberg remained one of the most significant patrician families of Styria till 17th century. Hans Eggenberger (‚Ä† 1481) a brother of Balthasar who remained in Radkersburg was the father of the Ehrenhausen line. His son, Ruprecht von Eggenberg (‚Ä† 1611), was not only a successful businessman but also an accomplished soldier. His military accomplishments in the fight against invasions by armies of the Ottoman Empire, among others, led to the elevation of the whole family into the Barons Estate providing the second, essential foundation-stone for the rise of others in the family. Ruprecht left his inheritance to his nephew Wolf von Eggenberg, another one of the rare Eggenbergs who opted for a military career, which cost him his right leg in battle with the Turks.Heydendorff, W. E. ‚ÄúDie F√ºrsten und Freiherren zu Eggenberg und ihre Vorfahren‚Äù. Graz: Verlag Styria, 1965. p.47. The next generation saw the end of the male heirs to the Ehrenhausen line with the death of Franz Andrae to Sitzenberg in 1646.  The zenith of the main lineage in the 17th century  Schloss Eggenberg Arms of Prince Johann Anton I of Eggenberg It was the younger cousin of Ruprecht, Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg, from the main Graz line who brought the family to their ultimate prominence. Graz was the seat of power for the Habsburg archdukes of Inner Austria from 1564‚Äì1619. It was during this period that Hans Ulrich, having received a very good Protestant education at the T√ºbinger Stift, converted to Catholicism in order to serve his lord, Archduke Ferdinand. In 1619, at the onset of The Thirty Years War, Archduke Ferdinand was elected Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor and, owing to his own faith and the strong influence of his devoted mother, Archduchess Maria Anna of Bavaria he prosecuted the Counter-Reformation in the Habsburg hereditary lands and the Holy Roman Empire which led to the Thirty Years War between Protestant and Catholic Princes in the Empire as well as the House of Habsburg and the House of Bourbon. Under the influence of Cardinal Richelieu and his anti-Habsburg policy, the Catholic French supported the Protestant, German Princes against the Emperor. Hans Ulrich helped steer Ferdinand II's policy. Hans Ulrich was awarded the Order of the Golden Fleece (an honor rare outside of the Habsburg Royal Family), appointed Governor of Inner Austria as well as First Minister of the Emperor, Duke of Krumlov and President of the Geheimrat. He was, with Richelieu, one of the most important and powerful statesmen and diplomats of 17th century in Europe. Due to both his service to the Emperor and his cunning business prowess, Eggenberg amassed a large fortune and, in addition to the family seat in Graz, extensive territorial holdings throughout the southern regions of the Habsburg hereditary lands from ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov to Ptuj. It was in 1625, as he was appointed to Governor of Inner Austria, while Ferdinand busied himself with the duties of imperial office in Vienna, that Hans Ulrich had the medieval family seat transformed into a lavish palace of the late Renaissance and early Baroque. Today, this palace, Schloss Eggenberg stands as a museum and UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site owned by the State of Styria in Austria and managed by the Universalmuseum Joanneum. The only son of Hans Ulrich, Johann Anton I von Eggenberg, Holy Roman Prince (1610‚Äì1649) enjoyed his education at, among others, the Jesuit University in Graz. In the end, after an extensive gentleman's tour of the whole of Europe he returned to Graz in 1632. At this time he exerted his efforts in a broad renovation of Schloss Eggenberg. Nevertheless, his preferential residences were the Palais Eggenberg on the Sackstrasse in the Graz Old Town (now Palais Herberstein and home of the Joanneum's Museum im Palais) and the residence in ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov. He also entered into the service of the imperial court and proved himself under Emperor Ferdinand III. An important goal for Johann Anton I was the acquisition of the Imperial Estate, which had amazingly eluded his father, Hans Ulrich. However, in 1647, the emperor granted him the possibility to buy the princely shire of G√∂rz with the town Aquileia as well as a few other localities. With these acquisitions the Eggenbergs were prosperous not only in Habsburg hereditary lands but also within the Holy Roman Empire. Thus, the Eggenbergs now had the right to a seat in the Imperial Diet.  Decline of a dynasty  After the unexpected death of Johann Anton I and on account of the absence of a valid last will, division of the Eggenberg holdings led to conflict among his two sons, Johann Christian and Johann Seyfried. They agreed on an equivalent division of the inheritance. Johann Christian received the Bohemian possessions and Johann Seyfried decided on the Inner Austrian possessions. The most serious disagreement arose over the fate of Gradisca, because, the seat in the Imperial Diet was tied to this possession. The quarrel would last until 1672, when they could finally agree on a new contract of inheritance. The division of properties remained as it was with Johann Seyfried receiving a larger capital. Johann Christian meanwhile would administer Gradisca, however, he would do so in the name of both brothers.Kaiser, B. Schloss Eggenberg. Graz: Christian Brandst√§tter Verlag, 2006. (available in German or English editions through the Universalmuseum Joanneum Johann Seyfried focused his primary attention on the splendid arrangement of the Inner Austrian possessions awarded to him, above all, the completion of the accouterments of the Graz residence. Under his regency Schloss Eggenberg received its first magnificent accouterments and the first garden was established. Most probably Johann Seyfried's most important task was to provide his residence as host for the imperial bride of Emperor Leopold I in 1673. During the course of the only imperial wedding to be held in Graz, future Empress, Archduchess Claudia Felicitas of Tyrol resided in the new family residence of the Eggenbergs. Johann Seyfried spared no expense for either his princely patronage or the imperial visit. While his brother, Johann Christian, knew how to increase his wealth with the typical Eggenberg cunning, Johann Seyfried did not seem to have inherited the economic talent of his family. Within a few decades he brought himself to almost complete ruin. Only by the sales of the most the various possessions and by the narrow connections with the imperial house was he able to escape his misfortune time and again. After the death of Johann Christian, Johann Seyfried received the income from the Bohemian possessions as the sole heir of the House of Eggenberg at which time his financial position was again comfortable. After the death Johann Seyfried in 1713 the continuance of the House of Eggenberg was thought to still be secured through male descendants. However, in 1716 his ailing son, Johann Anton II died at the age of 47. Only one year later his only son, the last Prince of Eggenberg, Johann Christian II, died at the age of 13 due to a severe case of appendicitis. Johann Seyfried's brother, Johann Christian in Krumau, left no heirs upon his death in 1710 and in his will stipulated that the profitable Bohemian possessions pass to the nephew of his widow, Adam II Franz Karl a Prince of Schwarzenberg. Thus with the death of Johann Christian II in 1717, the House of Eggenberg's male heritage came to an end. Subsequently, the decay of the vast Eggenberg possessions began. One of the two sisters of Johann Christian II, Maria Eleonore, Imperial Princess to Eggenberg, married her third husband, Johann Leopold Count Herberstein. Her spouse was named her sole heir upon her death without issue in 1774. The Styrian possessions, which included Schloss Eggenberg in Graz, thereby passed to a branch of the Herberstein family. Other possessions were sold to pay off debt and Gradisca, which could not be passed to a female heir, was taken out of Eggenberg possession. Thus by 1774 the arguably most famous noble dynasty of Styria had become extinct.  Coat of arms  Eggenberg coat of arms Blazon: In the middle of a silver field a golden helmet-crown, trefoil shaped, accompanied by three golden-crowned, black-highlighted, red-tongued ravens, in the posture of a normal heraldic eagle each with head to crown. On the crowned helmet with black-silver coverings a golden-crowned, black-highlighted and red-tongued raven, flying up, already in the posture of a spread-eagle. It is thought that the coat of arms, which is found already on the tombstone of Balthasar Eggenberger, was granted sometime after 1479 through his relationship with Mathias Corvinus, King of Hungary. What is unusual is the prominent use of this coat of arms on the grave of a middle-class merchant citizen whose family would not achieve noble status until the next generation.

It was first published in 2008. Plot Honey and Agnes are best friends growing up in Mount Blessing, a religious commune in Fairfield, Connecticut. Honey and Agnes could not be any more different, and the older they get the more they are growing apart. Honey was abandoned by her mother as a newborn, but she lived in the nursery with Agnes until she turned 7 years old; Honey lives with Winky and Agnes lives with her parents and her brother, Benny. Ever since Agnes got The Saints' Way (The Saints' Way is a book that everyone in Mount Blessing gets when they turn twelve; it is given by the leader Emmanuel), she has changed. Agnes now abides all the rules in Mount Blessing, and she goes by whatever Emmanuel says. Honey on the other hand, never listens to Emmanuel or Veronica, never follows the rules and hates living at Mount Blessing. Whenever they, or anyone, do something wrong they are sent to the \\"regulation room\\". There they get whipped by Emmanuel and Veronica. Everything stays this way until Nana Pete, Agnes' grandmother, shows up unexpectedly and finds out the truth behind Mount Blessing. Awards The Patron Saint of Butterflies received the New Atlantic Independent Booksellers (NAIBA) Best Book of the Year award for Children's Literature in 2008; it was also selected as one of Oprah‚Äôs Best Teen Selections in 2008. The Patron Saint of Butterflies earned the award for the Young Adult Book of the Year by the Northeast Independent Booksellers Association and was a Top Ten Pick for 2008 by Amazon.com. The novel was selected to be a Book Sense Pick and a Banks Children Book of the Year Selection. It was also a Golden Sower Award Nominee and a Grand Canyon Reader Award Nominee. Book Ban In 2011, The Patron Saint of Butterflies was banned from a school in Minnesota. The effect of which was to increase the popularity and visibility of the novel. The Author's Basis for the Story The story is a fictionalized account of the little-known religious commune run by Herbert T.(Thomas) Schwartz (1903-1980) at Mount Hope in New York in the mid-20th century. (Unlike the Mount Blessing community, the Mount Hope religious commune was quite mobile. Schwartz started the community by gathering laypeople around himself in Greenwich Village. The community was housed in Ridgewood, Queens, New York, and then moved 75 miles north to Mount Hope near Newburgh, New York. After Schwartz died, the commune \\"headquarters\\" moved to Milford, Pennsylvania.) One who was an adult at Mount Hope, Laura Mead Jones, describes the author, Cecilia Galante, as a woman who lived the life of the children described in The Patron Saint of Butterflies: \\"Cecilia Galante was born at Mt. Hope and her book is something of a parody of life as seen through the eyes of many of her generation.\\" In a 2007, Laura Jones, also, wrote that it appeared to her that author Cecilia Galante actually enjoyed Mount Hope, but only changed her views about the religious commune when convinced to do so as an adult by her mother, Terry Plummer. Similarities between Mount Blessing commune and Mount Hope commune are only slightly veiled. The character \\"Emmanuel\\" stood for cult-leader Herbert T. Schwartz while the character \\"Veronica\\" represented his wife \\"Charleen\\" (some reports call her \\"Catherine,\\" also). The fictional book, The Saint's Way represents the autobiography of St. Therese of Lisieux which is called The Little Way. Schwartz considered himself to be the official and proper (though never pronounced by any ecclesial authority and thereby self-proclaimed) interpreter of St. Therese's description of her path to holiness. Many adults who were children at the commune wrote blogs confirming abuse (physical and sexual) by Schwartz at Mount Hope. A private Facebook page was created for survivors to contact one another. Some remaining adults defend Herbert T. Schwartz as a great and holy leader while the grown children are confused and depraved. Then there are some who were there or who knew Schwartz who are non- committal about the whole event. The author of The Patron Saint of Butterflies, Cecilia Galante, reported that it was a place where she was always writing, including early stories \\"passed down from her father,\\" Tom Plummer. Audio Book A nine (9) hour audio version of Patron Saint of Butterflies was produced in 2011. Reviews *John Sellers of Publishers Weekly called The Patron Saint of Butterflies \\"required reading\\" in February 2008. *Publishers Weekly described the book as having \\"ripped from the headlines fascination for readers\\" in May 2008. (In this review, the author's first name is misspelled and the text is attributed to \\"Cecelia Galante.\\") *Ilene Cooper of Booklist described the climax as \\"realistic and emotionally charged.\\" *Joel Shoemaker of School Library Journal described the main characters of The Patron Saint of Butterflies by writing that both girls \\"occasionally seem wise beyond their years;\\" however, he noted, \\"readers will nevertheless cheer them on as they ponder the limits of faith and duty.\\" *Regarding the audio recording of the book, Heather Booth of Booklist reported that \\"This compelling story is well handled by a full cast of actors\\" and that \\"echoed voices are used to good effect for internal thoughts, and a church choir adds an extra boost in an especially powerful scene in this story of faith, doubt, and friendship.\\" *Also regarding the audio recording of the book, Amanda Raklovits writing in the School Library Journal said that \\"Despite some contrivances, listeners will be propelled along by the inherent tension in the narrative and the strength of the friendship between the protagonists.\\" References External links *The Patron Saint of Butterflies on Amazon *Cecilia Galante Category:American young adult novels Category:2008 American novels Category:Novels set in Connecticut Category:Bloomsbury Publishing books ","title":"The Patron Saint of Butterflies"},{"id":"24645341","text":"M√°ire Eil√≠s N√≠ Fhlaithearta, Irish actress and former model.

It was a market operator under MiFID Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, and was both a regulated market and a multilateral trading facility. PLUS Market Group was the holding company for PLUS Stock Exchange (PLUS-SX), PLUS Derivatives (PLUS-DX) and Plus Technology (PLUS-TX). It provided cash trading, listing, derivatives and technology services. After the group got into financial trouble in 2012 it looked for ways to sell the business. The exchange, containing all the listed companies and the exchange license, was sold to ICAP and the technology division was sold to GMEX Group (formerly Forum Trading Solutions). ICAP (after renaming itself as NEX Group in 2016) was bought out by CME Group in 2018. History PLUS Markets grew out of a growth-company stock market named OFEX, which effectively collapsed in September 2004 after a failed fundraising. PLUS was launched in 2005 as a competitor to the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market using a new electronic trading exchange software. The PLUS Service, as it was known, was launched on the 30 November 2005, and enabled brokers to trade any stock on the LSE's official list. The OFEX name was discontinued in late 2006, once regulatory changes had been made. The group gained the gold standard recognised investment exchange (RIE) licence in July 2007 but struggled to make much headway against the dominant LSE. In particular it found itself unable to trade AIM-listed stocks and eventually commenced legal action against the LSE. The LSE settled, but the arrival of the credit crisis in 2008 prevented successful trading. The group also struggled to maintain allegiance to its original constituency of small-company listings. Although it did host some well-known names, including Arsenal Football Club it failed to break even and the group eventually got into financial difficulty in 2012. In 2008 PLUS posted a pre-tax loss of ¬£8.26 million for 2009, following a pre-tax loss of ¬£10.20 million for 2008. It also announced the results of a strategic review, outlining plans to move away from its core retail market and develop a new platform with a view to trade more exotic securities, such as derivatives In May 2012 it initially announced that it would wind down its operations and close after failing to find a buyer, but then a week later on 18 May 2012 it announced that ICAP, the interdealer broker, would buy PLUS Stock Exchange (PLUS-SX) and its derivative operations. The group later sold the technology division PLUS-TS to GMEX Group (formerly Forum Trading Solutions).  Management  PLUS Markets Group was initially run by Simon Brickles, formerly Head of AIM at the London Stock Exchange. He had been recruited to manage OFEX and became chief executive of the rescued firm at the end of 2004. Veteran small companies fund manager Stephen Hazell- Smith joined as chairman in 2005. In 2009 Brickles and Hazell-Smith stepped down and were replaced by Cyril Theret, formerly the business development director at PLUS, and Giles Vardey as chairman. The finance director was Nemone Wynn-Evans, also a former business development director at the company.
