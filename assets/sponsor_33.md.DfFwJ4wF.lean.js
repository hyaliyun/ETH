Afterwards Archbishop Parker selected him as one of his domestic chaplains, and employed him in the collection of the library now deposited in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Batman asserts that he collected 6,700 books for the archbishop, though this is probably an exaggeration. In 1573 he was rector of Merstham, Surrey. He was also Doctor of Divinity and parson of Newington Butts in the same county. In 1582 he was one of the domestic chaplains of Henry Carey, Lord Hunsdon. He resided for some time at Leeds, Kent.

The nearest, to which Charles Danolds belonged, was at Fairhaven (the present-day Childs). The Albion preaching station was part of the Fairhaven charge. In the late 1840s the Fairhaven church was served part-time by whatever ministers were available - there were none at all from 1848 to 1852. In 1852 Rev. William B. Cook moved to Gaines - for four years he preached at Fairhaven and Clarendon until he, too, moved on. Thus Albion Universalists were in the same situation as those in Brocton - when they had a preacher they worshiped at the courthouse, otherwise Lewis Pullman led religious services in private homes. By default, Lewis Pullman served as the resident Universalist minister. To assure George Pullman that a Universalist church in Albion would begin with enthusiasm, Charles Danolds went home from the Castle Rest meeting and placed an article in the Democratic newspaper outlining Pullman's interested in building a $30,000 Universalist church as a memorial to his father Lewis. Danolds spent the next eleven months rallying support for the project. On June 15, 1891, Pullman stopped at Albion to gauge local interest in the building. Danolds and the Universalists he had gathered displayed enough enthusiasm to satisfy their benefactor. The next step in Danolds' building campaign was a conference. The Universalist conference to form a church in Albion met at the courthouse on Wednesday-Thursday, July 15‚Äì16, 1891. Ten Universalist ministers attended to show their support for the proposed church and to organize the new congregation. The Wednesday meeting was called to order by Charles Danolds. Frank E. Kittredge, an Albion entrepreneur who at that time ran a patent medicine business, was named secretary. Rev. Thomas Borden, of Sherman, gave the keynote address. Knowing the religious liberals of this vicinity from his long pastorate at Fairhaven, he was firm in the belief that a strong Universalist church could be maintained in Albion if those friendly to the cause would commit to the project at the conference.Vail, Charles H. \\"Historical Souvenir and Directory of the Pullman Universalist Church\\" 1910. Retrieved July 25, 2011. The conference then adjourned to the Presbyterian chapel, where the ladies of Fairhaven served dinner. In the afternoon they returned to the courthouse, where the ministers each gave a ten-minute sermon. Rev. Alfred Ellsworth Wright, son of farmer Justus W. Wright of Rich's Corners, who was supplying the Fairhaven church, stated that some could only be Baptists, or Methodists, and others could only be Universalists.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15181a.htm Rev. George W. Powell, of Lockport, gave the closing sermon, saying the difference between the Universalists and other denominations was a little word of four letters - LOVE.http://lovewins.us/886/the-beauties-of-universalism/ On Thursday morning the business committee presented a temporary organization of the Pullman Church Memorial Society of Albion. The society adopted their report and elected the following trustees: Charles A. Danolds, Wm Hallock (also Treasurer), Sheldon Warner, William A. Tanner, Mrs. Seth S. Spencer, Mrs. Frank E. Kittridge, and Mrs. George J. Reed. One hundred people joined the new society and pledged $25 a week to fund weekly services at the courthouse. George Pullman was notified of the gratifying outcome of the conference, and the society got right to business - Rev. A.E. Wright preached the first sermon on July 26. The church was formally organized under New York State law at a meeting at the courthouse on Tuesday, August 18, 1891. An organizational committee consisting of Seth S. Spencer, John A. Dibble and J. W. Wright was appointed to present a list of by-laws and report a list of Officers. The following were elected: Charles A. Danolds, John Lattin, Mrs. Joseph Hart, Sheldon Warner, Mrs. Seth S. Spencer, William A. Tanner, J. D. Billings, Adelbert Chapman, Mrs. Frank E. Kittredge, George J. Reed (Treasurer) and Frank E. Kittridge (Secretary). The official name of the church became the \\"Pullman Memorial Universalist Church of Albion\\" Raising funds To ensure matching funds and in-kind donations to the church he was endowing, George Pullman informed the Albion Universalists that his gift depended on the society raising $5,000.00 as a Guarantee Fund. The fund would show that they were serious about their new church and would have the money to maintain the new building once it was built. On the motion of Charles Danolds, the moderator of the organizational meeting appointed ten church members - men and women, lawyers, well-to-do farmers, and entrepreneurs - as a soliciting committee to raise the required money. The Guarantee Fund committee members gathered subscriptions from loyal Universalists and held several social events. However the society did not have a regular minister to provide leadership - Rev. George W. Powell, who had a church at Lockport, preached for the new society when he could until, in April 1892, he left the ministry to go into public speaking. Thus, nine months after it had begun, fundraising for the new church was bogged down and leaderless. It was during this period that Emily Caroline Pullman died, on May 21, 1892.Leyendecker, Liston Edgington. \\"Palace Car Prince: A Biography of George Mortimer Pullman.\\" University Press of Colorado. pp 210. 1992 The family came by private car to bury her in Mount Albion Cemetery next to James Lewis Pullman. Another of the Pullman family connections to Albion was gone. The Guarantee Fund languished into the fall. Then, the New York Universalist Convention stepped in rather than lose the large endowment through lack of interest, and assigned missionary Rev. Daniel Wright to the Albion church. Rev. Wright first preached at Fairhaven on September 11, then at Fairhaven and Albion on September 18. He brought in the Universalist State Superintendent of Churches to preach at Fairhaven, Albion, and the Porter School House, in the Town of Albion. Not conventional Sunday services, they were inspirational meetings to raise money and save the Pullman gift. The size of the Guarantee Fund was announced at each meeting and everyone donated. Rev. Wright also organized the ladies of the church, on October 11 establishing a ladies' aid society with fourteen members who pledged to raise $500 for the Guarantee Fund. Their first effort was a social event at the residence of Mrs. Joseph S. Hart. Then Rev. Wright organized a two-day conference at the GAR Hall on Thursday-Friday, November 17‚Äì18, and invited prominent Universalist clergymen to preach. On Friday night, after the preaching, the Ladies Aid put on a reception and sociable. By the end of that meeting the Guarantee Fund was $4,500. Rev. Wright kept up the meetings, raising money every Sunday - on November 27, backed up by the Fairhaven ‚Äúquartette,‚Äù he preached on ‚ÄúHoly Ground,‚Äù taking in $190. The Ladies Aid put on a pie social at the GAR Hall - entertainment and supper for 20 cents. The ladies went all out for the first annual Universalist Holiday Fair on Tuesday and Wednesday, December 20‚Äì21 - ice cream and cake the first night, hot supper the second - to raise another $200. The fund-raising blitz was successful - the trustees met on December 25, 1892, to announce that the $5,000.00 had been pledged. Rev. Daniel Wright had accomplished his assignment; he left after giving his last sermon on January 8, 1893. On February 6 Rev. John A. Copeland, a native of Clarendon who had served in the Civil War, came to Albion to give a lecture, ‚ÄúThe Battle of Bull Run,‚Äù for the benefit of the Universalist church - adults 25 cents and children 15 cents. The congregation enjoyed his talk and asked him to take the pastorate; he accepted. Land purchase & fund collection On January 2, 1893, George Pullman wrote that he would be in Albion soon to look at sites. George was experienced in building and had an architect, Solon S. Beman, who had designed Pullman's summer cottage in New Jersey, added a conservatory to their mansion in Chicago, and designed and oversaw the construction of Pullman, Illinois, the new industrial and residential village the Pullman Palace Car Company south of Chicago.Leavitt, Fred, text by Nancy Miller, ‚Äò‚ÄôPullman: Portrait of a Landmark Community‚Äô‚Äô, The Historic Pullman Foundation, Chicago, 1981 p.9 During the winter of 1892-93 Beman drew up plans for the new Pullman church. Beman envisioned a minimal church containing the bare essentials for Christian worship - a cross of pink Medina sandstone in the English Gothic style with a dome over the crossing and a bell tower in one comer. The entrance was at the head of the cross - the congregation would enter at the front and proceed straight back. The pulpit was just beyond the crossing, facing the entrance, with the organ and the choir behind it. Behind the choir were the Sunday School room and the parlor, which could be opened up to provide seating for three hundred more worshipers.Leyendecker, Liston Edgington. \\"Palace Car Prince: A Biography of George Mortimer Pullman.\\" University Press of Colorado. pp 240. 1992 Now that there were actual plans to base cost estimates on, the estimated cost had risen to $40,000. George Pullman, his elder daughter, Florence, and S.S. Beman brought the plans to Albion on April 13, 1893, when they looked over possible church sites with the church officers. Pullman's favorite sites were the Royce Homestead at the northwest corner of Main and West Avenue (the old Bell's Plaza) and the Proctor homestead on the southwest comer of Main and West Park (now St. Joseph's rectory). The church officers liked the Sheldon Warner home at the northwest corner of Main and West Park, next to the Episcopal Church. Pullman stated that he was ready to proceed with the church as soon as the society actually possessed the promised $5,000. Therefore, the society asked everyone to make good on his subscription by May 1 so that construction could begin. The subscribers did not meet the May 1 deadline - the last of the Guarantee Fund was taken to the Orleans County National Bank on May 28. When the money was in the bank George bought the lot - on June 26 paying $7,500 for a prime lot on the square that had not been previously mentioned - the home of Mrs. C.R. Burrows on the southeast corner of South Main and East Park. George held the deed - he would turn it over to the society when the church was completed. The plan was to take over the property on August 1, have the building enclosed before snow flew, and have it fully complete and ready for occupancy in June 1894.Leyendecker, Liston Edgington. \\"Palace Car Prince: A Biography of George Mortimer Pullman.\\" University Press of Colorado. pp 176. 1992 As soon as the Universalists had possession of their lot they held a social, hoping that this reunion of the liberal Christians of the community would result in a \\"broader Christian fellowship and a kindlier feeling toward the new church.\\" On Thursday evening, August 3, the grounds were illuminated with Chinese lanterns, the Crescent Musical Society provided music, and there was a literary entertainment. The crowd was larger than the house could comfortably handle, but the Ladies Aid added $40 to their funds. Construction Final plans for the building were not drawn and approved until September 27. The new plans were adjusted to the sloping lot - the church front was changed from the head, which was on Main Street, to the side, on East Park Street. The new main entrance was on East Park, in the north cross-piece; a second entrance further east on East Park opened into the Sunday School room. On the exterior the original cross design was obscured by the additions necessary for the social use of the building - the Sunday School classrooms, the trustees room, the dining room, and the pastor's study - but on the interior the original cross design was still very apparent. The pulpit was now in the south cross-piece, facing the new entrance. As before, the organ and choir were behind the pulpit. The estimated cost, with furnishings, had now risen to $60,000.\\"In Memory of Their Dead. Many Beautiful and Expensive Churches Erected by Well Known Millionaires\\" , The New York Herald.

Then the society again lost its minister - Rev. Copeland accepted a call to the LeRoy Universalist church and preached his last sermon on October 8. Albion was feeling the effects of the Panic of 1893 - one of the requests of the church society was that there be no outside contractor to take money out of the community and that Albion's day laborers would be used for the work. But the project was bogged down - winter would soon come and the contract for the stone and foundation work had not yet been let. At the end of October Pullman summoned the church clerk, Frank Kittredge, and the architect, S. S. Beman, to New York City to discuss the project. As a result, on October 31 the stone and foundation work was let to DeGraff & Roberts. The DeGraff & Roberts quarry, in the bank of Sandy Creek just south of East State Street, had a reputation for producing beautiful pink Medina sandstone that carved well and held up in buildings. By the end of November DeGraff & Roberts had torn down the brick Burrows house. Excavation for the basement was stopped in December by winter weather. However, twelve stone cutters worked under sheds at the quarry through the winter, preparing the stone for the spring. Pullman realized that the lack of a superintendent and a general contractor had caused slow progress so he hired J. H. Porter of Chicago as superintendent and Mr. Murphy of Tonawanda as general contractor. Contractor Murphy began work in March 1894 when DeGraff & Roberts delivered the stone. Cornerstone George Pullman wanted a cornerstone laying ceremony. The new church was to be a memorial to his father Lewis Pullman, who sixty-eight years earlier had renounced his Baptist faith. The church was also dedicated to the memory of Emily Caroline Pullman, who had left her Presbyterian faith to support her husband in Universalism. George Pullman had memorial booklets printed on the faith and life of each parent to place in the cornerstone to symbolically strengthen the building. Lewis Pullman was a Mason and was buried in Albion with Masonic ceremonies in 1853. The cornerstone laying of the church, dedicated to the memory of a fellow Mason, required the participation of the Masons. Renovation Lodge invited the officials of the Grand Masonic Lodge of New York State to preside - the first time that such officials had presided at a cornerstone laying in Albion. Saturday, May 19, 1894, was the second day of a five-day rainstorm that flooded the county. Many people were kept away from the cornerstone ceremony by the rain - most of the Niagara County Masons never came. Only four of the Grand Lodge officials arrived - Grand Master Frederick K. Burnham,\\"A Church from Mr Pullman\\" Wheeling Sunday Register. May 20, 1894. p.6. Retrieved July 30, 2011. Grand Treasurer John J. Gorman, Grand Marshal Elmer A. Miller, all of New York City, and Grand Senior Warden William A. Sutherland, of Syracuse. The other Grand positions were filled by Masons from Lockport, Medina, and Albion. The planned grand procession through the streets was canceled - the two hundred Masons from Albion, Medina, Holley, and Lockport processed along Main Street, marching directly from their hall on East Bank to the church. The village businesses closed from 2:00 to 3:30 so the crowd stood in the rain to greet the Masons. A platform had been built at the level of the cornerstone, high up on the northeast corner of the church - now covered with a canvas awning to protect the Masonic officials during the ceremony. Also in attendance were the Pullman party - George Pullman, his son George, his sisters Helen West and Emma Fluhrer, his brother Rev. Dr. Royal H. Pullman (Rev. Dr. James Pullman could not attend because of the death of a parishioner and Charles Pullman was never asked, or at least never came, to these ceremonies), his private secretary Charles S. Sweet, his traveling secretary, his architect S. S. Beman, and his friend and adviser Rev. Dr. Charles Eaton. With the rain drumming on the awning, Acting Grand Chaplain Rev. F. S. Dunham of Christ Episcopal Church offered a prayer. Acting Grand Secretary George A. Newell read the list of articles included in the copper box. Grand Master Burnham then instructed Acting Grand Treasurer Newell: \\"You will now deposit these articles beneath the cornerstone, and may the Great Architect of the Universe, in His wisdom grant that ages upon ages shall pass away ere they shall again be seen by men.\\" The cornerstone was then dropped in place and mortared by Grand Master Burnham while he uttered the following prayer: \\"Almighty and eternal God, by whom all things were made, grant that whatsoever shall be builded on this stone may be to the honor and glory of Thy name, to which be praise forever.\\" The master architect presented the working tools to Grand Master Burnham, who delivered them to Grand Marshal Miller, who gave the square to Acting Deputy Grand Master John Hodge, the level to Grand Senior Warden Sutherland, and the plumb to Acting Junior Warden Charles Ross. After an invocation the square, the level, and plumb were applied, then Grand Master Burnham came forward and struck the stone three times with a gavel and declared it \\"well formed, true and trusty and laid in ample form.\\" The stone was then consecrated with corn, oil, and wine. By the end of the ceremony the rain had become so heavy that everyone adjourned to the courthouse, where the court room was packed to capacity. Rev. Dr. Royal H. Pullman delivered the address of the day, choosing as his theme Character Building. He alluded to his father and mother, in whose memory the church was erected and to the consecrated life lived by them in the old home in Albion. The Pullman Universalist Memorial Church was not erected by his brother George as a work of ostentation, but simply and purely as a memorial of the father and mother who believed in the doctrines of the Universalist church and who lived their religion among the people of this community many years ago. The exercises were concluded by the benediction by Acting Grand Chaplain Rev. Dunham. A celebratory dinner for the visiting Masons was served in the dining room of Masonic Hall, followed by dancing. The Masonic officials were entertained next door at the Orleans House. Construction completes In the summer of 1894 it seemed the church would be completed by the end of the year. The memorial window had been a problem - George Pullman had difficulty deciding on a theme. It was not until some time after the cornerstone laying that the theme of Christ with open arms was chosen. The 10-foot-tall window features a life-size image of Jesus over a quote from John 10:10 - \\"I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly\\" was designed by Frederick Wilson. It was hoped that Tiffany could get the window done and installed for a dedication at Christmas. \\"Christ the Consoler\\" Memorial Window by Tiffany The society then turned to the need for a minister since they had been without a permanent minister after Rev. John A. Copeland left in October, 1893. The congregation invited a wide variety of ministers to preach on summer Sundays so they would hear regular sermons and could look over possible permanent ministers. Reverend Thomas Borden began the summer by preaching at the courthouse on June 17. He was followed by Rev. Dr. James M. Pullman; Rev. Miss Henrietta Moore, of Ohio; Rev. Dr. Charles Fluhrer, of Grand Rapids, Michigan; Rev. J .H. Holder, of Amherst, Massachusetts; Rev. Alice K. Wright (wife of Rev. Alfred Ellsworth Wright) of Brooklyn; and, finally, on September 14, by Rev. Francis A. Gray of Nashua, New Hampshire. The search concluded on October 14 when the society called Rev. Dr. Charles Fluhrer to the pastorate.\\"Personal\\" New York Herald-Tribune. Oct. 26, 1894. p6. Retrieved 2011-08-06 Rev. Fluhrer had been a classmate of Rev. James Pullman at St. Lawrence University and Canton Theological School and was well known in the denomination and considered to be a fine scholar and able preacher as well as a sympathetic minister. He was also the brother-in-law of George's younger sister, Emma Pullman Fluhrer. Rev. Fluhrer would begin his pastorate when the church was dedicated. In August the lathing and plastering was being pushed ahead, using the newly invented steel lath wire net that held plaster thoroughly, producing a firm and durable surface. By the middle of October, when George Pullman and other members of the family stopped by on their way east to look over the new church, the masons, carpenters and painters were almost finished. Pullman set early January as the tentative date for the dedication. A general dedication date had to be set relatively early because it would take time to mold and cast the bronze dedication tablet which George ordered to be dated \\"January 1895.\\" When the interior carpentry and plastering finished the church was ready for the pipe organ. The organ, from the Johnson Pipe Organ Company, Westfield, Mass., arrived in early November; company workmen spent the rest of the month installing it. As soon as the organ was installed workmen from Tiffany's workshop in New York City arrived to paint the walls and ceilings with the special \\"Tiffany blend,\\" which modulated from terracotta on the walls to gold on the ceiling, and installed the fifty-six colored glass windows. By the end of December the church was almost complete, so the dedication was set for Wednesday, January 16, 1895. The decorators were done by January 10, but the memorial window had not yet arrived. Pullman visited Albion on the 10th, refused to dedicate the church until it was complete, and postponed the dedication until further notice. The half-ton memorial window arrived Tuesday, January 15. The new dedication was set for Thursday, January 31. Pullman ordered the souvenir programs, which contained the text of all the speeches and the order of the ceremonies, and the exact date. The workmen rushed the memorial window into place.

Pullman preached the dedication sermon, from the text, \\"What mean these stones\\" which embraced a history of the Pullman family with a panegyric of the father and mother, in whose memory the church was erected. In the afternoon the church doors were again opened, for the installation of Rev. Dr. Fluhrer as pastor of the new church. This time Rev. Dr. James Pullman presented the sermon, speaking the sentences of installation for his friend. In the evening the doors were opened for the third time, for the reception for Mr. Pullman and Rev. Fluhrer and the visiting clergymen. Receiving the guests were Mr. and Mrs. Pullman, Rev. and Mrs. Fluhrer, and Mr. and Mrs. Danolds. An elaborate repast was served by the ladies of the church.\\"Dedicate the Memorial Church\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, p. 9. Feb. 1, 1895. Retrieved July 27, 2011. In a single day the society received the keys to their new church, installed their new pastor, and held their first church supper. Final construction costs were reported at $64,000.00. Total costs with lot, furnishings, dishes, communion set, linens, carpets, etc. were estimated at between $100,000.00 and $150,000.00. George Pullman's investment in Universalism established the only Universalist church in an Orleans County village, and the only one of the five Orleans County Universalist churches still functioning today.

It arrived in early November; company workmen spent the rest of the month installing it. The organ was reputed to cost $6,000.00. The Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company decorated the pipes after the installation was complete, by applying gold leaf stencil.Lattin, C. W. \\"History of the PMUC Organ.\\" 1994. The organ contains 22 ranks with 1248 speaking pipes. A Rose water motor was used to supply power to operate the organ. The Rose water motor operated off the municipal water pressure which, in turn, caused a ratchet to move up and down, connected to the bellows. This allowed the church to fore-go hiring a bellows boy to pump the organ. In 1948 a set of chimes was added in memory of Thomas Sweet, given by Mae Sweet. In 1959 the organ was electrified and the console moved from the organ loft to the west transept of the church. The rebuilding was done by Carl K. Rademaker of Middleport, NY. In 1994 the console was moved back to its original position in preparation for the church's centennial. The work was performed by Heritage Pipe Organs of North Tonawanda, NY with the assistance of church volunteers. The restored organ case lights were given by the children of the Sunday School. The organ retains its original facade pipes, most of which are actual speaking pipes. Chronology 1890 Charles A. Danolds visited George Pullman in the Thousand Islands where they conceived the idea for a Universalist Church in Albion. If the local Universalists can raise $5,000.00, Mr. Pullman will match it with a church in memory of his parents James Lewis and Emily Caroline. 1891 A meeting was held on August 18 for the purpose of legally organizing and incorporating the PMUC according to the laws of the State of New York. A committee was appointed to raise the $5,000 guarantee fund. 1892 On December 25 the board of trustees announced that $5,000.00 had been pledged in amounts varying from $5 to $600. 1893 George Pullman arrived in Albion to negotiate for the site at the comer of Main and East Park Streets. He pays $7,500.00 for the lot. 1894 On May 19 at 2:30 p.m. Renovation Lodge F and AM with Grand Master Burnham and Masonic dignitaries from around New York state laid the cornerstone with traditional Masonic ritual. 1895 The PMUC is dedicated on Thursday, January 31 with Rev. Dr. Royal H. Pullman, a brother of George M. Pullman and a Universalist Minister giving the dedication sermon. Rev. Dr. Charles Fluhrer is also installed as the first minister. 1906 The Parsonage just south of the church was ready for occupancy. Designed by S.S. Beman, the same architect who designed the church, it cost approximately $20,000. 1910 A silver communion service of individual cups was first used at the Good Friday Service. It was presented by Mrs. James G. Brown in memory of her mother Mrs. Eunice C. Rice. 1921 Recorded that the church was valued at $75,000, the parsonage $11,000, and the church had 150 families, 350 individuals and 145 members. 1927 The church was rewired - original knob-and-tube wiring replaced. 1928 A steam table was installed to handle the annual turkey dinners. 1931 Over 500 turkey dinners were served at$1.75 each. 1937 The red fluted Spanish Tile roof was removed and replaced with patent roofing. 1938 Sanctuary redecorated for the first time. 1939 New carpet laid in church parlors - $500.00 1940 Ladies Aid bought a brass cross in memory of Mrs. Jerome Brace. 1944 The church celebrated the 50th anniversary of the laying of the cornerstone on May 19 with members of Renovation Lodge F and AM. 1948 Two brass vases given by Mrs. Pridmore in memory of Addie Bradley. Chimes to organ given in memory of Thomas Sweet by Wife Mae. 1950 Two new oil burners installed in church by Ralph Mosher. Exterior repointed and sanctuary redecorated for a second time. 1954 Last annual meeting held on the dedication of church changed to November 1 (59 years). 1956 Two brass candle sticks were given by Grant and Mae Barber. 1959 Organ rebuilt, electrified, and console moved from choir loft to the west transept at a cost of $10,000. 1961 The congregation affiliated within the merger of the American Universalist Church and the American Unitarian Association in what became the Unitarian Universalist Association. 1965 A Festival of Art was held in June which drew community interest. The church presented an original dramatic play entitled the \\"Masque of Indifference\\" at a summer Union Service. 1966 Rev. Warren Lovejoy presented \\"The Bomb That Killed God, Or Did It\\" as part of a summer Union Service. The Sanctuary was decorated in \\"warm ivory\\". 1971 Rev. Richard Hood began his pastorate. 1972 Bernard Lynch, church organist for 29 years, retired. 1976 The church hosted a community event at Albion High School. 1984 The church sanctuary was redecorated with volunteers and painted \\"Cedar Rust\\" to emulate earlier color schemes. The N.Y.S. Convention of Universalists held their 156th annual meeting in Albion. 1985 Through subscriptions, the congregation raised money to purchase new carpet for the sanctuary. The sanctuary was rededicated because of its refurbishing. 1987 Corrugated fiber glass roofing was placed over the dining room between the social room and east transept to correct deterioration of the light well. 1992 North windows in the dining room were restored original sash after being boarded up since 1957. 1993 East wall and front vestibule were repointed. 1994 The organ console was returned to the choir loft.

Robinson began his pastorate in the Pullman Memorial Universalist Church of Albion. He resigned March 1, 1941 on account of ill health. \\"He was considered an outstanding figure in the community, a worker in every cause for righteousness, and with all, one of the most popular preachers Albion has ever had. The people of the church exceedingly regret that health failed to the point where he is forced to resign and his resignation was accepted with deep regret.\\" Rev. Robinson was a member and Past Master of Renovation Lodge No. 97, Orleans Chapter R.A. M. and the IOOF Lodge. He was also a member of the Lions Club, served as chairman of the Albion Red Cross and was secretary of the Orleans County Fair Association. Rev. Robinson actually served three Universalist Societies in Orleans County. Before coming to Albion and occasionally preaching at Childs, New York, he had served the Universalist Church at Clarendon. He is most noted for describing the appeal of Universalism with the quote \\"Soft seats and no hell.\\"Gilbert, Richard. \\"Soft Seats & No Hell: Heaven, Hell And Universalism\\" 2001. Retrieved July 25, 2011 Minister Emeritus On October 9, 2011, the church held a ceremony to confer the status of Minister Emeritus upon the Reverend Richard Hood who served the congregation for thirty-five years. Officially serving as pulpit supply rather than as a called minister, Rev. Hood performed other ministerial duties as needed. He initiated Talk-back Sundays, Pullman Pennies (a strategy to make tough decisions), a long-range plan, the church covenant (which appears in each hymnal), and the closing circle done on some Sundays. He also presided over the Good Friday service for all his years at Pullman. The ceremony to appoint Rev. Hood to Minister Emeritus marks the first time a minister in the church's 120-year history was so honored.\\"Pullman Church installs pastor, confers minister emeritus\\" The Daily News, Batavia, NY.

The Universalist Register of the United States and Canada in 1882 lists women's Centenary Associations organized in 1869 to assist in raising money for the Murray Fund. This was a fund to aid in the education of theological students. By 1882 it had already raised over $100,000. The Register also listed Fair Haven Church (Thomas Borden, minister), now the Cobblestone Museum. Other churches in the area were Clarendon, Kendall, Olcott, Middleport, Lockport, Rochester, Buffalo, and Ridgeway. The Women's Centenary Association later became the Ladies Aid Society with the purposes of raising money for their churches and missionary work. On October 11, 1892 in Albion the Ladies Aid and Missionary Society was organized with 14 charter members. These women pledged $500 towards the Guarantee Fund of $5,000 raised to keep the Pullman Memorial Universalist Church in repair. The ladies sometimes met for dinner and when they did the gentlemen were always invited to join them so meetings were not all business but more social events. By 1901 this membership had grown to 53 members. Following is a summary of the October 6, 1901 meeting. \\"It was decided to have a reception for the Pastor and his wife the Rev. Arthur W. Grose, D.P. Cake and milk to be provided by the ladies, the Board of Trustees to furnish the ice cream. The flower committee for the month was Mrs. Burrows and Mrs. Flintham who offered to have charge if the ladies would contribute flowers for the church. Next, the Fair was discussed. It was decided to meet to make aprons as 25 already made had been sold. The next question was would the ladies serve their Annual Turkey Supper in connection with the Fair. The menu would be raw oysters, wafers, celery and pickles, roast turkey, cranberries, mashed potatoes, chicken salad, rolls, coffee, ice cream, and cake.\\" From the December 2, 1902 meeting, the recipe used for making mince meat was: 41 lbs. shoulder of beef, 10 lbs. suet, l barrel of apples (Spitzenburg), 20 lbs. seeded raisins, 10 lbs. currants, 5 lbs. citron, l0 lbs. sugar, l 3/4 lbs. allspice, 1/4 lb. nutmeg, 2 oz. cloves, qt. salt, 2 gal. molasses, l qt. grape wine, juice from meat, sweet and sour cider, and fruit juices, all you can collect. This made 24 gallons of mincemeat, sold at 40 cents a quart. This mince meat was featured at the annual Fair and Turkey supper. This tradition was carried out until the early 1930s. In January 1902 the group published a cookbook. The committee raised $250 in ads from local merchants to pay for printing one thousand books. The first one hundred dollars raised from the sale of books went to the fund for building a parsonage (built and dedicated in 1906). The Ladies Aid paid the monthly salaries of the Sexton $15.00, organist $18.20, and musical director $20.83. This responsibility was undertaken for ‚Äúthe advancement of our beloved church.‚Äù The Ladies Aid sponsored many concerts, teas, Strawberry Socials, rummage sales, baked goods and apron sales. Individual members earned money for the Society by selling bread, aprons, cottage cheese, cookies, popcorn, shirtwaists, dusting, jellies, and pancakes. One Lenten season they raised $l00 this way. They also provided flowers for the church services and funerals, and dinners for Church and Sunday School groups, a Fair & Turkey dinner, and mince meat in the month of November. In the Annual Report of January 31, 1905, it was noted that the Juniors of the church and the Merry Maids had contributed money and the Get- Together club had given their aid in assisting at the Fair and entertainments. It was noted to discontinue paying the salary of the Sexton. ‚ÄúBoth financially and socially this year has proven one of the most successful years and never has there been so large a gathering at the homes of the members showing their loyalty to the church and Society.‚Äù Officers of the Society in 1901 were President Mrs. Charles Burrows, Secretary, Minnie Roberts, and Treasurer, Miss Mary Billings. A printed invitation was sent out for a birthday party on March 26. 1908, it was in the form of a poem: This Birthday party is given for you; ‚ÄôTis nothing novel, nor is it new We forward you a little sack Please either send it or bring it back. With as many cents as you are years old; We promise the number shall never be told Refreshments there will be to eat and friends will furnish a literary treat The Ladies Aid with greetings hearty will welcome you to your Birthday Party. The Get-Together Club was first mentioned in 1905, made up of younger ladies of the church, and sponsored by the Ladies Aid Society. The group was very active during the ministry of Rev. Lewis H. Robinson, who served the church from 1921 to 1941. At that time the Get- Togethers took over most of the activities of the Ladies Aid Society. The Get- Togethers provided most of the social life of the church, sponsoring dinners, entertainments, family picnics at the lake (Hamlin beach, Lakeside park, Point Breeze), dances, card parties, and worked on all the activities of the church. In 1932 officers were President, Mrs. Fred Tanner, Vice-President, Mrs. Bert Crego, Secretary and Treasurer, Mrs. Palmer Lyon. These ladies entertained in their homes and husbands and children were always included. The Pullman Girls Club was mentioned in the December 27, 1908 church calendar. Officers were President, Inez Warner, Vice-President Genieve Marshall, Secretary Elsie Brown, Treasurer Velma Harding. This group consisted of young girls of High School age and slightly older who remained in the club for years and were still called the Pullman Girls. They cleaned the kitchen, painted, served suppers to the Men's Club, donated to the Pension Fund, and helped serve the Annual Turkey dinner, published a cook book in 1952, pledged money to support the church yearly, and furnished for many years the calendars for weekly Sunday Church Services. On May 26, 1970 the Pullman Girls merged with the Get- Togethers Club to form the Pull-Togethers with twelve members. Officers elected were President, Jean Bistoff, Secretary-Treasurer, Betsy Hoffman, and Charlene Kyle as program chairman. Plans were made to have a bake sale and then a bazaar in October. First public dinner put on by this group was a Chili Con Carne dinner that raised $125.00. Rance Wright grew and furnished the kidney beans already cooked. Group was asked to take charge of the coffee hour. The group raised money by putting on luncheons, suppers, rummage and bake sales. Money raised has been used for paint for the parlors, carpet for the Memorial Room, toward painting the Sanctuary, curtains for the dining rooms, paid one years insurance, purchased the grand piano, prepared the table for the Good Friday Service, and bought carpet for the Social rooms and many other items for the church. When the Pullman Girls and the Get-Together Clubs merged, the Get-Togethers kept their money that was referred to as the ‚Äúcarpet fund‚Äù. Whenever the church was in financial need, help would come from the ‚Äúcarpet fund\\". Other women's groups that are listed in the past orders-of- services are The Clover Circle, The Jolly Girls Club, the Lydian Circle, and the Clara Barton Guild.

Life  The only surviving child of Louis Conrad d'Argenteau, Count d'Esneux, and Marie Ghisberte de Locquenghien, Charlotte d'Argenteau met Lord Ailesbury when she was 21 and living in Brussels, Belgium, with her widowed mother. Brussels gossip had it that despite her many good qualities she would probably never marry, due to her having a small dowry, and her mother an appalling temper.Chapman, Hester Privileged Persons Baylis and Son London 1966 Within a short time of meeting her Ailesbury fell in love, and it seems his feelings were returned; friends however warned Ailesbury that Charlotte's mother would probably make difficulties. The Countess duly did so, and arguably on this occasion she was not acting unreasonably. Ailesbury was after all more than 20 years older than Charlotte; more importantly he had fled England to avoid being condemned to death as a traitor. Though the British Crown made no effort to extradite him, and had not seized his estates, he was only able to draw part of the rents from them. Eventually he overcame his future mother-in-law's objections, although it is clear from his memoirs that he disliked her intensely.Ailesbury, Thomas Bruce, Earl of Memoirs Edited by W. E. Buckley London 1890 The marriage was very happy. Charlotte was described as \\"a noble and virtuous lady, born to make anyone happy\\". In his memoirs her husband, who rarely spoke of his first wife Lady Elizabeth Seymour, wrote of his second wife that \\"there was scarce her equal in goodness and sweetness and generous to the last degree\\"; although he could resist the gibe that she was \\"the reverse of her mother\\". Charlotte's stepchildren, Charles and Elizabeth, became deeply attached to her and she had one daughter of her own:Cokayne Complete Peerage Lady Marie Th√©r√®se Charlotte Bruce, born in 1704. Ailesbury settled in Brussels so happily that when in time the English government made it clear that he could return home, he no longer had any wish to do so. After ten years of marriage, Charlotte died of a fever in July 1710, aged 31, and was buried in the Church of the Brigittines, Brussels. Ailesbury was deeply grieved, and though he outlived her by 30 years he never made a third marriage. Their daughter Marie Th√©r√®se became the wife of Maximilian, Prince of Hornes, and among Charlotte's great-grandchildren was Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern (the Jacobite consort from 1772 to 1788).

They are unique in Hawaii as being a series of three waterfalls in close proximity. They are easily viewed from an overlook located on private botanical garden property accessible for a fee. The overlook was constructed in 1996 by Walter L. Wagner who was developing the World Botanical Gardens with the waterfalls overlook as part of the tourist attraction. Subsequently, the waterfall overlook ownership was transferred circa 2008, and access to the overlook is now through Umauma Experience (also a botanical garden), and not through World Botanical Gardens. Formation and history The Umauma Falls and River has been forming since the Mauna Kea volcano on which flank it flows slowly emerged from the sea beginning millions of years ago. During this period, the volcano formed alternating layers of volcanic ash or solidified lava, forming distinct layers that can erode at different rates. Eventually, Mauna Kea reached its current height, and entered a 'final phase' of primarily cinder cone eruptions from the flanks of Mauna Kea, which also deposited a 10-meter thick layer of ash, which is now the fertile soil presently found on the relatively level or gentle-slope portions. Due to the flow of the trade-winds, the southern regions of the eastern flank of Mauna Kea have higher rainfalls than the northern regions. The Umauma River is at the dividing line between heavy rains to the south, and lighter rains to the north. The word Umauma means 'constantly flowing' in the Hawaiian language, and it is the most northernly river to have a continuous flow and not dry up during the dry season. Rainfall can at times be intense, and two feet of rain in a few hours has been recorded in historic times, and presumably even heavier rains can occur, and the further up-slope, the more intense the rainfall. Such rainfalls can swell the rivers to huge flows, moving boulders and rocks downstream. As the boulders tumble down slope, they will tend to cause erosion wherever they hit, and this forms small waterfalls. Over time, as boulders fall over the waterfall, they erode deeply at the base of the waterfall, forming a plunge pool. During normal low flows, these make for excellent swimming holes, and are notable features of all the waterfalls on Mauna Kea. Eventually, the face of a waterfall will become undermined by the plunge-pool, and will cave into the pool, filling it with debris. Subsequently, the debris is removed by additional heavy rainfalls, leaving a new plunge-pool relatively free of debris. The waterfall, however, has moved up-slope by a few feet. Over time, the waterfalls slowly recede upslope. If a waterfall hits a stronger region that resists erosion, lower level waterfalls can 'catch-up' and two waterfalls merge into one deeper waterfall. This process is causing the Umauma Falls to slowly move upslope over geologic time, though we can see the plunge-pools at the bases of the three Umauma Falls (Note: there are many other waterfalls on the Umauma River, also slowly moving upslope over geologic time). We can see what Umauma Falls might look like in the far distant future by visiting the neighboring river (KoleKole) just to the south of the Umauma River, which has a very large single waterfall, known as Akaka Falls, formed in just such a manner in the distant geologic past. It is further upslope than the Umauma Falls, and it is in a much heavier rainfall region. The Umauma Falls were accessible for viewing until relatively recently only by walking upslope along the river bed. In 1995 the founder of the World Botanical Gardens, while exploring the Umauma River gulch edge to find a good viewing point, discovered the current overlook, which had been hidden from view by extensive growth of wild guava trees and sugarcane. Soon thereafter, he carved the current overlook by removing the overgrown agricultural berm along the gulch edge and its guava trees, replacing it with a concrete platform, retaining walls, and steel railing, which is its present configuration.

Resolution Observations In the preamble of Resolution 1734, the Council paid tribute to UNIOSIL for its contribution towards post-conflict Sierra Leone. The Secretary-General Kofi Annan and President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah had recommended that the peacekeeping mission's mandate be extended until the end of 2007 so that preparations for general elections could take place.

He is a six-time World Champion, seven-time European Champion, and twenty-time World Cup winner. He competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics and the 2004 Summer Olympics, finishing fifth and fourth respectively. He was the first man to perform a ‚ÄúDouble Full In ‚Äì Double Full Out‚Äù on trampoline and the skill is named after him. He is the only person who has been an active trampolinist and trampoline coach at the Olympic Games.  Early life  Dmitri Poliaroush was born on September 20, 1970 in Berezniki, Russia. From a young age, he wanted to be an astronaut. At the age of 6, he saw a trampolinist flying in the air, and later told his mother that he wanted to do this. He joined the local trampoline club in Berezniki, where his talent was noticed. Starting from an early age, he worked out many hours per day.  Competitive career   Before 1990  In 1984, Poliaroush won the Soviet Union Junior National Competitions and was named to the Soviet Union junior team. In 1985, he competed in his first international competition in Denmark, where he finished 5th. In 1986, he won the bronze medal at the Soviet Union National Championships, won the European Junior Championships, and participated at his first Trampoline World Championships in Paris. At the early age of 16, he had already finished 5th in the world. In 1987 and 1988, Poliaroush won the Soviet Union National Championships, which had been one of his big goals. In 1988, he competed at the World Championships in Birmingham, USA, where he brought home a gold medal in the team competition and a silver in the individual competition. He finished second in the final round of competition to trampoline legend Vadim Krasnoshapka by only 0.2.https://www.facebook.com/dmitri.poliaroush 1990s From 1990, Poliaroush regularly competed head to head against Alexander Moskalenko. At the 1990, World Championships in Essen, Germany, Poliaroush won two gold medals (team and synchronized), and silver again in individual, placing second to teammate Alexander Moskalenko. This loss was a motivation for Poliaroush to make upgrades to his routine. In 1991 at the European Championships, Poliaroush competed with a routine that had a difficulty of 14.6, which was a new world record. His routine finished with a new skill that had never been seen before, it was a double full in ‚Äì double full out, which would later be named the ‚ÄúPoliaroush‚Äù. In 1991, the Soviet Union Sports Government honored him with the highest national athletic title, Honor Master of Sport of the Soviet Union. In 1992, Poliaroush was not able to compete at the World Championships even though he had a new routine and was in the best shape of his life. This was a time of political problems within the Soviet Union. In 1993, Poliaroush moved to Vitebsk, Belarus and started representing Belarus at international competitions. This helped the Belarus team tremendously. He led the team to beat the reigning world champions, Russia at the World Championships in 1994. In 1995, the Belarus Sport Administration awarded Poliaroush with the title Honored Master of Sport of the Republic of Belarus. In 1995 and 1996, he won many world cup titles, world cup final, European Championships, and finally the individual world title, at the World Championships in 1996 in Vancouver, Canada. After this competition, Poliaroush retired from the sport but in 1998, when the sport was added to the Olympics, he decided to make a comeback. At the time, he was already living in the Lafayette, Louisiana, United States where he had started his coaching career. It was very difficult for him to combine his coaching and training life together. At the 1999 World Championships in South Africa, he finished in 4th place.https://www.facebook.com/dmitri.poliaroush 2000 ‚Äì 2005 Motivated by his 1999 South African finish, Poliaroush and in 2000 he won all competitions that he entered, including the World Cup in Great Britain where he set two new world records, in Optional Routine and total score. His routine was given a 42.1, with a 14.2 tariff of difficulty, which made his execution scores, 9.3 9.2 9.3 9.4 9.3. In Sydney, Australia, trampoline made its Olympic debut. Two days before the competition took place, Poliaroush celebrated his 30th birthday. Preliminary competitions went extremely well, but he made a significant error in the final routine and finished in 5th place. After a half year of break, Poliaroush decided to continue competing until the 2004 Olympic Games. He was a winner and medalist at many competitions such as the Goodwill Games, World Cups, and in 2003 at the World Championships, he won the synchronized world title with Nikolai Kasak, which made him the oldest male to win a world title in trampoline. He was 33 years old. In Athens, at the Olympic Games, Poliaroush finished 4th. He saw this a good way to end off his career at the age of 34. The 19 year international career was a major success, he had a total of 13 medals from the World Championships, which makes him the second most decorated male trampolinist in history (behind Alexander Moskalenko).https://www.facebook.com/dmitri.poliaroush In 2005, there was a big retirement party for Poliaroush in Vitebsk, Belarus.

This was done in order to provide manpower for the country's military at the time of the French Revolution. Conscription continued in various forms for two hundred years until being phased out between 1996 and 2001. History Origins The French Royal Army of the 17th and 18th centuries had consisted primarily of long-service regulars together with a number of regiments recruited from Swiss, German, Irish and other foreign mercenaries. Limited conscription for local militia units was widely resented and only enforced in times of emergency. Universal conscription in the modern sense originated during the French Revolution, when the newly-created Republic needed stronger military forces, initially to defend the country against counter-revolutionary invasion and subsequently to expand its radical ideas throughout Europe. The 1798 Jourdan law stated: \\"Any Frenchman is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the nation\\". Napoleon Bonaparte consequently inherited a greatly expanded army based on conscription, from which he created the Grande Arm√©e. Nineteenth century Following the Napoleonic Wars, the restored Bourbon monarchy returned to its traditional reliance on long service volunteers plus some Swiss and German mercenary regiments. Numbers were filled out through limited conscription by lot, the burden of which spared the middle and upper classes who could afford to purchase exemption through the employment of paid substitutes. This unequal system continued until the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Under the Third Republic, the French Army became the \\"school of the nation\\" utilizing general military service following the Prussian model. Shorter periods of service, alternative hospital duties or other forms of exemption were however still permitted for certain categories such as student teachers and priests. It was not until 1905 that universal military service for a period of two years, without exception on any but medical grounds, was introduced. \\"Three Year Law\\" of 1913 In 1913, France introduced a \\"Three Year Law\\" to extend the term of French military service to match the size of the Imperial German Army. France's population lagged significantly behind Germany in 1913; the population of mainland France was 40 million as opposed to Germany's 60 million. In contrast to Germany and Russia, who were able to offer exemptions or deferments to accommodate educational commitments or family circumstances, France required virtually all fit males of the appropriate age group to undertake full-time military service for three years from the age of 20. As part of the 1913 measures, a limited form of selective conscription was imposed on the Muslim population of Algeria, who had previously been required only to offer volunteers for service in the French Army.General R. Hure, pages 265‚Äì266, \\"L'Armee d' Afrique\\", Paris-Limoges1977 World War I With war imminent, 2.9 million men were mobilized in August 1914. These comprised conscripts undertaking their three years of obligatory service, reservists of ages 24 to 30 who had completed their period of full-time service, and territorials drawn from older men up to the age of 45. While reservists had been required to undertake periodic re-training in the form of annual maneuvers, the territorials had no peacetime commitment and were not intended for employment in the front-line in the event of war. However France's heavy losses on the Western Front required the deployment of all three categories of conscripted man-power, especially during the early months of the war. Between the wars France had retained conscription between the two world wars, though the country relied upon the French regulars of the Colonial Army, native regiments and the Foreign Legion to garrison its overseas empire. However, the birth rate dropped,The World at War episode 3 \\"France Falls\\" primarily due to the fact that over a million young Frenchmen had been killed in the First World War and many more had been wounded. As a transitional measure conscription was reduced to 18 months on 1 April 1923. In 1928 this was changed to one year. A serious short-fall in available numbers and the growing threat of a resurgent Germany obliged the French Army to extend conscription to two years under the Law of 16 March 1935. World War II French morale in 1940 had declined for a variety of political, social and military reasons, and the French High Command largely consisted of aging commanders who had held senior positions in the First World War. On the outbreak of war, the French Army Commander-in-Chief General Maurice Gamelin was already past retirement age. In sending his best troops and the whole of the BEF through Belgium, he attempted to refight the Great War. He gravely underestimated the German Army's tactics, however, which contributed to the Fall of France and over 4 years of occupation. Under German pressure, the small \\"Armistice Army\\" of the Vichy regime broke away from the now classical French dependence on conscription in favour of voluntary enlistment. This short-lived force was poorly equipped and of mixed allegiances. North African and colonial forces were reduced to the level necessary to police the territories in which they were stationed. In France itself the Vichy Regime created a compulsory national service organisation designated as the Chantiers de la Jeunesse Francaise (C.J.F. or French Youth Builders). Created in 1940 this body provided military style basic training for approximately 400,000 inductees serving for eight months, until the German occupation authorities forced its disbandment in June 1944. Large numbers then joined the French resistance and eventually the re-created French regular army. Post-war period and the end of conscription Following liberation in 1944, France returned to a universal military service system. However, conscripts were not required to serve in the Indo-China War of 1947‚Äì54, which was fought by French, North African and colonial volunteers plus the Foreign Legion and locally recruited forces. This meant an increased reliance on voluntary enlistment and by 1950 conscripts made up only 29.1% of total French Army effectives. By contrast the Algerian War of 1954‚Äì62 involved the extensive use of conscripts, on the rationale that Algeria was legally part of metropolitan France. In 1957, with the Algerian War at its height, 57% of the army consisted of conscripts, mostly from metropolitan France. It was still possible to draw on substantial numbers of Algerian Muslim volunteers and conscripts, although issues of divided loyalties made the North African troops less dependable towards the end of the war. During this period, the majority of French military units were made up of a mix of volunteers and conscripts in varying proportions. Only the Foreign Legion remained an entirely professional force. With France finally disengaged from colonial commitments it was possible to progressively reduce military service to 18 months from 1962, 12 months in 1970 and finally 10 months in 1992. During this period about three- quarters of each annual contingent of 18 year old males actually served. The army initially favoured the retention of conscription as an inexpensive means of obtaining qualified specialists, as well as providing a source of long-term recruits (one-third of the professional element began their military careers as conscripts).US Army War College Quarterly ‚Äì Summer 2000 pp 33‚Äì45 The drawbacks of this reliance on short-term conscripts became evident at the time of the First Gulf War when France had to draw on its limited number of fully trained professional units to provide a significant contribution. Of 18,000 regulars sent to the Middle East about 5,000 had to be transferred from mixed professional/conscript units.US Army War College Quarterly ‚Äì Summer 2000 pp 33‚Äì45 The relevance of the historical system of universal military service to modern commitments and warfare accordingly came under review. France accordingly suspended peacetime military conscription in 1996. President Jacques Chirac's government formally announced the end of compulsory military serviceConscription drummed out as France gets professional ‚Äì World ‚Äì News ‚Äì The Independent in 2001. Young people are still required, however, to register for possible obligatory service of an unspecified nature (should the need arise). A recent change is that women must now register as well. Journ√©e D√©fense et Citoyennet√© (JDC) In 1998 the Journ√©e D√©fense et Citoyennet√© (JDC), the \\"Defence and Citizenship Day\\" was established by President Jacques Chirac. It is mandatory for all persons of French nationality, both males and females. At the conclusion of the program, an individual certificate is issued to each participant. This certificate is needed to take the baccalaureate examination (except for persons under 18 years of age), to enrol in a public university, to obtain a driving licence or to apply for any civil servant jobs. From 1998 to 2010, this mandatory day was called Journ√©e d‚ÄôAppel de Pr√©paration √† la D√©fense, the \\"Defence Preparation Day\\". Service national universel (SNU) In 2019, President Emmanuel Macron introduced Service national universel (SNU), a national service currently on a voluntary basis, for a period of 4 weeks. It will become a compulsory service in the future. Conscripts will spend two weeks in training and two weeks performing community service. The system has been described as \\"more scout camp than military service\\".https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world- europe-48755605https://www.france24.com/en/20190616-france-trial-macron-new- compulsory-national-service-teen-military References France ","title":"Conscription in France"},{"id":"32488777","text":"John Bavant, D.D.

A member of the group is a Knight Mason. The Order of Knight Masons is a system of three degrees, namely Knight of the Sword, Knight of the East, and Knight of the East and West. Councils of Knight Masons are individually presided over by an Excellent Chief and the degrees are conferred separately upon candidates. The Degrees communicate the story of the efforts to build the Second Temple in Jerusalem. They complete the sequence of universal Masonic degrees that are conferred within the Irish system. Councils of Knight Masons Councils of Knight Masons are presided over by an Excellent Chief with two other senior officers, namely the Senior Knight and Junior Knight. When meeting officially, Knight Masons are permitted to form Councils of Knights of the Sword, or Councils of Knight of the East, or Councils of Knights of the East and West in order to confer those particular degrees, therefore the three degrees of Knight Masonry are conferred in three separate Councils, all operating within a Council of Knight Masons. Degrees There are three degrees conferred within the Order of Knight Masons, all concerning the return of the Jewish people from the Babylonian captivity. The central character in all of the degrees is Zerubbabel. The three degrees are: Knight of the Sword, or Babylonian Pass, in which Zerubbabel seeks permission from King Cyrus to return to Jerusalem; Knight of the East, or Jordan Pass, which tells the story of Zerubbabel's return to Persia to seek the help of King Darius; and Knight of the East and West, or Royal Order, which represents the return of Zerubbabel to his countrymen in Jerusalem. History left The position of the Order of Knight Masons among the Masonic appendant bodies in England and Wales There are degrees of this nature in appendant orders within various Masonic systems throughout the world. For example, the Allied Masonic Degrees, America's York Rite, the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite and others have degrees that bear a close similarity to the Irish Knight Mason Degrees. In Ireland the degrees were being conferred within Masonic Knights Templar Preceptories until 1923. When compared to similar ceremonies, the Irish version of these degrees are very elaborate and exceptionally detailed, and it was decided that they should be given their own governing body and be allowed to practice independently of the Masonic Knights Templars. In 1923 within Freemasons' Hall in Dublin the first meeting of the Grand Council of Knight Masons took place and the consecration of new Councils to preserve the Knight Mason Degrees was planned. In the US, Knight Masonry quickly flourished and eventually some American Councils formed a separate Grand Council of the U.S.A. This Grand Council governs Councils within many States within the US, however access to American Councils is strictly by invitation only, within the York Rite. In England and Wales, there are three councils in London (two meeting at Mark Masons' Hall, and one at Croydon), 1 in each of the following places Birmingham, Essex, and Kent.http://www.irish-freemasons.orgPages_KM/List_Councils.html During 2016, two new councils were constituted in England at Leeds, and Plymouth in Devon Today, the Order of Knight Masons under the Grand Council of Knight Masons can be found all over the world. Councils can be found in across the globe in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India. New Councils continue to be founded, most recently in Bermuda, Greece and England. Qualification for membership is to have been Initiated, Passed and Raised in the Craft, Exalted into Royal Arch and Advanced to the rank of Mark Master Mason.

In February 2011, Perform acquired Goal.com. In 2011 and 2013 the company bought sports data companies RunningBall and Opta Sports respectively. In 2013, Perform Group combined its U.S. businesses with The Sporting News to form Sporting News Media, in which it took a 65% stake. Sporting News' former owner American City Business Journals retained 35%.

Brief history Its name derives from miguxo, a corruption from amiguxo, turn a term used for amiguinho, or \\"buddy\\" in Portuguese. This sociolect of Vernacular Brazilian Portuguese brings possible simplifications in the grammatical structures, since the vehicles in which migux√™s is used are nearly universally colloquial, often space-delimited (such as SMS messages, instant messengers or social networks). It also tends to have \\"simpler\\" orthography in comparison to standard Portuguese orthography, which leads to the most strong criticism to it (migux√™s without its common alternative spellings is associated with the just normal Internet and/or youth slang). There are identitarian and orthographic differences between the so- called leetspeak, migux√™s, tiop√™s and internet√™s ‚Äî Brazilian Portuguese for netspeak, which is by far the one that most closely resembles standard Portuguese ‚Äî, all common sociolects found in the Portuguese-speaking digital network community, the three latter ones created in it. Basically, the use of each category depends on the individual choice and the environment in which people are interacting. While in the Internet, in a general manner, there is a handful of a different phenomenon in which users communicate with abbreviations to simplify writing, migux√™s carries with it an effective intention, that is, to express an infantile language in a conversation between friends, or even satirize this style of communication. In certain subcultures in Brazil, especially in the case of what is called 'emo' there, migux√™s is an item of group identification. So it would not be unusual for someone which opposes such subcultures to also develop a distaste for migux√™s. Brazilian 'anti-emo' groups usually satirize 'emo' teenagers with use of migux√™s. Together with the cited urban tribes, they started to fall out of the mainstream in the early 2010s, so that they have much lower popularity with the following teen generation that did not see its spreading as a frequent Internet meme. Spelling Although orthography rules of migux√™s may vary individually, and also in each region and in different urban tribes since it is plain broken Portuguese, there are certain characteristics often commonly found as: * Replacement of s and c for x, simulating the palatalization of native Portuguese-speaking children's speech through their language acquisition: voc√™ (Second person singular), voc√™s (Second person plural) > vuxeh, vuxeix; * Omission or replacement of diacritics, notably by replacing an acute accent over a vowel with the letter h after the vowel as in √© (\\"is\\") > eh (to distinguish it from the word e meaning \\"and\\") or ser√° (\\"will be\\") > serah. Or replacing the tilde with n/m to indicate nasalization: n√£o (\\"no\\") > nawn/naum * Replacement of i by ee, influenced by English language orthography: gatinha (female kitten, also a slang for pretty girl) > gateenha; * Replacement of o and e by u and i respectively, specially in non-tonic syllables: quero (I want) > keru. * Replacing the digraph qu and the letter c as k both for brevity and as a form of sensational spelling, and deleting the u of these environments: quem (who), escreveu (wrote) > kem, ixkrevew Tiop√™s Brazilian indie and scene kids use a related Internet sociolect, the tiop√™s (from tiop, which is a corruption of Portuguese tipo, or equivalent to English \\"like, totally\\", in tiop√™s), which mainly uses ingroup memes as well purposeful ridiculous-sounding misspellings to add humor or irony to the message and bring group identification, much like teh of English-derived leetspeak. The origin of \\"tiop√™s\\" ‚Äì memepedia ‚Äì youPIX, people + pixels As it is common for the migux√™s, there are detractors of tiop√™s, although much less numbered and for different reasons (usually, people which are detractors at the same time of different youth subcultures deemed as alienated, including 'emo' teenagers, scene kids and indie kids). Tiop√™s is also much less common in the Portuguese-speaking Internet community, and is said to be a phenomenon limited to Brazil.

The Isser and Rae Price Library of Judaica currently holds over 100,000 circulating volumes. The main library is located on the first floor of Library West. The Judaica special collections are held in the Judaica Suite in Smathers Library (East).  History  The core collection of the Isser and Rae Price Library of Judaica was formed from the private collection of Rabbi Leonard C. Mishkin of Chicago, Illinois. At the time of its purchase by the University of Florida in 1977, Mishkin's library was the largest private collection of Judaica and Hebraica in America. This collection covered many different areas of Jewish scholarship in a number of languages but had a particular focus on Jewish periodicals. Mishkin's collection also contained a wide variety of festschriften, books produced to honor scholars, usually created by the scholarly community. Mishkin collected festschrifts of all types, including ones about events, rabbis and leaders, and Jewish community members. He also collected Yizkor books, which celebrate the anniversary of a persons death. For instance, one of Mishkin's Yizkor books was about a young Jewish girl on Ellis Island. The Mishkin collection of around 35,000 volumes was purchased in part thanks to a National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Challenge Grant - the first ever awarded to a United States Research Library. This major award was matched by the first State of Florida Quality Improvement Funds. Two large collections supplemented and complemented the Mishkin acquisition: Professor Shlomo Marenof's personal collection with its strengths in Hebrew literature (purchased in 1978), and Bernard Morgenstern's bookstore on New York's Lower East Side with its copies of major and lesser known Yiddish works (purchased in 1979). A smaller collection of mostly Ancient Near Eastern works and books on the Dead Sea Scrolls was later acquired from Theodor H. Gaster's private library in the 1980s. In 1979, a fund was established to support the development of the Judaica library by Jack and Samuel Price, alumni of the University of Florida. Their gift of $400,000 was the largest single gift ever given to the UF Libraries up to that point, and it was the first time that a special collection in the University Library had been endowed. The Judaica Library was named for their parents, Isser and Rae Price. The library was formally named at a special dedication ceremony in March 1981. The Price Library grew from 45,000 volumes to a collection of over 85,000 thanks to the efforts of its librarian of 30 years, Robert Singerman and his assistants Yael Herbsman, Joy Funk, Carol Bird and Emily Madden. In addition to the \\"3 M's Collection\\" (Mishkin, Marenof, and Morgenstern), Singerman continued Mishkin's tradition of festschriften, collecting newspapers and periodicals. By his retirement in 2006, Singerman had collected roughly 200 Jewish newspapers from all over the world, including rare anniversary editions. However, they were unprocessed, stored in binders and boxes with a simple card catalog. After receiving a UF Libraries Mini Grant in 2011, the library worked to digitize its valuable newspaper collection. Initially located in Library East (Smathers Library) and then in Norman Hall from 1995, the Price Library was finally given a permanent home in Library West in 2006. The Library was rededicated 30 years later in 2011. A special collections wing to house the Judaica Library's special collections was opened in 2014. The Judaica Suite was designed by the renowned Florida architect and artist, Kenneth Treister, FAIA. A second historic NEH Challenge Grant was awarded to the George A. Smathers Libraries in 2014 to build an endowment fund that will support the Judaica Library in its efforts to broaden access to Humanities resources relating to the Jewish experience in Florida, Latin America and the Caribbean. The fund will sustain the new online Jewish Diaspora Collection dedicated to providing global access to materials from these areas. The Judaica Suite This special collections wing opened on January 19, 2014. Designed by Kenneth Treister, a UF alumni and architect, this wing is filled with his art and furniture as well as his rare chess set collections. The wing is composed of meaningful elements: abstract paintings about creation, a bronze sculpture depicting the parting of the red sea, and quotes from famous Jewish thinkers. Chairs are side by side at tables rather than across from one another, representing the Jewish tradition of studying together. Samuel Price and Charles Price made a large contribution for Samuel's son, Todd Carroll Price, which allowed for lights, art, and furniture. References Further reading *Jefferson, R. J.

In 1424 Uko and his father opposed the tom Brok family of East Frisian chieftains, who had transferred the village and castle of Oldersum to them in 1413. Ocko II tom Brok demanded from Focko the return of the castle and won a court case to that effect in the city of Groningen dated 6 June 1426.Ernst Friedl√§nder: Ostfriesisches Urkundenbuch, vol. 1, Emden, 1878, Nr. 324 Focko rejected this decision and defeated Ocko in the Battle of Detern on 27 September 1426 and in the Battle of the Wild Fields on 28 October 1427. Thus, Focko Ukena became a pioneer of the principle of Frisian freedom. From the spoils of war Uko Fockena kept the Lordship of Oldersum, includeding the parishes of Gandersum, Rorichum, Tergast and Simonswolde. In 1428, Uko Fockena styled himself (chieftain at Oldersum).Herbert Kannegieter: Oldersumer Chronik, vol. 1.A, self-published, Emden, 1987. p. 19 The Oldersumer Chronik reports that he strengthened the castle at Oldersum using obtained by demolishing Focken Castle in Borssum. In 1430, Uko was besieged in his Oldersum castle by a group of Frisian chieftains who had joined forces under the leadership of the Cirksena family and who opposed Ukena's Lordship. On 2 November 1430, Uko gave up his claim, in a treaty with the besiegers. He was able, however, to retain the right to live in the castle, based on a legal claim his wife held as granddaughter of Ocko I tom Brok.Ostfriesisches Urkundenbuch, certificate Nr. 389 of 5 November 1430 Uko lived in the castle until his death in 1432. His father had fled to M√ºnster after his castle at Leer had fallen. Father Focko had not given up the power struggle and he invited his son Uko to Groothusen to meet his ally Imel Allena. On the way to there, Uko was attacked and slain in a reed land between Marienwehr und Suurhusen. He was buried in the church of the Franciscan monastery in Emden. His daughter Theda Ukena ordered an effigy tomb stone to be put on his grave.Hajo van Lengen: Die sp√§tgotischen Bildnisgrabm√§ler der Heba Attena und des Uko Ukena und ihre politische Bedeutung, in: Emder Jahrbuch, vol. 80, 2000, p. 68-69Stephanie Hahn and Michael Sprenger (eds): Herrschaft - Architektur- Raum, Berlin, 2008, p. 71.

He served thrice as Chief of the Hellenic Army General Staff, occupied various important ministerial positions and became president of the Academy of Athens. Life Early life and career Alexandros Mazarakis-Ainian was born in Athens in 1874. He entered the Hellenic Army Academy in 1890 and was commissioned a second lieutenant of Artillery on 30 June 1895. He participated in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 commanding an artillery battery, and served for three years in the newly founded Geographical Service. In 1905, during the Greek Struggle for Macedonia against the Bulgarian-sponsored Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), he was attached to the Greek Consulate-General in Thessaloniki under the cover name Ioannidis. He served there for three and a half years, until the end of the Struggle in 1908. In 1906 he was promoted to lieutenant. Balkan Wars and World War I After returning from Macedonia, he came first in a contest for further studies in the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Guerre in France. In the Balkan Wars he served as a staff officer in the 7th Infantry Division. In 1914 he was promoted to major and became chief of staff of the 5th Infantry Division at Drama. In September 1916 he joined the Venizelist Movement of National Defence in Thessaloniki. Promoted to lieutenant colonel and full colonel, he served in various General Staff departments during World War I. He then accompanied Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos as a military expert to the Paris Peace Conference, and prepared ethnological and military studies to support the Greek claims. Division commander in Asia Minor He returned to Greece in July 1919, and assumed command of the Smyrna Division in Asia Minor. In 1920 he was promoted to major general, and led his division to the capture of Balƒ±kesir and in the advance towards Bursa during the Greek summer offensive. From there he and his division were recalled to be used in a landing operation in support of the occupation of Eastern Thrace: Mazarakis commanded the landings of troops ferried from Asia at Ereƒüli and Rodosto, and thence advanced north. After overcoming Turkish resistance at Lule Burgas, Babaeski and √áorlu and capturing the local Turkish commander, Cafer Tayyar, his units reached Adrianople. Returning to Asia, he led his division to new positions around Bursa, and commanded a series of raids against Turkish territory. Following the Venizelist defeat in the November 1920 elections, he resigned his commission. In 1921 he published a series of articles criticizing the new government's conduct of the war in Asia Minor, recommending the stabilization and fortification of the then-held lines instead of an advance into the interior of Turkey. Following the Greek defeat and retreat from Asia Minor in August 1922, he was appointed Greek representative at the armistice negotiations at Mudanya, but initially refused to sign the Armistice of Mudanya when it was revealed that Greece would have to evacuate Eastern Thrace. He was subsequently recalled to active service and placed as chief of staff of the Army of Evros in Western Thrace, and then participated in the Greek mission to Conference of Lausanne as a military adviser. Senior military commands in the Interwar period In 1924 he was promoted to lieutenant general and appointed Chief of the Hellenic Army General Staff, beginning the process for its reorganization and re-equipment following the Asia Minor Disaster. He was dismissed from his position following the coup d'√©tat of general Theodoros Pangalos in June 1925, but was reinstated in September 1926, following the overthrow of the Pangalos dictatorship. He served as Minister for Military Affairs in the 1926‚Äì1928 Alexandros Zaimis cabinets, and in September 1928 he was elected a member of the Academy of Athens for his historical studies. He was appointed as Inspector General of Military Schools in March 1929 and soon after again as Chief of the Army General Staff, occupying the post until June 1931. In the March 1933 emergency cabinet of Lt. General Alexandros Othonaios, Mazarakis occupied the portfolio of National Education, as well as, as interim holder, of Foreign Affairs (6/7 March) and Aviation (9/10 March). In 1935, following the outbreak of a pro- Venizelist coup attempt, he was suspended from active service, and finally retired in 1937 due to the age limit. In the same year, he served as president of the Academy of Athens. Later life Following the suicide of Prime Minister Alexandros Koryzis on 18 January 1941, amidst the German invasion of Greece, King George II of Greece gave Mazarakis the mandate to form a new government. The latter refused to formally accept before being briefed on the military situation in Epirus, and on the 20th returned the mandate to the King, both due to the rapid German advance, as well as due to his refusal to form a government with the widely loathed security minister of the Metaxas Regime, Konstantinos Maniadakis. Mazarakis died in Athens in 1943. He was married but childless.

Biography Nicola Filippo is the playfully baroque nom de guerre of Guy Ayres who was born in Peoria, Illinois 1957. Little is known of his early years; when interviewed about his childhood, Filippo refers to it as \\"a chaotic household\\" and an \\"unconventional childhood\\". Filippo attended Otis College of Art and Design and the California College of the Arts. Upon completing his education, he traveled extensively in Italy, visiting many museums and churches and studying what had been done by earlier artists and seeking to incorporate it in his style. In the mid 1990s Filippo surfaced as a painter and sculptor of what he refers to as building blocks of his art work today. Much of this early work was destroyed by the artist. A pivotal point in Filippo's art career was when he photographed a collection of collage pieces by the artist Ray Johnson for the 1999 Whitney Museum exhibit of Johnson's art work New York. Taking a financial outlook in 2000, Filippo launched a design and import line using Balinese silver, pearls, shell and Javanese scarves under the brand name of Mr. Guy. Represented by Priorities, a Los Angeles showroom, the line was successful until it was discontinued in 2007, which turned Filippo's attention entirely back to fine art. Filippo's collage pieces began to gain moderate attention; however due to the playful erotic content, the art work remained taboo for mainstream galleries. Some of the earliest shows were through the Tom of Finland Foundation, Los Angeles. Though not specifically homo-erotic the free use of genital representation on both his male and female figures was an obstacle many galleries are shied away from. In 2007, Filippo's work was shown by Sex Art Gallery in Amsterdam, 2010 at Parlor Gallery in Asbury Park, 2012 12 Inches of Sin at the Sin City Gallery in Las Vegas, 2014 12 Inches of Sin-Le Salon Des Refuses Du Peche at the Sin City Gallery in Las Vegas, 2015 12 Inches of Sin-Le Salon Des Refuses Du Peche at the Sin City Gallery in Las Vegas and 2016 12 Inches of Sin- Immersive at the Sin City Gallery in Las Vegas, 2017 12 Inches of Sin VI at the Sin City Gallery in Las Vegas, 2018 12 Inches of Sin VII at the Sin City Gallery in Las Vegas. In addition to fine art Nicola Filippo began in 2010 to explore advertising work for firms such as Serino Coyne. Nicola Filippo has gifted art work to the Tom of Finland Foundation and Palm Springs Museum of Art; his work is also in numerous private collections. Most notable is the Hieghet and Wilson collection of San Francisco. Early supporters and patrons of Nicola Filippo's art include his spouse Producer and Screenwriter Gerald Ayres (m.2013), art historian Hunter Drohojowska-Philp, curator Lisa Lyons and film maker Agn√®s Varda. Collage Filippo's most notable collage elements are nude figures of men and women, generally vintage, with playful text and bits of Americana found or acquired. Multiple layered and strongly colored these small collages radiate color and flow with gesture.http://nicolafilippo.com/Nicola_Filippo_artist_bio.html The early works consisted of printed transparencies laid over painted cardboard with collage underneath and over. Later works consist entirely of assorted paper. Notes  References  # Henkel, Dr. Laura (2013). Sin City Gallery's 12 Inches of Sin: So Much Art You Can Barely Fit It All In (Volume 1).

From the Sena temples built by Ballal Sen, to the Mughal architecture of the Mughals, to the Indo-Saracenic style (pioneered in Madras) of the colonial era, to 20th century steel and chrome of skyscrapers. Dhaka has a colonial core in the river port area, surrounded by progressively newer areas as one travels away from the Buriganga, punctuated with old temples, churches and mosques. Styles of architecture Mughal architecture Mughal architecture, an amalgam of Islamic, PersianHistory of the Taj Mahal Agra , Retrieved on: 20 January 2009. and Indian architecture, is the distinctive style developed by the Mughals in the 16th and 17th centuries in what is now India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. It is symmetrical and decorative in style. Some of the first and most characteristic examples that remain of early Mughal architecture were built in the short reign (1540‚Äì1545) of emperor Sher Shah Suri, who was not a Mughal; they include a mosque known as the Qila-i-Kuhna mosque (1541) at Purana Quila, Delhi, and the military architecture of the Old Fort in Delhi, the Lalbagh Fort in Bangladesh, and Rohtas Fort, near Jhelum in Pakistan. His mausoleum, octagonal in plan and set upon a plinth in the middle of an artificial lake, is in Sasaram, and was completed by his son and successor Islam Shah Suri (1545AD-1553AD). Indo-Saracenic The Indo-Saracenic (also known as Indo- Gothic, Mughal-Gothic, Neo-Mughal, Hindoo or Hindu-Gothic) was an architectural style movement by British architects in the late 19th century in British India. It drew elements from native Indo-Islamic and Indian architecture, and combined it with the Gothic revival and Neo-Classical styles favoured in Victorian Britain. The style gained momentum in the west with the publication of the various views of India by William Hodges and the Daniell duo, (William Daniell and his uncle Thomas Daniell) from about 1795. Notable buildings Many historic buildings are still fully functional and host government, business or educational establishments. Dhakeshwari Temple Dhakeshwari National Temple ( √êhakeshshori Jatio Mondir) is a famous Hindu temple in Dhaka, Bangladesh and is state-owned, giving it the distinction of Bangladesh's \\"National Temple\\". The name \\"Dhakeshwari\\" (‡¶¢‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶∞‡ßÄ √êhakeshshori) means \\"Goddess of Dhaka\\". The temple is located southwest of the Salimullah Hall of Dhaka University. Since the destruction of Ramna Kali Mandir in 1971 by the Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh Liberation War, the Dhakeshwari Temple has assumed status as the most important Hindu place of worship in Bangladesh. Lalbagh Fort Lalbagh Fort () (also known as \\"Fort Aurangabad\\") is an incomplete Mughal palace fortress at the Buriganga River in the southwestern part of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Construction was commenced in 1678 by Prince Muhammad Azam during his 15-month-long vice-royalty of Bengal, but before the work could complete, he was recalled by Aurangzeb. His successor, Shaista Khan, did not complete the work, though he stayed in Dhaka up to 1688. His daughter Iran Dukht nicknamed Pari Bibi (Fairy Lady) died here in 1684 and this led him to consider the fort to be ominous. Ruplal House Ruplal House is a grand 19th century building or mansion in Old Dhaka, Bangladesh. It was initially owned by Dhaka's infamous Armenian landlord Aratun and later bought [1] and erected jointly by two Hindu affluent merchant brothers named Ruplal Das and Raghunath, sons of Swarup Chandra, on the northern bank of Buriganga overlooking a riverfront promenade in the Farashganj district of old Dhaka. Ruplal House was built on the site at a huge cost, according to the design of an architect of the Martin Company in Calcutta. Divided into two unequal blocks in slightly different styles, it is a two-storey edifice. It presents a Grand River front, about 9144 m long. It replicated Greek Doric column and there used to be a huge clock at the top of the building. In the earthquake of 1897.Dhaka Smriti Bismritir Nagari by Muntasir Mamun, Bangla Academy p.257 Its ground plan follows the shape of the letter 'E', with three arms extending towards the north or the city side, of which the middle arm projects about 1830 m. It accommodates a grand portico carried on a series of lofty semi-Corinthian fluted columns, and surmounted by a triangular pediment, characteristic of Renaissance architecture. The two blocks include, in two floors, over fifty rooms of various sizes and of them the central hall on the upper floor of the more impressive western wing was an elegantly decorated dance hall with a wooden floor. On the north and south two broad verandas run the entire length of the block and are supported on either round semi- Corinthian columns or rectangular brick pillars with segmented or trefoil arches above. Bara Katra The Bara Katra () is a historical and architectural monument located in the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is a palatial building dating to the reign of the Mughal dynasty in the Bengal region. It is situated to the south of Chawk Bazar close to the north bank of the river Buriganga. Curzon Hall Curzon Hall is part of the school of science of the University of Dhaka. With its significance in education during the post independence era of Bangladesh as well as afterwards, it has become an emblem of educational tradition of the country. Ahsan Manzil Ahsan Manzil () was the official residential palace and seat of the Dhaka Nawab Family. This magnificent building is situated at Kumartoli along the banks of the Buriganga River in Bangladesh. The construction of this palace was started in the year 1859 and was completed in 1869. It is constructed in the Indo- Saracenic Revival architecture. To preserve the cultural and history of the area, the palace became the Bangladesh National Museum on 20 September 1992. Star Mosque Star Mosque, locally known as Tara Masjid (), is a mosque located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is situated at the Armanitola area of the old part of the city.

Health Leads facilitates the treatment of underlying social and environmental causes of patients' health problems by working with doctors in participating clinics on \\"prescriptions\\" for things such as food, fuel assistance, housing or other resources for their patients the same way they might prescribe medication. Patients then work with an onsite trained volunteer to access public benefits and community resources to fulfill these \\"prescriptions.\\" Currently, Health Leads operates at 20 desks with 15 clinical partners in six U.S. cities (Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, New York, Providence, and Washington, D.C.). History In 1996, Harvard College sophomore Rebecca Onie co-founded Health Leads (called Project HEALTH until November 2010) with Dr. Barry Zuckerman, Chief of Pediatrics at Boston Medical Center. Onie reached out to Zuckerman while serving as an intern at Greater Boston Legal Services, where she was struck by the link between poverty and poor health. During her internship, Onie interviewed mothers of children who had asthma and lung infections, which were triggered by their housing conditions. Onie found that close to 70 percent of the patients at Boston Medical Center are considered poor and the children who were treated at the clinic would later be readmitted to the hospital because nothing was done to address the causes of their illnesses. Onie served as Executive Director for Health Leads while she completed her undergraduate education. She then attended Harvard Law School and later worked as an associate at Miner, Barnhill & Galland P.C. in Chicago, where her clients included civil health centers, affordable housing developers, and non-profit organizations. During that time, Onie served as founding Co-Chair of Health Leads‚Äô Board of Directors. She returned to Health Leads as CEO in February 2006. Between 2012 and 2014, over 1,000 hospitals requested the Health Leads program. Funding Health Leads is currently supported by both foundations and individual donors. In March 2011, The Skoll Foundation awarded Health Leads a $1.2 million, three-year grant in connection with its social entrepreneurship award to Rebecca Onie. In June 2011, Health Leads completed a capital campaign to raise $11.1 million for a four-year strategic growth plan. In 2014, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation gave Health Leads a $16 million grant to focus on scaling impact. Other donors include New Profit, a venture philanthropy fund, and The Physicians Foundation. Business Model Health Leads facilities are operated chiefly by physicians and college volunteers who work together to match incoming patients with available resources. Health Leads‚Äô stated mission is to ‚Äúconnect low-income patients with the basic resources ‚Äî such as food, housing, and heating assistance ‚Äî that they need to be healthy.‚Äù During a medical appointment at a Health Leads partnered clinic, a physician can refer a patient to a Health Leads desk by writing a ‚Äúprescription‚Äù for resources just as he/she would for medication. The patient is sent to a Health Leads desk in clinic waiting rooms where trained college volunteers ‚Äúfill‚Äù the prescription. Patient casework is documented by Advocates using Health Leads REACH, an online resource and case note database. Stations are typically housed within pediatric outpatient, adolescent and prenatal clinics, newborn nurseries, pediatric emergency rooms, health department clinics and federally qualified health centers. Importance of volunteers Student Advocates are a key part of the model, which involves mobilizing ‚Äúundergraduate volunteers, in partnership with providers in urban clinics, to connect low-income patients with the basic resources ‚Äî such as food, housing, and heating assistance ‚Äî that they need to be healthy.‚Äù Health Leads also sees them as potential future healthcare leaders who will understand the importance of addressing the connection between poverty and poor health. The volunteers go through intensive training and dedicate a minimum of eight hours a week. Health Leads currently works with and accepts applications for new college volunteers each semester from the following schools: Boston University, Harvard University, University of Massachusetts Boston, Brown University, City College of New York, Columbia University, Hofstra University, New York University, Johns Hopkins University, Loyola University Maryland, University of Maryland Baltimore County, University of Maryland College Park, George Washington University, the University of Chicago, and Case Western Reserve University. In 2014, Health Leads anticipates training roughly 1,000 college volunteers, helping over 14,000 low-income patients. A reported 83 percent of graduating Health Leads volunteers in 2010 entered jobs or advanced study in the fields of health and poverty. Plans for growth Health Leads‚Äô strategic plan for 2011 to 2014 calls for growing significantly beyond its current partner hospitals and clinics. In addition to scaling up its current model, the organization is also working on building a strong business case for why the healthcare system should pay for the service. Evaluations and media coverage Outcomes  Nearly 60 percent of patients referred to Health Leads had at least one critical need met within 90 days of their first appointment. Awards In an April 2013 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Health Leads was provided as an example of an ‚Äúoutside the box‚Äù multidisciplinary primary care intervention, along with programs like Reach Out and Read and the Medical-Legal Partnership. The article made recommendations for successful approaches to addressing social determinants of health. In April 2013, the Academic Pediatric Association‚Äôs Task Force on Childhood Poverty, formed to address the effect of childhood poverty on health, released a brief highlighting specific programs, including Health Leads, as ‚Äúevidence-based primary care programs that help children in poor families.‚Äù In March 2013, Rebecca Onie appeared for the second time on the MSNBC program Melissa Harris-Perry Show to discuss the Affordable Care Act and the challenges of implementation as coverage is set to extend to roughly 30 million more Americans in 2014. The Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship named Onie one of twenty-four international Social Entrepreneurs of the Year 2013. The award recognizes leadership and innovation, as well as potential for global impact. The Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School named Rebecca Onie as the 2012 recipient of the Gleitsman Citizen Activist Award, bestowed biennially to leaders ‚Äúwho have struggled to correct social injustice in the United States.‚Äù In December 2012, Health Leads was named to the S&I; 100, an index launched by the Social Impact Exchange highlighting America‚Äôs top-performing non-profit organizations. In October 2012, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation selected Rebecca Onie as one of ten recipients, 40 years of age and younger, of the Young Leader Award: Recognizing Leadership for a Healthier America. In September 2012, Rebecca Onie appeared on the top-rated MSNBC program Melissa Harris-Perry Show to discuss the Affordable Care Act and the challenge of more patients becoming insured while fewer medical students pursue primary care. In 2012, Rebecca Onie co-authored \\"Realigning Health with Care: Lessons in Delivering More with Less\\", highlighting the need for America to expand its scope of healthcare. The article appeared in the Stanford Social Innovation Review. In April 2012, Rebecca Onie delivered a TEDMED talk, \\"Can We Rewrite the DNA of the Healthcare System?\\" where she asked, \\"If we know what we need to do to have a healthcare system, rather than a sickcare system - why don't we do it?\\" In December 2011, Harris Interactive, on behalf of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that nine in ten physicians serving patients in low- income communities believe patients' social needs are as important to address as their medical conditions and offered Health Leads as a promising model for bridging the gap. On July 28, 2011, The New York Times ran a commentary about Health Leads, written by David Bornstein (author), which referred to Health Leads as \\"one of the most impressive organizations in the country\\" at addressing the conditions that make people sick. The Skoll Foundation awarded Rebecca Onie one of its four 2011 Skoll Awards for Entrepreneurship for Health Leads‚Äô role in ‚Äúscalable, proven solutions‚Äù to the ‚Äútoughest of problems.‚Äù The awards go to social entrepreneurs ‚Äúaround the world in the areas of tolerance and human rights, health, environmental sustainability, peace and security and economic and social equity.‚Äù Onie was named to Oprah Winfrey's 2010 O Power List of women who are ‚Äúchanging the world for the better.‚Äù According to O: The Oprah Magazine, Onie and Health Leads ‚Äúblew us away‚Äù by understanding ‚Äúthe power of the big picture.‚Äù In 2009, Onie received a MacArthur Fellows Program from the John D. and Catherine T.

Regarding the album's thematic content, Hay said, \\"I think it‚Äôs about life and loss and the injustice of the way the universe is set up; how we lose people we love.\\" Background and recording The album is partly inspired by the death of Hay's father in 2010. On the album's release, Hay noted, \\"The loss of my father last year brought an unavoidable emotional contingent to writing and recording. I don‚Äôt have a definitive belief in an afterlife, but I do feel like I had his help when I was working on this album, especially alone late at night, in the studio.

It is classified as a \\"breakdown\\" and is popular in old time, bluegrass and Celtic traditional circles. History The tune has been included in over 250 tune books. The tune became popular as recorded by Fiddlin' Arthur Smith. That version, according to Alan Jabbour, supplanted an earlier tune played by Santford Kelly from Morgan County, Kentucky,Note: As an E minor tune. He ends the tune \\"that's the way that God made peace\\". http://www.aca-dla.org/cgi- bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/Berea43&CISOPTR;=3533&filename;=3534.mp3 which is now represented by the tune \\"Yew Piney Mountain\\".Fiddle tune played by Alan Jabbour at Berea College on 5-28-08, while participating in Berea's Appalachian Music Fellowship Program; Jabbour, Alan; Blackberry Blossom\\"Blackberry Blossom\\" - Lecture and performance by Alan Jabbour. Madison County, Kentucky,Audio Compact Disc, Digital Library of Appalachia, Archives, Hutchins Library, Department of Special Collections & Archives. It is also called \\"Garfield's Blackberry Blossom\\", perhaps to distinguish it from the earlier version.The Fiddler‚Äôs Companion, Andrew Kuntz, 1996, citing Jean Thomas's Ballad Makin' in the Mountains of Kentucky Contradicting Jabbour, who clearly distinguishes the earlier version, is the account of Andrew Kuntz to the effect that \\"Betty Vornbrock and others have noted a similarity between 'Garfield‚Äôs Blackberry Blossom' and the West Virginia tune 'Yew Piney Mountain', a variant ... also played by Kentucky fiddlers J.P. Fraley and Santford Kelly\\". Alan Snyder gives an alternate name of \\"Strawberry Beds\\". Culture Although the tune is closely associated with the old time/ bluegrass traditions of the United States,Note: The Digital Library of Appalachia has recordings primarily from Kentucky. it enjoys the distinction of being frequently played by traditional Irish musicians. In Celtic music This is a partial list of covers by Irish musicians and bands. *An Fhidil, Sraith 2 by Sean Keane, Kevin Burke, Paddy Glackin And Seamus Creagh *Ireland's Best Session Tunes CD 1 by Waltons Recording *Irish Dances by Various Artists *Top Of Coom by Conal √ì'Gr√°da *Traditional Irish Dance Music by All Star Ceilidhe Band *Traditional Irish Dance Music: All Star Ceili Band by Joe Derrane *Traditional Irish Music by William Sullivan *Traditional Irish Tunes Played On The Tin Whistle (1/2) by Geraldine Cotter *Traditional Music Of Ireland by Various Artists *Natalie MacMaster in Four on the Floor (cassette) In Bluegrass According to Devon Wells, \\"Blackberry Blossom\\", as a banjo tune, was brought to the public's attention as one of the earliest arrangements of Bill Keith. Wells, a bluegrass teacher, asserts that the tune is a standard in the bluegrass banjo repertoire.Wells Some of the older recordings archived at the Digital Library of Appalachia include: *Fiddle tune played by Clyde Davenport at the Berea College Celebration of Traditional Music on 11-03-84 *Fiddle tune played by Carlton Rawlings and recorded by John Harrod in Bath County, Kentucky in the 1970s Structure Like most fiddle tunes, \\"Blackberry Blossom\\" has an A part and a B part. In Arthur Smith's 1935 version, the A part is in the key of G major, with C and D chords in the second half of the part; the B part introduces an E major chord, making for a rather unusual mood shift. Later recorded versions changed the harmonic structure of this tune radically, introducing additional chord changes (substitutions based on the melody line) in the A part, and alternating E minor and B7 in the B part. The key of E minor is the relative minor of the key of G major - it uses the same sharps and flats but its modal center is E rather than G. This makes for a more \\"standard\\" harmonic structure. Melodically, according to Anthony, \\"The note played on the 1st & 3rd beat of the first 2 measures are the first 4 notes of the descending scale of G. Each of these notes is the beginning of a 3-note run, returning to this base note, before moving on to the next note in the G scale.\\" Videographic documentation * Fiddle Solo (Vi Wickam) * Fiddle and Guitar * Mandolin (Mark O'Connor) * Fiddle and percussion - interpretive (Carrie Rodriguez)Carrie Rodriguez performing live at the Rosendale Cafe in Rosendale, NY on January 3, 2008.

It was revealed on 23 May 2011 and was released in the U.S. on 10 June 2011 at a price of $129.99. The Kobo Touch 2.0, the successor to the Touch, was released in September 2015.Kobo Touch 2.0 e-Reader Review September 8, 2015.  Hardware  This model of the Kobo Touch improved upon its predecessors by using a zForce touch-sensitive display; hence its name, the Kobo Touch. The infrared based touch interface does not require electrical conductivity, allowing for the user to interact with the device when wearing gloves. Other improvements included an E Ink Pearl screen, a faster processor capable of smooth PDF panning, 802.11n Wi-Fi capability, and reduced size and weight. The Kobo Touch shipped in five colours: lilac, blue, silver, black, and white. It is made of a soft matte plastic. The back of every Kobo device features a quilted pattern. Like the original Kobo model, the Touch is manufactured in Taiwan.FCC OET Exhibits List for Kobo N905 The Kobo Touch was introduced to compete with Amazon's Kindle and Barnes & Noble's Nook. By not including a physical keyboard like the Kindle Keyboard, and leaving only a home button on the front face of the device, Kobo was able to further shrink down the dimensions of the Touch. The 2GB of memory was similar to what competitors offered; this memory allows for the storage of approximately 1 000 books. With a 32GB microSD card that can be inserted in the side of the Kobo Touch, the number of books that can be stored rises to 30 000. Battery life of the Kobo Touch is estimated to be approximately one month, assuming reading for 30 minutes a day and Wi-Fi turned off.  Variants  Three variants of the Kobo Touch were released: N905, N905B, and N905C. The first was the original Kobo Touch; the second was the model with advertisements; the third was the low-cost model introduced after the release of the Kobo Glo.  Software  Kobo Touch runs on the Kobo Touch Firmware, based on the Linux kernel. The software is available in 8 languages and 2 variants: English, French, Canadian French, Japanese, German, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Brazilian Portuguese. The main screen shows tiles that automatically update based on actions the user has performed. Tiles may appear for books, newspapers, magazines, store categories, or games the user has recently read, browsed, or played, respectively. The main screen is called \\"Reading Life\\". The main application, the digital reader, supports a variety of ebook formats: ePub, PDF, Adobe DRM, MOBI, RTF, HTML, TXT, Comic Book Archive file, JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIFF. By flicking or tapping a side of the screen, the user may advance to the next page or previous page. Adjusting the font is possible with a feature called TypeGenius: users can change the weight, sharpness, and font size of any preinstalled fonts on the Kobo. Highlighting, adding notes, and looking up definitions in the built-in dictionaries is also possible by long-tapping a passage in any part of the book. The Kobo Touch also provides statistics about reading progress: average reading time per session, total time read, pages turned, and the percentage of books completed. Books can be viewed in a list view or grid view in the user's library. They can be arranged based on title, author, file size, file type, and when they were last opened. Users can also arrange their books into collections. Users may also download books through the use of the Kobo Bookstore. Adding books to a wishlist, purchasing books, and browsing through the library can be done on the Kobo itself thanks to the Wi-Fi chip. Once purchased, books are saved in the cloud and can be redownloaded at any time if the user has deleted the book from his/her device. This feature also allows for reading location, bookmarks, highlights, and notes to be synced across many devices. eBooks compatible with the Kobo Touch can be borrowed from many public libraries, including the Ottawa Public Library and the Toronto Public Library. These books with DRM require authentication from Adobe in order to be read on the device. Books may be added to the device with the Kobo Desktop app or third party apps such as Calibre. The Kobo Touch also includes integration with the read-it-later service Pocket. Once a user has signed in with their Pocket account, articles saved to Pocket can be read on the Kobo Touch. Four applications are included with the Kobo Touch: a web browser, sudoku, chess - now replaced by Unblock It - and a sketch pad. The web browser allows for downloading of files that can be read on the device. Kobo does not provide technical support for these applications. Originally, 15 free previews of select books were included, although Kobo ceased including books with their devices.  Reception  The initial reaction to the Kobo Touch was mixed to positive. Reviewers lauded the design of the device, and the software, most notably praising the inclusion of a touch screen, a new E-ink panel, a microSD card slot, included applications, and the minimalism of the device. Complaints included an overall sluggishness to the interface (which eventually got solved in firmware updates) and the lack of hardware buttons for turning pages.

During April to June 2011, anti-Gaddafi forces gained control of most of the eastern part of the southern desert region (i.e. the southern part of Cyrenaica) during the Cyrenaican desert campaign. In July, Qatrun changed to anti-Gaddafi control on 17 July and back to pro-Gaddafi control on 23 July. In late August, anti- and pro-Gaddafi forces struggled for control of Sabha.  Background  Before the war, parts of southern Libya were known for being almost lawless, and travel was often restricted in some areas due to the presence of bands of militants and bandits (often filtering across the border from Algeria) roaming the desert between towns. Clashes between Islamic militants linked to Al-Qaeda and Libyan security forces occurred several times near the town of Ghat in the years leading up to the conflict. Further south, near the border with Chad, the terrain is made hazardous by landmines in the desert left over from the Chadian-Libyan conflict, which lasted from 1978 to 1987. The far south also lacks paved roads and functioning mobile phone services, making communication difficult even in peacetime.  Preceding events  Following the Cyrenaican desert campaign mounted by loyalist forces, focus shifted to the southern part of the Libyan Desert. By mid-June 2011, the Eastern Desert was under the control of forces answering to the National Transitional Council in Benghazi. Clashes in Sabha, the largest city in the Fezzan, in mid-June suggested previously unknown vulnerabilities in a settlement thought to be a loyalist stronghold. Although anti-Gaddafi activists and fighters in Sabha were successfully suppressed, the NTC suggested that the bold attempt at uprising was indicative of cracks in Gaddafi's support base in the oasis city.  The campaign  Moving out of Kufra, a population center in the southeastern desert, rebel forces moved through Murzuq District along the international border with Chad and Niger in mid-July 2011. They secured the Tumu border crossing and took Qatrun on 17 July, without a shot, also capturing a military airfield and outpost at Al Wigh near the Niger border. Pro-Gaddafi forces were believed to have withdrawn to Traghan in order to block a suspected rebel advance on Sabha, but rebel forces bypassed Traghan in their northward press in order to capture the village of Umm Al Aranib as a forward base. Loyalist forces attacked Qatrun three times before finally recapturing it on 23 July. Toubou tribesmen, who declared support to the National Transitional Council, retreated to the south of the town, leaving about 20,000 civilians trapped between them and the army. At least two people are thought to had been killed and eight wounded in the final attack to retake the town. On 5 August, Alain Jupp√©, the French foreign minister, claimed that the southern regions of Libya are \\"practically under the NTC's control\\".Al Jazeera Libya Live Blog. There was no confirmation of the claim by either independent media, the loyalists or the rebels. Toubou tribal fighters reportedly captured Murzuk. Jufra At least one NTC official suggested that the Jufra District, including Hun, Waddan, and neighbouring towns, as well as the Al Jufra Air Base, was a key target, more valuable than Bani Walid or Sirte. On 19 September, NTC forces took over Zella, an oasis town near the Jufra area, Al Jazeera reported. On 21 September, pro-Gaddafi forces shelled the town of Hun after NTC forces reportedly took control of it. On the same day, the NTC announced that they took control over the town of Jufra and surrounding area. This was later confirmed at a NATO press conference by Lieutenant General Charles Bouchard. Sabha Several months after clashes occurred in the southern Libyan city of Sabha in June, Libyan opposition forces reported fierce fighting between revolutionary fighters and forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi on 23 August. Several days later, on 25 August, rebels claimed to have again captured the outpost of Al Wigh, several hundred kilometres south of Sabha, towards the Libya/Chad/Niger tripoint. On 28 August, three NLA soldiers were killed in the city of Sabha after they ran out of ammunition. Pro-Gaddafi brigades were joined by reinforcements from other towns. On the same day, Colonel Bani of the NLA forces said that they would \\"advance on\\" Sabha after taking control of Sirte on the coast. On 4 September, NLA forces claimed that they had surrounded Sabha. The city would receive humanitarian aid but has one week to surrender. On 19 September, spokesman for NTC Ministry of Defence, Col. Ahmed Bani, announced at a press conference that NTC fighters managed to capture Sabha airport and fort. There was no immediate independent verification of his claims. On 20 September, NTC forces entered the city of Sabha, taking the city center with little resistance. A CNN reporter accompanied NTC forces, confirming the reports. An NTC military spokesman in Benghazi said Sabha Airport was under the control of anti-Gaddafi fighters, but fighting was continuing in some quarters of the city proper. Brak On 14 September, an NTC Commander said an anti-Gaddafi column 500 strong (coming from the north/Mizda region) had captured the military air-base at Brak in south- central Libya, some 50 kilometres north of Sabha. The NTC commander (Ahamda Almagri) also said two Gaddafi loyalists were arrested, while 70 loyalists fled the air-base, the second-largest in the south of Libya. On the morning of 15 September, anti-Gaddafi forces entered the city itself where fighting erupted. On 16 September, anti-Gaddafi forces had taken control over the towns of Brak and Gira, just 50 kilometers north of Sabha. During the fighting, incoming rocket fire struck the airbase, that the rebels captured the day before, which ignited the underground ammunition stores that held thousands of artillery rounds causing massive explosions. A day later, on 17 September, the rest of the towns in Wadi al Shatii District were peacefully taken by NTC forces. Murzuq On 21 September, after NTC forces have taken control of Sabha, Desert Shield Brigade spokesman in Benghazi said that NTC forces moved from Sabha south and engaged pro-Gaddafi loyalists in town Traghan, between Umm al-Aranib and capital city of district Murzuq. Ubari On 22 September, an NTC commander in Sabha told CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman that his forces have taken control over the town of Ubari, the capital of the Wadi al Hayaa District. Ghat By 25 September, fighting moved onto the border town of Ghat where the last remnants of pro-Gaddafi loyalists in Fezzan were claimed to be stationed. The same day, NTC forces took control over Ghat airport, located north of the city and a day later Ghat itself and the Tinkarine border crossing with Algeria.

The first song was finished on October 6, 1913; the second one was composed between November 30 and December 3, 1914; the third one was composed between December 3, 1914, and January 1, 1915; and, after a hiatus, the fourth one was composed between July 19 and 28, 1916. These songs were the last works that Schoenberg was to write in the freely atonal style. After finishing this composition, Schoenberg would complete no new works for seven years, when he composed the Five Piano Pieces, Op. 23. During this compositional hiatus, he would develop the twelve-tone technique; thereafter, he would compose mainly (though not exclusively) using the twelve-note method. The orchestral songs was premiered on February 21, 1932, in Frankfurt am Main, conducted by Hans Rosbaud with soprano Hertha Reinecke. The second movement was dedicated to student and fellow composer Anton Webern. It was eventually published by Universal Edition in Vienna, on November 7, 1917.  Structure  The four songs are as follows: The first of the songs, Seraphita, was composed in October 1913. The text comes from a poem by Ernest Dowson, translated by Stefan George. This is the most extended of the four songs with the vocal line separated by substantial orchestral interludes. The six clarinets open this song with a melody primarily based on seconds and thirds. The second song was written from November to December 1914, taking a text from a collection of poetry entitled The Book of Hours, by Rainer Maria Rilke; it is found in the second volume, Das Buch von der Pilgerschaft (The Book of Pilgrimage). The third song, which also comes from Rilke's The Book the Hours, Das Buch von der Armut und vom Tode (The Book of Poverty and Death), was written between December 1914 to January 1915 and is divided into three sections. The fourth and final song, Vorgef√ºhle, was finished in July 1916 with the text coming from Rilke's The Book of Images.  Arrangements  Felix Greissle wrote an arrangement of the whole set of songs in 1921. It was scored for a small ensemble which included a baritone, a piccolo, a flute, a clarinet, a bass clarinet, a violin, a viola, a violoncello, and a piano. The arrangement has only been recorded once by EMI, which was released in LP format. The performance of this recording was carried out by the Pierrot Ensemble K√∂ln in August 1980.  Notable recordings  The Philharmonia Orchestra recording on the Naxos label with the voice of Catherine Wyn-Rogers under the baton of Robert Craft. At the time of its release in 1998, it received a positive critical reception.

The house dates back to at least the 15th century, was rebuilt in the 17th century, and extended in 1854. Between 1985 and 2003 it was used as a retirement home. The structure was devastated by suspected arson attacks in 2003 and remained derelict for more than a decade before being redeveloped into apartments in 2016. History The land that sites Holme Hall dates back to 1340 when Richard de Whitacre arrived in Cliviger from High Whiteacre (Padiham). In 1431, The Holme, then a manor house of 40 rooms, was referenced in connection with Thomas Whitaker. The process of converting the original wooden structure into stone began in 1603 and was completed 1717 with west wing. The Whitakers installed windows in the stairway that had been removed from the old St Mary's Church, Blackburn after the church was demolished in 1819, and built an extension to the rear in 1854. The family sold the house in 1950. The land once belonged to the Tattersall family and housed a chapel which lent its name to the neighbouring village of Holme Chapel. In 1953 the house was recognised as a Grade II* listed building with Historic England. The original features were documented, as well as the history of the alterations, including the rear extension in 1854. In 1985 The Holme became a retirement home which closed in 2003. The Holme was subject to suspected arson attacks in March and April 2003 which devastated most of the south-east structure and destroyed period features, leaving the west wing and 1854 northeast addition intact. The property was sold on 19 August 2004 for ¬£475,000 and again sold on 11 March 2005 for ¬£495,000 to the Hurstwood Group. On 29 August 2007 Hurstwood obtained planning permission to convert the building into ten 1000 sq/ft apartments. On 6 September 2007 Hurstwood sold the property with 1.5 acres at auction for ¬£600,000.Pugh & Co 6 Sep 2007 auction, lot 22 retrieved 10 April 2013 On 25 April 2013 the derelict property with 1.5 acres was auctioned on behalf of the Receivers with a guide price of ¬£100,000 to ¬£150,000 Pugh & Co 25 Apr 2013 auction, lot 78 retrieved 10 April 2013 and sold for ¬£151,000.

Early life and training She was born Russell Meriwether Hughes in Louisville, Kentucky and began her dance training in Texas, studying ballet, Spanish, and Mexican dance forms. She continued her training in Hawaii, where she studied Hawaiian dance, and then New York, where she studied modern dance and ballet. Career In 1928, La Meri began performing professionally. In the 1930s, she invited Indian classical dancer, Ram Gopal, one of the early pioneers of dance of India in the west, who toured with her extensively. Until 1940, she toured and studied in areas such as Central and South America, Europe, North Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, India, Burma, Indonesia, the Philippines, China, Japan, Ceylan, and Hawaii. As she traveled, La Meri learned the native dances of the different areas she visited, studying with local dance masters. She went on to create her own dance works based on the steps and movement vocabularies she learned.Judy Farrar Burns, \\"Meri, La,\\" The International Encyclopedia of Dance, Selma Jean Cohen and Dance perspectives foundation, ¬© 1998, 2005 by Oxford University Press, Inc.. She researched the dance styles of Latin America, Spain, Africa, and Asia extensively. This allowed her to bring authenticity to the stage in a way that rang true to the roots of each dance style. In 1940, La Meri and Ruth St. Denis founded the \\"School of Natya\\", which is Hindu dance, in New York City. Through the school, La Meri formed The Five Natyas, her first performing company. In 1945 she absorbed the school of Natya into Ethnologic Dance Center and the Ethnologic Dance Theater, which operated from 1942-1956. She also performed at the American Museum of Natural History‚ÄúThe American Museum of Natural History Presents La Meri and Company with Juana in Around the World with Dance and Song,‚Äù Program from 1949. Dieman-Bennett Dance Theatre of the Hemispheres records, Iowa Women's Archives, The University of Iowa Libraries, Iowa City. and presented concert programs of young ethnic-dancers from across the globe. In 1944, she choreographed swan lake with the translation into Hindu dance movements. She did not change ballet's music and plot, but added a prologue and a danced fight between the princess and the Rothbart. La Meri taught regularly at Jacob‚Äôs Pillow, gave lecture-demonstrations, and published a number of magazine articles and books, including The Gesture Language of Hindu Dance (1941) and Spanish Dancing (1948). The latter book is considered to be a definitive text on the subject of Spanish dance. Overall, La Meri‚Äôs extensive work in ethnic dance earned her the reputation of being one of the foremost experts in the ethnic-dance field. La Meri's work helped to inspire other choreographers to show respect for dances of cultures not their own, as well as educating the audience. Her thorough anthropological work embodied the values of each ethnicity she used in her choreography and highlighted the importance of integrity in the dance world. In 1938 La Meri published a book \\"Songs and Voyages,\\" with 82 pages of poetry, now very rare. [Livorno -Arti Grafiche S. Belfort & C. 5 Dicembre 1938 - XVII, printed in Italy] According to the frontispiece, her poetry had appeared in American Poetry Magazine, Literary Digest, Braithwaite Anthology, L'Alouette, The Harp, The Dance Magazine, Independent Poetry Anthology, Lariat, Circle, Buccaneer, Contemporary Verse, Interludes, Gammadion, Texas Anthology, Bozart, American Anthology, Poetry Journal, Bright Scrawl, Unicorn, Home Magazine, Present Day Poets, Wandering Eros, more.

Career At age thirteen, Armstrong began working at a coin and stamp dealership in Pennsauken, New Jersey. At age fifteen he bought a bag of rare Canadian pennies that for a brief period would have made him a millionaire, had he sold them before they crashed in value. After becoming the manager of his employer's store at the age of twenty-one, he and a partner opened a store for coin and stamp collectors. Armstrong progressed from investments in gold coins to following commodity prices for precious metals. In 1973, he began publishing commodities market predictions as a hobby. As his coin and stamp business declined, Armstrong spent more time on his commodities ventures, launching a paid newsletter in 1983. Armstrong has since traded under various business names, including Princeton Economics International, Princeton Economic Consultants, Inc., Economic Consultants of Princeton, Inc., and Armstrong Report, Inc.  Education  After viewing The Toast of New York in high school, Armstrong came to believe that assets do not appreciate linearly over time and that, historically, some manner of economic panic occurs every 8.6 years. His economic philosophy was influenced by his father, a lawyer whose grandfather had lost a fortune in the 1929 stock market crash. After finishing high school, Armstrong briefly attended RCA Institutes (now TCI College of Technology) in New York City and audited courses at Princeton University but did not obtain a college degree. That may have contributed to the reason that Armstrong is unable to understand the simplest physics of energy conservation law and the impossibility of perpetual motion machine even in the year of 2019, stating on his public blog as a matter of fact that \\"You plugged it [scooter] in once and thereafter it self-generated power and did not need to be plugged in again. \\" Economic Confidence Model Armstrong's Economic Confidence Model is an economic cycle theory that proposes that economic waves occur every 8.6 years, or 3141 days, which is approximately \\\\pi \\\\times 1000. At the end of each cycle is a crisis after which the economic climate improves until the next 8.6 year crisis point. The theory is based on a list of historical financial panics (26 in 224 years, between 1683 and 1907), producing a frequency of roughly 8.6 years. Armstrong concluded that a wave of 8.6 years moved through larger waves building in intensity amounting to six waves of 8.6 years constructing a major long wave of 51.6 years. Also key are quarter-cycles of 2.15 years. Armstrong kept his cycle secret and The New Yorker commented that Armstrong suggested that his models were rooted in certain fundamentals and complex computer calculations, rather than in a simple mystical number. Despite Armstrong's repeated claim that his model is accurate \\"down to the day\\", he gave two different dates for the 2015.75 ECM dates. One is 10/7/2015 from his blog. Another date also from his blog is 10/1/2015. His fuzzy math comes from his liberal usage of the number 8.6, which is in fact 8.6153846615 according to the headline of his own website. That many digits of accuracy would certainly give a precision within a day. However, October 7 is obviously NOT October 1st. ECM date cannot be accurate down to the day if there are two different dates. Computerized Services Armstrong claimed in 2012 that he runs his models on a \\"Global Artificial Intelligence Computer System\\", the IBM Sequoia. This computer is operated by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC, for the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration. He claims the energy cost to run his program takes up 6 million dollars, which happens to be about 86% to 100% of the TOTAL energy cost for Sequoia. Sequoia is meant to be used for government or academic research only. His claims on super-computer are extremely likely to be a lie to booster subscribers' confidence. In September 2018, Armstrong claims that his computer software, named Socrates, originally written in assembler code, is a clone of himself. Since December 2015, output from his models is available as reports and graphs via the Socrates web application as a subscription service with three price levels. The performance of this service has been discussed in internet forums. Some critics question the profitability and integrity of the system due to conflicts created by ambiguities that require resolution by human interpretation, and due to important signals reported only in hindsight. Predictions Armstrong's theory was initially applied in 1977, when he used it to successfully predict an upturn in the price of commodities, according to The New Yorker. Armstrong's forecast of an imminent Russian economic collapse was mentioned in the Financial Times on 27 June 27, 1998. In August 1998 the currency market saw the 1998 Russian financial crisis. Justin Fox wrote in Time that Armstrong's model \\"made several eerily on-the-mark calls using a formula based on the mathematical constant pi.\\"Justin Fox. Time magazine. Pg 30; Nov. 30, 2009 Barron's noted the model called for a change in sentiment in June 2011.Robin Blumenthal. \\"Circular Reasoning: A Market for Pi in the Sky?\\", Barron's, June 25, 2011 According to an editorial in The Guardian, Armstrong INcorrectly predicted that a sovereign debt crisis, or \\"Big Bang\\" as he called it, would begin on 1 October 2015. On his public blog, Armstrong predicted a drop of bitcoin to $775 if year 2018 closes below 4150. Bitcoin closed at about $3743 at the end of 2018. However, instead of a drop, bitcoin more than doubled in year 2019. His blog URL and title of the post suggested The End of Cryptocurrencies. His entire forecast was totally off the mark. CFTC violations In 1985 Armstrong was found to have violated Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations by failing to register as a commodity trading advisor, failing to deliver required disclosure documents to clients, and failing to maintain proper records. In 1987 one of Armstrong's trading entities, Economic Consultants of Princeton Inc., was charged with failing to disclose a commission sharing agreement, and another of his entities, Princeton Economic Consultants Inc, was charged with misrepresenting hypothetical performance results and omitting a required disclaimer in advertisements. The penalties levied banned Armstrong and his companies from trading for twelve months, revoked their registrations, imposed cease-and- desist orders, and levied civil penalties totalling fifty thousand dollars. Criminal conviction In 1999, Japanese fraud investigators accused Armstrong of collecting money from Japanese investors, improperly commingling these funds with funds from other investors, and using the fresh money to cover losses he had incurred while trading. United States prosecutors called it a three-billion-dollar Ponzi scheme. Allegedly assisting Armstrong in his scheme was the Republic New York Corporation, which produced false account statements to reassure Armstrong's investors. In 2001, the bank agreed to pay US$606 million as restitution for its part in the scandal. Armstrong was indicted in 1999 and ordered by Judge Richard Owen to turn over fifteen million dollars in gold bars and antiquities bought with the fund's money; the list included bronze helmets and a bust of Julius Caesar. Armstrong produced some of the items but claimed the others were not in his possession; this led to several contempt of court charges brought by the SEC and the CFTC, for which he served seven years in jail until he reached a plea bargain with federal prosecutors. Under the terms of the agreement, Armstrong admitted to deceiving corporate investors and improperly commingling client funds‚Äîactions that according to prosecutors resulted in commodities losses of more than seven hundred million dollars‚Äîand was sentenced to five years in prison. He was released from federal custody on 2 September 2011 after serving a total of eleven years behind bars.Martin Arthur Armstrong, inmate # 12518-050, Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Dep't of Justice. The case against Armstrong was finally closed in 2017, with the distribution of about $80 million to claim holders by the receiver, according to court filings. Armstrong appealed the refusal of the receiver to transport his remaining possessions from storage lockers in New York and Pennsylvania to him in Florida, but the appeal failed in 2019. Hidden rare coins cache In 2014, a New Jersey day laborer claimed to have found a cache of valuable rare coins while clearing out the basement of a house, and subsequently sold them to a local thrift shop. Three years later in 2017, the thrift shop announced they were to auction the coins, however Armstrong came forward and claimed to be the rightful owner, saying he hid them in his mother's old house to take them \\"off the books\\" in anticipation of his firm's public offering. The thrift shop sued Armstrong, and asked the court to declare the thrift shop as rightful owners. Armstrong counter-sued also seeking ownership. The US government found out about the coins, in 2019, and claimed the coins as part of the treasure hoard Armstrong had refused to hand over to the Court, in 1999, and for which he served seven years in jail for contempt. The hoard consisted of 102 gold bars, 699 gold coins, an ancient bust of Julius Caesar, and rare coins in total valued at $12.9 million. Armstrong was deposed and, according to Receiver Alan M. Cohen, Armstrong admitted hiding the coins. However, Armstrong's attorneys said in a court filing that Armstrong did not make this admission. The auction house now possesses the coins and the US government has filed suit to take possession. Documentary film The 2014 documentary film The Forecaster tells the story of Armstrong's financial model, his imprisonment and release.http://www.theforecaster-film.de/, retrieved September 13, 2017 It was directed by Marcus Vetter and Karin Steinberger and co-produced by Arte. The film presents Armstrong's claims that he is innocent, that the bank involved was at fault, that he was coerced into admitting to fraud, and that the FBI was after his economic model. Representatives of the United States Department of Justice were not interviewed in the film. A Los Angeles Times critic described the film as \\"intended primarily as a name-clearing platform for Armstrong to relate his version of the events\\" and that it lacked perspective due to its failure to present commentary from authorities. A New York Times critic decried the film's \\"one-sided assertions and insinuations\\" and \\"less than skeptical\\" tone. A Washington Post critic observed that \\"though the Armstrong partisans in the film strongly suggest that [his models work], director Marcus Vetter struggles to convince the lay viewer.\\" Climate change According to DeSmogBlog, Armstrong has frequently posted on his website denying the existence of man-made climate change. He stated in 2018, \\"Climate is changing and it is part of the normal cycle ‚Äì not human-induced.\\" Armstrong stated in June 2016 that \\"Britain is moving into an Ice Age\\". Personal life Armstrong is divorced and has a son and a daughter.

It formed a prelude to the wider News International phone hacking scandal which developed in 2009 and exploded in 2011, when it became clear that the phone hacking had taken place on a much wider scale. Early indications of this in the police investigation were not followed through, and the failures of the police investigation would go on to form part of the wider scandal in 2011. In August 2006, the News of the Worlds royal editor, Clive Goodman and a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, were arrested by the Metropolitan Police, and later charged with hacking the telephones of members of the royal family by accessing voicemail messages, an offence under section 79 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. On 26 January 2007, both Goodman and Mulcaire pleaded guilty to the charges and were sentenced to four and six months imprisonment respectively. On the same day, it was announced that Andy Coulson had resigned as editor of the News of the World. Overview Background On 13 November 2005, an article appeared in the News of the World written by royal editor Clive Goodman, that claimed that Prince William was in the process of borrowing a portable editing suite from ITV royal correspondent Tom Bradby. Following the publication, the Prince and Bradby met to try to figure out how the details of their arrangement had been leaked, as only two other people were aware of it. Prince William noted that another equally improbable leak had recently taken place regarding an appointment he had made with a knee surgeon. After some discussion, the Prince and Bradby concluded it was likely that their voicemails were being accessed. Their concerns were passed to the Metropolitan Police, who set up an investigation under Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke, who managed the Counter Terrorism Command. Clarke reported to Assistant Commissioner Andy Hayman, commander of the Specialist Operations directorate.Nick Davies. \\"Police 'ignored News of the World phone hacking evidence'\\". The Guardian. 4 April 2010. The reason the investigation was passed to Hayman and Clarke, was that Hayman's command included the Protection Command, under whom SO14 provide all Royalty Protection. Clarke's investigation began as a localised incident involving staff at Clarence House, but the compiled list of possible victims broadened to include: Government ministers; a Member of Parliament; military chiefs; a leading media figure; Premiership footballers; and celebrities. Clarke's investigation team searched the London office of the News of the World, eventually concluding that the compromised voice mail accounts belonged to Prince William's aides, including Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, and not the Prince himself. Goodman and Mulcaire trial On 8 August 2006, Clarke's team arrested three men, including Goodman and former footballer turned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. After releasing the third man, in consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, Goodman and Mulcaire were charged with hacking the telephones of members of the royal family by accessing voicemail messages, an offence under section 79 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. Goodman was subsequently suspended by the paper. In September 2006 lawyers for News of the World parent company Newsgroup Newspapers told the police that During the subsequent court hearing, the jury were told that Goodman and Mulcaire made a total of 609 calls to the royal staff members' numbers, with Goodman making 487 calls, while Mulcaire made 122 calls. Over this period, the News of the World had paid Mulcaire ¬£104,988 for his services, on top of which Goodman had additionally paid Mulcaire ¬£12,300 in cash between 9 November 2005 and 7 August 2006, hiding Mulcaire's identity by using the code name Alexander on his expenses sheet. The court heard that Mulcaire had also hacked into the messages of: supermodel Elle Macpherson; publicist Max Clifford; MP Simon Hughes; football agent Skylet Andrew; and the Professional Footballers' Association's Gordon Taylor. On 26 January 2007, Mr Justice Gross jailed Goodman for four months, having previously pleaded guilty to the charges. His associate and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, was imprisoned for six months. On the same day, it was announced that Andy Coulson had resigned as the editor of the News of the World a fortnight earlier. He was immediately replaced by former Sunday Mirror editor and previously executive editor of the New York Post, Colin Myler, hired by News International Chairman Les Hinton. Unfair dismissal claim Goodman subsequently filed an unfair dismissal claim against News Group Newspapers Limited, his former employer and the publisher of The Sun and The News of the World. Goodman started his claim against his former employer, engaging defence lawyer John Kelsey-Fry, on the grounds that the practice of phone hacking was widespread at the newspaper group. To defend their case, News International hired London-based media specialist solicitors Harbottle & Lewis. During its work for News International, Harbottle & Lewis took possession of hundreds of internal emails. In a letter dated 29 May 2007, sent to News International head of legal affairs Jon Chapman, Lawrence Abramson of Harbottle & Lewis wrote that: This letter was subsequently used by various News International executives in their defence during a parliamentary investigation into phone hacking in 2009. Chapman then wrote to News International chairman Les Hinton, that the company was likely to lose the case filed by Goodman, based on grounds of failing to follow specified contractual employment law procedure. This could result in a payment of ¬£60,600 to Goodman, plus his notice period. Hinton hence authorised an out of court settlement to Goodman, covering the sum indicated by Chapman, plus Goodman's legal costs. After settlement of Goodman's case, a similar amount was authorised to Mulcaire after he also started legal action, again settled out of court on Hinton's authorisation.

State Street, Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  History  The building was built in 1868 by Barclay Smith to house a new financial venture, The Newtown Banking Company. Smith was a member of Wrightstown Friends Meeting and an organizer of the First National Bank of Newtown in 1864. The Newtown Banking Company financed The Philadelphia and Newtown Railroad, a Newtown based railroad company who built rails from Philadelphia to Newtown. Opening the Newtown station to the public in 1878, they had a goal of extending rail lines to New York, but lost to a competing company based in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. The competitor extended a rail line from Langhorne that made the connection to New York by joining the Jersey Central at Bound Brook.

Columbus opened its 2012 campaign against the Colorado Rapids at Dick's Sporting Goods Park on March 10, 2012.  Background   Review  http://massivereportdata.com/season/2012 The Crew missed the playoffs in 2012 for the first time since 2007, marking a further step backwards from the height of 2008. The roster moves which took place leading into the season were ultimately unsuccessful, with both high-profile signings - Milovan Mirosevic and Olman Vargas - playing only a single season for the club. The lackluster performance of Vargas and Mirosevic led the team to a series of midseason signings, which nearly salvaged the season. Costa Rican forward Jairo Arrieta joined the team in June, while Argentine midfielder Federico Higuain signed a Designated Player contract a month later. The tandem revitalized the Crew's offense, leading to a 4-game winning streak and thoughts of post-season glory. After this initial honeymoon, however, the team's performance declined; the team just missed out on a playoff berth. After the season, coach Robert Warzycha began yet another rebuilding effort, jettisoning several veteran players including William Hesmer, Sebastian Miranda and Emilio Renteria. The year's most significant event, however, had nothing to do with on-field performance. Rookie midfielder Kirk Urso collapsed and died on August 5 from a genetic heart defect (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy), providing an emotional rallying cry for the remainder of the season and beyond.

After participating in the Mutiny on the Bounty on 28 April 1789, he was court-martialed at Spithead in September 1792, sentenced to death, but escaped the hangman's noose after his conviction was overturned on appeal. He returned to active service in the British navy, and likely perished in 1797 aboard HMS Bellerophon. Mutiny On the books of the Bounty, Muspratt is listed not only as an able seaman but also as the ship's tailor. His status as a craftsman did not grant any special privileges and, like the other AB's of the ship's crew, Muspratt was subject to the discipline of the ship's captain, William Bligh. Upon the Bounty's landfall in Tahiti in late 1788, Muspratt soon fell afoul of his commanding officers and was sentenced in December to endure a dozen lashes with the cat o' nine tails for \\"neglect of duty.\\" The seaman appears to have responded to this treatment by attempting to desert the ship, for on 5 January 1789, he absconded with two shipmates. All were recaptured and Muspratt was re-sentenced to four dozen additional lashes. Soon after the Bounty made sail for the West Indies in early 1789, the mutiny occurred. Witnesses later testified that Muspratt was armed during the take- over with a musket, which he never used nor fired. The mutineer left the Bounty when it again called at Tahiti and did not accompany the inner core of the mutineers to their eventual destination in the Pitcairn Islands. Bligh had meanwhile returned to England and written out descriptions of the mutineers; from this record we learn that Muspratt was \\"5 feet 6 inches high. Dark complexion, brown hair, slender made. Very strong black beard under his scarred chin. Tattooed in several places.\\" When HMS Pandora arrived in Tahiti to try to recapture those mutineers that could be found, Muspratt was among those recaptured and returned to England to stand trial for mutiny. One key element in the outcome of this trial was that Muspratt, although a common seaman, was able to find an attorney to defend him. Although eyewitness testimony depicted the seaman as having been armed during the mutiny, and he was convicted and sentenced to death, he was able to successfully appeal his conviction and return to the ranks. His subsequent service was short, however. His will, probated in January 1798, indicated that his service ended aboard HMS Bellerophon, a ship of the line.

Marvel Comics. April 1, 2010 Writer Matt Fraction created Detroit Steel to embody jingoistic patriotism in the vein of Team America, and describes the character thus: > He is what follows in the hole left behind by Iron Man once Tony Stark > leaves the world stage. Tony hasn't been around to protect the regular > interests that he might have during his time running Stark Industries or > running S.H.I.E.L.D.

Basically, Iron Man's > worst nightmare of what he could become. An absolute perversion of > everything he is. Though the Detroit Steel armor exhibits the American flag's colors, Fraction states that the Detroit Steel armor can repainted to reflect the colors of whatever country or corporation purchases them, from the Japanese Rising Sun Flag (which makes an appearance in The Invincible Iron Man #27) to the yellow and red colors of McDonald's. Fraction also contrasts Detroit Steel with Iron Man's Bleeding Edge armor, which debuted in the same issue, by describing the latter as \\"sleeker, slicker and pared down\\", whereas the former is \\"bigger and better and boisterous and loud and noisy and everything else. It's like the difference between a Porsche and a Mack Truck\\". Fictional history Former United States Air Force Lieutenant Doug Johnson III is the first pilot of the Detroit Steel armor, first appearing during the \\"Stark Resilient\\" storyline. He underwent surgical modifications in order to operate the weaponized suit, and also trained the other pilots in the Steelcorps army. Hammer Industries, led by Justine Hammer and Sasha Hammer, not only wish revenge for patriarch Justin Hammer's death but see Tony Stark as an obstacle for their product Detroit Steel which they hope to market globally as a new soldier for the world. They also both desire revenge against Stark, whom they blame for the loss of Justin. Justine and Sasha embark on a campaign to discredit Iron Man in the industrial market, conspiring with a corrupt Pentagon General Babbage, and staging civilian attacks in which Detroit Steel is arranged to intervene before Iron Man. When confronted about her operations, Sasha attacks with her own biotech weapons with which Zeke augmented her body before being arrested, revealing her criminal intent to both Iron Man and Rescue. Shortly after, Detroit Steel launches a surprise attack on Stark Resilient by orchestrating a remote-server air-strike unwittingly piloted by young gamers on their mobile devices, who are unaware these actions were actually taking place in the real world. The combined efforts of Iron Man, War Machine, Rescue and Maria Hill are able to stop the strike and shut down Detroit Steel. When the Hammers use their connections to arrange Zeke's secret release, Sasha introduces Zeke to her father's employ.

The Detroit Steel suit allows its users to fly, and usually is seen with a rotary cannon mounted on its right arm, and a specialized chainsaw on its left, which can penetrate Iron Man's Bleeding Edge Armor. There are rocket-powered munitions on the suit's shoulders. The rotary cannon can be dismounted so that the soldier can carry and fire it as a traditional handheld weapon, and the Detroit Steel armor's users have been seen outfitted with other types of weapons in this manner, including both directed-energy weapons and scaled-up rifles.

Light grey and streaky silicious limestone. Heavy Neolithic (alternatively, Gigantolithic) is a style of large stone and flint tools (or industry) associated primarily with the Qaraoun culture in the Beqaa Valley, Lebanon, dating to the Epipaleolithic or early Pre-Pottery Neolithic at the end of the Stone Age. The type site for the Qaraoun culture is Qaraoun II.Cauvin, Jacques. and Cauvin, Marie-Claire., Des ateliers \\"campigniens\\" au Liban. pp. 103-116 in M. Mazi√©res (ed.) La pr√©histoire probl√©me et tendances. Hommabge √° Raymond Vaufrey. √âditions CNRS, Paris, 1968. Naming The term \\"Heavy Neolithic\\" was translated by Lorraine Copeland and Peter J. Wescombe from Henri Fleisch's term \\"gros Neolithique\\", suggested by Dorothy Garrod (in a letter dated February 1965) for adoption to describe the particular flint industry that was identified at sites near Qaraoun in the Beqaa Valley.Fleisch, Henri, Nouvelles stations pr√©historiques au Liban, BSPF, vol. 51, pp. 564-565, 1954. The industry was also termed \\"Gigantolithic\\" and confirmed as Neolithic by Alfred Rust and Dorothy Garrod. Characteristics Gigantolithic was initially mistaken for Acheulean or Levalloisian by some scholars. Diana Kirkbride and Henri de Contenson suggested that it existed over a wide area of the fertile crescent. Heavy Neolithic industry occurred before the invention of pottery and is characterized by huge, coarse, heavy tools such as axes, picks and adzes including bifaces. There is no evidence of polishing at the Qaraoun sites or indeed of any arrowheads, burins or millstones. Henri Fleisch noted that the culture that produced this industry may well have led a forest way of life before the dawn of agriculture.Fleisch, Henri, Les industries lithiques r√©centes de la B√©kaa, R√©publique Libanaise, Acts of the 6th C.I.S.E.A., vol. XI, no. 1, Paris, 1960. Jacques Cauvin proposed that some of the sites discovered may have been factories or workshops as many artifacts recovered were rough outs.Cauvin, Jacques., Le n√©olithique de Mouchtara (Liban-Sud), L'Anthropologie, vol. 67, 5-6, p. 509, 1963. James Mellaart suggested the industry dated to a period before the Pottery Neolithic at Byblos (10,600 to 6900 BC according to the ASPRO chronology) and noted \\"Aceramic cultures have not yet been found in excavations but they must have existed here as it is clear from Ras Shamra and from the fact that the Pre-Pottery B complex of Palestine originated in this area, just as the following Pottery Neolithic cultures can be traced back to the Lebanon.\\"Mellaart, James, Earliest Civilizations in the Near East, p. 46, Thames and Hudson, London, 1965. Maya Haidar Boustani has called for discussion on the chronological problem when reliable data on the flint workshops becomes available. She looked towards the work of Ron Barkai and H. Taute as being of possible use in this research.Barkai, Ron., Make my axe: flint axe production and resharpening at EPPNB Nahal Lavan 109. pp. 73-92 in I. Canneva, C. Lemorini, D. Zampetti and P.

A notable stratified excavation of Heavy Neolithic material took place at Adloun II (Bezez Cave), conducted by Diana Kirkbride and Dorothy Garrod. Materials extracted from the upper layers were however disturbed. The morphology of the tools has noted similarities to the Campignian industry in France. Due to the disturbance of the upper layers and lack of radiocarbon dating or the materials at the time of this excavation, the placement of the Qaroun culture into the chronology of the ancient Near East remains undetermined from these excavations. The industry has been found at surface stations in the Beqaa Valley and on the seaward side of the mountains. Heavy Neolithic sites were found near sources of flint and were thought to be factories or workshops where large, coarse flint tools were roughed out to work and chop timber. Chisels, flake scrapers and picks were also found with little, if any sign of arrowheads, sickles (except for Orange slices) or pottery. Finds of waste and debris at the sites were usually plentiful, normally consisting of Orange slices, thick and crested blades, discoid, cylindrical, pyramidal or Levallois cores. Andrew Moore suggested that many of the sites were used as flint factories that complimented settlements in the surrounding hills. The identification of Heavy Neolithic sites in Lebanon was complicated by the fact that the assemblages found at these sites included tools made with all techniques used during earlier periods. Bifaces are found both with and without a cortex, along with grattoir de cote, triangular flakes, tortoise cores, discoid cores and steep scrapers. This presented particular problems with sites where Heavy Neolithic material was mixed with that from the Lower Paleolithic and Middle Paleolithic, such as at Mejdel Anjar I and Dakoue. Although tools similar to Heavy Neolithic ones were found at later Neolithic surfaces sites, little relationship could be established between those found at the later Neolithic tells, where flints were often sparse, especially at those of later dates. The relationship and dividing line between the related Shepherd Neolithic zone of the north Bekaa Valley could also not be clearly defined but was suggested to be in the area around Douris and Qalaat Tannour. Not enough exploration has been carried out yet to conclude whether the bands of Neolithic surface sites continues north into the areas around Zahle and Rayak. Sites Apart from the type site, Qaraoun II, other sites with Heavy Neolithic finds include Qaraoun I, Adloun II, Akbiyeh, Beit Mery II, Dikwene II, Hadeth South, Jbaa, Jebel Aabeby, Jdeideh I, Jdeideh III, Mtaileb I (Rabiya), Ourrouar II, Sin el Fil, Sarafand, Tell Mureibit near Kasimiyeh, Fadaous Sud, Baidar ech Chamout, Kfar Tebnit, Wadi Koura, Wadi Yaroun and other suggested sites at Flaoui, Sidon III, the Akkar plain foothills and the Plain of Zghorta.

Facts During a strike, Glasbrook Brothers (the owners of a colliery) requested police protection in the form of a body of officers quartered on the premises; though the police only had the resources to make visiting patrols, they offered to place constables in exchange for a financial contribution. After the strike, the police presented the colliery with a bill for the provided services; the colliery refused to pay and so the police sued. The issue before the court was whether the police authority had provided fresh consideration for Glasbrook Bros' promise to pay. Judgment The colliery owners repudiated liability on the grounds that there was no consideration for the promise to pay for the police protection and that such an agreement was against public policy. The case was tried by Mr. Justice Bailhache and he entered judgment for the Plaintiffs, saying :‚Äî \\"There is an obligation on the police to afford efficient protection, but if an individual asks for special protection in a particular form, for the special protection so asked for in that particular form, the individual must pay.\\" This decision was affirmed by a majority on the appeal (Bankes, L.J. and Scrutton, L.J.; Atkin, L.J. dissenting). The colliery owners now appeal and ask that judgment should be entered for them. It appears to me that there is nothing in the first point made for the colliery owners that there was no consideration for the promise. It is clear that there was abundant consideration. The police authorities thought that it would be best to give protection by means of a flying column of police, but the colliery owners wanted the \\"garrison\\" and promised to pay for it if it was sent. Significance It has long been accepted that where a party merely does something by which he is already legally bound this can never be sufficient to amount to consideration for an entirely fresh agreement. This basic rule can be seen in operation in Collins v Godfrey [1831] 109 1040. Glasbrook Bros v Glamorgan County Council is the first major exception to the rule identified. It will be adequate consideration where what is given is more than could have been expected from performance of the existing duty, where in fact something extra is added to what the claimant is already bound to do. The extra element is the consideration for the new promise. This principle will apply where public duty is exceeded as seen in this case. See also Stilk v Myrick The Glamorgan Coal Company v.

The construction Applying the Haj√≥s construction to two copies of by identifying a vertex from each copy into a single vertex (shown with both colors), deleting an edge incident to the combined vertex within each subgraph (dashed) and adding a new edge connecting the endpoints of the deleted edges (thick green), produces the Moser spindle. Let and be two undirected graphs, be an edge of , and be an edge of . Then the Haj√≥s construction forms a new graph that combines the two graphs by identifying vertices and into a single vertex, removing the two edges and , and adding a new edge . For example, let and each be a complete graph on four vertices; because of the symmetry of these graphs, the choice of which edge to select from each of them is unimportant. In this case, the result of applying the Haj√≥s construction is the Moser spindle, a seven-vertex unit distance graph that requires four colors. As another example, if and are cycle graphs of length and respectively, then the result of applying the Haj√≥s construction is itself a cycle graph, of length . Constructible graphs A graph is said to be -constructible (or Haj√≥s--constructible) when it formed in one of the following three ways:. *The complete graph is -constructible. *Let and be any two -constructible graphs. Then the graph formed by applying the Haj√≥s construction to and is -constructible. *Let be any -constructible graph, and let and be any two non-adjacent vertices in . Then the graph formed by combining and into a single vertex is also -constructible. Equivalently, this graph may be formed by adding edge to the graph and then contracting it. Connection to coloring It is straightforward to verify that every -constructible graph requires at least colors in any proper graph coloring. Indeed, this is clear for the complete graph , and the effect of identifying two nonadjacent vertices is to force them to have the same color as each other in any coloring, something that does not reduce the number of colors. In the Haj√≥s construction itself, the new edge forces at least one of the two vertices and to have a different color than the combined vertex for and , so any proper coloring of the combined graph leads to a proper coloring of one of the two smaller graphs from which it was formed, which again causes it to require colors. Haj√≥s proved more strongly that a graph requires at least colors, in any proper coloring, if and only if it contains a -constructible graph as a subgraph. Equivalently, every -critical graph (a graph that requires colors but for which every proper subgraph requires fewer colors) is -constructible.A proof can also be found in . Alternatively, every graph that requires colors may be formed by combining the Haj√≥s construction, the operation of identifying any two nonadjacent vertices, and the operations of adding a vertex or edge to the given graph, starting from the complete graph ., p. 184. A similar construction may be used for list coloring in place of coloring.; . Constructibility of critical graphs For , every -critical graph (that is, every odd cycle) can be generated as a -constructible graph such that all of the graphs formed in its construction are also -critical. For , this is not true: a graph found by as a counterexample to Haj√≥s's conjecture that -chromatic graphs contain a subdivision of , also serves as a counterexample to this problem. Subsequently, -critical but not -constructible graphs solely through -critical graphs were found for all . For , one such example is the graph obtained from the dodecahedron graph by adding a new edge between each pair of antipodal vertices. The Haj√≥s number Because merging two non-adjacent vertices reduces the number of vertices in the resulting graph, the number of operations needed to represent a given graph using the operations defined by Haj√≥s may exceed the number of vertices in . alludes to this when he writes that the sequence of operations is \\"not always short\\". , 11.6 Length of Haj√≥s proofs, pp. 184‚Äì185, state as an open problem the question of determining the smallest number of steps needed to construct every -vertex graph. More specifically, define the Haj√≥s number of a -chromatic graph to be the minimum number of steps needed to construct from , where each step forms a new graph by combining two previously formed graphs, merging two nonadjacent vertices of a previously formed graph, or adding a vertex or edge to a previously formed graph. They showed that, for an -vertex graph with edges, . If every graph has a polynomial Haj√≥s number, this would imply that it is possible to prove non-colorability in nondeterministic polynomial time, and therefore imply that NP = co-NP, a conclusion considered unlikely by complexity theorists.. However, it is not known how to prove non-polynomial lower bounds on the Haj√≥s number without making some complexity-theoretic assumption, and if such a bound could be proven it would also imply the existence of non-polynomial bounds on certain types of Frege system in mathematical logic. The minimum size of an expression tree describing a Haj√≥s construction for a given graph may be significantly larger than the Haj√≥s number of , because a shortest expression for may re-use the same graphs multiple times, an economy not permitted in an expression tree. There exist 3-chromatic graphs for which the smallest such expression tree has exponential size.. Other applications used the Haj√≥s construction to generate an infinite set of 4-critical polyhedral graphs, each having more than twice as many edges as vertices. Similarly, used the construction, starting with the Gr√∂tzsch graph, to generate many 4-critical triangle-free graphs, which they showed to be difficult to color using traditional backtracking algorithms. In polyhedral combinatorics, used the Haj√≥s construction to generate facets of the stable set polytope. Notes References *. *. *. *. *. As cited by . *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *.

They became established in Florence during the 13th century with judge Rustico Alberti and divided into different lines, who owned several houses and towers near the modern Ponte alle Grazie. Due to their Guelph allegiance, they were exiled after the Battle of Montaperti, but returned after Manfred of Sicily's defeat in the battle of Benevento (1266). They subsequently sided for the Black Guelph faction, and established a flourishing trade company with agencies at Bologna, Genoa, Venice, Barcelona, Paris, Ghent, Brussels, Bruges and London, as well as in Syria and Greece. In 1378, the Alberti were again banned for their support of the Ciompi revolt. Some of them were admitted in the Venetian nobility late in the century. Returned to Florence, in the 15th century they were first allied to the Medici against the Albizzi.

A professional soldier, he saw active service during both World Wars. Leeb's older brother was Field Marshal Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb. First World War Leeb entered Army service on 7 July 1901. He attended the War School in Munich, the Bavarian Artillery & Engineer School, and then the Bavarian War Academy. Before and during World War I, Leeb served as an adjutant in artillery units and then was appointed a General Staff officer. Leeb was promoted to captain on 1 June 1915. In June 1917, he was transferred to the General staff in the XVth Royal Bavarian Reserve Corps and an infantry division. Leeb participated in battles around Lorraine, Northern France, Galicia, the Carpathian Mountains, Flanders and the German withdrawal from Northern France. Leeb's older brother, Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb, had the knightly rank of \\"Ritter\\" and the nobiliary particle of \\"von\\", not by birth, but thanks to the conferment of the Bavarian Military Order of Max Joseph and a patent of nobility. Hence, the older brother had ‚Äúvon‚Äù between his names, but the younger brother did not. Interwar period Remaining in the downsized Reichswehr after the end of the war in November 1918, during 1919 Leeb served as a staff officer with the 4th Bavarian Field Artillery Regiment, the Detachment Hierl (Freikorps), the 24th Reichswehr Brigade, Niederwerfung des Spartacus Aufstandes in Bavaria, before a posting to the German War Ministry (1 October 1919 ‚Äì 1 October 1921), an artillery regiment (1 October 1921 ‚Äì 1 October 1924), and the War Academy (7th Division) in Munich (1924 - 1 October 1928). He was promoted to Major on 1 February 1925. Between 1929 and 1933, Leeb served as commander of the Mountain Transport and Observation Squadron in Landsberg. He became a supply officer (Provision Matters) in the War Ministry (1 April 1933 ‚Äì 1 April 1936), before promotion to Generalmajor on 1 July 1935, and later was given command of the 15th Infantry Division (1 April 1936 ‚Äì 1 April 1939) at Frankfurt-am-Main. After promotion to Generalleutnant in early 1937, he became Commanding General of the XI Army Corps (1 April 1939 ‚Äì 16 April 1940) in Hanover, where he was responsible for recruiting, training, and mobilization. During this period he was promoted to General of the Artillery (1 April 1939) and also became commander of Military District XI (1 April 1939 ‚Äì 31 August 1939). Second World War Leeb took part in the invasion of Poland, with his XI Corps attacking towards Warsaw. He initially reported to Walther von Reichenau of the 10th Army, before his unit formed the left wing of Reichenau's drive towards ≈Å√≥d≈∫. Later, his unit was transferred to Johannes Blaskowitz's 8th Army in its attack from the east- central region of Germany into west-central Poland, before sweeping on towards Warsaw. On 15 April 1940, Leeb became Chief of the Waffenamt (Army Ordnance Weapons Depot) at the War Ministry in Berlin (15 April 1940 ‚Äì 1 January 1945). His predecessor, Karl Becker, had committed suicide because he was unable to properly supply the field units with ammunition. During this period, Leeb also served as an advisor to the Works Company for Weapons and Mechanical Engineering, which was directed by Hermann G√∂ring in Berlin (17 January 1941 ‚Äì 29 December 1942), and he then served as a member of the Armaments Advisory Service (December 1942 - 1 May 1945). In late 1944, Leeb's section became part of Heinrich Himmler's Replacement Army. Leeb retired on 1 May 1945, the day following Adolf Hitler's death.

(The car is sometimes referred to as the 380 K, presumably because of the Kompressor (supercharger) fitted on the faster cars, but this designation was never officially used by the manufacturer.) In 1933, the 380 sports tourer was one of the most advanced cars on the market, and was duly admired although in the end, with only 154 produced over two years, it proved in some respects a resounding failure.Oswald, p 246. Engines The engines started out as the straight-eight from the car's predecessor, but the side-valves in the earlier car were now replaced by overhead valves. A new two-barrel carburetor was also fitted. More newsworthy was the availability of a Kompressor, which instantly established the car's credentials as technologically advanced,. in common with other luxury cars of the period, such as the Duesenberg SJ and Cord 810. The least powerful version carried the engine code \\"M22\\". It came without a compressor and provided a listed maximum output of at 3,200 rpm. This supported a claimed top speed of 120 km/h (75 mph).Oswald, p 247 Adding a supercharger raised the maximum output to at 3,400 rpm and top speed to 130 km/h (81 mph). The car was also available with an \\"Integrated Kompressor\\" (mit integriertem Kompressor) which changed the engine code to \\"M22K\\" and further raised the maximum power to , now at 3,600 rpm. Top speed was 135 km/h (84 mph) or 145 km/h (90 mph), depending on the final drive ratio fitted. Running gear This was the first Mercedes-Benz to use an independent suspension setup, with a double wishbone front axle, double-joint swing axle at the rear, and separate wheel location, coil springs and damping. The W22 series had a four-speed manual gearbox with synchromesh on the top two ratios. The brakes operated on all four wheels via a hydraulic control mechanism. The headlights were manufactured by Carl Zeiss and sit each side of the radiator grille, set behind the chrome Rudge Whitworth wire wheels. Bodies In bare chassis form the listed price of the W22 was 13,000 Marks and many buyers will have chosen to buy a car body separately from a bespoke coach builder. Cars using any one of the six standard Mercedes-Benz bodies were all listed at 19,500 Marks. A four-door \\"Limousine\\" (sedan/saloon) body was offered along with a traditional Torpedo bodied 2 door ‚ÄúTourenwagen‚Äù. There was a \\"Sport- Roadster\\" and three different cabriolet bodied cars, designated the \\"Cabriolet A\\", the \\"Cabriolet B\\" and the \\"Cabriolet C\\". The principal differences involved the number of seats (2 or 4) and the number of side windows (2 or 4). Commercial The Mercedes-Benz W22 was widely admired for its advanced high performance engine, for its sophisticated independent suspension and for the stylish elegance of the bodies. Its handling characteristics were infinitely superior to those of high powered cars from competitor manufacturers who were still using rigid axle based suspension configurations. However, this led to calls for still more raw speed, and in 1934 the 380/W22 was replaced by the 500K (W29) a slightly larger car with a significantly larger engine and, where a Kompressor was specified, of power.Oswald, pp 246 & 266 After less than two years, production of the Typ 380 ceased, with 154 built. Just seven were lightweight, open, two-seat sporting roadsters bodied by Mercedes-Benz‚Äôs own Sindelfingen coachworks.

Mega Shark of Malibu) is a 2009 TV film, directed by David Lister and produced for the Syfy channel. It is the 19th film in the Maneater Series. Plot Heather (Peta Wilson) is the head-lifeguard on a Malibu beach, alongside her ex-boyfriend Chavez (Warren Christie), Doug (Remi Broadway) and Barb (Sonya Salomaa). Also on the beach are Jenny (Chelan Simmons), a teenage girl who is reluctantly cleaning the beach for community service after she got caught shoplifting, and Bryan (Nicholas G. Cooper), Barb's boyfriend who proposes to her. Meanwhile, a tremor unleashes a group of Living fossil goblin sharks who begin to devour swimmers along the beach. Chavez travels to a nearby house that is undergoing construction and meets with the workers Colin (Jeffery Gannon), who is Heather's new boyfriend, George (Mungo McKay), Yancey (Renee Bowen) and Karl (Evert McQueen). A warning of a tsunami arises and Chavez returns to the beach, saving Heather who had been knocked into the water by a shark after being sent to investigate some people causing trouble in the water. Doug and Barb evacuate the beach, and take shelter in the lifeguard hut with Heather, Chavez, Jenny and Bryan. As the tsunami hits, Bryan is knocked unconscious and Jenny suffers a large cut on her leg. Heather manages to stitch the cut together; however, the blood attracts the goblin sharks, and the group realize they are stranded in the hut, with help unlikely due to the damage the tsunami has created. The sharks soon begin to attack the hut and manage to break the floor, dragging Barb out and devouring her. As the group mourn Barb's death, the construction crew have become stranded in the house where they were working. Yancey decides to try to swim to land and get help; however, she is quickly attacked and eaten by sharks. Then a shark jumps up and drags Karl into the water. Soon after, Colin and George discover a boat and begin to travel to the hut. Back at the hut, the group manage to kill one of the sharks, and Chavez swims out of the hut to retrieve a flare gun. The others attempt to distract the sharks, but one attempts to eat Chavez, resulting in him shooting and killing the shark with the flare gun, instead of summoning help. Chavez returns, and the group move up to the roof as the sharks continue to damage the hut. Colin and George arrive on the boat and everyone boards, but the fuel soon runs out, forcing them to drift to land. After hours, the boat reaches the house that was under construction. The boat becomes stuck on a gate, so George enters the site to try to find pliers to open the gate. As the rest wait, the sharks arrive. Bryan jumps into the water, sacrificing himself so the rest can escape. Doug, Jenny and Colin manage to get into the flooded house and encounter a shark but manage to kill it, while Heather and Chavez discover a half eaten George, before taking shelter in a car, where they reconcile. Chavez kills another shark, before entering the house with Heather. The group meet up, and manage to trap and kill the final shark.

The population is mainly composed of the contribution of people from the Netherlands, India, Africa, China and Indonesia, as well as indigenous peoples who lived in the area, before the arrival of European settlers. Cultural events * New Year's Eve * Holi-Phagwa * Easter * Labour Day * Indian Arrival Day * Keti Koti * Javanese Arrival Day * Indigenous People's Day * Day of the Maroons * Chinese Arrival Day * Independence Day * Christmas Music Suriname is a South American country, a former colony of the Netherlands. The country is known for its kaseko music, and for having an Indo-Caribbean tradition. The term kaseko is probably derived from the French expression casser le corps (break the body), which was used during slavery to indicate a very swift dance. Kaseko is a fusion of numerous popular and folk styles derived from Africa, Europe and the Americas. It is rhythmically complex, with percussion instruments including skratji (a very large bass drum) and snare drums, as well as saxophone, trumpet and occasionally trombone. Singing can be both solo and choir. Songs are typically call-and- response, as are Creole folk styles from the area, such as kawina. Kaseko emerged from the traditional Surinamese Creole kawina music, which was played since the beginning of 1900 by Creole street musicians in Paramaribo. It evolved in the 1930s during festivities that used large bands, especially brass bands, and was called Bigi Pokoe (big drum music). Following World War II, jazz, calypso and other importations became popular, while rock and roll soon left its own influence in the form of electrified instruments. Cuisine A Surinamese \\"broodje bakeljauw\\" in the Netherlands (bun with shredded and spiced stockfish), with a chili paste made from Madame Jeanette peppers on the side Surinamese cuisine is extensive, since the population of Suriname came from many countries. Surinamese cuisine is a combination of many international cuisines including Indian, African, Javanese (Indonesian), Chinese, Dutch, Jewish, Portuguese, and Amerindian cuisines. This has ensured that Surinamese cooking has spawned many dishes; the different groups were influenced by each other's dishes and ingredients; this new Surinamese cuisine included roti, nasi goreng, bami, pom, (, moksi meti, and (; because of this blending of many cultures, Surinamese cuisine is a unique creation. Basic foods include rice, plants such as tayer and cassava, and roti. Usually, there is chicken on the menu in many variations of the Chinese , the Indian chicken masala and pom, a very popular party dish of Creole origin. Also, salted meat and stockfish (bakkeljauw) are widely used. Yardlong beans, okra, and eggplant are examples of vegetables in the Surinamese kitchen. For a spicy taste, Madame Jeanette peppers are used. Besides the casserole pom, roti (often served with a filling of chicken masala, potato and vegetables) is also often served on festive occasions with many guests. Other well known dishes are moksi-alesi (mixed boiled rice with salted meat, shrimp or fish, and any vegetable), rice and beans, peanut soup, battered fried plantain, bara and the original Javanese nasi goreng and mie goreng. Desserts include boyo, a sweet cake made with coconut and cassava, and fiadu, a cake containing raisins, currants, almonds, and succade. Maizena koek are cornstarch cookies made with vanilla.

He is best known as a multi-year international artistic pool champion, as both an individual and team captain. He has also served as an officer for the Polizia di Stato (Italy's national police) for 27 years, retiring from police work in 2011, then moving to Las Vegas, Nevada to play pool full-time. Pelinga has served as a board member of the International Artistic Poolplayers Association (IAPA). He was the featured player on the cover of the May 2010 issue of Billiards Digest magazine, which named him one of the world's best trick shot artists. He has been nicknamed \\"Mr. Trick Shots\\" and \\"Il Maestro\\" (\\"The Master\\"). Aside from competition, Pelinga performs exhibitions, organizes competitions and raises funds for a variety of charitable organizations with his personal appearances. He was invited to tour in the USA with Paul Gerni, Norway's Lars Riiber, and Japan's Yoshikazu Kimura, and nominated by Paul Gerni for a spot on ESPN's Trick Shot Magic, where he has been featured for over ten years. He won two Trick Shot Magic events, in 2005 and 2007, after a few second places. In addition to having won several international titles, Pelinga has also produced a series of instructional videos, and he was appointed on January 31, 2000, as official instructor of cue sports by the Italian Federation of Billiard Sports (FIBiS) and the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI). He was also awarded the honorary title of Professor of Sport Games by the University of Kharkov (Ukraine). Pelinga has a large repertoire of trick shots and is able to execute over 1,000 unique and \\"fancy\\" shots. He is recognized as one of the greatest trick shot champions in the history of the sport, and has earned a spot in ESPN's Trick Shot Magic Hall of Fame. In 2012, Pelinga was inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame. Pelinga is represented by (and in turn represents, as co-founder and Western & International Executive Manager) the booking agent Billiards Superstars Promotions, who also represent Paul Gerni, Allison Fisher, Mike Massey, Ewa Laurance and other top pool pros. Early life Pelinga began to play pool at age 12, drawing inspiration from his favorite singer and actor, Dean Martin, whom he emulates in various parts of his life. He has also stated and exhibited his Dean Martin memorabilia collection, which includes \\"every applicable book and record album, plus publicity photos, newspaper and magazine clippings, novelty statuettes, comic books, and even a copy of Dino's death certificate.\\" He also cites Paul Gerni, Mike Massey and Yoshikazu Kimura as influences. While he was a teenager, he \\"became a black belt in Kung Fu and then...switched to boxing...for several years.\\" During his years in university, he focused his studies on foreign languages, specifically English. Pelinga began serving as a police officer in the beginning of 1985. He became a member of the Polizia di Stato (Italian Federal Police) for the Calabria region after six months of police training. A part of the Reparto volanti group, he continued to serve even while pursuing his billiards career until 2011, when he retired from police work with pension. Pro pool career Pelinga won several national titles in Italy in straight pool and nine-ball throughout the late 1970s and 1980s and began traveling around Italy giving exhibitions under the sponsorship of Longoni Cues. In 1990, he asked Longoni if he would be allowed to meet Paul Gerni on his arrival at the airport in Rome, and that was their first meeting, Gerni's exhibition and TV documentary, and personal training from Gerni during that tour first got Pelinga interested in artistic pool, the formalized practice of trick shots. After speaking with Gerni and acting as his translator, Pelinga explained his interest in learning to become a professional trick shot artist. Gerni, in response, had Pelinga accompany him on a tour throughout the United States as a pseudo-apprenticeship. In 2003, he won the U.S. Open of Artistic Pool in New Bedford, Massachusetts, followed by another major title, the EPBF European Artistic Pool Championship in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 2004. In 2005 and 2007, Pelinga won the prestigious ESPN Trick Shot Magic title. In 2006, he competed in the first annual trans- Atlantic World Cup of Trick Shots, as captain of Team Europe, who lost to Team USA that year; his team won in 2007. In 2008, Pelinga competed in the second annual Showdown in Seoul, playing against World Three-cushion Billiards Champion from Turkey, Semih Saygƒ±ner in both artistic pool and artistic billiards. On October 29, 2009, he was a part of the fourth World Cup of Trick Shots on Team Europe, in which he and his team lost to their American counterparts. His European team won again in 2010 and 2011. He organized a \\"World Legends of Artistic Pool\\" event\\" in Kiev in 2006 to showcase trick shots, with the participation of the greatest contemporary trick shot champions. On November 17, 2012, Pelinga was inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame (NIASHF), based in Chicago, Illinois, becoming the second pool player in the history of the organization to be inducted, after Willie Mosconi.

Promundo's work engages women, girls, boys and men; strives to transform gender norms and power relations within key institutions; and is based on building local and international partnerships. It is an applied research institute that works to test, evaluate and advocate for policies and programs that transform masculinities. History Founded in 1997, Promundo was born out of frustration with the prevailing discourses about gender equality and efforts to put those discourses into action, practice and policy. The institute has concentrated on developing evaluated interventions and advocacy strategies to achieve gender equality with a focus on engaging men and boys in changing inequitable and violent forms of masculinities. Promundo works locally, nationally, and internationally to: *Conduct research to build the knowledge base on masculinities and gender equality; *Develop, evaluate and scale up gender transformative interventions and policies; *Carry out national and international advocacy to achieve gender equality and social justice. Promundo designs, implements, and evaluates its research and evidence-based programs in close partnership with local, not-for-profit Civil Society Organizations. In recent years, Promundo has been increasingly recognized for promoting the role of men and boys in achieving gender equality. Most recently, Promundo expanded its presence to Washington, DC, to support the organization‚Äôs international communication, advocacy and technical assistance, which include the coordination of the MenEngage Alliance, a global network of NGOs and UN partners working to engage men and boys in gender equality, of which Promundo was a co-founder. Main Programs and Activities Program H In 1999 Promundo, together with ECOS Comunica√ß√£o em Sexualidade (S√£o Paulo, Brazil), Instituto Papai (Recife, Brazil), and Salud y G√©nero (Mexico), with support from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the World Health Organization (WHO), International Planned Parenthood Federation/Western Hemisphere Region (IPPF/WHR), JohnSnowBrasil and Durex ‚Äì SSL International developed the Program H (H for and , the words for Men). The material was born in part of extensive community-based research, including the study Dying to be Men: Youth, Masculinity and Social Exclusion. Program H seeks to engage young men and their communities in critical reflections about rigid norms related to manhood. It includes group educational activities, community campaigns, and an innovative evaluation model, called Gender- Equitable Men or GEM scale, for assessing the program‚Äôs impact on gender- related attitudes. The approach was subjected to quasi-experimental impact evaluation studies in Brazil, India, the Balkans and several settings in Sub- Saharan Africa, and found to lead to significant changes in attitudes among young men, in addition to self-reported increases in condom use, increased in couple communication and reductions in men‚Äôs reports of use of violence against female partners. Program H has been acknowledged by the Pan American Health Organization, UNICEF, United Nations Population Fund, United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank and the Brazilian Ministry of External Relations as a best practice in promoting gender equality. Program M In 1999 Promundo in partnership with Ecos (S√£o Paulo), Instituto Papai (Recife), Salud y G√©nero (Mexico) and World Education (United States), with the support of the Oak Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, the Nike Foundation and the Brazilian Secretariat for Women‚Äôs Policies developed Program M (M for and , the words for Women). Program M seeks to promote the health and empowerment of young women through critical reflections about gender, rights and health. It consists of educational workshops, community campaigns and innovative evaluation instruments for assessing the program‚Äôs impact on young women‚Äôs gender-related attitudes and perceived self-efficacy in interpersonal relationships. White Ribbon Campaign In 2000 Promundo, Instituto Papai and other partner organizations launched the White Ribbon Campaign in Brazil. Promundo also works together Instituto Noos and the State Government of Rio de Janeiro to start one of Brazil‚Äôs first batterer intervention programs, which eventually inspired the Brazilian Federal Government to implement such programs in other states. Video Against Homophobia Because attitudes towards homophobia showed the least amount of attitude change in the study impact evaluation in Brazil, in 2005 Promundo, Ecos, Salud y G√©nero, Papai and the other Program H partners, with support from the Brazilian National AIDS Programme, developed a cartoon video called Afraid of What? as a complementary educational tool focusing specifically on the issue of homophobia, and targeting mostly heterosexual youth. Global Symposium on Engaging Men and Boys in Gender Equality Between March 30 and April 3, 2009, Promundo and partners co-hosted the Global Symposium on Engaging Men and Boys in Gender Equality in Rio de Janeiro. The event brought together 439 activists, researchers, and practitioners from 77 countries to share their experiences in challenging rigid gender norms and engaging men and boys in: reducing violence against women and girls; promoting sexual and reproductive health; HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment; and fatherhood and care-giving. The event was organized in collaboration with the MenEngage Alliance.

Campbell was born in Johannesburg to John William Wallace Campbell, an Australian Boer War veteran, and Antonette Cholette, n√©e Bleckmann. The younger Campbell, known as \\"Wal\\", came to Australia as an infant, and was a telegram delivery boy, a drover and a shearer. Ultimately he became a refrigerator mechanic. On 31 May 1940 Campbell enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, serving in the Middle East and Papua with the 2nd/4th Field Company of the Royal Australian Engineers. He was sent back to Australia in August 1943 after contracting malaria, and was discharged a sergeant on 23 October 1945. During his service in the Middle East, Campbell came to believe that Syrian Catholic priests had betrayed Allied forces after observing a man signalling from a monastery window, instilling in him the anti-Catholicism that would characterise the rest of his life. In January 1945 Campbell began publishing The Rock, a \\"brash eight-page tabloid\\", reporting on supposed corruption, sex scandals and intrigue inside the Catholic Church. By the 1950s, circulation of the paper was around 30,000, but it was never financially secure. Although it had considerable influence during the debate on government funding of religious schools, and in particular during the Labor Split of 1955, the paper gradually declined, especially after Vatican II. The death of Pope John Paul I in 1978 fuelled Campbell's beliefs of conspiracy within the church. He was arrested in 1978 after a disturbance at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, and he found himself out of place in a more modern world. The Rock, still running, became a monthly paper in the late 1970s, when Campbell moved to Calvert in Queensland. Campbell died in 1979 at Grandchester, Queensland, and was cremated with Reformed Presbyterian forms. He was unmarried. The Rock, though no longer possessing any of the influence it had enjoyed during the 1950s, published its final issue only in 1995.

the first fossil skull was excavated near Pikermi in Attica, Greece. Fossils were also excavated near the Moldovan city of Taraclia. F. attica was bigger in body size than a European wildcat but probably smaller than a serval. Due to size differences, it was proposed as type species for the genus Pristifelis proposed in 2012. Around 12 million years ago, the genus Felis evolved and eventually gave rise to many of the modern small cat species. Felis attica was a small lynx-like cat and one of the ancestors of the first modern Felis species, such as F. lunensis, which evolved around 2.5 million years ago during the Pliocene epoch.

Van Rensburg is a prolific artist with dozens of credits as composer, performer and producer. Career He established himself in South Africa in the mid '90s and has since traveled the world, performing and recording regularly in Taiwan, Japan and New York City. He is well known in South Africa as the founder of the group Supernature as well as acclaimed guitarist for the hugely successful industrial group Battery 9 from 1999 to 2004. His solo instrumental work is characterized by dissonance, non-predictable structures and the absence of traditional melodic or harmonic content. His solo guitar playing often utilizes extended techniques and string 'preparations', as in the prepared piano works of composer John Cage. He has been influenced by composers such as Morton Feldman, Giacinto Scelsi, Leo Brouwer, John Zorn and Pierre Boulez, and improvisors Derek Bailey, Fred Frith and Marc Ribot. Early life Andre van Rensburg grew up in South Africa and studied classical guitar from the age of 7. He started composing at the age of 10. After studying with various teachers he developed his own notational technique, blending traditional musical notation with abstract and graphic notation. In 1994 he moved to London and Paris, busking for a living. In 1995 he returned to South Africa, forming the group Supernature, who had a number one hit on Barney Simon's 5FM Alternative Chart with their first single \\"Devil\\" (1997). Supernature went on to record two albums. He then joined Brendan Jury and Warrick Sony's Trans.sky project as guitarist, later forming the group Ohm with Jury. Ohm went on to release an album through the British label M.E.L.T. 2000 and touring England and the Netherlands in 2000. In 1998 he moved to Johannesburg and joined the industrial group Battery 9, appearing on their album Sondebok, released by BMG in 1999. He also composed and recorded an album with Battery 9 front man Paul Riekert as Die Menere; the album Floukop was released by One F Music in 2004. Recent projects Van Rensburg moved to Asia in 2003, forming the recording label South of the Border, and released five solo albums: Concrete (2007), chamber music performed by the Poisondwarf Esemble; Unfinished Cities (2008), recorded in Japan and Taiwan with koto player Mori Chieko; Scopophilia (7 etudes for solo bondage guitar) (2008); Kopstukke Vol. 1 (the first in a series of nine albums of new compositions for classical guitar, 2011); and Game of the Voce (2011). In 2009 he collaborated with South African expats Louis Minnaar and Jean Marais (also known as MoShang) and released the album Eentonig through the Onse Plate label. He has recently scored music for award-winning Thai film director Pramotz Sangsorn and creates various sound installations internationally. In 2016 he relocated to Tokyo where he performs with various butoh dancers and other improvising musicians, including Tetuzi Akiyama.

He was the primary fundraiser for Tom Petters, who was convicted of organizing a $3.5 billion Ponzi scheme in Minnesota. Vennes was previously convicted on federal charges of money laundering, illegal firearm sales and cocaine distribution in 1987. He experienced a religious transformation while incarcerated and became a major political contributor and business leader after his release in 1990. Vennes' homes were raided by federal agents in connection with the Petters Ponzi scheme in 2008. In July 2011, he was charged with eight counts of securities fraud, six counts of wire fraud, three counts of money laundering, three counts of bank fraud, and two counts of mail fraud. On February 1, 2013, Vennes pleaded guilty to charges of securities fraud and money laundering and on October 18, 2013, he was sentenced to 15 years in Federal prison. Money laundering conviction Internal Revenue Service agents investigating suspected money laundering by certain North Dakota car dealers were informed that Vennes, the owner of a pawnshop in Bismarck, North Dakota, had visited Switzerland multiple times and might have experience transferring funds to foreign countries. Vennes was approached by an undercover IRS agent posing as an investor from Chicago in 1986. He received $370,000 from the agent over the next three months and transferred the funds to offshore accounts in Switzerland, the Isle of Man and the Bahamas. In one transaction, Vennes personally delivered $100,000 to Switzerland. Vennes alleged that his associates had either stolen or lost the $100,000. Vennes was charged in three indictments in May 1987. He was convicted on federal charges of illegal firearm sales, money laundering and cocaine distribution. He pleaded guilty to the money laundering charge and no contest to the other charges. He was sentenced to five years in federal prison, and served three at the Federal Correctional Institution, Sandstone. While in prison, Vennes experienced a religious conversion. He was released in 1990 and filed a petition for a pardon. Vennes also filed a suit against IRS, alleging that he had been a victim of entrapment. Political contributions Vennes has been a major financial contributor to the campaigns of former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty and Congresswoman Michele Bachmann. In 2006, he and his family were the top contributors to Bachmann's campaign. In 2007, Bachmann sent a letter to then-President George W. Bush, recommending that Vennes be pardoned for his crimes. She later withdrew her letter after Vennes' home was raided by federal agents in connection with the Petters Ponzi scheme. Tom Petters Ponzi scheme On September 24, 2008, Vennes' Shorewood, Minnesota home was raided by federal agents in connection with an investigation of Minnesota businessman Tom Petters' $3.5 billion Ponzi scheme. In a basement vault, agents discovered stacks of $100 bills, buckets and boxes of gold and silver coins, boxes of gem stones, trays of jewelry and Rolex watches. In April 2011, Vennes was indicted in federal court on charges of fraudulently marketing a hedge fund's investments in Petters Company, Inc. (PCI). The indictment alleged that Vennes engaged in 748 transactions involving hundreds of millions of dollars from 1999 through September 2008, and made more than $140 million through investments and commissions. On July 19, 2011, Vennes was charged with eight counts of securities fraud, six counts of wire fraud, three counts of money laundering, two counts of mail fraud, three counts of bank fraud, and two counts of making false statements on credit applications.

Moral absolutism is the ethical view that certain actions are absolutely right or wrong regardless of other contexts such as their consequences or the intentions behind them. Graded absolutism is moral absolutism but qualifies that a moral absolute, like \\"Do not kill,\\" can be greater or lesser than another moral absolute, like \\"Do not lie\\". Also called contextual absolutism or the greater good view, is an alternative to the third alternative view and the lesser evil view, both discussed below, regarding moral conflict resolution. According to graded absolutism, in moral conflicts, the dilemma is not that we are obligated to opposites, because greater absolutes are not opposites of lesser absolutes, and evil is not the opposite of good but is instead the privation of good. Since evil is the privation of good, only the privation of the greater good counts as evil, since whenever there is a moral conflict, we are only obligated to the greater good. The real dilemma is that we cannot perform both conflicting absolutes at the same time. 'Which' absolutes are in conflict depends on the context, but which conflicting absolute is ‚Äògreater‚Äô does not depend on the context. That is why graded absolutism is also called 'contextual absolutism' but is not to be confused with situational ethics. The conflict is resolved in acting according to the greater absolute. In Christianity, this greater absolute is defined by the Great Commandments. That is why graded absolutism is also called the 'greater good view', but is not to be confused with utilitarianism. The third alternative view The third alternative view is the view that there are never any real moral conflicts and that there is always a third alternative. For example, instead of answering in the affirmative or negative to the Nazi at the door, one may simply withhold an answer. The lesser evil view The lesser evil view is the view that the only way out of a moral conflict is to violate one of the moral absolutes and choose the lesser evil. For example, if we disagree with Kant's thoughts on the categorical imperative and say that lying is a lesser evil than helping a would-be murderer, the lesser evil view would have us lie rather than help a would-be murderer. According to the proponent of graded absolutism, this violates the ought implies can principle and defeats itself in obligating evil. The greater good view The greater good view is the view that there are real moral conflicts between absolutes, but rather than requiring a third alternative (as in the case of the third alternative view above) or obligating evil (as in the case of the lesser evil view above), this view obligates the greater absolute, or greater good. For example, when one saves a life rather than telling the truth to a would-be murderer, one is committing the greater good of saving life, rather than violating the lesser good of telling the truth or committing the lesser (than aiding a murderer) evil of lying. Since evil is the privation of good, only the privation of the greater good counts as evil, since whenever there is a moral conflict, we are only obligated to the greater good.

Serani comments on the roadblocks of stigma and reminds us that the pain of depression and most mental illness arise not solely from the illness, but from the harsh response society has to people with these disorders. ‚ÄúOne of the greatest things I‚Äôve been able to do,‚Äù Serani says, ‚ÄúIs to let others know that there‚Äôs no shame in living with a mental illness. Help is out there ‚Äì and you don‚Äôt have to suffer quietly or alone.‚Äù Personal life As a teenager, Serani was treated for depression and cites it as the inspiration for her education and profession.

It is among the few surviving Oswald films from the Winkler era. Plot Oswald is driving his uncovered car through the countryside. One day, he stops by a two-story house to pick up his date, a girl cat. When both are on board, they attempt to hit the road. To their surprise, the car breaks down. Oswald steps out to fix the vehicle while the girl cat impatiently waits. While Oswald is fixing it, a terrier comes by, wanting to play fetch. Every time the rabbit hurls a stick, the terrier comes back with a bigger one. This goes on until the terrier returns with a huge log, dropping it on the car's front as well as flattening Oswald underneath. Tired of playing games, Oswald kicks away the little mutt and resumes working on the car. In no time, the car is repaired and ready to go. Oswald and the girl cat finally set off. However, their journey is far from a smooth one because they have to dodge large rocks on the way which they do successfully. But more trouble comes as the two riders see a boulder rolling toward them from behind. Finding no way to escape, they run off a cliff where they plunge into a pond, splashing out all the water. In the dry pit which is what is left of the pond, the car is capsized. Oswald and his date are lying on the ground. The girl cat then stands up and expresses her disgust. Momentarily, a boy dog in a luxuriant car stops by. The boy dog invites the girl cat, who is most flattered, to come along. She then takes a seat and the luxuriant car then departs. Oswald is left behind, frustrated, and battering his own vehicle.

It is operated by DB Regio NRW. History  RE 9 service to Aachen in Nothberg Regional Express (RE) line 9 has existed since the introduction of the integrated timetable (, ITF) in North Rhine-Westphalia in 1998. Previously one train ran each day over the line to M√∂nchengladbach from Gie√üen to Kaldenkirchen. From 1998 the train service ran on the route from Krefeld via Neuss, Cologne, Siegburg and Siegen to Gie√üen. The service used old rolling stock, consisting of class 111 locomotives hauling five double-deck carriages. At the introduction of the next stage of the integrated timetable (ITF2) in December 2002, the line was the most vulnerable to delay in North Rhine-Westphalia. The causes of these delays were the single track sections of the Sieg Railway, work in connection with the completion of the Cologne‚ÄìFrankfurt high-speed line and the upgrading of the Sieg Railway for S-Bahn operations, speed restrictions between Cologne and Krefeld and a very short turnaround time in Krefeld of 12 minutes. As a result, in December 2003, the sections of line west of the Rhine of the Rhein- Sieg-Express and the Rhein-M√ºnsterland-Express (RE 7) were swapped. The Rhein- Sieg-Express now runs from Cologne to Aachen, making the timetable more stable. Three public transport associations are involved in the operation of the Rhein-Express: the Zweckverband Nahverkehr Rheinland (local transport association of Rhineland, NVR), SPNV Rheinland-Pfalz Nord (transport association of northern Rhineland-Paltinate) and the Zweckverband Nahverkehr Westfalen-Lippe (local transport association of Westphalia-Lippe). They called for tenders for its continued operations after December 2010 to be submitted by 30 January 2008. In April 2008 it was announced that DB Regio Rheinland (formerly DB Heidekrautbahn, which was established in Potsdam for an unsuccessful bid for services in the Berlin area) would operate the line from 12 December 2010 for 15 years. Therefore, services are to be operated with a total of 15 electric multiple units of the E-Talent 2 variety of the Bombardier Talent called class 442. There will be three three-carriage, ten four-carriage and two five-carriage sets. Since its contract with the North Rhine-Westphalia transport associations was terminated by Rhein-Main- Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main transport association) the Rhein-Sieg-Express has terminated since 12 December 2010 in Siegen. Since then the Siegen‚ÄìGie√üen section has been operated only with Hessische Landesbahn trains as services RE 99 and RE 40. However, deliveries of E-Talent 2 to DB Regio Rheinland have been delayed. Since December 2010, the service has been operated under the RSX brand. The new vehicles were first delayed until the second half of 2011, but are now not expected to be available before December 2011. Until then, the line is being operated by conventional double-deck carriages sandwiched between two class 111 locomotives. DB Regio Rheinland took over DB Regio NRW in August 2011 and became the operator of the service. Route  RE 9 in Aachen RE 9 to Siegen in Nothberg The train leaves every hour from Aachen station on the Cologne‚ÄìAachen high-speed line to Cologne station. This section is also part of the route of the NRW-Express (RE 1) and together both lines operate services at approximately 30-minute intervals. From Cologne, the Rhine-Sieg Express follows the Sieg Railway along the Sieg to Siegen. In Siegen there is a regular connection with the Main-Sieg-Express (RE 99) towards Gie√üen and Frankfurt. In addition connections exist to the Rothaar Railway (RB 93) to Bad Berleburg and to the Ruhr-Sieg-Express (RE 16) to Essen. The frequency of services of the Rhine-Sieg-Express on the Sieg Railway is increased during the peaks. In the morning two extra trains run to Cologne and in the afternoon two extra trains run from Cologne towards Siegen. These additional trains run between Au (Sieg) and Siegen with stops in Etzbach, Niederh√∂vels, Scheuerfeld and Brachbach. Between Cologne and Au they also stop in Dattenfeld and Rosbach.

The Central Bank fulfills this mandate by issuing prudential guidelines and regulations as provided for under the Act. In theory, the licensed commercial banks are obligated to operate in accordance with these laws and guidelines, but many suggest this is not happening. Before independence Prior to 9 July 2011, when South Sudan attained independence, banking operations in the country were controlled and governed by the Bank of Sudan based in Khartoum. The Sudanese central bank operated branches in South Sudan in the cities of Juba, Wau, and Malakal. The legal tender was the Sudanese Pound. Beginning in 2005, with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), most of the Sudanese banks operating in South Sudan began to close operations. Also, as part of the CPA, the three branches of the Sudanese central bank located in South Sudan became known as the Bank of Southern Sudan, from January 2005 until July 2011. Bank of Southern Sudan was headquartered in Juba, with branches in Wau and Malakal. It is estimated that the total Sudanese currency circulating in South Sudan was valued at approximately US$700 million, as of July 2011.Sudanese Currency Worth About US$700 Million Circulating In South Sudan In July 2011 After independence Once South Sudan became independent, the Bank of Southern Sudan rebranded to the Central Bank of South Sudan, the central bank in the country and the national banking regulator. Nine days following independence day, the Central Bank of South Sudan released new currency notes of the South Sudanese Pound, to be exchanged at par with the Sudanese Pound for a period of approximately sixty days. In late July 2011, the period to exchange the old Sudanese currency notes was shortened to approximately six weeks, with 31 August 2011 as the last day for the activity. Commercial banks Road sign of the Equity Bank in Juba in 2011 By independence day, the following commercial banks were operating in the country under license from the Central Bank of South Sudan: List of Banks Authorized to Operate in South Sudan # Agricultural Bank of Sudan # Buffalo Commercial Bank # Commercial Bank of Ethiopia # Equity BankEquity Bank Has Presence in South Sudan # Ivory Bank # Kenya Commercial Bank # Mountain Trade and Development BankMountain Trade and Development Bank Established In 2010 # Nile Commercial Bank Bank supervision Banking in the country is under supervision and regulation of South Sudan's central bank, the Central Bank of South Sudan.

They are all in the black market,‚Äù said Deputy Minister Mou Ambrose Thiik. He said a parallel economy had emerged and people were hoarding cash. Black market rates have reached 150 South Sudanese pounds to the dollar, up from 105 in mid- February. Microfinance institutions No information is currently available about the operation of microfinance institutions in South Sudan. Other financial institutions There are investment banks, insurance companies, foreign exchange bureaux, finance companies and leasing companies operating in South Sudan. The role of the central bank in the operations of these businesses will become clearer as the laws governing their operations are publicized in the coming weeks and months.

London: Tate Gallery, 1979, p. 14. Measuring high and wide, it depicts the heads of six of his domestic servants. It is held by in Tate Britain in London. This is evidently a late work by Hogarth, demonstrating his mastery of portraiture. The subject matter and composition are unusual, with six studies of heads crammed in a small space, distributed in three groups of two, all lit by a light source at the upper left. Space for a seventh head has been marked out roughly in the lower left corner but it was not completed like the other six. The left edge of the canvas was later cut to frame the six completed heads better, cutting off part of the absent seventh head. The painting shows three men and three women, of varying ages from youth to maturity, reminiscent of the seven ages of man, and with varying skin tones. Hogarth is exploring the differences of human physiognomy as he had in his print Characters and Caricaturas of 1743. Each subject looks in a different direction, with no lines of vision intersecting, reflecting the sketch-like nature of the work. The three female figures have similarly youthful appearances, not children but also not old. The male figures progress in age from a boy at the top centre, through a mature man at the bottom centre, to a more elderly man at the top right. The older man is possibly Ben Ives; the other servants may be \\"Samuel\\"; Mary Lewis, Hogarth's wife's cousin, who later inherited the painting; and Mrs Chappel, who was known to have worked for the Hogarths in Chiswick. Ronald Paulson believes the servants featured could be a coachman, valet, page, housekeeper and two housemaids. The servants are shown in their natural appearance, in their usual work clothes, capturing their individual characters. It was painted with warmth and sensitivity, demonstrating Hogarth's affection for his servants, and a lightness of touch reminiscent of his uncompleted portrait of The Shrimp Girl. The work was not commissioned, but rather painted for Hogarth's own amusement. It may have been hung in Hogarth's studio to demonstrate his ability as a portraitist to his patrons. It was inherited by Hogarth's wife after his death, and left to Mary Lewis in 1789. It was sold at Greenwood's in April 1790; displayed at the British Institution in 1817 and Suffolk Street Gallery in 1833. It was sold at Christie's in 1879 and again in 1892, when it was bought by the National Gallery with money from the Lewis Fund. It was transferred to the Tate Gallery in 1960.

Sheep were among the first animals to be domesticated by humankind; the domestication date is estimated to fall between nine and eleven thousand years ago in Mesopotamia.EnsmingerWeaverSimmons & EkariusHenri Fleisch suggested that the Shepherd Neolithic industry could have been used by nomadic shepherds.Fleisch, Henri., Notes de Pr√©histoire Libanaise : 1) Ard es Saoude. 2) La Bekaa Nord. 3) Un polissoir en plein air. BSPF, vol. 63. Shepherd Neolithic is a name given by archaeologists to a style (or industry) of small flint tools from the Hermel plains in the north Beqaa Valley, Lebanon.Fleisch, Henri., Les industries lithiques r√©centes de la B√©kaa, R√©publique Libanaise, Acts of the 6th C.I.S.E.A., vol. XI, no. 1. Paris, 1960. The Shepherd Neolithic industry has been insufficiently studied and was provisionally named based on a limited typology collected by Jesuit archaeologist \\"P√®re\\" Henri Fleisch. Lorraine Copeland and Peter J. Wescombe suggested it was possibly \\"of quite late date\\". Characteristics Shepherd Neolithic material can be found dispersed over a wide area of the north Beqaa Valley in low concentrations. M. Billaux and Henri Fleisch suggested that the flints were of a higher quality than the brittle flint in the nearby conglomerates indicating origin from elsewhere. Three groups of flint could be determined; light brown, red-brown and that varied but was usually grey-chocolate that was distinguished with a radiant \\"desert shine\\". Characteristics of the industry include smallness in size, commonly between 2.5 cm and 4 cm and frequently being quite thick, unlike geometric microliths. The small number of tools within the assemblage is another distinguishable characteristic, including short denticulated or notched blades, end scrapers, transverse racloirs on thin flakes and borers with strong points. They also display a lack of recognizable typology although Levallois technique was occasionally observed to have been used. They also show signs of having been heavily worked with cores being re-used and turned into scrapers. Fleisch suggested the industry was Epipaleolithic as it is evidently not Paleolithic, Mesolithic or even Pottery Neolithic. He further suggested that the industry could have been used by nomadic shepherds. The relationship and dividing line between the related Heavy Neolithic zone of the south Beqaa Valley could also not be clearly defined but was suggested to be in the area around Douris and Qalaat Tannour. Not enough exploration had been carried out to conclude whether the bands of Neolithic surface sites continues south into the areas around Zahle and Rayak. Sites The type sites of the Shepherd Neolithic are at Qaa and Maqne I, with other sites with Shepherd Neolithic finds include Douris, Hermel II, Hermel III, Kamouh el Hermel, Qalaat Tannour, Wadi Boura I and possibly at Rayak North, Riha Station and Serain.

The editor-in-chief is Sergei G. Kazarian (Imperial College London). The journal covers applications of spectroscopy in analytical chemistry, materials science, biotechnology, and chemical characterization. The journal is a continuation of Bulletin of the Society for Applied Spectroscopy (), which was first published in February 1946. This title continued until July 1951. The frequency of this publication varied between 1951 and 1991. Then in 1992 it became a monthly journal.Applied Spectroscopy @ WorldCat, Applied Spectroscopy @ Library of Congress, Bulletin of the Society for Applied Spectroscopy @ Library of Congress,  Aims and Scope  The journal seeks to be comprehensive in scope, with its primary aim the publication of papers on both the fundamentals and applications of photon- based spectroscopy. These include, but are not limited to, ultraviolet-visible absorption, fluorescence and phosphorescence, mid-infrared, Raman, near- infrared, terahertz, and microwave, and atomic absorption, atomic emission, and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopies (and ICP-MS), as well as cutting- edge hyphenated and interdisciplinary techniques. Fundamental topics include, but are not restricted to, the theory of optical spectra and their interpretation, instrumentation design, and operational principles. Reports of spectral processing methodologies such as 2D correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS), baseline correction, and chemometric methods applied to spectra are also strongly encouraged. Application papers are intended to feature novel, innovative applications of spectroscopic methods and techniques. Papers from all fields of scientific endeavor in which applied spectroscopy can be utilized will be considered for publication. Representative fields include chemistry, physics, biological and health sciences, environmental science, materials science, archeology and art conservation, and forensic science. In addition to full papers, the journal publishes Rapid Communications, Spectroscopic Techniques, Notes, and Correspondence related to previously published papers. A regular feature of the journal, Focal Point Reviews, provides definitive, comprehensive reviews of spectroscopic techniques and applications and is available as open access.

He was educated at Southland Boys' High School between 1933 and 1936 and after leaving school worked for two years at the National Bank of New Zealand in Invercargill. In June 1938 he applied for a four-year short service commission and was provisionally accepted in November. On 1 February 1939 he sailed for the UK aboard the RMS Tainui with a large draft of other candidates. Royal Air Force Training Lawrence reported for training as a pupil pilot at 10 E & RFTS (Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School), Yatesbury run for the RAF by the Bristol Aeroplane Company. After successful ab initio training on de Havilland Tiger Moths, he was posted to No. 1 Depot, RAF Uxbridge to be commissioned into the RAF, and on 31 May was posted to No. 5 FTS, RAF Sealand for Service training on Airspeed Oxfords. After completion of Service training on 31 October, he joined the newly formed No. 234 Squadron RAF at RAF Leconfield on 6 November 1939. Initially the Squadron kept up flying hours in Avro Tutors and Miles Magisters. Further training started on 17 December on Bristol Blenheim Mk 1Fs (this type known as the short-nosed Blenheim). At the end of March the Squadron began to convert to Supermarine Spitfire Mk1s and became operational with them on 8 May. From 9 May 1940 Lawrence was sent for a month's training to become the Squadron Navigation Officer, flying Avro Ansons at the School of Air Navigation RAF St Athan, Glamorgan. The Battle of Britain On 30 June he rejoined 234 Squadron which had moved to RAF St Eval, Cornwall. Here the unit's main duties were patrols, scrambles and convoy protection. On 8 July he shared in the destruction of a Junkers Ju 88 ‚Äì the squadron's first victory. On 12 July he damaged a Ju 88. On 15 August 234 Squadron was posted to RAF Middle Wallop, a part of No. 10 Group RAF flying in defence of Portsmouth, Southampton and other targets along the south coast. As there were fewer raids along the south coast than in the south east, about two-thirds of patrols, scrambles and interceptions undertaken were flown in support of No. 11 Group RAF, as far as Kent. On 24 August he damaged a Messerschmitt Bf 110. On the afternoon of 7 September the Luftwaffe made its first heavy daylight raid on London. 234 Squadron was amongst those scrambled to intercept the enemy bomber force as it retired. Lawrence damaged a Dornier Do 17 and then joined an attack on a formation of 12 Messerschmitt Bf 109s, one of which he pursued to the coast and shot down. Also on 7 September 234 Squadron lost two important members, its inspirational force, Australian Pat Hughes, who was Lawrence's flight commander, and its CO S/Ldr O'Brian. Two days later, 234 Squadron was posted back to its old base at St Eval to be rested, receive replacement aircraft and train new pilots being posted in from OTUs ‚Äì Operational Training Units; the squadron had lost 18 Spitfires in 4 weeks fighting. Lawrence did not remain with it, but was posted to No. 603 Squadron RAF at RAF Hornchurch, Essex. This was in line with the policy of Keith Park to hold back up to six experienced pilots when a squadron was being rested, and post them to squadrons still in action. On 15 September he claimed a Bf 109 destroyed and two more damaged, and on 17 September a further Bf 109. On 8 October 1940 Lawrence was posted to the newly formed No. 421 (Reconnaissance) Flight RAF, initially based at Gravesend, Kent, and subsequently at West Malling, Biggin Hill and Hawkinge. The unit was formed by Winston Churchill and Dowding to operate in the specialised role of making visual observation and reporting on the approach of high-flying fighter sweeps, and acquired the nickname of the Jim Crow Flight. On 23 November he damaged a Bf 110. On 27 November, whilst flying alone on an early morning weather recce over Ramsgate he unsuccessfully attacked 3 Bf 109s from II./JG 26, but was 'bounced' and shot down by the fourth. Records available after the war indicate this was another victory for a leading Luftwaffe ace, Gustav Sprick (Oblt. Gustav Sprick Staffelkapit√§n 8/JG 26, Spitfire at 09.25 Deal). One wing was blown off Lawrence's Spitfire, and he found himself falling in his stocking feet with his right arm useless. He managed to deploy his parachute and went into the sea. He was spotted and picked up by a lifeboat. Taken to Ramsgate, he was admitted to hospital with a fractured right leg, a lacerated left leg and dislocated right shoulder. He was then transferred to RAF hospital at RAF Halton where he met his future wife Kay. The Siege of Malta On 4 December 1941, after rehabilitation at the RAF Officers' Hospital Torquay, Lawrence rejoined his unit, by then re- numbered as No. 91 Squadron RAF. He was posted to 52 OTU, RAF Aston Down for a refresher course on Spitfires and rejoined the squadron on 10 January 1942. Soon afterwards he was posted to RAF HQ Mediterranean at Valletta, to join the defence of the island during the Siege of Malta. Lawrence joined No. 185 Squadron RAF at Hal Far on 17 February. The defending Hurricanes were considerably outnumbered by enemy fighters escorting the bombers and were slower and less well-armed than the German cannon-equipped Bf 109Fs. Malta was the most heavily bombed place on earth in World War 2. (See external link below). During April there were an estimated 3547 bomber sorties over Malta, with only two days without bombing. Whilst Lawrence was on the island, it was regarded as normal for the squadron to be scrambled two or three times a day in response to raids by anything from 20 to 100+ aircraft. However, this was dependent upon two factors, the serviceability of aircraft ‚Äì arising from both battle damage and from damage to aircraft on the ground from bombing and strafing ‚Äì and the serviceability of the runway due to bomb damage. Prior to the arrival of its Spitfires, on several days in April and early May the squadron could only muster 3 or 4 serviceable Hurricanes for scrambles. On 17 March Lawrence was promoted to Flight Lieutenant. On 23 March he shared a Heinkel He 111, on 9 April damaged a Ju 88 and on 24 April damaged a Bf 109. On 9 May, the day on which the Squadron received its first consignment of Spitfire Mk Vb's, Lawrence destroyed one of the Junkers Ju 87 Stukas which was dive-bombing Grand Harbour, Luqa and defence gun positions. On 10 May he destroyed another of the Stukas this time dive-bombing the Welshman, a fast minelayer now tied up at the jetty at Grand Harbour which had arrived at dawn, but which had been converted for carrying badly needed cargo including fighter fuel, ammunition, spare engines, air crew and a large amount of mail. On 19 May Lawrence damaged a Bf 109. On 28 May he was made Acting Squadron Leader and took command of 185 Squadron, leading the squadron until he was posted back to the UK on 27 June. Following this, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (gazetted on 12 September 1942) the citation stating \\"This officer has displayed great courage and outstanding keenness. His example at all times, especially when the odds were great, has been of the best\\" and crediting him with four destroyed, two probable and seven damaged. Operational Training Units In August 1942 Lawrence began a long period as an instructor when he was again posted to 52 OTU at Aston Down, preparing pupils for operational flying in Spitfire squadrons. On 4 September 1942 he moved to 57 OTU, initially at RAF Hawarden and then at Eshott, on the same duties. In early July 1943 Lawrence went to RAF Duxford for liaison duties with the United States Army Air Forces. flying mainly the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, the Miles Master and the Piper Cub. On 27 October 1943 he was posted to the Central Gunnery School at RAF Sutton Bridge on the Pilot Gunnery Instructors Training Wing to receive training to become a Spitfire gunnery instructor. (See link to Sutton Bridge for training methods). From 27 December 1943 to 3 May 1944, Lawrence was an instructor at 14 APC at Ayr, where squadrons flew in for two weeks intensive gunnery training. In June 1944 Lawrence was posted to 28 OTU, RAF Wymeswold where he flew Hawker Hurricanes by day and by night to assist the training of Air Gunners flying in Vickers Wellington bomber by making simulated attacks. He was subsequently posted to 18 OTU at Worksop on similar duties until the end of January 1945. 124 (F.B.) Squadron On 5 February 1945 Lawrence returned to operations when he joined No. 124 Squadron, a fighter-bomber squadron. The unit, which transferred to RAF Coltishall on 10 February 1945, flew Spitfire Mk IX.HF(e)'s. The Squadron's main duty was to make dive-bombing attacks on V-2 rocket launching sites around The Hague. Depending on visibility for dive- bombing and the availability of liberated airfields in Belgium for refuelling, each aircraft carried either a 500 or a 1000 lb. bomb-load. For dive-bombing sorties when the liberated airfields were not available, drop tanks were required for the extra fuel for the out-and-return sorties, reducing the bomb- load to 500lbs. (See link to No. 124 Squadron RAF for more detail on operational sorties). The main danger on these sorties was not enemy fighter defence, but heavy flak along the coast and around the launch sites. The squadron also flew sorties known as interdictions, attacking railway and supply lines to the V-2 sites, again on an out-and-return basis from Coltishall using drop tanks which were jettisoned on approach to the Dutch coast. A further duty was flying daylight escorts for heavy bombers raiding into Germany. At the end of April, after Lawrence had flown approximately 50 operational sorties, and following the liberation of the Netherlands by the Allies, 124 Squadron moved to RAF Hutton Cranswick for squadron training. On 15 July, Lawrence transferred to the RNZAF, whilst remaining in 124 Squadron. On 24 August 1945, 124 Squadron moved to RAF Molesworth, for conversion to the Gloster Meteor, the RAF's first jet fighter. In October the unit transferred to RAF Bentwaters. Lawrence was released from Service on 11 March 1946. He returned to New Zealand in late May 1946 and went into the Reserve in September. Later life and death Keith Lawrence and his wife Kay on their Diamond Wedding in 2005. Lawrence married Kay Harte in 1945 and they had two daughters and three sons. They later returned from New Zealand to Great Britain where he ran retail and commercial enterprises. He retired at age 65 to Devon, where he flew for 18 years with the Devon and Somerset Gliding Club. In 2002, as a part of the Queen's Golden Jubilee celebrations Carolyn Grace invited the Battle of Britain Fighter Association to nominate a member for a flight in The Grace Spitfire. As Lawrence was then still flying, being current on the Club's single seaters, he was nominated by the Association and gratefully accepted the invitation for his first Spitfire flight for 57 years. In 2010, the seventieth anniversary of the Battle of Britain, Lawrence was invited to represent 'The Few' by filming a short sequence with the BBC (see External Link below) at the Battle of Britain Memorial, Capel-le-Ferne on the Kent coast for inclusion in the Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall on 13 November.

In 1963 an associate degree in nursing was established under the auspices of BYU's College of Industrial and Technical Education.

It is located in East Carnegie, a neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The seminary is not a degree-granting institution; seminarians in their collegiate or pre-theological studies attend classes at Franciscan University of Steubenville. History Previous diocesan seminaries Bishop Michael O'Connor founded Pittsburgh's first diocesan seminary in 1844, the first year of his episcopate. St. Michael Seminary was located in Pittsburgh's Birmingham neighborhood. It was briefly discontinued for four years (1851‚Äì1856), operated for a year in Cambria County, and was finally reestablished in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Glenwood. The seminary definitively closed in 1876 with the tumultuous creation of the Diocese of Allegheny out of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. After 1876, Pittsburgh's diocesan seminarians received instruction at Saint Vincent Seminary in Latrobe.Catholic Pittsburgh's One Hundred Years, p. 147 Seminarians during the episcopacy of Hugh C. Boyle, from 1926 to 1945, were allowed to commute to Duquesne University from home. Bishop John F. Dearden, however, ended that practice. Until the creation of Saint Paul's, Pittsburgh seminarians would attend classes at other minor seminaries in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky. Phelan Hall on the campus of St. Paul Seminary Establishment of Saint Paul's Saint Paul's Seminary occupies the grounds and buildings of the former Saint Paul's Orphanage. The campus began its connection with the Pittsburgh diocese with the establishment of the orphanage there on May 27, 1900, on \\"a plateau at Idlewood between Crafton and Carnegie.\\" The orphanage operated until August 1965, when its operations were combined with those of Holy Family Institute in Emsworth. In September 1965, Bishop John Wright founded St. Paul Seminary as a minor, or \\"transitional,\\" seminary on the same site. Pittsburgh bishop David Zubik sold the diocesan bishop's mansion in Oakland in favor of a simpler apartment on the seminary's campus in 2007. Auxiliary bishop emeritus William J. Winter is also in residence.

Early life Shurtleff was born on July 28, 1910 in Middleborough, Massachusetts. He attended Williston Academy and Brown University. Shurtleff worked as a writer for the Middleborough Journal and The Standard-Times. In 1937, while working for the Journal, Shurtleff was elected to the Middleborough Board of Selectmen. On August 12, 1938, Shurtleff married Thalia Elizabeth Forsberg. They would go on to have four children together. During World War II, Shurtleff served as one of Middleborough's three blackout coordinators. Mansfield, Massachusetts In 1943, Shurtleff, who had no prior experience in the day-to-day administrative operations of a town, was named Town Manager of Mansfield, Massachusetts. In 1945, Shurtleff dismissed Police Chief John Haines and named Lawrence Barrows to succeed him. Haines refused to turn over his badge and the keys to the police cruiser and maintained that he was still chief. Two months later, a Special Town Meeting voted to direct the Board of Selectmen to reinstate Haines as Chief. Shurtleff, who accused Haines of 35 counts of misconduct, including fee splitting and insubordination, refused to reinstate the former chief. The dismissal was upheld by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and the Civil Service Commission. Brookfield, Illinois In August 1947, Shurtleff was named village manager of Brookfield, Illinois. Shurtleff left Brookfield after only eight months to become Town Manager in Saugus, Massachusetts. Saugus, Massachusetts On February 16, 1948, Shurtleff was unanimously chosen by the Board of Selectmen to become the first Town Manager of Saugus. On February 1, 1950, Shurtleff resigned as Town Manager to accept a similar job in Medford, Massachusetts. Medford, Massachusetts In 1950, Shurtleff became Medford's first-ever City Manager. During his tenure in Medford, Shurtleff clashed with State Tax Commissioner Henry F. Long over who could appoint assessors. The dispute went before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, who ruled in favor of Shurtleff. On November 20, 1956, the Medford City Council voted 4 to 3 in favor of firing Shurtleff. After his dismissal, Shurtleff was granted a public hearing a second vote on whether or not he should be fired. Once again, the City Council voted in favor of dismissal. In 1957, Shurtleff ran for and was elected to the Medford City Council. Soon after his election, Shurtleff led the charge to remove his successor as City Manager, John B. Kennedy, from office. On April 8, 1958 the city council voted for to 4 to 3 to fire Kennedy. Shurtleff was later involved in the effort to remove City Manager John C. Carr, charging that City Councilor John C. Carr, Jr.'s vote for his father was a conflict of interest. On November 18, 1964, Shurtleff died at his home of a heart attack.

The first series Victorian Undead: Sherlock Holmes vs. Zombies is a six-issue American comic book limited series published by Wildstorm. The series was written by Ian Edginton, with art by Davide Fabbri. The story is set in Victorian England and follows Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson in the midst of a zombie outbreak. It was followed by Victorian Undead Special: Sherlock Holmes vs. Jekyll/Hyde (one issue) and a second series Victorian Undead: Sherlock Holmes vs. Dracula (five issues), which sees Holmes and Watson helping to track down the title character (Count Dracula) before he kills Queen Victoria. Publication history The first series ran in early 2010 and the second in early 2011 ‚Äì as Wildstorm folded during that period, the last three issues were published directly by the parent company, DC Comics. Victorian Undead: Sherlock Holmes vs Zombies (Plot) Issue 1: The Star of Ill-Omen In 1854, a strange comet enters over London, releasing little fragments in which one fragment penetrates into a street pump near Broad Street in Soho. Five months later, Soho suffers what appears to be a cholera outbreak. Doctor John Snow and Reverend Henry Whitehead investigate the outbreak. While Snow postulates the cause for the outbreak, Reverend Whitehead discusses a recent confession from a tanner's apprentice about the dead coming back to life. Soon afterwards, one of Snow's deceased patients is resurrected as a zombie in front of a shocked Snow and Whitehead. By 1898, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson investigate a charlatan who has been hypnotizing unsuspecting people into revealing their secrets. The charlatan turns out to be an advanced automaton and is disabled during a struggle with Holmes and Watson. The two are perplexed at this discovery, in which Holmes deduces that the machine was controlled by an unknown person, who personally knows Holmes. Meanwhile, two workmen at an underground railway construction yard come across a corpse. One of the workmen sees a gold ring on the corpse and greedily attempts to appropriate it, but the corpse comes to life and bites him. The zombie is decapitated by the other workman, but he is also attacked and bitten by his coworker, who turns into a zombie. At Baker Street, Holmes and Watson later study the automaton and are then urgently summoned to Scotland Yard by Inspector Lestrade over what appears to be a murder between the aforementioned workmen before they are brought to one of the zombified workmen and a functioning head of the discovered zombie. However, Holmes and Watson are forced to call off their investigation by British Secret Service agents. Issue 2: The Skull Beneath The Skin Despite being warned by British Intelligence, Holmes and Watson continue their investigation and search for where the zombie was discovered. The two dig into the earthwork and find themselves in an underground city dating back to ancient London. They then find a corpse pile and look into its contents to find that some of the corpses are barely a year old. Soon they are surrounded by a horde of zombies. Being driven to a corner while learning that shooting the zombies in the head will effectively dispatch them, Holmes and Watson are saved by the arrival of heavily armed and armored Royal Marines led by the former's brother, Mycroft Holmes. After saving Holmes and Watson, Mycroft escorts them to the surface and proceeds in providing them answers. As Holmes and Watson are being escorted, Sebastian Moran spies them from afar and travels to Whitechapel, where he reports his news to his master - an undead Professor Moriarty. Issue 3: Written in Blood At the Diogenes Club, Mycroft debriefs Holmes and Watson of their government's knowledge about the undead. In 1854, the Broad Street cholera outbreak was in fact a zombie outbreak, in which more than a thousand people were killed and turned into zombies in the Soho district. Initially the government failed to understand what they were dealing with until the aid of Dr. John Snow, who had prior experience with the undead, strenuously contained and culled the outbreak. In the aftermath, the entire events were covered up as a cholera outbreak and Snow kept his silence after promises were made in improving public sanitation. The source of the outbreak, however, remains unknown and there has not been any undead incidents since the last forty years until now. Holmes analyzes his brother's information and the recently discovered zombies, and believes that someone is creating and corralling the undead. Meanwhile, Holmes' deductions are proven correct as the culprit, Professor Moriarty, has been creating an undead army in several secret locations throughout London, and releasing them to start another, but much larger, outbreak. Holmes and Watson bear witness to the outbreak and flee to the safety of Baker Street. There Holmes ties the connection of the zombies in 1854 in concurrent to a comet, as the source of the outbreak for carrying an alien disease, after reading a book written by Moriarty; concluding that his nemesis is behind this and noting that he was thought to be dead. Issue 4: And Death Shall Have No Dominion In a flashback to 1891, Moriarty survived his confrontation with Holmes at the Reichenbach Falls. Here Moriarty, severely wounded, is found by Sebastian Moran and inoculated with a serum based on the disease which created the undead, transforming him into a zombie but retaining his intelligence. In the present, the undead have overrun London. From Whitechapel, Moriarty reveals to Moran that he never intended to use the outbreak to force the government to yield to him, but instead desires to spread the outbreak further and forge an undead empire. Moran is morally perturbed by his master's intentions and attempts to kill him, but is infected in the process before escaping with his life. At Baker Street Holmes and Watson, along with Mrs. Hudson, have barricaded inside. However, they are saved by the military that was sent out by Myrcroft Holmes. As they are evacuating the premise, a dying Moran finds Holmes and Watson, informing them of Moriarty before expiring. Issue 5: The Earth Shall Give Up Its Dead The undead have taken London with Moriarty reigning from a captured Buckingham Palace. Holmes and Watson have relocated to Windsor Castle, being used as a command center by the British government. They are granted an audience with Lord Bellinger, the Prime Minister, who informs Holmes that his government had anticipated another outbreak only because after previously discovering foreign agents were found attempting to steal the undead remains from the Soho outbreak for their respective nations in order to cultivate the undead virus as a biological weapon. As of now, Moriarty holds the ultimate deadly weapon in the world. Holmes heavily advises Lord Bellinger that the only option to contain and neutralize the exponentially growing outbreak is to scorch London at the cost of losing the nation's capital. Holme's advisement is soon put forward as the Royal Navy is set to bombard London after the undead have broken through Westminster Bridge. However, Holmes is aghast to learn that the government intends to let Moriarty be burned along with London rather than having him dealt with directly. But thanks to Mycroft, Holmes and Watson are provided with a launch into London to face Moriarty themselves. Before leaving, Holmes implores Mycroft of how Trelawney Hope, the current Secretary of State, became tasked in tactical deployments in which his brother explains that Hope succeeded from his predecessors of the Home Secretary, who fell to the zombies, based on a contingency plan. Holmes and Watson land in Whitechapel after deducing Moriarty's location from the clay soil found on Moran's footwear. The two enter a slaughterhouse where they are confronted by an apparently very-much alive Moriarty. Issue 6: Inferno Holmes confronts Moriarty's automaton about how the earlier one had mesmerized Trelawney Hope. Hope realized that his safe and the contingency plan were compromised and had engaged Holmes, who in turn was able to undo Moriarty's control of Hope's mind. Moriarty makes taunts about his reign as monarch. After blinding the automaton Holmes and Watson escape into the streets of Whitechapel. They make their way into the Underground and come out of a secret station that leads into Buckingham Palace. Holmes has deduced that is where Moriarty is based on the comments he had transmitted via the automaton. Watson separates from Holmes after being reminded to follow the plan. Naval ships in the Thames River open fire on central London. Meanwhile upstairs in the Palace Holmes encounters Moriarty who he manages to badly burn with a grenade that also sets the room on fire. While he admits that it will be hard to kill Moriarty, Holmes says he can still break him since the \\"body is only a system of pulley and levers.\\" Moriarty is beaten in the fight and Holmes beheads him. Out on a balcony Watson fires a flare and Mycroft Holmes, aboard an airship, heads for the signal. Holmes tries to finds Moriarty's head as Watson enters the burning room and says that there is no time. The two run from the Palace as the airship approaches and then begins to drop bombs. The second Great Fire of London is shown burning away the \\"plague.\\" Sailors pull the last of the zombies out of the river with fishing nets. Three months later London is being rebuilt as Holmes and Watson discuss the revenant event, with Holmes noting they are \\"venturing into the unknown.\\" In the final panels Moriarty is shown in an underground lab, and he has staples in his neck as he works on the brain of a detached head on the table. Victorian Undead II (Plots) Jekyll & Hyde In 1899, nearly a year after the revenant attack on London, as the city continues to rebuild, Holmes, having completed recreating his lost files, is contacted by Mr. Utterson regarding the recent strange behavior of his friend Dr. Henry Jekyll, including his role in the death of a young girl and a mysterious assistant known only as \\"Edward Hyde\\". Investigating Jekyll's lab, Holmes and Watson's examination of the tissue consumed by dead flies in the lab reveals that Jekyll has access to a revenant, but a confrontation with Jekyll that night reveals that he is the revenant; having suffered a psychotic breakdown from stress prior to the revenant outbreak that fractured his personality, Jekyll initially maintained control through a serum provided by a Limehouse herbalist, but after he was attacked by a revenant and his supplier killed in the fire, he was forced to ration his supply and restrain himself, the infection having resulted in him retaining his own mind while under the serum's influence while occasionally reverting to his other persona and revenant instincts, as well as escaping his confinement on some occasions. With no way to contain Hyde as he escapes his house, Jekyll begs Holmes to kill him while he is still himself after being injected with the last of his serum, with Watson mercifully shooting his head off. Sherlock Holmes vs. Dracula It is one year later (1900), and contacted by a maritime insurance company to investigate the deaths of the crew of the schooner the Demeter, Holmes and Watson's investigation of the solicitor's office that took custody of the ship's cargo reveals that the entire household has abruptly died of the bubonic plague, and they are attacked by a group of gypsies before being saved by another group. Talking with their saviours, Holmes and Watson learn that the other group are known as the Szgany, who serve the vampire known as Count Dracula. Meanwhile, Lord Godalmning has introduced Queen Victoria to Count Dracula, claiming that the Count is an expert in diseases of the blood and will be able to treat the condition that curtails the royal family. In reality, Dracula and Godalming intend to unleash an infection on the empire - using the diseased earth brought to Britain via the Demeter, Dracula taking the throne in the ensuing chaos. As Holmes and Watson track the boxes of earth to Carfax Abbey, they discover Professor Abraham van Helsing, Jonathan Harker, Doctor John Seward and Quincey Morris at the abbey already, the two groups exchanging information before they are attacked by the vampire Lucy Westenra and a group of Dracula's 'get', half-deads animated by his blood as plague carriers. Having destroyed the plague-carriers and driven Lucy away, the group meet up at Baker Street to discuss their separate approaches to the current investigation, including Godalming's betrayal and the suicide of Jonathan's wife Mina after Dracula bit her (Lucy escaped being staked because Godalming tipped her off). As they ponder how Dracula made contact with the firm that arranged his arrival in Britain, the group are visited by Mycroft Holmes, who reveals that Godalming was an agent of the Diogenes Club sent on a mission to investigate old legends as means of acquiring an 'alternative arsenal' for Britain after the revenant attack, only to betray his country for power. Tracking Dracula to his new lair based on where the boxes were delivered, they discover the dead Godalming - drained by Lucy when Dracula became frustrated with him - and Dracula's brides, with Seward being killed before Lucy allows the brides to be destroyed and shield her before fleeing, dismissing Dracula as an antiquated fool for following old superstitions (apparently since she was turned in modern times, her undead form is a bit more resistant to holy symbols like crosses). Using Toby the bloodhound - wounded during the revenant attack on London but still possessing his keen nose - the group tracks Dracula to the Palace, where they manage to expose him during a royal ball. Dracula attacks and kills the Queen, then tries to escape while Holmes and Morris jump on Dracula's transformed bat-like form and force him to land in a nearby construction site. Morris dies of his injuries before Holmes manages to cut a vital rope so that the scaffolding impales Dracula, and Holmes then beheads him, thus ending his threat once and for all (it is also revealed that the \\"Queen\\" was an actress hired to impersonate her). However Holmes deduces this is just the start of the world becoming more known to supernatural forces.

The Jefferson County School District named Molly Howard as principal of the new school at the time of its formation. She and the school's staff set about improving the educational performance of the student body, posting impressive gains in achievement in state-mandated mathematics tests during the first decade of the 21st century, which led to Howard being selected as the 2008 National High School Principal of the Year by the National Association of Secondary School Principals.

Mie means noodle made of flour, salt and egg, while soto refers to Indonesian soup. In Indonesia it is called soto mie and is considered as one variant of soto, while in Malaysia and Singapore it is called mee soto.  Ingredients  Soto mie can be made of beef, chicken, or offals such as kaki sapi (skin, cartilage and tendons of cow's trotters) or tripes. People may exchange noodles for rice or rice vermicelli according to their preference. A combination of either noodle or rice vermicelli along with slices of tomato, boiled potato, hard boiled egg, cabbages, peanut, bean sprout and beef, offal or chicken meat are added. Broth is then poured over this combination. This soup is made from beef or chicken stock and some other spices. Condiments are usually added, such as jeruk nipis (lime juice), sambal, bawang goreng (fried shallot), vinegar, kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), and emping.  Variants  Yellow noodles served in soto soup is mainly known in two major different versions; the beef (soto mie) and chicken (mee soto) versions.  Soto mie (Bogor and Jakarta)  File:Soto Mie Bogor Cart 1.JPG|A travelling Soto mie bogor cart on Jakarta street, with the ingredients displayed on the window File:Soto Mie Bogor 1.JPG|Soto mie bogor sold on Jakarta street The most popular soto mie in Indonesia comes from Bogor, West Java. It is a popular street food sold by travelling gerobak or cart vendors frequenting business and residential areas in cities and towns in Indonesia. The beef broth soup is spiced with shallot, garlic, candlenut, peppercorn, ground ebi (dried shrimp), daun salam (Indonesian bayleaf), lime leaves, bruised lemongrass and lime juice. It is made of beef or cow's trotters (tendons, skin and cartilage) with noodles, slices of risole (fried spring rolls with bihun and vegetables filling similar to lumpia), tomato, cabbage, potato, and celery. The Jakarta (Betawi) version is very similar to the version found in Bogor, but beef meat is preferred over cow's trotters, and galangal is added in its spice mixture.  Mee soto (Singapore and Johor)  In Singapore and Johor, Malaysia the most popular variant is mee soto ayam (chicken noodle soto). Mee soto is a spicy noodle soup dish that combines the Indonesian chicken broth known as soto ayam with thick yellow Hokkien noodles. The chicken broth is spiced with spice paste made of ground peppercorns, coriander, garlic, candlenut, galangal, red onion, turmeric, bruised lemongrass, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon. It is a Javanese influenced dish, and quite popular in Singapore and Johor. Basically it is pretty similar with soto ayam (chicken soto) commonly served in Indonesia, with exception it is served with noodle instead of rice vermicelli. The origin of the soto ayam broth used for making mee soto can be traced to the Madurese migrant ethnic group residing in the Indonesian city of Surabaya in East Java. The East Javanese immigrants from Madura and Lamongan settled in Johor and Singapore, bringing with them the spicy soto ayam broth dish, and replacing the rice dumpling (lontong) with yellow noodle.

In the past it has granted various master's degrees and Doctor of Religious Education degrees. Currently its only degree programs are an MA in religious education, primarily aimed at full-time Church Educational System employees, and an MA program for military chaplains, while most students who take courses with Religious Education are studying other topics. Undergraduate BYU students have to take the equivalent of one religion course per semester.  Departments  Religious Education at BYU consists of two departments, Church History and Doctrine and Ancient Scripture. Church History and Doctrine focuses on courses related to the Doctrine and Covenants, missionary work, the religious history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and LDS Temples. These courses focus primarily on doctrines and theology and are largely devotional in nature. BYU also offers more historically oriented courses related to LDS Church history through its history department, some of which are taught by faculty members whose main appointment is with the religion department. The department of Ancient Scripture teaches courses related to the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon and the Pearl of Great Price. The work of Religious Education faculty members is often published by its publication arm, the Religious Studies Center, or through BYU's Neal A. Maxwell Institute. Religious Education is not designated as a college. It has approximately 70 full-time faculty members. The current dean is Brent L. Top. His most recent predecessors were Terry Ball, Andrew Skinner, and Robert L. Millet.  History  Prior to 1929 religion related instruction at BYU was termed theology. In that year it was renamed religious education. George H. Brimhall, who was the president emeritus was the only full-time religion instructor before 1930. Other classes in religion were taught by faculty from other fields. Having faculty with their main expertise in other fields teach religion is still done at BYU, but the full-time religion faculty is now much more numerous. Guy C. Wilson, an alumnus of BYU, the University of Chicago and Columbia University was hired as the director of BYU's religious education program in 1930. Wilson had also been the first seminary teacher ever. In the early 1930s Sidney B. Sperry and Russel Swensen, also Universityof Chicago alumni, were added as full-time religion faculty. In 1932 the department of religious education was made part of the BYU College of Education. In 1940 the department was split off and made the Division of Religious Instruction, a college-level entity, with J. Wyley Sessions as its first head. The division was divided into four sections, Bible and Modern Scripture (Sperry as head), Church Organization and Administration (Wesley Lloyd as head), Church History (Swensen as head) and Theology (Sessions as head). In 1946 the BYU Department of Archeology was organized as part of the Division of Religious Instruction. In About 1953 that department was moved to the BYU College of Humanities and Social Sciences. The section or department of theology was renamed in 1952 to the Department of Theology and Religious Philosophy. Its name was shortened to Department of Theology and Philosophy. In 1959 the Division of Religious Instruction was renamed to the College of Religious Instruction. David H. Yarn, an alumnus of BYU and Columbia University was chosen as the first dean. All the departments were reformatted or renamed at this point. The Bible and Modern Scripture Department retained its name, but a new Biblical Languages department was formed that absorbed some of that departments old components. The Theology and Philosophy and the Church History departments were merged into the History and Philosophy of Religions Department. The Church Organization and Administration Department was renamed the LDS Theology, Church Organizations and Administration Department. This last was the shortest lived of the changes, it was renamed in 1961 to the Theology and Church Administration Department. In 1964 the college was reduced to two departments. Biblical Literature was moved to the BYU College of Humanities. The remaining departments were re-organized into the Undergraduate Studies in Religious Instruction and the Graduate Studies in Religious Instruction Departments. This organization persisted until 1973 when the College was again renamed to being the Department of Ancient Scripture and the Department of Church History and Doctrine. In 1969 BYU created a philosophy department outside of the College of Religious Instruction. The 1973 organization of the current departments also saw the program designated as Religious Instruction with no other modifiers.

McDonald was born at Penguin in Tasmania to building contractor Warren Patrick McDonald and Christina Louise Gaffney. He grew up in Strahan and was educated at Hadspen State School before winning a scholarship to Launceston Church Grammar School. He gained another scholarship, this time to the University of Tasmania, at the age of 17 but worked as a cadet-engineer with the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Department until he could take up the scholarship at 18. Having found his vocation, he relinquished his place (having intended to study medicine) and in 1925 moved to Camperdown in Victoria. Called to supervise residential construction in Canberra, McDonald moved to the capital permanently. He married tailoress Christina Helen Sullivan on 14 December 1927 at St Patrick's Catholic Church in Sydney, and later that year won the contract for the section of the Federal Highway from Canberra to Goulburn. He took over the family business in 1936 after his father's death and in 1948 established McDonald Industries Ltd. Following the outbreak of World War II, McDonald enlisted in the militia on 5 October 1939 as a sapper. He was commissioned in the Australian Imperial Force in January 1940 and sent to the Middle East with the 7th Divisional Engineers, being promoted to lieutenant colonel in March 1942 and serving as chief engineer in the Papua campaign. He was temporary brigadier of the II Corps in Bougainville from June to October 1945 before transferring to the Reserve of Officers on 7 December. He was mentioned in dispatches in 1947. McDonald ran unsuccessfully for the Country Party in the 1946 federal election, a fact which did not prevent the Chifley government appointing him to advise the prices commissioner in 1947. The Menzies Liberal Government appointed him to the Australian National Airlines Commission in 1952, operator of Trans Australia Airlines, of which he was chairman by February 1957. In 1959 he became the first chairman of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, and strongly supported further development of northern Australia and increasing and broadening Australian exports. McDonald served on the council of the Australian National University from 1953 to 1964 and was important in the foundation of the National Heart Foundation, of which he was first president (1959-64); the Foundation honours him with the Warren McDonald Research Fellowship. McDonald was a keen sportsman who represented the Australian Capital Territory in cricket and Australian Rules football. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1957 and elevated to Knight in 1964. He died at Lewisham in Sydney in 1965 of cerebral thrombosis and is buried in Canberra.

Godfrey was born in Battersea in London to schoolteacher Francis George Godfrey and Millie, n√©e Fuller. He was educated at Strand School and won a mathematics scholarship to Queens' College, Cambridge, from which he received a Bachelor of Arts in 1926 (and later a Master of Arts in 1972). During the general strike in 1926, he enlisted as a special constable. In 1927, he emigrated to Australia, arriving in 1927 in Melbourne. He taught mathematics for a term at Essendon High School before being employed by The Argus in May. In 1930, he moved to Sydney to work for the afternoon broadsheet the Sun, of which he became a sub-editor (1943) and relieving editor. He married a clerk, Phyllis Berenice Alethia Carling, at St Augustine's Church of England in Neutral Bay on 21 June 1932. In 1927, Godfrey joined the Australian Journalists' Association (AJA); he was elected to the state committee in 1934 and 1940, and was state president from 1941-1953 during which time he federally implemented a code of ethics. He was awarded the gold honour badge in 1944. Godfrey was elected federal president of the AJA in 1963, serving until 1974. He was a long-term campaigner for the Australian Press Council, which was finally established in 1976. Godfrey was also a prominent figure in the Australian Labor Party; he became president in 1944 of the Mosman branch in one of Sydney's least Labor-friendly areas. He edited the Labor Digest from 1945 to 1946, was elected a party conference delegate in 1946 and was on the state executive from 1959 to 1971. Godfrey was also a member of the Fabian Society. In 1955, he came to the rescue of federal leader Bert Evatt by providing him with membership of the Mosman branch after Evatt's leadership was not renewed. Godfrey wrote a column for the A.L.P. News in the early 1960s. He published a series of articles on democratic socialism for the A.L.P. Journal from 1960 to 1968. An anti-censorship campaigner, Godfrey had rallied against the imprisonment of Robert Close for obscene libel in 1948, opposed Robert Menzies' attempt to dissolve the Communist Party in 1950, and objected to the barring of Russian journalist Vadim Nekrasov in 1963. In the later years of his federal presidency, Godfrey opposed the more militant unionists who opposed the close relationship between the union and media proprietors. He retired from the Sun in 1971 and worked for the North Shore Times from 1976 to 1986. Appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1972, Godfrey was also a Freemason. He died at Mosman in 1989 and was cremated.

Ashkanasy was born Moshe Ashckinasy at Mile End Old Town in London to Palestinian-born tailor's cutter Solomon Ashckinasy and Annie, n√©e Cohen, who was born in Russia. They emigrated to Australia in 1910 and lived in Melbourne, where Solomon worked as a scholar and Annie sold clothes. Maurice attended state schools including Melbourne High School before studying law at the University of Melbourne, receiving a Bachelor of Law in 1923 and a Master of Law in 1924. Admitted to the bar in 1924 having read with his lifelong friend Robert Menzies, he took silk in 1940. He married Heather Helen Epstein at East Melbourne Synagogue on 29 June 1927. Ashkanasy was transferred to the Australian Imperial Force from the Reserve on 2 July 1940 as a lieutenant and embarked on 3 February 1941 for Singapore with the 8th Division. He was the deputy adjutant-general and legal officer for the AIF in Malaya and in October was promoted major. Following the fall of Singapore in February 1942, Ashkanasy led a small group in an audacious escape, ultimately reaching Fremantle in Western Australia via the Netherlands East Indies. Now a lieutenant colonel, Ashkanasy served in New Guinea and was mentioned in dispatches. He retired from active duty in September 1944 and returned to the reserve in February 1945 as an honorary colonel. Returning to the Bar, Ashkanasy was elected vice-chairman of the Victorian Bar Council in March 1952 and served as chairman from 1953 to 1956. He was instrumental in the construction of the Owen Dixon Chambers and was chairman of the Victorian section of the International Commission of Jurists, of which he was also Australian vice-president. A member of the Labor Party, Ashkanasy twice contested federal elections unsuccessfully, in 1946 (for the seat of Balaclava) and 1958 (for the Senate). Prior to the 1961 election Ashkanasy lost an acrimonious ALP Senate preselection contest to Sam Cohen, who became the first Jew elected to the Senate. Ashkanasy was aligned with the Labor Right faction and Cohen with the Labor Left faction. Ashkanasy was also a leader in the Australian Jewish community and had been one of the founders of the Judaean League, a Jewish youth group. He was the founding president of the Victorian Jewish Board of Deputies in 1947 and served five times as president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. Ashkanasy was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1961. He died at Frankston of heart disease in 1971 and was buried in Springvale Cemetery; he is commemorated with a national Jewish award. Personal Ashkanasy had three children; Vivianne de Vahl Davis, Neville Ashkanasy and Neal Ashkanasy.

It is the one of the largest B2B-cross-border e-commerce trade platforms in China. The company is based in Beijing and has offices worldwide, including in the USA and UK. History DHgate was founded by Diane Wang in Beijing in August 2004 and was officially launched in 2005. The \\"DH\\" in DHgate refers to Dunhuang (Mandarin Êï¶ÁÖå (D≈´nhu√°ng)), a Chinese city in modern-day Gansu province and formerly a strategic point on the Silk Road which linked China to the rest of the world during ancient times. The name alludes to the company's place as a modern, online version of the Silk Road linking SMEs between China and abroad. Early on, the company struggled to remain profitable, but capital investments in 2006 and 2007 helped DHGate remain afloat. In 2008, it was listed 7th on the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 for the Asia Pacific region. By the following year, it had over 1 million registered users worldwide. In January 2013, DHgate began assisting small & medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam with exporting goods internationally. Prior to this, the company had primarily worked to connect Chinese SMEs with foreign buyers. DHgate also became the first Chinese cross- border e-commerce company to provide internet financial services. An April 2014 report by the International Finance Corporation advised Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies to follow the company's model. DHgate's founder and CEO, Diane Wang, had been a member of the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) since 2011. In February 2015, access to DHgate was added to the Shopify platform. In November 2015, DHgate helped facilitate a bilateral e-commerce treaty between Turkey and China at a ceremony during the G20 summit in Antalya that was attended by leaders of both nations and Diane Wang. The agreement was signed as a part of China's Belt and Road Initiative. A Sino- Turkish e-commerce platform was established by DHgate (in conjunction with Chongqing Logistics City) in April 2016. In 2017, the company began developing physical stores called Digital Trade Centers (DTCs), which were designed to allow retailers and wholesalers to inspect products prior to purchasing them. By the end of 2017, it had set up DTCs in the United States, Hungary, Australia, Spain, Russia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Peru. In 2019, DHgate began helping Japanese SMEs sell their products through the platform, and continued its strategy in Turkey to enable suppliers in the country to sell online. Operation DHgate.com is a cross-border business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce platform that links primarily Chinese SMEs to businesses and individuals worldwide. As of June 30 2020, the platform had 31 million global registered buyers, 2.2 million in sellers and other countries from over 220 countries and regions, and 32 million products available. The website sells numerous products, including a range of electronics, apparel, and health and beauty items, among many others. It is considered the largest digital platform in China that focuses exclusively on B2B transactions, and is available in 8 languages including Chinese, English, Russian, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Italian, and French. DHgate also operates physical locations known as Digital Trade Centers (DTCs) in which prospective clients can inspect goods before ordering. DTCs are located in numerous countries globally. In 2020, DHgate launched MyyShop, a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product to build a decentralized cross-border e-commerce industry. Facing the COVID-19 crisis, DHgate accelerated the digital transformation of international traders, connecting global buyers with virtual exhibitions.

Architecture The eight-story brick and masonry building has been described as a \\"gem\\" and a gorgeous example of Art Nouveau architecture. Eschewing the then-popular Beaux Arts style, this is one of the few and possibly the earliest Art Nouveau building in Manhattan still standing. Four squat rounded Doric columns seem to support five stories with three vertical rows of large windows separated by brickwork and iron ornamentation, culminating in three large arches at the sixth floor. This is topped with a two-story copper fronted mansard roof, now coated with verdigris, reminiscent of Parisian architecture. The building is served by a freight elevator and two passenger elevators. Average floor size is .Metro Manhattan Office Space, accessed July 22, 2011 The building goes through the block west of Broadway so that it also fronts on Mercer Street, which is parallel to Broadway. Sources differ as to the architect, developer, and year of construction. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, in its 1973 report on the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District, says the building, at 495 Broadway, was designed by Alfred Zucker for Augustus D. Juilliard and was completed in 1893. Several other sources shown below say the building was designed by Buchman & Deisler for Jeremiah C. Lyons, who had previously developed real estate in other areas of Manhattan, and was completed in 1897. However, many of these same sources mistakenly show the address as 491 Broadway. The Landmarks Preservation Commission says 491 Broadway, the somewhat thinner 12-story building adjacent to the south of the New Era Building, is the 1897 Buchman & Deisler building. History Although its lofts were originally intended for the New Era Printing Company, the building was soon occupied by an office of the Butler Brothers company, an early mail-order business that had 100,000 customers at the time they moved in. Later, in 1927, they began franchising the Ben Franklin Stores.Daytonian in Manhattan blog, accessed July 21, 2011 At the time this building opened, fashionable retail businesses were already moving further uptown. Soon the area was home to businesses such as manufacturers and waste paper dealers. On December 29, 1927, a fire in the building caused one million dollars worth of damage. The fire burned for two hours before being noticed and caused the partial collapse of eight floors toward the rear, or Mercer Street side, of the building. The fire began among some crates in the company's basement shipping room. The collapse was caused when three unprotected 14-inch diameter hollow cast iron support columns buckled because of excessive heat, bring down the eight stories above. Fire-resistant insulation might have prevented the collapse.\\"Killing Fires High in the Air\\", Popular Science Monthly, December 1928, p. 50 As of 2011, tenants included a clothing retailer, fashion consultants, a publisher, a golf and fitness club, a retail drug store, and the Swiss Institute.

The species is known from late Eocene, Priabonian stage, lake deposits of the Florissant Formation in Teller County, Colorado, United States. It was first described by Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell in 1922. History and classification Hydriomena? protrita is known only from one fossil, the holotype, specimen \\"AMNH-FI-19033\\". It is a single, complete forewing, preserved as a compression fossil in fine grained shale. The shale specimen is one of a group of fossils obtained in 1909 by George F. Sternberg, Terry Duce, and Willard Rusk from the Florissant Formation, named for its outcrop around Florissant, Colorado. The type specimen is currently preserved in the paleoentomological collections housed in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. H.? protrita was first studied by Dr. Theodore D. A. Cockerell of the University of Colorado, with his 1922 type description being published in the journal American Museum Novitates. Though Cockerell did not provide an explicit explanation for the specific epithet protrita. The description of the specimen was delayed for five years due expectation that the description of the fossil would be completed by another researcher in 1910. However, after the description failed to be presented, Cockerell wrote the American Museum Novitates article rather than let the fossil continue to go undescribed. At the time of description, the Florissant Formation was considered to be Miocene in age. Further refinement of the formation's dating has resulted in an age of 34 million years. This places the formation in the Eocene Priabonian stage. Description The holotype forewing of Hydriomena? protrita is about in length with a outer margin, a lower margin and the color patterning faintly preserved. The wing has a checkered patterning in the fringe along the hind margin; the costal area is dark in coloration and broken by the antemedial band. Near the apical end of the costal cell is a distinct spot or pair of bars in a placement very similar to the antemedian mark of the modern species Hydriomena manzanita. The basal area of the wing is pallid, and the subbasal line is faint. The admedial band is similar to that of H. manzanita, but farther from the wing base and having a broader, less abrupt curvature. H.? protrita was the first member of the family Geometridae to be described from the American fossil record. The placement of H.? protrita is noted by Cockerell to be uncertain.

For a time, he was Visiting Fellow at Stanford University, California and a Research Fellow, King's College, Cambridge, England. Among the boats stored at the River Cam boathouse, King's College, Cambridge, include \\"Ted\\", the lightweight wooden scull named after Ted Bastin, who won races in it for King's from 1950 to 1953. Work Bastin‚Äôs research specialties included the foundations of physics, especially the discrete and finite aspects of quantum mechanics and relativity. He believed that a view of physical space in which space is defined not as a continuum but as a finite set of points was capable of resolving the clash between the continuum aspect of the classic theory of relativity and the discrete aspect of quantum physics. He was strongly influenced by Eddington's view that the various dimensionless and cosmological constants such as the fine structure constant had a unique status or significance as constraints upon the possible values of the natural atomic and cosmological constants of which they are ratios, and hence on all possible measurements. Along with Frederick Parker-Rhodes, Clive W. Kilmister and John Amson, Ted Bastin is noted for the discovery of, and research on applications of, the so-called combinatorial hierarchy which defines this view of space. While at the Cambridge Language Research Unit (founded by Margaret Masterman) he and Parker-Rhodes used Maurice Wilkes' EDSAC to compute the combinatorial hierarchy. However, the theory gave rise to no testable predictions and was generally regarded as too speculative. He was on firmer ground in his objection to the (then generally accepted) Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, and also to other conceptual difficulties, such as the nature and role of observation and measurement, which he regarded as contributing to logical muddle arising from confusing ontological and epistemological aspects of the theory. His assessment of the philosophical difficulties and obscurities in quantum theory that had to be overcome before any change in the basic structure could take place was penetrating; it was only his attempt to overcome the formal difficulties that failed. He collaborated with David Bohm to organize the \\"Quantum Theory and Beyond\\" colloquium at Cambridge University in July 1968, chaired by O. R. Frisch. The colloquium was sponsored by the Royal Society, Carnegie Institution of Science, and Theoria Inc., and resulted in a book by the same name. Bastin worked with David Bohm on other theoretical physics projects as well, particularly by having discussions with the latter on his theory of hidden variables in quantum theory. Bastin was a founding member, with H. Pierre Noyes, Clive W. Kilmister, John Amson and Frederick Parker-Rhodes, of the Alternative Natural Philosophy Association (ANPA), Cambridge, England. Their \\"first meeting was held in the autumn of 1979 at Prof. Kilmister's \\"Red Tiles Cottage \\" near Lewes, and near Thomas Paine's birthplace\\". ANPA Home Page The organization was joined in 1980 by David McGoveran and Tom Etter, among others. Meetings were first held annually at King's College, Cambridge and now continue annually at Westcott House.

It is threatened by the loss and degradation of its wetland habitat. It is a federally listed endangered species. This bulrush produces clumps of upright or leaning stems from a fibrous rhizome. The stems sometimes have axillary bulblets. The leaves are up to 68 cm long and are only about 1 cm wide. The inflorescences occur at the tips of the stems and sometimes from the uppermost leaf axil on the side of each stem. Each is made up of clusters of spikelets that are oval in shape and up to 0.5 cm long. They are covered in brown scales with green midribs. The flowers emerge from beneath the scales and the plant can be identified by the straight or curving toothed spines on the developing fruit.Scirpus ancistrochaetus. Flora of North America. Germination occurs around March and seedlings grow from the rhizomes in May. Flowering occurs in June and July and the fruits develop in July through September.Scirpus ancistrochaetus. The Nature Conservancy. This bulrush sometimes hybridizes with Scirpus hattorianus. This plant grows in a number of types of wetlands, especially those with variable water depths. These include beaver ponds that are shallow or deep, depending on the activity of beavers, sandy depressions and sinkholes that sometimes fill with groundwater, and sinkhole ponds in solid sandstone bedrock. The latter is the most common type of habitat in the southern portion of its range. Sinkhole ponds usually fill with water in the spring and dry out during the summer, but their hydrology is variable.Bartgis, R. L. (1992). The endangered sedge Scirpus ancistrochaetus and the flora of sinkhole ponds in Maryland and West Virginia. Castanea 57(1) 46. The bulrush grows at the water's edge, sometimes in a small amount of standing water, but it can be found away from the water or in deeper water up to about a depth of 90 cm. It has been observed experimentally that changes in water level affect the growth of the plant.Lentz, K. A. and W. A. Dunson. (1998). Water level affects growth of endangered northeastern bulrush, Scirpus ancistrochaetus Schuyler. Aquatic Botany 60(3) 213. The most common plant associates are threeway sedge (Dulichium arundinaceum), woolgrass (Scirpus cyperinus sens. lat.), rattlesnake mannagrass (Glyceria canadensis), and Virginia marsh St. Johns wort (Triadenum virginicum). Other plants in the habitat include American winterberry (Ilex verticillata), blue skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora), dogbane (Apocynum sp.), swamp rose (Rosa palustris), lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium), red maple (Acer rubrum), black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), white oak (Quercus alba), eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), yellow water lily (Nuphar advena), buttonwillow (Cephalanthus occidentalis), duckweed (Lemna minor), silvery sedge (Carex canescens), blister sedge (Carex vesicaria), tussock sedge (Carex stricta), squarestem spikerush (Eleocharis quadrangulata), cinnamon fern (Osmundastrum cinnamomeum), rice cutgrass (Leersia oryzoides), water knotweed (Persicaria amphibia), and water parsnip (Sium suave). The bulrush is threatened by the destruction and degradation of its habitat. This includes outright destruction as the land is cleared for development. It also includes damage to the habitat from road construction and maintenance, fire suppression activities, maintenance of power lines and other utilities, hydrocarbon development, and all-terrain vehicle use. The plant is affected by changes in the hydrology of its wetland habitat, including agricultural runoff and other surface water runoff contamination and dredging. Natural threats include beaver activity at beaver pond populations and trampling and browsing by larger animals such as deer. As of 2007 there were about 113 known populations of this species, about half of them in decline.

He attended University High School, Melbourne before working as a jackeroo and undergoing compulsory military training. Military career Fergusson enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 24 August 1914 and was posted to Egypt in the 1st Field Artillery Brigade. He was promoted from gunner to bombardier in March 1915, landing at Gallipoli on 25 April. He was hospitalised in England for enteric fever from September. In July 1916 he was sent to the Western Front. Fergusson was commissioned in December 1916 and promoted lieutenant in May 1917. Wounded at Messines on 7 June, he was mentioned in despatches. He was awarded the Military Cross (MC) after saving his battery's guns and many of his men near C√©risy-Gailly, winning a Bar to his MC for his actions from February to March. Injured in an accident in August, he was transferred to England and granted a disability pension, which he voluntarily surrendered in 1922. He married Effie Hazel Skinner at Southampton on 6 January 1916. After the termination of his commission on 25 March 1919, Fergusson and his wife returned to Australia. Fergusson farmed at Whittlesea from 1927 and was a local councillor from 1930 to 1934, serving from 1931 to 1932 as president. In 1932, he contested the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Evelyn as an independent United Australia Party candidate, but was defeated. Fergusson remained in the militia from 1926 to 1932 and rejoined in 1936. He was given command of the 8th Light Horse Regiment and promoted lieutenant colonel in 1939; on 13 October he returned to the AIF to take command of the 6th Divisional Reconnaissance Regiment. Posted to the Middle East from February 1940, Fergusson was wounded on 9 March 1941 at the siege of Giarabub in Libya and returned to Australia in June. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and again mentioned in despatches. He returned to active service in November, commanding the 2/17th Battalion from January to February 1942 in Syria. He returned to Australia in March and was promoted temporary brigadier in April, leading the 1st and 2nd Armoured and 2nd Infantry brigades from 1942 to 1944. Fergusson commanded the 8th Infantry Brigade from August 1944 in New Guinea, being mentioned in despatches a third time, and returned to Australia on 16 August 1945, where he was transferred to the Reserve as honorary brigadier. Later life Fergusson stood for the Senate as a Liberal Party candidate in 1946, but was defeated. He moved to Inverell in New South Wales in 1946 and to the property \\"Moreton Bay\\" in New South Wales in 1949, farming near Leadville. In 1966 he retired to Sydney. Fergusson died at Dunedoo in 1975 and was buried in Moreton Bay; his wife and four of his six sons survived him (one, Terence, had been killed in action in 1942 in Papua).

The painting and its companion piece, Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman, originally decorated Villa Lemmi, a country villa near Florence owned by Giovanni Tornabuoni, uncle of Lorenzo de' Medici and head of the Roman branch of the Medici Bank. They were probably commissioned for the 1486 wedding of Giovanni's son Lorenzo to Giovanna of the Albizzi family, and are therefore thought to depict the two. A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts depicts a young man, perhaps Lorenzo Tornabuoni, led by a personification of Grammar into a circle of allegorical figures representing the Seven Liberal Arts. Presided over by Prudentia, the circle also includes Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy and Music, each recognizable by means of various attributes. In antiquity, the liberal arts denoted the education worthy of a free person and the painting therefore testifies to the young man's broad education. The figure of Arithmetic is seen holding its hand out in greeting to the young man. Tornabuoni, a scion to a banking family, would have probably had an education focused on numbers. Both paintings were discovered at Villa Lemmi in 1873 under a coat of whitewash and removed from their original location. They are now in the Mus√©e du Louvre, Paris.

It aims to provide key information on the taxonomy, distribution and ecology of all marine species in the world apart from finfish. SeaLifeBase is in partnership with the WorldFish Center in Malaysia and the UBC Fisheries Centre at the University of British Columbia.SeaLifeBase (SLB FishBase Information and Research Group (FIN).

SeaLifeBase complements FishBase, which provides parallel information for finfish. History The origins of SeaLifeBase go back to the 1970s, when the fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly found himself struggling to test a hypothesis on how the growing ability of fish was affected by the size of their gills.Bakun A (2011) \\"The oxygen constraint\\" Pages 11‚Äì23. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective, Cambridge University Press. . Hypotheses, such as this one, could be tested only if large amounts of empirical data were available.Palomares MLD and Bailly N (2011) \\"Organizing and disseminating marine biodiversity information: the Fishbase and SeaLifeBase story\\" Pages 24‚Äì46. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective, Cambridge University Press. . At the time, fisheries management used analytical models which required estimates for fish growth and mortality.Monro JL (2011) \\"Assessment of exploited stock of tropical fishes: an overview\\" Pages 171‚Äì188. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective, Cambridge University Press. . Pauly believed that the only practical way fisheries managers could access the volume of data they needed was to assemble all the data available in the published literature into some central repository. This would mean that when a new hypothesis needs to be tested, the available data will already be there in a validated and accessible form, and there will be no need create a new dataset and then have to validate it.Froese R (2011) \\"The science in FishBase\\" Pages 47‚Äì54. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective, Cambridge University Press. . Pauly recruited Rainer Froese, and the beginnings of a software database along these lines was encoded in 1988. This database, initially confined to tropical fish, became the prototype for FishBase. FishBase was extended to cover all finfish, and is now the largest online database for fish in the world. Given FishBase's success, there was naturally a demand for a database covering forms of aquatic life other than finfish. This resulted, in 2006, in the birth of SeaLifeBase. The long-term goal of the project is develop an information system modelled on FishBase, but including all forms of aquatic life, both marine and freshwater, apart from the finfish which FishBase specialises in.

He did not attend school but worked in the Bogan River district as a shearer, wool-presser, sawmiller, tree-feller, fencer and miner. In 1905 he joined the Australian Workers' Union (AWU), and was later employed as a clerk in Sydney. He married Amy Forrest, a dressmaker, at the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Waterloo on 13 April 1914. An organiser for the AWU from 1920, he moved to Queensland in search of work in 1923. In 1924 Boland was the AWU's Western District organiser, holding various positions until becoming Far Northern District secretary in 1941. He was elected Queensland president of the AWU in 1947 and Queensland president of the Australian Labor Party in 1950, joining the federal executive. Boland, who also chaired the union's newspaper the Worker, was one of six Queensland delegates to the 1955 ALP federal conference in Hobart, where he was left to represent his state alone after the other five delegates, who included Premier Vince Gair and state treasurer Ted Walsh, boycotted the conference over a dispute concerning the Victorian delegation. Boland was an opponent of the Industrial Groups and supported the conference's resolution to withdraw party support from them. The anti-Grouper attack in Queensland was led by AWU president Joe Bukowski, allowing Boland to retain friendly relations with Gair and the others.

The Devas are no match for the mighty Banasura, who is under the protection of Shiva and are defeated in the ensuing battle. He further challenges Shiva, the very power under whose allegiance he defeated the Devas. Angered with Banasura‚Äôs arrogance, Shiva curses him that when the flag of his chariot falls without a reason, Sri Krishna will fight him and humble his pride. Usha, the beautiful daughter of Banasura, prays to Lord Shiva and Parvati who are posted at the entrance to her father‚Äôs fort and learns the art of dance from Parvati.

Moss was born near Numurkah to farmer Frederick George Moss and Isabella, n√©e Spiers. He attended local state schools and helped on his parents' property before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force on 1 February 1917. He served in the 12th Army Brigade of the Australian Field Artillery as a gunner on the Western Front, but was badly gassed in October 1918 and returned to Australia; he was discharged from the AIF on 19 February 1919. Returning to Victoria, Moss farmed wheat and wool at Numurkah and joined the Victorian Farmers' Union. In July 1930 he visited Canberra in his capacity as vice-president of the Victorian Wheat Growers' Association as a lobbyist, and joined the Australian Country Party in 1931. Moss opposed the pledge guaranteeing support for party policy instituted by the United Country Party and ran against the UCP's candidate John McEwen for the seat of Echuca in 1934 as the federal party's endorsed candidate. There was another split in 1938, when McEwen accepted office in the Lyons government; this time Moss supported McEwen and joined the breakaway Liberal Country Party. The parties were reunited in 1943 and Moss was involved in drafting the new constitution. He contested the Senate unsuccessfully in 1946. In 1949 Moss was elected state president of the Victorian Country Party, serving until 1952. He was appointed commissioner of the State Savings Bank of Victoria in 1951 and served as chairman in 1958, 1963 and 1968. He was a councillor of the Shire of Numurkah from 1939 to 1955 (president 1943) and was chairman of the Goulburn Regional Committee from 1944 to 1954.

The quake hypocenter was located beneath Villa Collemandina. The maximum felt intensity was rated as X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale, and 6.6 on the Richter magnitude scale. It was one of the most destructive seismic events recorded in the Apenninic region in the twentieth century. Due to good news coverage, availability of official documents on the damage and abundance of recordings from surveillance stations throughout Europe, it was regarded as a first-rate case study to improve knowledge of tectonics and macroseismic analysis. Geology The epicenter of the 1920 earthquake lay within the inner zone of the Northern Apennines, which has been affected by extensional tectonics since the Late Miocene to Pliocene epochs. This extension is a result of the same process that opened the Tyrrhenian Sea during the same period, the rollback of the subducting Adriatic Plate. The continuing extension has resulted in a series of northwest- southeast trending normal faults bounding basins filled by the Pliocene to recent sediments. Near Garfagnana, there are two such basins, the Serchio and Magra grabens. The 1920 event is thought to have ruptured the east-dipping Casciana-Sillicano fault on the southwestern boundary of the Serchio graben. Lunigiana and Garfagnana are part of the Apennines, a mountain area located above a subduction zone between the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian tectonic plates. The region, crossed by different systems of active faults, is mainly mountainous and rocky, with noticeable variations in soil composition. Earthquake Foreshocks occurred on September 6, including an intensity (VI (Strong)) event on September 6 at 2:05 p.m. Frightened by these foreshocks, many people choose to sleep outside their homes in the open air, since the weather was still mild in the late summer. The main shock came at 7:55 a.m. (local time) the following morning, after a few hours of calm, its epicenter directly under the town of Villa Collemandina. The towns of Vigneta and Villa Collemandina were completely destroyed. Fivizzano, with its tall buildings in the city center, was almost totally demolished, those buildings that remained standing were later destroyed by the aftershocks. Piazza al Serchio and another 30 towns suffered substantial damage to buildings and infrastructure. Reports of collapsed buildings came from about 100 towns and over 350 comuni from eastern Liguria to western Versilia were affected. The earthquake was noticed by people in the French Riviera, Friuli, Marche and Umbria, over from the stricken area. Aftershocks lasted up until August 1921. Damage The earthquake wrought massive destruction. Near the epicenter, an area of about from Fivizzano in Lunigiana and the upper Garfagnana, received X (Extreme) damage, including the collapse of many buildings. Newspaper headlines read \\"Fivizzano is no more\\". A much bigger area, assessed at over , received significant damage, and minor damage was sustained by other regions in Toscana, Emilia Romagna and Liguria. Many provinces reported consequences from the shocks: nearby Lucca and Massa Carrara, Modena, Parma, Pisa, Pistoia, Reggio Emilia and La Spezia. In Pontremoli the shock destroyed the rooftop of the Chiesa della Misericordia church: debris fell on the ancient organ, damaging it. Roads near the epicenter were compromised, along with some bridges. Since rescue operations were mostly managed on a local scale (city or town, lacking any national coordinating authority), that was a minor detriment to relief work. More of a problem was the availability of first aid resources, which were scarce. There was also much less food and tents than what was needed. In the broader damaged area, some springs changed their path or became cloudy due to a sharp increase in the content of Hydrogen sulfide. On September 21, refugees were affected by an exceptionally violent downpour, further worsening their condition. The refugees asked Bishop Angelo Fiorini to intercede with the Pope, hopeful to receive some economic help or relief effort, but received only a blessing to the victims. On the other hand, many organizations of emigrants in the United States and Argentina managed to collect and send significant donations of money. ;Anomalies in distribution Isoseismic curves of the event displayed some anomalies in damage distribution. The town of Fosdinovo and its surroundings sustained only minor damage, despite being in the middle of an area of widespread destruction. Vigneta and Castiglioncello, both frazioni of Casola in Lunigiana, had very different fates: the first was completely devastated, while the latter experienced only a few cracks in the walls and some collapsed chimneys. Study on those anomalies led to a better understanding of the effect of ground composition on the transmission of seismic waves. Vigneta was built on alluvial ground, made of sand and cobbles. It turned out that the cobbles acted as an amplifier for the shock waves, multiplying their intensity and deflecting them in random directions. Sometimes, cobbles shattered, and the ground above was further destabilized. Castiglioncello was built on an extraordinarily compact limestone slab, which acted as a barrier that reflected shock waves. Resonance and shock-wave amplification phenomena, well understood today, were unknown at the time of the Garfagnana earthquake. Casualties One hundred and seventy one people died in the disaster, mostly from building collapses or being hit by falling debris. A further 650 were injured. Families left homeless numbered in the thousands. Thirty of the casualties and half the injured were concentrated in Fivizzano. Casualties could have been much higher without the precursor shocks scaring much of the populace into sleeping outdoors. Garfagnana and Lunigiana were mostly farming areas, so at the time of the disaster, most men were out in mountain pastures or going to their fields, leaving their wives and children at home. Aftermath The rebuilding took over ten years. Property speculation was reported in Fivizzano, where well-off local people bought up plots from those without the means of rebuilding their homes. Reconstruction, lacking a town plan, was messy and disorganized. In Fivizzano, the ancient San Giovanni church ‚Äì built by ancestors of Pope Nicholas V ‚Äì sustained only partial damage to the roof, but was nevertheless demolished, along with a Medici palace and the Teatro degli Imperfetti theater, in the rush to take advantage of the disaster; new housing and commercial buildings were erected on the valuable lots formerly occupied by the monuments. Previous events As is common in central Italy, many towns are built on steep hillside or along deep valleys. The region is rated as second and third class on a four-class scale of seismicity, according to the Italian building code (four being the highest). Despite being inhabited since ancient times, the region experienced rapid colonization in the Middle Ages, thanks to agricultural techniques allowing the exploitation of the steep hills and to the new wealth acquired by the nearby Republic of Florence. According to records made by Bartolomeo Pucci, captain of Florence's army, the town of Fivizzano was struck by a major earthquake in 1481, with an intensity estimated at VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli scale. The town experienced extensive damage, but few or no other records were preserved in the small town. Until the nineteenth century, it was a common occurrence for city leaders to downplay the disasters striking their lands to avoid giving nearby rival cities any incentive to declare war. On June 9, 1545, Borgo Val di Taro was destroyed by another earthquake. From June 8 to 10, 1641, two medium-sized shocks hit nearby Pontremoli, causing damage to many buildings, as recorded in the Memorie Pontremolesi chronicles. On July 23, 1746, an earthquake hit the town of Barga. On January 21, 1767, Fivizzano was struck again, as was Pontremoli on February 14, 1834. Fivizzano was struck again on October 15, 1939, but while the energy release of the quake was larger, the hypocenter was much deeper (between 20 and 26 kilometres, or 12 to 16 mi, down) and damage was significant, but limited. On October 25, 1957, Pontremoli and Borgotaro were struck again by a very powerful quake. As its hypocenter was over deep, the shock was felt across the whole of northern Italy, but caused little damage. Between 1740 and 2000, the Garfagnana region experienced 16 earthquakes rated as \\"strong\\" or above (VI or greater on the Mercalli scale).

Early life James Cantey was born on December 30, 1818 in Camden, South Carolina. After graduating from South Carolina College, where he was a member of the Euphradian Society, he studied law and was admitted to the state bar in 1840, and set up practice in Camden. Cantey became politically active and was elected to two terms from Kershaw County as a state legislator in South Carolina, starting November 23, 1846.

Cantey offered to free the man, but he refused.Historical Marker Database After the end of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Cantey moved to Alabama, where he bought land and became a planter in Russell County.Warner, Ezra J.

Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1959. . p. 43 American Civil War James Cantey helped form and was elected colonel of the 15th Alabama Infantry Regiment in 1861, in which he organized \\"Cantey's Rifles\\". In 1862, he led the regiment in Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign. At the First Battle of Winchester, on May 25, 1862, Cantey's regiment fought in Brigadier General Isaac Trimble's brigade of Major General Richard S. Ewell's division and helped turn back the Union Army advance. At the Battle of Cross Keys, the 15th Alabama Infantry was nearly cut off from the main force but fought their way back. Later, as part of Trimble's attack, the 15th Regiment Alabama Infantry helped flank the Union force and drive them back. The regiment fought with Jackson in the Seven Days Battles in the Richmond, Virginia area. Thereafter, Cantey was detachedLt. Col. William C. Oates succeeded Cantey as regimental commander and led the regiment on its famous charge up Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg and sent to Mobile, Alabama from January 1863 through April 1864,Eicher, John H., and David J.

He was appointed a brigadier general to rank from January 8, 1863. He was frequently absent from his command due to illness but also led a division for short period of time in May and June 1864. His brigade fought in the Atlanta Campaign and Franklin‚ÄìNashville Campaign (Hood's Tennessee Campaign). When present, he led the brigade with distinction, such as when his brigade held off a much larger Union force at the Battle of Resaca, Georgia. CanteyAlthough Longacre states that Cantey was in the Carolinas Campaign, Sifakis, Stewart. Who Was Who in the Civil War. New York: Facts On File, 1988. . p. 104 states that Cantey does not appear to have been engaged in any major action after June 1864. and his brigade fought at General Joseph E. Johnston's last battle, the Battle of Bentonville, North Carolina. Cantey's brigade surrendered with Johnston's forces at Durham Station, North Carolina. Although Longacre (1986) states that Cantey surrendered with Johnston, Eicher (2001) and Warner (1959) state that no record of Brigadier General Cantey's capture or parole has been found. Aftermath After the Civil War, James Cantey returned to work his plantation near Fort Mitchell, Alabama. He died at the plantation on June 30, 1874. Cantey is buried in the Crowell family cemetery at Fort Mitchell, Alabama. See also * List of American Civil War generals (Confederate) Notes References * Boatner, Mark Mayo, III.

Life and career Frank Browne was born in the Sydney suburb of Coogee to New Zealand-born tailor Courtney Brown and Linda Veronica, n√©e Heckenberg. He attended Christian Brothers' College in Waverley and went on to enter the Royal Military College, having failed to win a bursary for university. In August 1935 he was discharged and described as \\"temperamentally unsuited to the military profession\\"; Browne would later claim that he was in fact expelled as a result of an affair with an officer's wife. He also claimed (falsely) to have won a \\"gold pocket\\" for sporting excellence. After leaving the military Browne became a cadet journalist on Smith's Weekly and then travelled to the United States, writing for the Chicago Tribune. He boxed professionally as \\"Buzz Brown\\" in the featherweight division. It was later rumoured that he had served with communist forces in the Spanish Civil War in 1937, receiving a Soviet decoration after his wounding, a fact he later refused to confirm or deny. He returned to Sydney in 1938. Browne, now a greyhound racing correspondent for The Daily Mirror, enlisted in the Citizen Military Forces in January 1942, serving in anti-tank regiments and then with the North Australia Observer Unit as a commissioned lieutenant. He married Marie Katherine Ormston, a musician, on 19 September 1942 at St Mary's Cathedral, and was declared medically unfit for service on 10 February 1943. Browne then became involved in politics, contesting the 1943 federal election for the United Australia Party against H. V. Evatt in the seat of Barton. He contested the state seat of Bondi in 1944 for the Democratic Party and then Vaucluse in 1947 as an Independent Liberal. A Liberal Party branch president in 1945, his attempt to form a Young Liberals' League was met with disbandment. As a result of these setbacks he grew to dislike most politicians, with the notable exception of Billy Hughes. In 1946 Browne established a weekly subscriber newspaper, Things I Hear, an often scandalous political gossip publication that John Gorton referred to as \\"Things I Smear\\". He infuriated politicians of all parties, despite sometimes providing astute political analysis. He published a biography of Billy Hughes in 1946, and in 1947 wrote an attack on bureaucracy and the trend towards nationalisation titled The Public Be Damned!. The reviewer for the Sydney Daily Telegraph, Emery Barcs, while praising it as \\"interesting, amusing and thought- producing\\", said Browne's \\"unbalanced and often quite illogical and unreasonable emotionalism\\" weakened what would otherwise have been an important book. Browne is best remembered for his involvement in a parliamentary privilege case in 1955. Labor MP Charles Morgan began the affair in May by objecting in parliament to a reference made in the Bankstown Observer (of which Browne was the editor) alleging his involvement in \\"an immigration racket\\". The standing committee on parliamentary privilege found Browne and the Observer's owner, Raymond Fitzpatrick, in breach of said privilege, and the two were called before the Bar of the House on 20 June. Before the Bar, Browne spoke passionately about freedom of speech; his address prompted rare bipartisan unity, with Prime Minister Robert Menzies describing it as \\"an exhibition of unparalleled arrogance and impertinence\\" and deputy Opposition Leader Arthur Calwell describing Browne as \\"an arrogant rat\\". The House voted 55 to 11 that Browne should be imprisoned for three months, and he was sent to Goulburn Gaol. It was the first time anyone had ever been called to the Bar of the lower house, and it was the only time the Parliament has ever jailed anyone.Gavin Souter, Acts of Parliament, pp. 431-433 Browne formed the Australian Party on his release, which enjoyed little success, and in the 1960s wrote a column for the Daily Mirror. He contested the Australian Senate unsuccessfully in 1974, and continued publishing Things I Hear until 1977. In that year he travelled to Rhodesia to work for Ian Smith. He died in the Sydney suburb of Darlinghurst in 1981 of liver cirrhosis and was cremated. Books *They Called Him Billy: A Biography of the Rt. Hon. W.M. Hughes, P.C., M.P.

He was one of the first Australians to enjoy success as a film actor in Hollywood. Biography Early life Born Henry Raymond Shirley in Hobart to civil servant Henry Shirley and Sarah Ann, n√©e Morton, he was baptised Arthur and attended Catholic schools. He then worked for Tattersall's Lottery and as a junior solicitor's clerk, when at age sixteen he decided to join a semi-professional troupe of entertainers which toured Tasmania in a two horse caravan.Graham Shirley, 'Arthur Shirley of Sydney Australia', Shirley Family Association accessed 24 March 2012 In 1904 Shirley moved to Melbourne. For a time he worked as door-to-door salesman for a wholesale grocery firm, then he became a novice in a Sydney seminary, but left it in 1905 to try and break into theatre. His first role was a three-line part in Sweet Nell of Old Drury (1905), starring Nellie Stewart at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne. He spent the next two years touring Victoria and New South Wales with the John Cosgrove Company, after which he worked for other theatre entrepreneurs, including William Anderson, George Marlow, Beaumont Smith and George Willoughby. In 1909 he announced he was going to star in a play especially written for him, an early indication of Shirley's later flair for self-promotion. Shirley owed money to a Miss Tindall, a debt which saw him be declared bankrupt at his own petition in December 1913. He struggled with financial difficulties before winning the leads in two films, The Silence of Dean Maitland and The Shepherd of the Southern Cross, both opening in 1914; the first was a success. On 22 December 1913 Shirley married New Zealand singer Ellen Newcomb Hall at St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney; they would separate in 1920 and divorce in 1940. Willoughby lawsuit In Christmas 1913 Shirley was working for George Willoughby, who issued a notice to his company that their engagements would terminate at a certain date. Willougby offered Shirley another contract at ¬£4 10 a week but Shirley insisted on ¬£6. Shirley then contacted J.C. Williamson Ltd and said he obtained a position there. A day or two later, Williamsons withdrew their offer to Shirley on the basis that Willoughby had told them he was still under contact to the latter. According to Shirley, Willoughby told him that if he didn't work for the producer, he would make sure Shirley was blacklisted in the industry. Shirley responded by suing Willoughby for ¬£1,000 in damages. Willoughby argued that Shirley had no contract with Williamsons and was supported by E.J. Tait, managing director of Williamsons. The judge ruled that Tait had been guilty of perjury and the jury awarded Shirley ¬£500 in damages. Willoughby appealed the decision, asking for it to be set aside, and the Judge suggested the parties come to a settlement, which was done. The money he earned from the lawsuit enabled Shirley to pay off his debts and he appears to have had his bankruptcy discharged. However, Shirley felt his career as a stage actor in Australia had been greatly hurt by taking on two of its most powerful producers and he decided to try his luck overseas. US career In June 1914 Shirley and his wife moved to the United States, where he was signed by Kalem Company in their New York studios. He then went to work in their Glendale studio where he played a detective hero.http://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog/motionpicturenew131unse_0648 He later signed to Universal Studios. He won roles in One Man's Evil (1915), Bawb O' Blue Ridge (1916), The Fall of a Nation (1916) and Branding Broadway (1918) alongside William S. Hart. Of these movies, The Fall of a Nation is the best known, being a sequel to The Birth of a Nation (1914), but Shirley also acted opposite such stars as Lon Chaney, Sr. and Mae Murray. Shirley also ran a photography business on Hollywood Boulevard, where he was a pioneer in the use of artificial lighting for portraiture, and three-dimensional rather that painted backgrounds. He claimed it was a photograph he took of Rudolph Valentino dancing which helped that actor be cast in Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921), and thus become a star. Return home Shirley returned to Sydney in April 1920 to found his own company, setting up at Rose Bay with the slogan \\"Moving Pictures Made in Australia for the World\\". Although one movie, The Throwback, did begin production, he did not complete it and Shirley was declared bankrupt again in 1925 after a court action by his cinematographer, Ernest Higgins. He managed to recover, playing Steve Gunn in a stage adaptation of The Sentimental Bloke in 1923 and setting up Pyramid Pictures to produce a film based on The Mystery of a Hansom Cab (1925). This was a large hit and remains his greatest achievement. He also wrote, produced, directed and starred in The Sealed Room in 1926 which was less successful. Final years Shirley relocated to London in 1927, and tried to exhibit his two directorial efforts to UK audiences, but was not allowed until he paid the requisite duty. He did not have the funds so this did not eventuate. He also announced he intended to form Australian National Films, Ltd., with a capital of ¬£600,000, to act as film producers, and as distributors of British films throughout Australia and New Zealand. A company of that name was incorporated the following year but Shirley instead attempted to start a film industry in Rhodesia, starting with a project called Sons of Rhodesia. This did not work out and in September 1930 he moved to Hollywood, where he was arrested in February 1932 for overstaying his visa;\\"ACTOR ESCAPES ALIEN OUSTING: Arthur Shirley Will Not Be Deported Exceptional Circumstances Cited by Government Jailed Australian Must Leave by March 15\\" Los Angeles Times 12 Feb 1932: A5. however he later obtained permission to stay.\\"Veteran Actor Gets Permission to Remain Here\\" Los Angeles Times 16 Mar 1932: A10. He married Frances Clayton in 1934, apparently believing his first wife to be dead, but returned alone to Sydney later in August that year. When he came off the boat, Shirley was interviewed by police, who wanted to know if he had been deported. He later sued the two offices involved for ¬£5,000 for assault and wrongful arrest but lost the case. In 1938 Shirley announced he was going to produce a film in Tasmania called Wings of Love but this did not eventuate. He adopted a son in 1940, and contested the 1943 federal election as an independent candidate for East Sydney. He ran on a platform of the abolition of the entertainment tax and safeguarding of personal liberties, among other things. His campaign manager was arrested during the campaign. Shirley lost the election. Shirley devoted his retirement to archaeology and ancient Egypt. He died at Rose Bay in 1967 and was buried at Waverley Cemetery.

She attended Cleveland Street Public School and Mis Somerville's Ladies' College and worked for the Liberal and Reform Association. She became general secretary and organiser of the Australian Women's National League in 1911 before returning to Sydney in 1913 to work for the Liberal Association of New South Wales. On 14 March 1917 she married Andrew William Glencross at St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, moving to Stawell later that year and vigorously supporting the pro-conscription campaign. Glencross was appointed honorary director of the prohibitionist Strength of Empire Movement in 1918, and worked for various temperance organisations. She became president of the Housewives' Association of Victoria in 1920 and president of the Federated Housewives' Association of Australia in 1923, working for a lower cost of living. From 1927 to 1928 she was president of the National Council of Women of Victoria, having assisted in the formation of the Victorian Women Citizens' Movement in 1922. She unsuccessfully ran for public office three times as an independent candidate: for Henty federally in 1922, Brighton at state level in 1928, and Martin federally in 1943. In 1927 she was one of the first female justices of the peace in Victoria. Glencross moved to Sydney in 1928 after her appointment to the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board, but the Scullin government did not reappoint her in 1929.

Despite wider evidence of wrongdoing, the News of the World royal phone hacking scandal appeared resolved with the 2007 conviction of the News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman and the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, and the resignation of editor Andy Coulson. However, a series of civil legal cases and investigations by newspapers, parliament and the police ultimately saw evidence of \\"industrial scale\\" phone hacking, leading to the closure of the News of the World on 10 July 2011. However, the affair did not end there, developing into the News Corporation ethics scandal as wrongdoing beyond the News of the World (including the United States) and beyond phone hacking (including paying police for information) came to light. Civil legal cases The News of the World royal phone hacking scandal had raised evidence of victims being targeted outside the Royal Family, but this evidence did not lead to criminal proceedings. In lieu of criminal proceedings, several public figures commenced litigation against the News of the Worlds owner News International and against the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. Those who began legal action included the football agent Sky Andrew, actress Sienna Miller, actor Steve Coogan, television presenter Chris Tarrant and football pundit Andy Gray. In December 2009, footballer Sol Campbell instructed his solicitor to contact the police in response to various media reports. The Max Clifford case, which in early 2010 had appeared to make likely the disclosure of previously secret News of the World documents, was settled out of court in March 2010, keeping the documents secret. The next month, reports of further legal action against the News of the World emerged. Those considering litigation against the paper included a football agent and ten MPs. The legal action re-opened the possibility of details emerging that the settlement with Clifford had kept secret.The Observer, 25 April 2010, New claims of phone hacking put pressure on Andy Coulson Max Clifford case, 2010 In March 2010 the News of the World settled out-of-court a case brought against it by publicist Max Clifford for intercepting his voicemail. After a lunch with Rebekah Brooks, the paper agreed to pay Clifford's legal fees and an undisclosed \\"personal payment\\" not described as damages, with the sum exceeding ¬£1 million. The money was paid in exchange for Clifford giving the News of the World exclusive stories over the next several years. The case had been expected to reveal the details of previous settlements the paper had made, including the ¬£1 million spent in 2009, settling with three phone hacking victims, and the unfair dismissal claim won by Clive Goodman.The Guardian, 9 March 2010, Max Clifford drops News of the World phone hacking action in ¬£1m deal Clifford had won court rulings in February earlier that year that meant that the News of the World would have had to disclose previously secret information regarding which journalists were involved in hacking voicemail messages. A judge ruled that Glenn Mulcaire had to disclose the names of all the journalists who targeted Clifford and also those who received transcripts of the messages. With the eventual settlement, however, the information was not made public. HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan A report aired on Channel 4's Dispatches in October included remarks made by an unnamed source said to have been a former senior journalist at the News of the World who had worked alongside Coulson. The source alleged that Coulson had personally listened to messages obtained through phone hacking. In December 2010, Coulson ‚Äì while under oath as a witness in HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan ‚Äì denied any knowledge of phone hacking at the News of the World or that he knew the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. The following day, the Crown Prosecution Service said that it had determined that there was insufficient evidence to charge Coulson over allegations that he was aware of phone hacking at the publication. The CPS said that witnesses interviewed by the Metropolitan Police ‚Äì including those who had previously made allegations through media outlets ‚Äì had not been willing to provide admissible evidence. Sienna Miller case New allegations about the conduct of News of the World executives emerged in December 2010. Papers lodged in the High Court by lawyers acting for Sienna Miller claimed to have uncovered evidence of the involvement of Ian Edmondson, a senior editor at the paper, in work undertaken by Mulcaire. Newspaper investigations The Guardian 2009 Beginning on 8 July 2009, The Guardian made a series of allegations that the phone hacking activities at the News of the World went far beyond the activities for which the News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman was jailed in 2007, those activities being limited to members of the royal household. The paper alleged that hacking victims included public figures such as former deputy prime minister John Prescott, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, Tessa Jowell when she was Olympics Secretary, Boris Johnson when he was the opposition's spokesman on higher education, publicist Max Clifford and even Rebekah Brooks, then editor of the News of the Worlds sister paper The Sun. In addition to this The Guardian reported that News Group - the News of the World's parent company - paid out more than ¬£1m to settle legal cases that threatened to reveal evidence of News of the World journalists using criminal methods (accessing mobile phone voicemails of various public figures) to obtain stories.Nick Davies, \\"Murdoch papers paid ¬£1m to gag phone-hacking victims\\", The Guardian, 8 July 2009 The article further reported sources as stating that News Group staff used private investigators to access several thousand mobile phone accounts. The News of the World denied The Guardians claims and its parent company, News Corporation, implored its competitor newspaper to share any evidence it had with police. Prescott in particular was outraged at the fact that the police did not inform him of the phone tapping, but Assistant Commissioner John Yates stated that there was no actual evidence that Prescott's phone had been tapped.\\"Prescott: Police decision 'so quick'\\". BBC News. Contrary to claims made by News of the World in 2007, The Guardian in July 2009 claimed that phone hacking activities were known to a range of staff at the tabloid including its then editor Andy Coulson. At the time The Guardian made these claims, Coulson had left News International and was director of Conservative Party communications and planning. Due to this, some claimed that the reporting was politically motivated. The Conservative Party was quick to stand by Coulson. The Guardian also reported that the News of the World had made payments in excess of ¬£1 million to three people subject to phone hacking, including Professional Footballers' Association chairman Gordon Taylor, with the out-of-court settlements subject to secrecy clauses.The Guardian, 9 December 2009, MPs' phone-hacking report delayed as Rebekah Brooks called to give evidence Around the same time, Private Eye revealed that The Guardian had, in order to avoid \\"all out war\\" with the News of the World, chosen not to tell the same Culture, Media and Sport Committee that the ¬£700,000 payment to Taylor was signed off in June 2008, by the directors of News Group Newspapers, the News International subsidiary owning the News of the World \\\\- thus showing awareness of the matter at the highest levels.Private Eye (1241) The reports led the Press Complaints Commission to reopen its inquiry into the matter (finding that it had not been \\"materially misled\\",The Guardian, 9 November 2009, PCC finds no evidence that it was misled in phone hacking inquiry leading The Guardians editor Alan Rusbridger to resign from the PCC) and the Culture, Media and Sport Committee to reopen its inquiry. 2010 In January 2010, The Guardian revealed the out of court payment to Goodman on grounds of settling an unfair dismissal case, and the later subsequent payment to Mulcaire. This started a new series of both newspaper stories, and subsequent further written questions from the Commons Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, to both News International and its executives. In February 2010, The Guardian reported that three mobile phone companies had discovered that the voicemails of over a hundred of their customers had been hacked. The companies identified the customers in 2007, after Scotland Yard disclosed numbers that had been accessed by Goodman and Mulcaire. A freedom of information request by The Guardian found that the police had recovered 91 PIN codes for accessing other people's voicemails in material seized from Mulcaire and Goodman. In April 2010, it was revealed from Crown Prosecution Service documents that although police had named only eight individuals in court, the Scotland Yard inquiry had actually uncovered over 4,000 names or partial names and nearly 3,000 full or partial telephone numbers from the materials seized from Mulcaire and Goodman.Nick Davies. \\"Police 'ignored News of the World phone hacking evidence'\\". The Guardian. 4 April 2010. In February 2010 The Guardian revealed that under Coulson the News of the World had rehired a private investigator shortly after his release from a seven-year prison sentence for blackmail. The News of the World had used the investigator prior to his imprisonment, at a time when Coulson was deputy editor. In February 2010, The Guardian could not name Jonathan Rees as he was involved in a new criminal trial.Nick Davies, guardian.co.uk, 24 February 2010, Andy Coulson hit by new tabloid trick charges In September 2010 The Guardian revealed that in 2009 plans by the Home Office to ask Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to review the police investigation into the phone hacking scandal were cancelled \\"after intense internal lobbying\\", with a senior Home Office official warning that the Metropolitan Police would \\"deeply resent\\" an inquiry.Nick Davies, Nicholas Watt and Vikram Dodd, guardian.co.uk, 6 September 2010, Phone-hacking inquiry was abandoned to avoid upsetting police Several days later the paper revealed comments by former News of the World journalist Paul McMullan on how widespread phone hacking had been under Andy Coulson; McMullan was one of six former News of the World journalists \\"who have independently told the Guardian that Coulson ... knew that his reporters were engaging in unlawful acts.\\".Nick Davies, guardian.co.uk, 8 September 2010, Phone hacking was rife at News of the World, claims new witness The New York Times In September 2010, The New York Times published the results of an investigation it had begun in March which revealed further details about the extent of the News of the Worlds phone hacking, and about editor Andy Coulson's alleged knowledge of it. The investigation also revealed that a journalist at the News of the World had been attempting to hack into the voicemail messages of a \\"television personality\\" in 2010. The journalist was suspended from reporting and faced legal action by the personality. The Times piece cited Sean Hoare, a former colleague, as saying that Coulson had \\"actively encouraged\\" phone hacking. Coulson denied the claims and indicated that he would allow himself to be questioned by the Metropolitan Police Service regarding the phone hacking affair. Press Complaints Commission investigations The Guardian's 2009 investigation led the Press Complaints Commission to reopen its inquiry into the matter (finding that it had not been \\"materially misled\\", leading The Guardians editor Alan Rusbridger to resign from the PCC) and the Culture, Media and Sport Committee to reopen its inquiry. Police investigations 2009 review of original investigation In light of the new allegations in The Guardian in July 2009, the Metropolitan Police Service commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson asked his assistant commissioner John Yates to review the original 2006 investigation for new evidence. In one 8-hour meeting, Yates reviewed the investigation and decided not to take any further action. In a public statement later, and in a July 2009, appearance at the Home Affairs Select Committee, he said of the initial investigation that he \\"found it to be satisfactory.\\" In a direct response to John Prescott, who had been particular outraged at the fact that police did not inform him of his phone being hacked, Yates specifically stated that there was no material evidence that Prescott's phone had been hacked. Yates then passed his findings back to the Chief Constable, and in agreement with lawyers and the head of the Crown Prosecution Service Keir Starmer, agreed that no further action need be taken, and the case not re-opened. The Metropolitan Police hence declined to re-open their hacking inquiry in response to the claims in The Guardian stating that \\"no additional evidence has come to light\\" and it \\"therefore consider[ed] that no further investigation is required\\". 2010 The original Metropolitan Police investigation attracted renewed attention in April 2010, when it emerged that Andy Hayman, an assistant commissioner and the officer responsible for overseeing the original 2006 Scotland Yard inquiry, had quit the police force to work for News International as a columnist. In September 2010, with the opening of parliamentary inquiries following The New York Times investigation, the Metropolitan Police also indicated its intention to re-examine the allegations regarding the News of the World, saying that it would consider new information that it had received. 2011 In January 2011, following evidence emerging from the civil case by Sienna Miller, the Crown Prosecution Service announced a review of the evidence collected during the Metropolitan Police's original investigation into phone hacking at the News of the World. The director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, said that the decision was motivated in part by developments in the civil courts. In April 2011 the Metropolitan Police admitted that in the previous four years it had only contacted 36 people to warn them that they might have been victims of phone hacking.The Guardian, 26 April 2011, Phone hacking: Met admits to only warning 36 people they may be targeted Operation Weeting The Metropolitan Police announced on 26 January 2011, that it would begin a new and fresh investigation into the phone hacking affair, following the receipt of \\"significant new information\\" regarding the conduct of News of the World employees. Operation Weeting would take place alongside the previously announced review of phone hacking evidence by the Crown Prosecution Service. Parliamentary investigations In December 2009, a parliamentary question was tabled about the possible tapping of minister Tessa Jowell's phone. Select Committee report (2009 - February 2010) Tom Watson, the Labour MP for West Bromwich East, played a key role in bringing the revelations about phone hacking into the open. Watson was concerned by alleged press misconduct, as were his colleagues Chris Bryant, the MP for Rhondda, Khalid Mahmood, MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, and Sion Simon, then MP for Birmingham Erdington. Watson joined the Culture, Media and Sport Committee in 2009, under the chairmanship of Conservative MP John Whittingdale, specifically to pose questions to leading figures in News International about the ethics at both The Sun and the News of the World, and allowing him to quiz Andy Coulson, who was director of communications for the Conservative Party, about his role at the News of the World. In July 2009, in evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee inquiry into privacy and libel issues that also covered the phone hacking affair, News of the World editor Colin Myler placed on record that a sum of ¬£700,000 was agreed to be paid to PFA chief Gordon Taylor by News International's head of legal affairs, Tom Crone. This was supported and agreed by Myler, with final approval given from News International executive chairman James Murdoch. On 24 February 2010, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee issued their report.The Guardian, 24 February 2010, News of the World phone-hacking scandal: the verdicts It condemned the testimony of the News of the World witnesses, referring to \\"collective amnesia\\" and \\"deliberate obfuscation\\", and noted News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks' refusal to appear at all. The Committee concluded: Other News International newspapers, including The Sun and The Times, downplayed the report, devoting minimal coverage to it and emphasising the News of the Worlds response.The Guardian, 25 February 2010, The Sun and the Times keep quiet about phone hacking New inquiries (September 2010) In the wake of the renewed allegations in September 2010, from The New York Times, the Home Affairs Select Committee in London opened a new inquiry into phone hacking. Two days after the Home Affairs Select Committee announced its inquiry, the House of Commons voted to refer allegations of hacking against politicians to the Standards and Privileges Committee, with the power to compel witnesses to give evidence. News International investigations News Corporation internal re- investigation News International started an investigation of the evidence within the companies files, headed by group general manager Will Lewis. Lewis quickly came across an email which referred to \\"the file\\" at the solicitors, and in December 2010, subsequently obtained all records held by Harbottle & Lewis regarding Clive Goodman's 2007 claim for unfair dismissal. Shocked at the content within the more than 200 emails, Lewis passed the file to another law firm, Hickman Rose. In January 2011, this firm engaged Ken Macdonald, Lord Macdonald QC, the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, to provide a report to the board of News Corporation on the contents of the emails. Macdonald's report stated that he found evidence of indirect hacking, breaches of national security and serious crime; he closed on advising them to immediately call the police. After a board meeting in New York chaired by Rupert Murdoch in January 2011, when Macdonald's report and recommendations were accepted in full, Macdonald immediately passed 11 emails in evidence formally to Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick. Subsequently the News of the World disclosed that it had suspended Ian Edmondson, saying that it would take \\"appropriate action\\" if the litigation or the paper's own internal investigation found evidence of wrongdoing by any staff. News International announced that they had sacked Ian Edmondson on 26 January 2011, the same day that the Metropolitan Police launched Operation Weeting. Hugh Grant In April 2011 actor Hugh Grant published an article in the New Statesman entitled \\"The Bugger, Bugged\\" about a conversation following a chance encounter with Paul McMullan, former journalist and paparazzo for News of the World. In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the Daily Mail and News of the World, particularly Andy Coulson, had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from Margaret Thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with Rupert Murdoch and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between David Cameron and Rebekah Brooks (n√©e Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: > \\"Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win > the election... So that was my submission to parliament ‚Äì that Cameron's > either a liar or an idiot.\\" When asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the Metropolitan Police to \\"drag their feet\\" on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed that this had happened, but also stated that the police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists, so had a motive to comply: > \\"20 per cent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why > would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with that, > anyway? It doesn't hurt anyone particularly.\\" Grant's article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of Grant himself \\"turning the tables\\" on a tabloid journalist. Whilst the allegations regarding the News of the World continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared for example on BBC Radio 4) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the then missing and subsequently murdered Millie Dowler had been hacked, and evidence in her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage. Grant became something of a spokesman against Murdoch's News Corporation, culminating in an appearance on the BBC's Question Time in July 2011. Further investigations Further investigations (beyond News of the World and/or beyond phone hacking) developed in 2011. Some of these also revealed further details of the phone hacking and of News International's handling of the phone hacking.

Museum Ren√© De Clercq, born Ren√© Desiderius Declercq (Deerlijk, Belgium, 14 November 1877 - Maartensdijk, Netherlands, 12 June 1932), was a Flemish-Dutch political activist, writer, poet, and composer. Biography He was the son of a flax dealer and rope- maker who also ran a local inn. After studying at the University of Gent he became a contributor and editor for the magazine Van Nu en Straks. During World War I he fled to the Netherlands. There he taught at the Belgian school in Amsterdam, while editing and contributing (mostly poetry) to the expat magazine \\"De Vlaamsche Stem\\" (The Flemish Voice), which (with German funding) slowly became an organ for Flemish activism. After the magazine was discontinued in 1916, he wrote a now famous poem directed at the Belgian government in exile in Le Havre, \\"Aan die van Havere\\" (To the Havrians). In 1917 he wrote the song \\"Daar is maar √©√©n Vlaanderen\\" (There is only one Flanders) that became the national anthem of the Flemish separatists. On December 22, 1917, the Raad van Vlaanderen declared its independence from Belgium. De Clercq became curator of the museum dedicated to the art of the controversial 19th century Belgian romantic painter Antoine Wiertz in Brussels. He made a cultural journey through Germany that was well received. After the war he fled again to the Netherlands, where he received by letter the news of the death sentence pronounced upon him by the Belgian government in 1920. In the same year he travelled around the Netherlands with a small band performing his songs. Only after amnesty in 1929 did he return to Flanders for a short visit. Fifty years after he death he was reburied in Deerlijk, Belgium. His place of birth there is now a museum. His book of songs and poetry De Noodhoorn, published in 1916, is listed in the Canon of Dutch Literature.

According to the website, Southern Africa consists of South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique. The book has been a source of information regarding noteworthy people in Southern Africa for over 100 years. Similar publications exist around the world, including the more famous annual British publication, Who's Who, published since 1849 and the Who's Who in American Art, a listing of prominent American artists. The original print publication provided lists of names and some biographical details of notable individuals in Southern Africa. Like the British version, inclusion was decided by a members prominence in public life, and /or his or her professional achievements. An online listing of the print publication was launched in 2001. The online Who's Who of Southern Africa consists of an interactive website of the same name and includes profiles of well known people born or living in the Southern African region. This listing includes noteworthy professionals, popular sports men and women, entertainers and politicians. For the purposes of the website the definition of the Southern African region was extended to include profiles of people from Angola, Zambia, Madagascar and Malawi. The online resource was opened to the public in January 2010 to allow anyone 18 years or older living or born in the region to register on the site and create a profile of themselves. The original Who's Whos are differentiated from the new members by a badge or ribbon located on the profile image. The website is used as an online research resource by the public, and as a networking and online reputation management platform for members. Unlike printed versions of the resource, the online version of Who's Who of Southern Africa does not exclude deceased members, but instead lists them under obituaries. Inclusion in both the print publication and online version is free and relegated by merit, distinguishing Who's Who of Southern Africa from the Who's Who scams with which the Who's Who titles are sometimes marred.

Cycling in Canada is experienced in various ways across a geographically huge, economically and socially diverse country. Among the reasons for cycling in Canada are for practical reasons such as commuting to work or school, for sports such as road racing, BMX, Mountain bike racing, freestyle BMX, as well as for pure recreation. The amount and quality of bicycle infrastructure varies widely across the country as do the laws pertaining to cyclists such as bicycle helmet laws which can differ by province. History Queen's Park, Toronto in 1884. Penny-farthings and safety bicycles were used in Canada as early as the late-19th century. Interest in early Velocipede bicycles exploded during the winter of 1868-69 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada as evidenced by advertisements. The first person in North America to ride a Penny Farthing style bicycle was Albert Lane who in Montreal rode an imported 50 inch Coventry on July 1, 1874. He also co-founded the first bicycle club in Canada, the Montreal Bicycle Club in 1878 which later joined with the Lacrosse and Snowshoe clubs to form the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association in 1881. Before the widespread adoption of private automobiles, bicycles were a popular mode of transport in Canada, although Canada's snowy winters posed a problem for year-round use. Travel by horse and carriage (or sled) or streetcar offered a more robust alternative. As Canadian became more suburban after World War II, cars became the principal mode of transportation for many people, and cycling shifted to being solely for sport or recreation. In the 1970s a bike boom saw a sharp increase of bicycle sales in Canada The advent of the mountain bike in the later twentieth century made off-road recreational bicycling particularly popular. In the twenty-first century, with longer and longer commute times between suburbs and central business districts, there has been a trend towards urbanization, with people moving into cities. together with gentrification, this has created a more dense urban environment less like the mid-century North American norm and more like Old World cities where cycling commuting is more popular. This has led to a new era of cycling advocacy and can create conflicts with motorists over road space prioritization, funding and planning decisions at the local municipality level.  Commuting cycling  Bicycle commuting to work has grown in popularity due to a grassroots cycling advocacy movement across Canada along with improvements to bicycling infrastructure in cities. Bicycling infrastructure has an impact on the perception of risk and safety which may impact the likelihood that people will commute by bicycle. According to the Canada 2016 Census, Victoria holds the largest percentage of bike commuters out of any municipality in Canada. For the 2016 Census Journey to Work data noted that the number of people living in Census Metropolitan Areas commuting by bicycle has increased by 87.9 percent, which is more than twice the pace of overall commuter growth. Canada's overall percent of bicycle commuters from the 2016 census was 1.4 percent. The top five Census Metropolitan Areas by percent of bicycle commuters are; Victoria at 6.6 percent, Kelowna at 2.7 percent, Ottawa-Gatineau at 2.4 percent, Vancouver at 2.3 percent, and Montreal and Saskatoon tied with 2.0 percent of people commuting by bike. The Canada 2011 Census recorded that the highest proportion of bicycle commuting to work metropolitan areas in Canada were; Victoria at 5.9 percent, Kelowna at 2.6 percent, Ottawa-Gatuineau at 2.4% and Kingston at 2.2 percent. Victoria has a very mild climate year-round compared to the rest of Canada which may help explain why the proportion of cycling commuters is so much higher, coupled with a compact core and strong bicycle culture. Victoria is home to one of Canada's earliest Bike to Work events that has grown into the popular bicycle commuting campaign in British Columbia known as \\"Bike to Work Week BC\\" occurs in May each year and pits workplace teams in friendly competition with other workplaces in their community for a variety of prizes. In Toronto, the country's largest city, and the city with the longest average commutes in all of North America, cycle-communing has quickly gained popularity. In 2010, however, Toronto had the highest per capita rate of bike- car collisions of any Canadian city and bike activists have demanded more bike lanes to make cycling safer. This was derided as \\"the war on the car\\" by successful mayoral candidate Rob Ford in the 2010 election. He was supported by media personality Don Cherry's rant against \\"the pinkos out there who ride bicycles\\" at Ford's inauguration. In July 2011, Toronto City Council voted to remove three of the bike lanes added by the previous council and most were removed the following year, the Jarvis bike lane was removed by Fall 2012 despite protesters. Toronto is not the only city to grapple with cyclist- motorist conflicts, however.  Recreational cycling  Cycling along the Trans Canada Trail in the Yukon. The Trans Canada Trail is a mixed-used path that extends throughout the country. The bikeability or bicycle-friendliness of cycling in Canada varies considerably by region. There are thousands of kilometres of bike lanes or paths in Canadian cities. Many multi-use trails connect cities and suburbs on old rail right of ways, known as rails to trails. Rural bicycling is quite popular in less-remote areas using the many low-traffic rural roads or wide shoulders on rural roads. A long distance multi-use trail that will have many sections for cycling, is slated to be completed in 2017, see Trans Canada Trail. There are also predetermined recreational cycle routes such as the Golden Triangle. It is somewhat not uncommon to see cyclists travelling across Canada on the shoulder of the Trans Canada Highway. Most of Canada's northern landmass completely lacks any bicycle infrastructure. In comparison to Europe, Canadian cities are not as bike friendly. Canadian cars are larger with more blind spots, cities have higher speed limits, highways often travel in or near the core of the city and there is more on-street parking which can present more door zone hazards for cyclists. Consequently, some inexperienced cyclists will use a \\"pedestrian\\" style of riding where no cycling facilities exist in order to feel safer cycling in the city such as by riding on the sidewalk, rather than on the roadway. Although pedestrian cycling is technically illegal ‚Äì as bicycles are deemed to be vehicles under the laws of all provinces ‚Äì it is a common method in small town and suburban Canada (where pedestrians on sidewalks are often rare). Canadian cycling advocates typically favour cycling facilities like bike paths and bike lanes that provide a buffer between motor vehicles and cyclists. Protected bike lanes or cycle tracks have been adopted in strategic corridors in Montreal, Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon and Ottawa with plans to add protected bike lanes in Victoria, Winnipeg and other cities across the country wanting to improve rates of active transportation.http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/special/editors-picks/out-of- harms-way-310590001.html In 2011 the province of Nova Scotia passed a law requiring all motor vehicles to give cyclist of clearance to protect people riding on the shoulder. The narrow streets of Downtown Halifax were originally designed for horse, cart and bicycle and they thus require drivers to share the road with a mix of other users. The city is small and reasonably easy to navigate by bicycle as infrastructure is gradually improved each year.  Sport cycling  Quebec Track Championship at Ga√©tan Boucher Oval in Quebec City. Sport cycling is a minority sport in Canada. Various disciplines are practiced across the country to different degrees. In Quebec older, disciplines like road racing and track cycling are popular, although they also have smaller following in English Canada). Newer \\"extreme\\" disciplines like bicycle motocross, cross-country cycling, downhill mountain biking and freeride are relatively popular in areas with the appropriate facilities. Many ski hills and resorts in Canada are converted to downhill biking in the summer months. Mountain biking in British Columbia is quite popular, in particular freeride originated on the North Shore near Vancouver. Canada's only Olympic gold medallist in cycling is Lori-Ann Muenzer, who won the Women's sprint in Athens in 2004. Canada's first winner of one of road racing's three most prestigious Grand Tours was Ryder Hesjedal in 2012. Two Canadians have worn the yellow jersey in the Tour de France: Alex Stieda (who led the race in 1986) and Steve Bauer (who won the opening stage of the 1988 Tour, led the race for five days, and eventually finished fourth overall). Bauer was also the first Canadian to win an Olympic medal in road racing, finishing second in the road race at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, before taking a bronze at the Road World Championships in Barcelona later that year. Cycling by area The amount of purpose-built cycle facilities varies widely across Canada. Alberta Calgary Calgary operates a number of bike facilities, including a number of mixed-use pathways. Calgary's report showed that from 1999‚Äì2010, there consistently were 9,200 weekday cycling trips entering or leaving the CBD. In 2010, Calgary had 712 kilometres of multi-use pathways and 355 kilometres of on-street bikeways, 328 kilometres of which were signed bikeways and 27 kilometres of which were bikeways with pavement marking ‚Äî bike lanes and marked shared lanes. In 2015 Calgary has launched a strategic protected bicycle infrastructure plan that has been lauded for its ambition by cycling advocacy organization People for Bikes.http://www.peopleforbikes.org/blog/entry/calgary-rolls-out-a-downtown- protected-bike-lane-network-all-at-once Edmonton Edmonton presently operates 117 km of on-street bike routes (12 km of marked bike lanes, 105 km of signed but unmarked bike routes), plus 275 km of routes shared with pedestrians (including sidewalks and 160 km of paved multiuse trails), and 450 km of unpaved trails; 500 km of new bike lane and paths is planned to be added from 2009 to 2019. British Columbia Vancouver protected bike lanes are typically separated from traffic by self-watering planters with plants. Vancouver operates a total of 400 km total bikes routes, of which 330 km are on-street bike lanes. The municipal government plans to built 55 km of new routes planned for 2010-2011 period. Cycling is the fastest growing mode of transportation in Vancouver.http://vancouver.ca/streets- transportation/separated-bicycle-lanes.aspx Translink data indicates that cycling has increased by 40 percent in Vancouver between 2008 and 2011. Statistics collected show that the protected bike lanes serve thousands of cyclists every month, even in the wet winter months.http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/Bike-lane-stats-by-month.pdf Over 1 out of 8 of its lanes, bikeways and paths was a separated lane. Many of Vancouver's protected bike lanes are separated from traffic by self-watering planters that feature hardy plants that can withstand the wet winters and dry summers. The Downtown Vancouver Business Improvement Association initially did not support the separated bike lanes that were installed on Hornby and Dunsmuir streets but have since come to accept them, noting that businesses have adapted and the lanes bring a lot of people to the area. Vancouver promotes cycling to events in the city by suggesting bicycle valet services to event organizers.http://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/secure-bicycle- parking-at-events.aspx These bicycle valet services that are usually no cost for cyclists but corral bikes for event coordinators while providing bike owners with a secure place to store their bike under watchful volunteers while they visit the event. In summer 2016 Vancouver started its own bicycle-sharing system known as Mobi by Shaw Go. Mobi faced initial planning challenges with the province of British Columbia's mandatory helmet law that is required for all ages and the placement of docking stations away from existing bike rental locations that cater to tourists.  Victoria  Victoria has the highest rate of commuters who bicycle to work in Canada. This may be in part due to a mild year-round climate, a relatively flat and compact core and separate municipalities for the suburban areas resulting perhaps less animosity towards dedicated infrastructure for cyclists. Growth in Victoria's bike commuting and bike culture is supported by the Greater Victoria Cycling Coalition, and other cyclist advocacy groups. The city includes 41 km of bike lanes with 775 km in the Capital Regional District.https://www.crd.bc.ca/project/pedestrian- cycling-master-plan Victoria's regional trails connect the downtown core with suburban municipalities along the Galloping Goose Regional Trail, Lochside and E&N; Rail Trail. The Galloping Goose Regional Trail in the Vic West neighbourhood has a bike barometer that counts daily cyclist activity along the popular cycling commuter trail. Victoria's first protected bike lane of a planned downtown network of protected bike lanes that are designed for all ages and abilities, or AAA, is a two-way lane on one-way Pandora avenue which opened in Spring 2017 and now sees over 1500 cyclist a day.http://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/victoria-eyes-two-way-bike-lane- for-pandora-by-next-spring-1.1982481 All Victoria Regional Transit buses have front bicycle carriers which are capable of carrying two bicycles. Victoria has planned an All Ages and Abilities (AAA) bicycle network for the city with the downtown phase planned for completion by the end of 2019 and extending into all neighbourhoods by 2022. Cook Street was initially planned as part of the north-south route but faced neighbourhood resident and business opposition so the city opted to move the bike route to parallel Vancouver street. In contrast, downtown merchants where protected bike lanes have been installed are overwhelmingly positive after the construction of the protected bike lanes on Pandora avenue and Fort street. In addition to bike lane infrastructure, Victoria has supported and implemented measures to make biking easier in the city. Victoria has a dock-less bike share system set-up by U-bicycle. All Victoria Regional Transit buses have front racks that can accommodate two bicycles. Bicycle lockers are available at some park and ride bus stop locations and can be reserved through the Greater Victoria Cycling Coalition. To help combat bike theft, the Victoria Police Department launched a bicycle registry in July 2015 to help police identify whether a bicycle is stolen. Victoria is proposing an update to the existing off-street parking bylaw to require more bicycle parking for new developments and is proposing that at minimum, half of all new long-term bicycle parking must be in-ground racks for greater accessibility. Car Free YYJ was started in 2015 by the Downtown Victoria Business Association to close part of Douglas street to motorized traffic and invite people and vendors to enjoy the space, its popularity encourages cycling to the event and corralling bikes in a bicycle valet service. Manitoba Winnipeg BMX bikers at a skatepark in The Forks, Winnipeg. Winnipeg maintains a total of 149 km of bike lanes, including 13 km of bike-only road routes, plans for 375 km of active transportation routes, which includes multi-use pathways, neighbourhood pathways bike lanes, sharrows and bike boulevards Newfoundland and Labrador St. John's As of 2016, St. John's had of AT facilities including 175 kilometres of multi-use trails (of the Grand Concourse) and 33 kilometres of on-street bike lanes. Nova Scotia Halifax As of 2013, Halifax had of AT facilities including 131 kilometres of multi-use trails (called greenways) and 96 kilometres of bike lanes.HRM Key Infrastructure Definitions , Regional AT Plan Review, 2013 Ontario A number of bicycle and mixed- use trails can be found throughout Ontario, with some crossing multiple municipalities. Many of these trails are provincially maintained, including Waterfront Trail. Ottawa Many of Ottawa's urban streets have a combination of cycling facilities, including bike lanes, cycle tracks and paved shoulders. The city also has a series of cycling and pedestrian bridges, four of which have opened since 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the city has 900 km of cycling facilities, including 435 km of multi use pathways, 8 km of cycle tracks, 200 km of on-street bicycle lanes and 257 km of paved shoulders. 204 km of facilities were added between 2011 and 2014. The Capital Pathway is a mixed-use path that Ottawa shares with the neighbouring city of Gatineau. Ottawa has a portion of the more than 250 km long Capital Pathway Network that it shares with the City of Gatineau. This mixed-use path extends to most suburban neighborhoods and into rural areas beyond, so that many long-distance commuters use at least part of it. It is a recreational pathway that is shared with walkers and runners, and not only apart from traffic, but mostly through parks, green spaces and along waterways. Ottawa closes over 50 kilometres of Colonel By Drive, Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway, the Rockcliffe Parkway to traffic every Sunday morning May to September, effectively turning the streets into wide recreational lanes. Gatineau Park has a 90 kilometres of trails for mountain biking and for extreme thrill riders near Camp Fortune. There is a commercial public bike-rental system. Ottawa's city transit have bike racks on all buses that are part of the transitway network and on express routes, but quite infrequently on local routes which use 40' buses. Bicycles are also easily taken aboard the O-Train, the city's light rail transit service. The City of Ottawa was ranked as a \\"Gold\\" Bicycle Friendly Community in 2013 by Share the Road Cycling Coalition, the first city in Ontario to receive this designation. The 2013 Ottawa Cycling Plan intends to increase citywide cycling mode share during the morning peak period from 2.5 percent in 2011 to 5 percent in 2031 (8 percent and 12 percent respectively in the inner area). Toronto As of December 2017 the City of Toronto has approximately 590 kilometres of on-street bike lanes, about 37 kilometres of which are protected from motor-vehicular traffic. Several types of bicycle lanes exist in Toronto. Types of bike lanes adopted in the city includes the cycle tracks, a type of lanes that uses a physical obstruction to protect cyclists from vehicular traffic. Bike lanes which do not use a physical barrier, use white lines and diamonds to distinguish the bike lanes from the rest of the roadway. Winter maintenance, including snow removal, for bike lanes is done by Toronto Works and Emergency Services. Queen's Quay, Toronto, with traffic lights specifically for cyclists in the cycle track. Toronto also utilizes shared lane marking on roadways without bike lanes. The markings alert all road users of the presence of bicycle traffic on the street, although they are not considered dedicated cycling facilities. Shared lane markings are typically used to connect disjointed parts of the Toronto cycling network. In addition to on-street bike lanes, the city maintains a number bike trails located throughout the city's parks, and the Toronto ravine system. In addition to cycling facilities such as bike lanes, the City of Toronto also operates bicycle parking facilities. These facilities include bicycle lockers, indoor bicycle parking stations, bicycle parking rack, and bicycle bollards. The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) also operates bicycle parking facilities at Toronto subway facilities, as well as bike carriers on the TTC buses. On 3 May 2011, a bicycle-sharing system was launched in the city. Bike Share Toronto is presently operated by the Toronto Parking Authority. The cost of installing cycling infrastructure varies depending on the area in the city. To paint bicycle lanes on an existing road, the cost will typically be C$40,000‚Äì50,000 per km. The implementation of a cycle lane cost approximately $180,000 per km when installed with planters as the separator, although costs escalate up to C$1,000,000 per km for the construction of a curb separated cycle track. In 2010, City of Toronto reported from a downtown study that 46 percent wore helmets, over 19,000 cyclists enter the downtown core daily, and the 24 percent of roads with bike lanes carried 45 percent of the bike traffic.http://www.toronto.ca/cycling/reports/pdf/bicycle_count_summary_2010.pdf In June 2016, the Toronto City Council approved a 10-year Cycling Network Plan which plans to add 280 km of bike lanes or cycle tracks on busy roadways, 55 km of bike trails adjacent to busy roadways, and 190 km of cycling routes along quiet roadways. Quebec A number of bicycle and mixed-use trails can be found throughout Quebec, with some crossing multiple municipalities. Many of these trails are provincially maintained, including the Route Verte trail network spread throughout the province. Montreal Launched in 2008, BIXI Montr√©al was the first large-scale bicycle-sharing system in North America. Montreal is one of the few North American cities to have been listed as a bicycle friendly city on the Copenhagenize index. Montreal has a long history of activism for bicycle infrastructure thanks to the work of Le Monde √† bicyclette and was one of the earliest Canadian cities to install bicycle lanes. As of 2015, the Montreal had 530 km of bike lanes and shared routes, with plans for 800 km total network by 2015. Montreal began a pilot implementation of the bicycle-sharing system known as BIXI in 2008. Users purchase daily or subscription usages for bikes, located in various depots throughout the city. The Coupe du Monde Cycliste F√©minine de Montr√©al female professional racing event has been held in Montreal since 1998. the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montr√©al has also been held since 2010.

Love was born at South Kurrajong to businessman John Love and Rebecca, n√©e Charley. He attended Sydney Boys' High School before working in his father's importing business, Plummer Love & Co. He visited Britain 1912-13\\\\. In 1915 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and was sent to the government flying school at Richmond. He was commissioned on 11 January 1917 and sent for further training in Britain. In January 1918 he was promoted lieutenant, and served in France with the Australian Flying Corps until June, when he was returned to England as an instructor. Love returned to Sydney in 1919, and in partnership with W. J. Warneford and H. E. Broadsmith registered the Australian Aircraft and Engineering Co. Ltd., establishing its premises at Mascot. Love, the inaugural managing director, pursued a vigorous publicity campaign and later supplied Qantas with its first commercial aircraft. The market was limited, however, and a lack of government assistance saw the company voluntarily liquidate in 1923. The Commonwealth resumed ownership of their airfield, now Kingsford Smith Airport, when the lease expired. On 4 June 1924 Love married Phyllis Eloise Davey at Strathfield Methodist Church, joining her father's flour mill firm, Edwin Davey & Sons. He registered N. B. Love Pty Ltd and built his own flour mill at Enfield in January 1935. He was also a founding member of the New South Wales Flour Millers' Trade Council in 1942. In August 1941, Love was appointed wing commander in the Royal Australian Air Force and commanded a wing of the Air Training Corps for boys between 16 and 18. He contested the 1943 federal election unsuccessfully, running as a Liberal Democrat in Parkes. From 1945 to 1946 he was president of the state branch of the Air Force Association. Love took over Edwin Davey & Sons in 1940, acquiring a Boggabri flour mill in 1944. He established Millmaster Feeds Pty Ltd in 1952 and in 1958 floated N. B. Love Industries Ltd., which was sold to George Weston Limited in 1962, when Love retired to the Canberra region. He died at Killara in 1979 and was cremated.

For nearly five centuries the shrine was of major religious value to Norway and the other Nordic countries, and also to other parts of Northern Europe. St. Olav‚Äôs Shrine opens and closes the Middle Ages as an historic period in Norway. The shrine consisted of three shrines, the one covering the other, and was the most important and by far the most valuable object in Norway in the Middle Ages. After the Lutheran reformation in 1536‚Äì1537, the valuable parts of St. Olav‚Äôs Shrine were destroyed by Danish authorities. Since 1568 St. Olav‚Äôs earthly remains have been resting in an unknown grave, in Nidaros Cathedral or in the cathedral cemetery.  Background  A replica of the c. 1320 Olav altar frontal, showing the opening of Olav's tomb top right. The night after King Olav II Haraldsson fell in the Battle of Stiklestad east of Trondheim on 29 July 1030, the body was laid in a simple wooden coffin, taken by boat to Trondheim and buried in the sandy bank further up the Nidelven river. According to the saga, those who did this were the farmer at Stiklestad, Torgils H√•lmuson, and his son Grim. The following year the coffin was taken up and given a new grave outside St. Clement's Church. Shortly after, on 3 August 1031, the coffin was again taken up and moved into the church, after the King had been examined and canonised by Bishop Grimkjell. Part of the St. Olav altar frontal in Nidaros Cathedral (ca 1320) depicts Translatio Olavi, when Bishop Grimkjell on 3 August 1031 finds the body intact, sweet-scented and with hair and nails having grown since the King died. Encouraged by the people‚Äôs demand, he canonises Olav. ¬´The King‚Äôs body was carried into St. Clement's Church and placed over the high altar. The coffin was covered with costly cloths. Soon many miracles took place because of King Olav‚Äôs holiness¬ª, writes Snorri Sturluson, our main source.  The saint  A chapel was built on the river bank where Olav had first been buried, and tradition says the altar was erected over the place where the King‚Äôs body had been buried. Tradition also says the high altar of Nidaros Cathedral has since been on this spot. King Olav was 35 when he died, and had taken part in twenty major battles. ¬´Where in the world‚Äôs northern parts have people known a more prominent prince? The King died far too early¬ª, said court poet Sigvat Skald. Of the earthly Olav Haraldsson the martyr, the heavenly king, was born. The veneration of the saint quickly spread far beyond Norway‚Äôs borders. A cathedral was built to hold the King‚Äôs canonised body. Pilgrimages to St. Olav‚Äôs Shrine continued for the next five centuries until the reformation in 1537, and Nidaros became the most popular place of pilgrimage in northern Europe. The high choir (the octagon) of Nidaros Cathedral, where the saint King was resting behind the altar, was known as Cor Norvegiae ‚Äì Norway‚Äôs heart. In 1153 Trondheim‚Äôs ecclesial significance was enhanced by the erection there of the Archiepiscopal See of Nidaros. Since the 9th century Norway‚Äôs kings had been approved at √òretinget, the old ting wall at the Nidelven estuary, in today‚Äôs Trondheim. Harald H√•rfagre (865‚Äì933) was taken king here. Under King Harald Hardr√•de (1015‚Äì1066) the unification of Norway was fulfilled, and Trondheim‚Äôs status also as the political capital confirmed. From 1204 an extra dimension was added to the approval of a new king: he now had to swear his oath on St. Olav‚Äôs Shrine. The ceremony was moved to the cathedral grounds, and Norwegian kings were now understood to reign on behalf of Norway's Eternal King ‚Äì Rex perpetuus Norvegiae ‚Äì St. Olav.  Restoration  In 1930, 900 years after King Olav‚Äôs death at Stiklestad, 29 July, St. Olav‚Äôs Day, was reintroduced in Norway‚Äôs calendar as Olsok (Olav‚Äôs Vigil, actually the eve of St. Olav‚Äôs Day). The day had then been out of the calendar since Danish-Norwegian ecclesial legislation had removed it in 1542, due to the reformation. However, St. Olav‚Äôs Day had never been absent from the popular calendar and tradition. The axe in Norway‚Äôs coat of arms and in the traditional ecclesial coat of arms Olavsmerket, show that the memory of the saint king had never left the official language of symbols. Since its re-establishment in Norway in 1843, the Roman Catholic Church has celebrated Olsok, St. Olav‚Äôs Day, as a major feast in the church calendar. And since the Olsok renewal from the late 19th century, St. Olav‚Äôs Day has also been celebrated in some of the (Lutheran) Church of Norway‚Äôs churches, not the least in Nidaros Cathedral.  The first and the second shrine  There were three St. Olav‚Äôs shrines. The first was the original wooden coffin from Stiklestad, covered by exclusive cloth. The second was a costly shrine that according to Snorre Sturlasson was made by King Magnus Olavsson (1035‚Äì1047), Olav‚Äôs son. This shrine was probably a wooden coffin covered by silver plates with religious motives. To the silver plates were fixed valuable jewels. This shrine was two metres long and with a width and height of about 80 centimetres. The lid had the shape of a house roof. The original coffin was kept inside this shrine. Some house-roof-like relic shrines preserved in Norway and Iceland are believed to be small copies of Saint Olav‚Äôs Shrine.  The third shrine  Documents written by Archbishop Olav Engelbrektsson in the 1530s, describe the shrine: *¬´ ... St. Olav‚Äôs Shrine was covered with silver. It had no bottom. It was covering two other shrines, and in the innermost shrine was the entire body of St. Olav ...¬ª Shrines consisting of several shrines, the one covering the other, are known from other places, like the Shrine of St. Cuthbert in Durham Cathedral in England. Erik Valkendorf (1465‚Äì1522), archbishop of Nidaros 1510 ‚Äì 1522, allegedly bought a costly jewel which was fixed to one end of St. Olav‚Äôs Shrine. For this he paid 20 lasts of butter. Unimaginable values were gathered in Nidaros Cathedral in Catholic times. The only valuable medieval object left in the cathedral today is golden chalice from the 16th century. The rest of the valuables disappeared abroad due to the reformation.  What happened to St. Olav‚Äôs Shrine?  Rumours have circulated on the shrine‚Äôs fate after the reformation, one is that it was lost in an unconfirmed shipwreck off Agdenes in the Trondheim Fjord on its way to Copenhagen. Archaeologist √òystein Ekroll at Nidaros Cathedral‚Äôs Restoration Works has collected what is known about the shrine‚Äôs fate in an article. Archbishop Olav Engelbrektsson left Trondheim 1 April, Easter Day, 1537. His intention was to return with a sea and land forces to defend the country against King Christian III. At his castle Steinvikholm off Skatval further east in the Trondheim Fjord, the archbishop had left a military force equipped to withstand protracted siege. At the castle he had also left behind the country‚Äôs most valuable relics, among them St. Olav‚Äôs Shrine, which had been moved there from Nidaros Cathedral some months before. The archbishop fled to Lier in the Netherlands, today in Belgium, since 1523 the exile town for his allied King Christian II of Denmark-Norway. Here Olav Engelbrektsson died already on 7 February 1538, and was buried in the town‚Äôs St. Gummarus Church. In the meantime his force at Steinvikholm had capitulated, and all values at the castle fallen into Danish hands. Five days later, on 3 June 1537, a list was made of all objects at the castle: *¬´In the tower called the Farmer: Saint Olav‚Äôs Shrine in which he rests, Saint Augustine‚Äôs (Archbishop √òystein Erlendsson‚Äôs) Shrine which is of silver, a saint‚Äôs shrine of gilded copper, a Saint Olav‚Äôs bowl of silver- covered tree.¬ª All valuables were smashed and taken to Copenhagen for melting. A receipt from the King‚Äôs treasurer Jochum Bech to Christoffer Huitfelt, governor of Tr√∏ndelag and responsible for the transport to Copenhagen, is dated 9 September 1540. Bech signed for 95 kilo silver, from Saint Olav‚Äôs Shrine, two large gilded silver buttons, 170 silver-set crystals and 11 jewels that fell from the shrine when it was smashed. From the shrine holding St. Olav‚Äôs shirts came 2.6 kilos of gilded silver and a number of enamelled gold plates.  The last part of St. Olav‚Äôs Shrine  During excavations at Steinvikholm in the 1880s several objects were found, among them a rounded transparent crystal. Such stones were popular in the Middle Ages and were often used to decorate relic shrines. According to √òystein Ekroll this stone may be the known part of Saint Olav‚Äôs Shrine, as it is probably the twelfth in addition to the eleven stones listed in 1537. The stone is exhibited in the Suhm House at the NTNU Museum of Natural History and Archaeology in Trondheim. Denmark has never paid any compensation to Norway for the destruction of St. Olav‚Äôs Shrine and the theft of silver and jewels.  What happened to St. Olav‚Äôs remains?  Only the innermost wooden coffin, with St. Olav‚Äôs remains, was left at Steinvikholm when Danish soldiers had smashed the two outer shrines and taken the silver and other valuables to Copenhagen in 1540. Whether pilgrims came to St. Olav‚Äôs coffin at Steinvikholm after the archbishop‚Äôs departure at Easter 1537 is uncertain, but in 1552 the first Lutheran bishop in Trondheim ‚Äì Danish Hans Gaas ‚Äì went to Copenhagen to hear the King‚Äôs opinion on returning St. Olav‚Äôs remains to Nidaros Cathedral. Twenty-four years after the shrine had been left behind at Steinvikholm, the Nordic Seven-Year War led to Swedish occupation of the area in the spring of 1564. Swedish soldiers now moved the wooden coffin from the castle to Fl√∏an Chapel on the mainland near by. Already on 8 June that same year, after Swedish forces had been driven back, the coffin with St. Olav‚Äôs body was brought ‚Äúin great procession‚Äù from Fl√∏an to Nidaros Cathedral, and lowered into a brick grave inside the church. It is now uncertain where this grave is. Differences between three 16th century descriptions of St. Olav‚Äôs body may indicate that it might have been another body that was brought back to the cathedral in 1564. Of the three descriptions, only the first one ‚Äì former pupil at Nidaros Cathedral School and later Presiding Magistrate Jon Simonsson‚Äôs from 1521, written down by Lutheran Vicar Peder Clauss√∏n Friis in the 1570s ‚Äì notes that the King‚Äôs face is bearded. Archbishop Olav Engelbrektsson‚Äôs description from the time when the shrine was moved to Steinvikholm, probably in 1536, notes that the King is not bearded, while Palace Chaplain Absalon Pedersson Beyer‚Äôs description from 1567 is silent on the matter. Should a change of bodies have taken place after 1521, Archbishop Olav Engelbrektsson may have found it best for posterity to hide the King‚Äôs body at the castle, or even in the cathedral before moving the shrine to the castle. All three descriptions speak of an intact, dry body, without any trace of decay. Olav Engelbrektsson‚Äôs description of 1536: *\\"... in the innermost shrine Saint Olav‚Äôs body was resting intact with skin, flesh and bone, no limb divided from the other. The body was wrapped in double linen. The linen closest to the body was somewhat decayed, while next layer of linen was quite strong. Covering the body was a broad piece of silk, yellow and red with woven flowers, at first sight looking like a piece of guilt [sic] and figured leather. It was quite unspoiled and looked as if it was no more than three years old. Alongside in the middle of the same piece of silk, were fixed two crosses in carmine red. Olav‚Äôs face was completely intact with flesh and skin, his eyes somewhat sunken; the hairs of his eyebrows were clearly visible. The tip of his nose was partly lacking, his lips were somewhat inverted, his teeth were in place and were white. His jaw was quite intact, but there was no beard on it. When touching his thighs, skin and flesh could clearly be felt. Also on his feet, skin, flesh and sinews were unspoiled. But when touching his toes, they felt like they were withered. A good scent came from his body, and there was no abomination to it. All who were present could clearly see this. And he has been a tall man\\". The year after the return from Fl√∏an to the cathedral, in 1565, the wooden coffin was taken out of the brick grave. The body was now given a new wooden coffin and lowered into another, probably new, grave in the cathedral. Neither the location of this grave is known today. Many of those who were present at this moment, threw gold and silver coins in the grave, in the honour of God and St. Olav. Three years later, in the spring of 1568 ‚Äì 31 years after the reformation, Danish Minister J√∏rgen Lykke let \\"earth fill the grave of St. Olav‚Äôs body\\", to put an end to pilgrimages to what until now had been a known grave in the cathedral. Whether it was the 1565 grave that was closed, or whether the remains now were moved to a third grave, known to only a few, is unclear. As those who knew the location of the grave that was closed in 1568 gradually died over the next decades, this grave went into oblivion. However, in the late 20th century Vicar Olav M√ºller in St. Olav Roman Catholic Cathedral in Trondheim, learned that the knowledge of the location of this grave was still kept in some families in Trondheim. After the extensive restoration works in Nidaros Cathedral in the last half of the 19th century, it is assumed that St. Olav‚Äôs remains were either taken out of the 1568 grave and moved to an unmarked common grave in the north part of the cathedral cemetery in the 1860s, when post-reformation burials were removed from the cathedral. Or, the grave that was closed in 1568 may still be among the medieval graves ‚Äì anonymised in the late 1800s ‚Äì under the cathedral‚Äôs floor. A third possibility is that St. Olav's remains are among pre-reformation remains that due to restoration works in the late 1800s were taken out of their graves and stored in a wooden box in the crypt, later to be moved to the Cathedral Architect's office. These remains were mentioned by Steinar Bjerkestrand, director at the Nidaros Cathedral Restoration Workshop in an interview on the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation's regional programmes (NRK-Tr√∏ndelag) on 5 April 2013. Bjerkestrand said the remains represent 14 persons. Shortly before this the remains had been brought back to the Cathedral's crypt in a locked metal box. In late 1993 Trondheim architect Bodvar Schjelderup proposed that one should look for the possible grave of Olav in two places in Nidaros Cathedral: in a brick grave under the floor close to today‚Äôs pulpit, and under the floor near the northern octagon chapel. The Bishop of Nidaros at the time, Finn Wagle, and the Director for Cultural Heritage of the time, √òivind Lunde, chose not to follow up the proposal. In 2003 √òystein Ekroll wrote that a possible location for St. Olav‚Äôs grave, if the King is still resting in the cathedral, may be under 17th-century burials in one of the three octagon chapels. These parts have not been excavated. There are also other areas under the cathedral that have not been excavated. On 5 April 2013 Bishop Tor Singsaas of Nidaros told the NRK-Tr√∏ndelag that he welcomes new investigations in the Cathedral. On 24 January 2014 the NRK- Tr√∏ndelag reported that the Nidaros Cathedral Restoration Workshop had started examinations in the octagon, also in the eastern octagon chapel. Archeologists from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) were using georadar to look for irregularities under the floor, guided by archeologist √òystein Ekroll and followed by the NRK science programme Newton. Bishop Tor Singsaas of Nidaros told the NRK that he was happy that such examinations now were possible. On 23 February 2014 NRK Newton reported that the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) georadar examinations had found a possible grave 1.5 metres under the floor in the eastern octagon chapel in Nidaros Cathedral, partly under the chapel's altar. Ekroll said in the programme that this may be Saint Olav's grave. He said this should now be further examined, preferably by the help of archeological excavations. The georadar examinations had confirmed the location of a grave under the floor north of the southern octagon chapel, where written sources say King Magnus the Good, Olav Haraldsson's son, had been buried. The georadar examinations also indicate that already the choir of the first wooden church here, located where the present octagon stands, may have been octagonal as in other early martyr's churches.  Possible St. Olav relic in Oslo  The only known relic of St. Olav in modern time is the Arm Relic, given by King Oscar I of Sweden and Norway to St. Olav Roman Catholic Cathedral in Oslo in 1862. The relic, which is a human calf bone and not an arm bone, had then been kept in the Danish National Museum in Copenhagen since the late 17th century. The relic may have come to Copenhagen among several St. Olav relics that King Christian II of Denmark-Norway had requested from Nidaros after his coronation in Oslo in the summer of 1514. According to √òystein Ekroll it was only in the early 1800s that this relic was linked to St. Olav. Before this its history has not been documented. The relic was in 2012 examined by Professor Per Holck, a University of Oslo anatomist, at the request of historian √òystein Morten and with the permission of Bishop Bernt Ivar Eidsvig of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oslo. Results were published by Morten and Holck on 16 March 2013. Examinations confirm that the relic is the left calf bone of a male who died in a time span covering 1030, and who had been in battle. At his death, the person has been about the age of Olav Haraldsson. As a child he had been raised on an inland diet. The person may have been unusually tall for the period, about . Also, tissue remains indicate that the bone may belong to a body that has been mummified and not buried. This may indicate that the relic is genuine, as St. Olav's body was never buried but was kept swaddled in cloths in its shrine for centuries, initially in St. Clemen's Church and then in Nidaros Cathedral. In the calf bone in St. Olav Cathedral in Oslo, remains of mitrochondrial DNA, inherited only from the mother, were found. An obvious next step would be to compare this with possible similar DNA traces in the remains of Olav Haraldsson's half-brother on the mother's side, King Harald Hardr√•de. His remains are thought to still rest in their grave in the ruins of Helgeseter (Elgseter) Augustinian Priory at √òya in Trondheim, under the street of Klostergata, between Klostergata 47 and 60‚Äì62. Excavations here depend on an initiative by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage. References  Sources  *Johs. J.

He died in Nazi custody days after being arrested by the Gestapo.  Biography  Westermann was born in Hamburg and was trained as a tailor. He joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1910, where he was a member of the left wing and volunteered in several capacities. in 1914, he was drafted into the navy, though opposed to the war. During this period, Westermann sympathized with the Spartacus League and the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany. In November 1918, during the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919, he was elected delegate of the minesweeper flotilla in the Kiel Sailors' council. In 1919, he joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and in 1921, became the full-time party secretary in Hamburg, where he was primarily responsible for the Works council.Hermann Weber/Andreas Herbst: Deutsche Kommunisten. Biographisches Handbuch 1918 bis 1945. Karl Dietz Verlag, Berlin (2004), p. 862, In 1925, Westermann was briefly expelled from the KPD after he advocated a waiver of Ernst Th√§lmann's candidacy in favor of Social Democrat Otto Braun, a tactical move meant to thwart a victory by Paul von Hindenburg in the second round of the German presidential election in 1925. He was readmitted after the ultra-left leadership of Ruth Fischer and Arkadi Maslow was removed and in 1927, he was elected to the Hamburg district leadership of the KPD. A short time later, he was elected to the Hamburg Parliament. Within the KPD, Westermann was considered to be a trade union expert. He was aligned with the Conciliator faction and was opposed to the increasingly militant verbal attacks by the ultra-left party leadership under Th√§lmann, particularly with regard to trade union policy, which was elevating the position of Revolutionary Trade Union Opposition policy. Westermann was also aligned with those in favor of closer ties and cooperative efforts with the SPD. These positions caused Westermann to be expelled from the party in 1930 along with Heinrich Stahmer and Albert Sanneck, also Conciliators. Westermann then resigned his parliamentary seat and, with his common-law wife, founded in Hamburg his own independent and unnamed Conciliator group, sometimes referred to the \\"Westermann Group\\". After the Nazis seized power in 1933, Westermann's group began working underground, focusing on dock and shipyard workers and employees. Westermann was arrested and kept in detention between June 1933 and August 1934. On his release, made contact with other Conciliator groups both within and outside the KPD, such as the Committee for Proletarian Unity, founded by Eduard Wald. His relationships with the KPD improved and he and his group were again admitted into the party in 1935. Shortly after he had begun reorganizing the Hamburg party, which had been weakened by Gestapo attacks, Westermann and numerous others were arrested late March 5, 1935 or early March 6. A few days later, Westermann was killed at KoLaFu in Hamburg.

Details Castle Batch was a motte constructed by the Norman lord Walter of Douai between the Norman conquest of England in 1066 and 1086.; It was built on a ridge above the surrounding area, with a mound that is now high and across, surrounded by a ditch up to wide. The entrance was probably on the north side of the motte. A possible bailey has been identified alongside the motte. Although typically characterised as a motte, the mound has a slight indentation in the centre and archaeologist Stuart Prior considers the mound to have been a ringwork.; Around 1200 the estate belonged to William De Courtney and by 1303 by John de Beauchamp. In the 21st century the site forms part of local parkland, and is protected by law as a scheduled monument.

Duncan was born at Canterbury to agent Andrew William Bartlett Duncan and Alice Dalby, n√©e Bellin. She attended the local Baptist school, Hessle College, before achieving a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) from the University of Melbourne in 1917, followed by a Master of Arts in 1922. She was one of the first women at the university to own a motorcycle, and offered rides during World War I to raise money for the Australian Red Cross Society. She worked for the Australian Student Christian Movement for two years before being appointed Australian secretary of the Young Women's Christian Association, in which capacity she was sent \\"on loan\\" to the Japanese association. Duncan worked in Tokyo and Kyoto while in Japan and studied at the London School of Economics in the 1928-29 period. She returned home in 1932 due to her father's illness, and joined the Lyceum Club. Secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian League of Nations Union and the Bureau of Social and International Affairs from 1934 to 1941, she attended the Institute of Pacific Relations conference at Yosemite in California as the Victorian delegate. She returned home via a fact-finding mission for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, investigating short-wave programs in China and Japan. Duncan then became involved in the peace movement, serving on the executive of the United Peace Council and becoming secretary of the International Peace Campaign in 1937. She resigned after the Munich agreement (Doris Blackburn was the replacement). In 1938 Duncan was appointed inaugural director of the Victorian International Refugee Emergency Council (VIREC), which assisted European refugees in assimilating into Australian life, and fought against widely held community prejudices. She visited refugees deported from Britain to Australia (the \\"Dunera boys\\") at their internment camps and wrote angrily to the British Society of Friends deploring the conditions on the ships, resulting in a summons to Victoria Barracks. Duncan resigned from the VIREC in December 1941 to join the Department of Labour and National Service, investigating the welfare of children of working mothers. She stood unsuccessfully at the 1943 federal election as an independent for the seat of Balaclava, and in 1944 produced a report for the National Health and Medical Research Council supporting, among other things, family welfare and increased pay for domestic workers. Duncan visited Korea in 1946 for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in her capacity as welfare officer for the South-West Pacific and liaised with the commanding generals of the United States and Soviet armies before returning to Australia to lecture at universities. She was a foundation member of the International House council (1955-66) and continued her considerable community and church involvement. She died at Kew in 1970 and was cremated; the private dining-room at International House at the University of Melbourne is named for her.

He uses unconventional materials such as bread, blood, mold and bacterial cultures, salt, spoiled milk, medical tubing, fingernails, brightly-colored cough syrups, thick medicinal ointments, gold, cremation ashes, and dead flies. Life and career Terrance Graven was born June 3, 1966 and raised in a northwest village in Antwerp, Ohio, as the oldest of three children. In 1984, he studied with an Individualized Major at Indiana University and in 2004 continued his education, culminating in a Bachelor of Arts degree from San Francisco State University (Honors Program and Dual Emphasis: Sculpture and Painting). He also studied privately at Michael Markowitz Art Studios. In 1990, he was a principal performer for Harupin-Ha, the first Bay Area Butoh troupe, headed by Koichi and Hiroko Tamano. He also trained with Yumiko Yoshioka, Akira Kasai, Anzu Furukawa, Yuri Nagaoka, and Diego Pi√±on. In 1992, he formed COLLAPSINGsilence Performance Troupe, which was active for thirteen years. They were a movement-based group, who choreographed all of their original works and collaborated with live musicians such as Sharkbait, Hollow Earth, Haunted by Waters, and Mandible Chatter. The troupe designed and fabricated all costumes, props, puppets, and site-specific installations. In 1996, they were featured at The International Performance Art Festival. After working as a veterinarian technician for three years, Graven currently supports his art career by working in the film, television, and advertising industry as a production designer, art director, project manager, prop master, model maker, and fabricator. In advertising, he has worked with large companies such as Nike Inc., Apple Inc., Google, Toyota Motor Corp., Chevron Corp., GEICO, and many others. He specializes in building miniatures and stop-motion animation and has worked for Skellington Productions, Phantom Investigators, Hatching Beauty, and others. Exhibitions In 2009, he exhibited a solo show at David Cunningham Projects Gallery entitled \\"TEMPVS\\". According to writer Traci Vogel of the SF Weekly, \\"In his performance work, Graven visits territory pioneered by the Viennese Actionists and feminist artists such as Carolee Schneeman, who claimed the body as a canvas. There is a fertile aesthetic intersection with Graven's installations, which hew closely to a Victorian Memento Mori (\\"remember death\\") sensibility\\". Terrance Graven states that before the exhibition, he placed an advertisement requesting memento mori donations. He was invited into strangers‚Äô homes wherein they shared personal stories about their deceased loved ones. Afterwards they gave contributions in the form of cremation ashes and other relics. These were placed at the bottom of a sculpture with a rotating tripod. In 2014, he was chosen to be featured in Yerba Buena Center for the Arts' triennial \\"Bay Area Now 7\\", which garnered considerable press coverage, including a review by San Francisco Chronicle's Kenneth Baker and the San Francisco Arts Quarterly. Graven created an installation and intervention that directly engaged the museum staff in a series of experimental trust exercises. In one of his undertakings, he met with YBCA's accountant requesting a blank check. With the staff member in attendance, he destroyed the check by repeatedly submerging it in one of the museum's 5 gallon buckets of black paint. All the materials used in the art piece were acquired from the museum on site, which included brass art-hanging-hardware with nails, Durabond joint compound (5 min set), Westpac Fast Set Patching Compound, Fix-It-All, drywall, YBCA hammer, latex paint-covered paper (blank check from YBCA, 24-page printouts of email correspondences between museum and artist to establish trust, photocopy of driver's license and social security card, photocopy of I-9, and photocopy of W-4), mason line string, labels with thread, numbered gallery pins, striping tape, painter's tape, furniture wrap, plastic drop, paint, graphite, and ink. He has been a guest lecturer- instructor at UC Berkeley, Stanford University, Douglas and Sturgess, Jon Sims Center for the Arts, Yugen Theater, and the Harvey Milk Institute.

He was appointed prime minister following the 2011 presidential election won by Ollanta Humala. Lerner resigned on 10 December 2011. Early life Salom√≥n Lerner is of Jewish descent. He was born on 4 February 1946. He studied in Anglo-Peruvian School. From 1962 to 1967, he studied industrial engineering with focus on agribusiness at the National University of Engineering (UNI) in Lima. Later he attended post-gradual courses at the Monterrey Institute of Technology in Mexico, in 1968, and at the Technion Institute in Haifa, Israel, in 1989. As a student, he joined politics and became the chairman of the students' wing of the social-democratic APRA party. Career Under the left-wing military administration of Juan Velasco Alvarado (1968‚Äì75), he was general manager of the Public Fish-Meal and Oil Marketing Enterprise (EPCHAP). In the government of Velasco's successor, Francisco Morales Berm√∫dez, Lerner was vice minister of foreign trade. In 1997, he managed CPN Radio channel, and from October 1997 to March 1998, he was a member of the board of Frecuencia Latina. At the end of the 1990s, he served as the CEO of the Banco del Progreso. When the NBK bank acquired Banco del Progreso in 2000, he stayed CEO of the merged bank, until his resignation during the crisis in July of that year. Other functions performed by Salom√≥n Lerner include manager of Helic√≥pteros del Sur, Tecal S.A., and the Cotton Corporation of Peru, president of the Institute for Economic and Social Development (Indes), and the industrial engineers' chapter in the Association of Peruvian Engineers (CIP). Politics In 2001, Lerner was general coordinator of the Civil Association Transparencia which observed the 2001 general elections. Afterwards he became a member of the editorial board of the daily newspaper La Rep√∫blica. He also managed the campaign of left-wing nationalist Ollanta Humala for both the 2006 and the 2011 presidential election. Prime Minister On 28 July 2011, newly elected president Ollanta Humala appointed Salom√≥n Lerner to be President of the Council of Ministers of Peru. His government had congressional support of the Peru Wins and Possible Peru parliamentary groups. During his tenure, the government of Peru was marked by internal and external debate over the political orientation of the cabinet and Lerner's ability to control, the suspension of the President's 2nd Vice President and some members of Congress, coupled with social mobilisations and heavy protests, including a dispute over the $4.8 billion Conga gold mining investment project by a Canadian company. On 10 December, he resigned as Prime Minister, without directly referencing to the mining conflict and was succeeded by his Interior Minister Oscar Vald√©s.

Charles Knight Snr was a local book seller and printer and edited and printed the newspaper from Church Street in Windsor. When Charles Knight Snr died the paper was passed to his son, who was unhappy with the cost of the newspaper, which was six-and-a-half pence when it began and rose to seven pence in September 1815 due to a heavy stamp duty. Charles Knight Jnr believed in a cheap press, but at the start of the Express newspapers were only ever subscribed to by the wealthy, before the abolition of stamp duty in 1855. To begin with the newspaper was the Windsor and Eton Express and General Advertiser for the counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Middlesex, Surrey, Hertfordshire, Hampshire and Wiltshire. Adverts always covered the front page of the newspaper and it wasn't until the outbreak of World War II that the ads were pushed off the top spot to make way for news. This set the trend of the layout which has continued to this day. Despite this, often parliamentary, national and world news made up the first pages of the paper, with local news usually not making an appearance until page four. Updates on the royals at Windsor Castle were usually found every week in the newspaper. In 1827 the publication was sold to William Reynell and it became the Windsor and Eton Express and Reading Journal. It was printed at 42 Thames Street, Windsor, and still cost 7d. In 1833, Richard Oxley bought the newspaper and turned it into Windsor and Eton Express, the Berks, Bucks and Middlesex Journal and West Surrey Gazette. By 1840 the price was reduced to 5d and was printed and published at 4 High Street, Windsor. It reduced to 2d in 1870 and became the Windsor and Eton Express and the Maidenhead and Slough Gazette. Frederick William Oxley was on board by this time. In 1880 the price reduced even further to 1d. Still in the Oxley family in 1910, the Windsor and Eton and Slough Express and the Berks, Bucks, Surrey and Middlesex Journal and the Ascot and District Advertiser were published by Stanley Frederick Oxley, still from the High Street. The newspaper simply became the Windsor, Slough and Eton Express in 1940, priced at 3d and consisting of eight pages. It was printed in Bachelor's Acre and High Street, Windsor, and 12 High Street, Slough. In 1960, the newspapers separated to what we know them as today: the Windsor and Eton Express and the Slough Express. They cost four pence and were 32 pages long. The first coloured pictures were printed and the Slough office, which opened at 57 High Street. In 1980 the papers were published by the Windsor News Group in Madeira Walk. In 2000 the papers were taken over by Trinity Newspaper.  Today  On April 7, 2008 the Maidenhead Advertiser bought the Slough and Windsor Express series. Today the Express, as part of Baylis Media Ltd, now employs about 85 people, with the biggest department being editorial. It is delivered free to households in the area and is also sold on stands for 60p. The circulation stands at about 44,000 combined for both editions. The Windsor Express serves the town and surrounding areas, such as Ascot, Sunningdale, Datchet, Dedworth, Eton and Wraysbury. The Slough Express reaches to the areas Iver, Colnbrook, Chalvey, Langley, Britwell, Cippenham, Upton and Farnham Common. Some content is shared across the editions of the Windsor Advertiser and Burnham Advertiser. Both newspapers are published on Fridays. In November 2010 the Express closed its premises in Slough's Ipswich Road and moved to the Advertiser's offices in Maidenhead.  Supplements  As well as the six editions of newspapers every week with a combined readership of nearly 128,000, Baylis Media Ltd also produces a number of special publications. These are the Business Monthly, Life etc. (a lifestyle glossy magazine) and Weddings Etc., both of which are published twice a year.  Online presence  The Express websites were integrated with Maidenhead Advertiser's at the same time as the newspapers were bought in 2008. It benefited from the multi-media arm of Baylis Media Ltd, which published video news content and breaking news as-it-happened. The website won an award in 2008 for the 'Weekly Newspaper Website of the Year' from the Newspaper Society. After a few years of rapid growth, the website now actively takes part in social media and achieves almost 30,000 unique visitors each week and these statistic are still rising.

It is an Anglican parish church in the deanery of Richmond, the archdeaconry of Richmond, and the Diocese of Leeds. Its benefice is united with those of four local churches to form the Stanwick Group of Churches. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History A church was present on the site before the Norman conquest, and the presence of a priest at Melsonby is recorded in the Domesday Book. The present church dates from 1135, and it was completed by the 13th century. It was restored in 1871‚Äì72 by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin. The restoration included rebuilding the nave and chancel, and adding the vestry and porch. The Perpendicular east window was replaced by three lancet windows. Architecture Exterior St James' is constructed in sandstone rubble with ashlar dressings and has a tiled roof. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a south porch, a three-bay chancel, a north vestry, and a west tower. The tower is in three stages with buttresses at the corners, and in the centre of each side. There is a lancet window in either one or both stages of each central buttress. Above the central buttress on the west side is a lozenge-shaped clock face. On each side of the top stage is a louvred bell opening. The parapet is corbelled and battlemented. The south porch is gabled with buttresses, a pointed-arched doorway and two lancet windows on each side. In the wall of the south aisle are a single lancet and two paired lancet windows; along the north aisle are three pairs of lancets. The clerestory has four round-headed windows on each side. There is a further lancet window in the west and east ends of both aisles. Along the south wall of the chancel is a pointed-arched window, a priest's door with a pointed arch, three lancet windows, and three niches for images. The east window is a triple lancet with a stepped hoodmould. On the north side of the chancel are three lancets. The vestry has a pointed-arched east window, and paired lancet on the north side. There are cross finials on the gable ends. Interior The arcades are supported by piers, some of which are circular, others octagonal. On the north side of the chancel is a double aumbry; on the south side is a single aumbry and a damaged piscina. In the south aisle is a recess dating from the middle of the 14th century with a crocketed canopy, a finial at the apex and pinnacles at the sides; it had possibly been an Easter Sepulchre. The monuments include a 13th-century effigy of a knight with chain mail, a sword and a shield; a grave cover carved with a foliated cross, a man's head, and hands in prayer; and two Anglo-Saxon cross shafts dating from about 800. The single manual organ was built by Bryceson and Company. There is a ring of four bells. The oldest of these was cast in about 1370, the next in 1718 by Edward Seller I, and the latest two in 1875 by John Warner & Sons. External features In the churchyard are three items that are listed at Grade II. To the east of the porch are two sandstone tombstones dating from the early and middle parts of the 18th century. To the south of the tower is a badly worn sandstone chest tomb, dating possibly from the 17th century. On the south side of the path leading to the church is a group of three sandstone tombstones dating from the middle of the 18th century.

Moyes was born in Koolunga to headmaster John Moyes and Ellen Jane, n√©e Stoward. Two of his brothers were John Stoward Moyes, who became an Anglican bishop, and Alban George (Johnnie) Moyes, a first class cricketer and journalist. Morton attended the Collegiate School of St Peter in Adelaide and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in physics and mathematics from the University of Adelaide in 1910, having represented South Australia in athletic championships. His geology lecturer, Douglas Mawson, had a profound impact on him and he successfully applied to join Mawson's Australasian Antarctic expedition in 1911 as meteorologist for Frank Wild's western base. In November 1912, Wild's group left on a sledging trip with Moyes remaining at the hut; the trip ended up taking nine weeks when the sled was lost. Moyes returned to Australia in March 1913 as headmaster of University Coaching College in Sydney. In February 1914 he was recruited as naval instructor for the new Royal Australian Naval College, moving from mathematics to navigation in 1915. In January 1916 he was promoted senior naval instructor and was navigating officer of Captain John King Davis's ship the Aurora on its December rescue mission for members of Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. Moyes twice attempted to leave the naval college to enlist but was refused; in October 1918, when his resignation was finally accepted, the war was all but over. He married Miriam Esther King at St James' Church in Sydney on 11 January 1919. Moyes returned to the navy as an instructor lieutenant with seniority; he was promoted instructor lieutenant-commander in 1920 and commander in 1924. Mawson requested Moyes for the British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition in September 1929, although Davis felt he lacked the training for a ship's officer and he became survey officer. Moyes did not undertake the second expedition in November 1930 but instead returned to the navy. He was fleet instructor officer aboard for six years before becoming the navy's first (acting) instructor captain in June 1941. He was the first director of educational and vocational training at Navy College, Melbourne, being appointed in November 1943 (his age and seniority precluded him from undertaking active sea service). He left the navy in 1946 and became chief rehabilitation officer for the Commonwealth, retiring in 1951. Moyes, who was president of the Geographical Society of New South Wales from 1933 to 1935, was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1935 and in his retirement published memoirs of his Antarctic travels. He died in Sydney in 1981 and was cremated at Roseville. Several Antarctic geographical features, including Moyes Peak and the Moyes Islands, are named for him.

Pratt's parents strongly disapproved of the relationship and it is not known whether or not the marriage was ever legally formalised. The couple toured together in theatrical productions, unsuccessfully, and eventually had to resort to telling fortunes to make their living. By 1777 the couple were briefly in Paris, where they met Benjamin Franklin who lent the couple money which they struggled to repay.Franklin Papers 22 June 1778 Charlotte, like Pratt, considered herself a poet, and Pratt sent Franklin copies of some of his wife's poetry.Franklin Papers 28 January 1778 In 1781 the couple separated and Charlotte embarked on a solo acting career. In 1793 she emigrated to America where she gained a reputation as \\"The Grande Dame of Tragedy on the Early American Stage\\". The couple would never meet again. The relationship was to taint Pratt's reputation with the reading public as indicating a dubious moral character;English Poetry 1579‚Äì1830 one obituary published after his death tactfully refers to the relationship as \\"such indiscretions as too frequently accompany genius\\"; others simply omit any reference to his marriage altogether.  Stage career  In 1773, having abandoned his Church career, Pratt made his first appearance as an actor under the name 'Courtney Melmoth' at the Smock Alley Theatre, in Dublin, playing Marc Antony in John Dryden's All For Love but with no great success. He then took a theatre company to Drogheda, again with no success, and the theatre closed after three months. In 1774 he appeared as Hamlet at the Covent Garden Theatre but his performance was again judged a failure. One critic wrote that he walked with \\"a kind of airy swing that rendered his acting at times rather ludicrous.\\" After this he gave up the stage and took to writing full-time although he still continued to take occasional parts opposite his \\"wife\\" until around 1781.charlotte melmoth&f;=false Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians  Later life  In 1774, having given up the stage, he had his first literary success ‚Äì a poem entitled The Tears of A Genius, occasioned by the Death of Dr Goldsmith which attracted the attention of the reading public, and from then onwards he was able to make a living by writing. By 1776 he had moved to Bath, where he entered into a part-ownership of a book-shop in Milsom StreetBaileys British Directory, 1784 with a partner of the name of Clinch. As with his previous professions, he soon decided that he was not suited to the life of a book-seller and returned to London within a few years. However he made many friends in Bath and became part of the fashionable Bath society, making the acquaintance of the famous actress Mrs Siddons, for whom he would later write leading character parts in his plays. He later fell out with Mrs Siddons after borrowing ¬£500 from her husband and becoming offended when she asked him to repay it. By 1802 he was in Birmingham, a well-known literary figure with a reputation for being willing to help and advise aspiring writers, including a young George Mogridge, who would later find fame as \\"Old Humphrey\\". In 1814 he fell from his horse, resulting in a long illness, from which he died on 4 October 1814 in his home at Colmore Row, Birmingham.  Literary career Pratt's first poem, written while he was still a clergyman, was The Partridges ‚Äì an elegy. Published in The Annual Register in 1771, it was a 10-verse tale of a mother partridge praying for the safety of her chicks during the shooting season, and revealed Pratt's concern for animal welfare which would be reflected in later writings.An online OCR-scanned copy of a selection of Pratt's writings It was included in many collections of popular poetry throughout the 19th Century. However, it was his The Tears of A Genius, occasioned by the Death of Dr Goldsmith (1774) which first caught the public's attention: written within a few hours of Goldsmith's death, it contained poetry written in imitation of Goldsmith's style and was published under Pratt's pseudonym of 'Courtney Melmoth'. Over the next six years he produced twelve further works as 'Courtney Melmoth' including An Apology for the Life and Writings of David Hume (1777) ;Shenstone Green, or the New Paradise Lost (1779); Emma Corbett (1780) and Shadows of Shakespeare, a Monody on Death of Garrick (1779): lines from the latter are quoted on Garrick's memorial in Westminster Abbey. In 1781 he began writing under his own name, with a tragic play entitled The Fair Circassian, and most of his following works were published as by Samuel Jackson Pratt. In total he penned seven novels (in twenty-three volumes), ten plays and twenty-three volumes of poems, 'miscellanies' and travel journals.The Spencerians  The Pupil of Pleasure  In 1776 he scandalised the literary world with a novel, satirising Lord Chesterfield, entitled The Pupil of Pleasure or The New System (Lord Chesterfield's) Illustrated, describing a fictional series of seductions in Buxton. Its licentious tone evoked letters of complaints, the author being described as \\"a dissipated clergyman\\"Silhouettes (Edmund Grosse) and the Monthly Review magazine said of it \\"It is unnatural and shocking ‚Äì it cannot be read without disgust.' Pratt's reputation suffered as a result, and, in an attempt to repair the damage he wrote a moral work, The Tutor of Truth', two years later, of which the Monthly Review conceded \\"it is more inoffensive than any of the previous productions of this writer.\\" Illustration from a 1788 edition of \\"Emma Corbett\\"  Emma Corbett In 1780 Pratt, still using the name Courtney Melmoth, published his most historically significant novel: Emma Corbett or, The miseries of civil war. Founded on some recent circumstances which happened in America. In the novel, the title-character, Emma, travels to America to find her lover, Henry, a British soldier. She is captured by American rebels, but released on George Washington's orders. She finds Henry, wounded by a poisoned arrow fired by an American 'Indian', and sucks out the venom, poisoning herself in the process. Henry dies and the fatally ill Emma travels back to England with their child, to die.Summary of Emma Corbett The novel was highly praised on its release and passed through many editions in several languages. Today, however, its principal significance is, firstly, its depiction of Anglo-American relations during the American War of Independence, and, secondly, that it was the first English novel to address the subject of the American Revolution.Dismembering Anglo-America  Dramatic works  As well as his poems, novels and 'miscellanies', Pratt drew upon his theatre experience to write ten plays, although three were never performed or published. His first play, Joseph Andrews, was an adaptation of Henry Fielding's novel of the same name, and was acted at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on 20 April 1778, with the role of Fanny being played by Mary Robinson.Oxford Journals Pratt would eventually write the epitaph for Mary Robinson's tombstone. The play has never been published. His most successful dramatic work was The Fair Circassian, an adaptation of John Hawkesworth's novel Almoran and Hamet, and was first performed at Drury Lane on 27 November 1781. The leading part was written for Pratt's friend, the actress Mrs Siddons, but she was unavailable and the part was played by Elizabeth Farren (later Countess of Derby) instead. The Fair Circassian was published in many editions, and is still in print today.Amazon's page for this play His 1783 comedy The School for Vanity was also staged at Drury Lane.  Animal welfare  Pratt was a campaigner against cruelty towards animals and an opponent of hunting and blood-sports. Many of his writings reflect this concern, including his most famous poem, Sympathy (1788) which argues that man was \\"born to share\\" the earth with all other living creatures and asks \\"Why must man subsist by prey?\\". In Humanity, or the Rights of Nature he attacks hunting, demanding \\"For hunger kill, but never sport with life\\". A review in Gentleman's Magazine of Lord Erskine's speech in support of the Bill for Preventing Malicious and Wanton Cruelty to Animals\\" (1809) said of Pratt, \\"Certainly [no living author has] expatiated more on this subject [cruelty to animals] than the Author of \\"Sympathy,\\" both in his poetical and prose writings. Indeed, nearly a third of a volume of the \\"Gleanings\\" of that Writer has been consecrated to this subject.\\"Animal Rights History  Critical reception  Critical reception to Pratt's works was mixed during his lifetime. His scandalous \\"sham marriage\\" and the public furore over his \\"unnatural and shocking\\" novel The Pupil of Pleasure damaged his reputation, giving him a 'dubious moral character' which deterred respectable readers. His poem Sympathy, however, was noted for its 'feeling, energy and beauty' and the Gentleman's Magazine remarked > \\"It is a just tribute to his character to say that all his works strongly > tended to promote the interests of benevolence and virtue. Though his > literary fame has been somewhat overcast by the extraordinary success of > several contemporary poets, yet it is probable that many of his works will > be admired when most of theirs has sunk into oblivion.\\" However the same publication also noted that \\"his chief error was not knowing how to check the exuberance of his feeling and imagination; and therefore he sometimes diffused his sentiments to a tedious extent.\\" Charles Lamb lambasted his Gleanings as \\"A wretched assortment of vapid feelings\\", although the same volume was popular enough with readers to pass through many editions. The London Magazine said of The Tutor of Truth, \\"We can recommend this sprightly and at the same time instructive romance in the warmest terms.\\" The Catalogue of Five Hundred Authors Now Living (1788) summarised his works with the succinct phrase \\"There are people now living who believe that they possess a degree of merit.\\" The Gentleman's Magazine obituary of Pratt summarised his life with the words > \\"No man who ever attained public distinction was more exempt from envy; and > though he may, in the vicissitudes of a life unsupported by fortune and > exposed to all the casualties of a precarious subsistence, have fallen into > errors, nothing of malice or ill-nature can justly be imputed to him; and as > his works are all intended to promote the interests of virtue, none of these > errors should be remembered in his epitaph.\\"  References   External links  * Complete list of Pratt's writings *Pratt's obituary in \\"Notes and Queries\\" *Pratt's obituary in \\"The Gentleman's Magazine\\" * An OCR-scanned (hard to read) copy of \\"Pity's Gift\\", a collection of Pratt's stories *Animal Rights History website, giving examples of Pratt's writings on animal welfare. * Pratt's entry in Chalmers' \\"General Biographical Dictionary\\" Category:1749 births Category:1814 deaths Category:English dramatists and playwrights Category:18th-century English novelists Category:19th-century English novelists Category:18th-century English poets Category:Animal welfare workers Category:18th-century English male actors Category:English male stage actors Category:English booksellers Category:English male dramatists and playwrights Category:English male novelists Category:British male poets Category:19th-century British male writers Category:18th-century male writers ","title":"Samuel Jackson Pratt"},{"id":"32495278","text":"The Siege of Lisbon was a siege of the city of Lisbon from 29 May to 3 September 1384, between the Portuguese defenders of the city led by John I of Portugal and the Castillian army led by King John I of Castile.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 189. History The name Stainfield derives from \\"a stony clearing\\", from the Old Norse 'steinn' and 'thveit'.Mills, Anthony David (2003); A Dictionary of British Place Names, p. 431, Oxford University Press, revised edition (2011). In 1086 Stainfield was named as Stainfelde and Stain' in the ancient wapentake of Wraggoe in the South Riding of Lindsey, Lincolnshire.Open Domesday Online: Stainfield, Wraggoe Wapentake; accessed August 2018.http://www.domesdaybook.co.uk/lincolnshire5.html St Andrews Church The Grade II* listed red brick and limestone parish church is dedicated to Saint Andrew and dates from 1711, mostly rebuilt in the 19th century by James Fowler. The pews and pulpit are 18th-century. Inside are a helmet, gauntlets and sword said to have belonged to the Wild Man of Stainfield. The Wild Man of Stainfield One of Lincolnshire's legends tells of a wild man who lived in the woods near Stainfield. The story appears in Folklore around Horncastle (1915) by Revd James Alpas Penny, who writes that in Stainfield church is the helmet of one of the Tyrwhitts of Stainfield, with the family crest of a wild man with a dagger. He recounts the legend that one Francis Tyrwhitt-Drake was promised all the land in Stainfield if he could kill the wild man who had terrorised the district. As he lay asleep, Drake ran the wild man through with his sword. A variation of this story, set in the 12th century, identifies the wild man as a Stainfield nobleman who had been away fighting in the Crusades for so long that when he returned he found he had been dispossessed. He went on to live in the woods, where he became so dangerous that Drake-Tyrwhitt was forced to kill him. It has been suggested that the story was put about to explain the relics in St Andrews belonging to the Tyrwhitt family, which included tattered cloth hanging from the wall reputed to be the wild man's clothing, and the dagger, gloves, and helmet said to belong to the man who killed him. In fact, the rags were the tattered remnants of the three banners embroidered by the ladies of the Tyrwhitt family, now in the care of the Archives Office in Lincoln. According to another variation on the legend the wildman was killed by a band of farmers incensed that their livestock was being taken and their families terrorised. The farmers, who went on to be known as \\"The Hardy Gang\\", trapped and killed the wildman in a wood between Langton and Stainfield. Priory and Hall Stainfield Hall with early-18th century gate pier Stainfield Priory was a benedictine nunnery founded about 1154. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries the site of Stainfield Priory was given to Sir Robert Tyrwhitt, who built Stainfield Hall on the site. It was rebuilt in 1611 with later additions in the early-18th century and had formal gardens associated with it. After 1760 the house fell into disrepair and was mostly pulled down in 1773. The remaining south front was destroyed by fire in 1855. The present building dates from 1856. School Stainfield CE School opened as a National school in 1817 It became a junior and infant school in 1946, and closed 1971.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1990. Sam Cohodas Sam Cohodas was born in Kobylnik, Poland in 1895, the son of Aaron and Eva Cohodas. In 1900 his father emigrated to Marinette, Wisconsin, fleeing the eastern European pogroms directed against Jews. The remainder of the family joined the elder Cohodas in 1903. Sam, his father, and his brothers worked in an uncle's produce business in the early part of the 20th century. By 1915, Sam and his brother Harry opened their own retail and wholesale produce company, Cohodas Brothers Fruit Company, in Houghton, Michigan. Under Sam's direction, the company boomed during the 1920s he expanded the operation to become the largest of its kind in the Upper Peninsula and northern Wisconsin. His success continued even into the depths of the Great Depression, with the company gaining national prominence as the nation's third largest fruit wholesaler. Cohodas built this lodge in part as evidence of his success. Cohodas also was involved in the banking industry, opening the Miners‚Äô First National Bank in Ishpeming, Michigan in 1934. He purchased other banks in local cities and formed the Michigan Financial Corporation. Cohodas was also a great philanthropist, raising money for the Mayo Clinic the Shaare Zedek Jewish Hospital in Detroit, the National Jewish Hospital in Denver, and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Sam Cohodas died in 1988. Lodge History In 1934, Cohodas hired local architect and Swedish immigrant David E. Anderson to design this lodge to serve as his personal residence as well as an entertainment center for his business. Finnish craftsmen built the lodge, using materials gathered from within 15 miles of the site, under the direction of Nestor Kallioinen, the region's finest log builder. Construction was finished in 1935, and the lodge served as Cohodas's wilderness camp until 1972. The lodge itself was later converted to a bed and breakfast, and remains largely intact. Description The Sam Cohodas Lodge in significant as a distinctive example of a large-scale, vernacular rustic log resort architecture constructed in the early 20th century. It is one of the largest log structures in Michigan which does not use an independent superstructure for support. The lodge is a rectangular, two-story structure built of logs on the northern section of Lake Michigamme. The front facade is symmetrical with an enclosed central entrance porch, surmounted by a central dormer and flanked by two-story gable bays. The rear facade is asymmetrical with an intersecting gable over a centrally-located balconette, and a rear entry. The lodge is built from locally furnished materials and features rustic ornamentation. The interior has a two-story greatroom, with the remainder of the rooms arranged in a surrounding U-shape.

He rose to the rank of admiral during a long and distinguished career, in which he served in the War of Jenkins' Ear, the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War. He fought at several major battles, and commanded a number of amphibious assaults off the French coast and in the West Indies. Though he lived until 1795 his health was broken after service in the tropics, and he never served at sea again after 1763. Early career Barton entered the navy in 1730, on board the Fox, under the command of Captain Arnold, and served with him on the coast of South Carolina. Afterwards he served in the Mediterranean under Captains John Byng, Philip VanBrugh, and Lord Augustus Fitzroy, as a midshipman. From lieutenant to admiral In March 1739, being then a midshipman of , he was made lieutenant in the prize ship St. Joseph by Admiral Nicholas Haddock. He was then appointed to the 70-gun , and was engaged in her in the capture of the Princesa on 18 April 1740. In October he was transferred to the 80-gun HMS Princess Caroline, commanded by Captain Griffin, forming part of the fleet which sailed with Sir Chaloner Ogle for the West Indies. On arriving at Jamaica, Admiral Edward Vernon selected the Princess Caroline for his flag, and Captain Griffin was removed to , taking Lieutenant Barton with him. From the Mediterranean to Africa After the failure at Cartagena the Burford came home and paid off. Barton was appointed to the 50-gun , in which ship he went to the Mediterranean and continued till after the battle off Toulon, 11 February 1743‚Äì4, when, in September, he was appointed to HMS Marlborough, and a few months later to , carrying the flag of Vice-Admiral William Rowley, the commander-in-chief, by whom, in May 1745, he was promoted to the command of the fireship ; and in February 1746‚Äì7 he was further promoted by Vice-Admiral Henry Medley to the frigate . In that, and afterwards in the xebec , he remained in the Mediterranean till the peace, when the Postilion was paid off at Port Mahon, and Barton returned to England in the flagship with Vice-Admiral Byng. He had no further employment at sea till the recommencement of the war with France, when he was appointed to the 50-gun , one of the fleet which went to North America with Edward Boscawen in the summer of 1755, and which, off Louisbourg, in June 1756, captured the French 50-gun ship, Arc-en-Ciel, armed en fl√ªte, and carrying stores. The next year he was senior officer on the coast of Guinea, and, having crossed over to the Leeward Islands, brought home a large convoy in August 1758. The Lichfield was then placed under the orders of Commodore Augustus Keppel, as part of the squadron destined for the capture of Gor√©e, and sailed with it on 11 November. On the 28th a heavy gale scattered the fleet; at night, the Lichfield by her reckoning was twenty-five leagues from the African shore. At six o'clock on the following morning she struck on the coast near Masagan; it was rocky and rugged; the sea was extremely high, and swept over the wreck, which beat violently, but by good fortune held together till the gale moderated, when those who had not been washed overboard or drowned in premature attempts, managed to reach the shore, distant only about 400 yards; the saved amounted to 220 out of a crew of 350. These survivors, naked and starving, were made prisoners by the Emperor of Morocco, and kept for a period of eighteen months in semi-slavery. After a tedious negotiation they were at last ransomed by the British government, and arrived at Gibraltar on 27 June 1760. To Jamaica Captain Barton arrived in England on 7 August, was tried for the loss of his ship, was fully acquitted, and in October was appointed to the 74-gun , captured from the French only the year before. In this ship he served, under Commodore Keppel, in the expedition against Belle-Isle in April 1761, had especial charge of the landing, and was sent home with despatches. He afterwards convoyed a number of transports to Barbadoes, and served under Sir George Rodney at the reduction of Martinique, January 1762. In the following March he was detached, under Commodore Sir James Douglas, to Jamaica, and formed part of the expedition against Havana in June and July, during a great part of which time he commanded the naval brigade on shore. Retirement Under the stress of fatigue and climate his health gave way, and he was compelled to exchange into for a passage to England, which was not, however, put out of commission till the peace. He attained his flag on 28 April 1777, became vice-admiral on 19 March 1779, and admiral on 24 September 1787. He died in 1795; but during the whole of these last thirty-two years his health, broken down by the Havana fever, did not permit him to accept any active command. He is described as faithful and affectionate as a husband, kind and forbearing as a master, unshaken and disinterested in his friendships; a sincere Christian, piously resigned to the will of God during his long illness.

Its value is about 86%, which is the Chambadal-Novikov efficiency, an approximation related to the Carnot limit, based on the temperature of the photons emitted by the Sun's surface.  Effect of band gap energy  Solar cells operate as quantum energy conversion devices, and are therefore subject to the thermodynamic efficiency limit. Photons with an energy below the band gap of the absorber material cannot generate an electron-hole pair, and so their energy is not converted to useful output and only generates heat if absorbed. For photons with an energy above the band gap energy, only a fraction of the energy above the band gap can be converted to useful output. When a photon of greater energy is absorbed, the excess energy above the band gap is converted to kinetic energy of the carrier recombination. The excess kinetic energy is converted to heat through phonon interactions as the kinetic energy of the carriers slows to equilibrium velocity. Hence, the solar energy cannot be converted to electricity beyond a certain limit. Solar cells with multiple band gap absorber materials improve efficiency by dividing the solar spectrum into smaller bins where the thermodynamic efficiency limit is higher for each bin. The thermodynamic limits of such cells (also called multi-junction cells, or tandem cells) can be analyzed using and online simulator in nanoHUB.  Efficiency limits for different solar cell technologies  Thermodynamic efficiency limits for different solar cell technologies are as follows: * Single junctions ‚âà 33% * 3-cell stacks and impure PVs ‚âà 50% * Hot carrier- or impact ionization-based devices ‚âà 54-68% * Commercial modules are ‚âà 12-21% * Solar cell with an upconverter for operation in the AM1.5 spectrum and with a 2eV bandgap ‚âà 50.7%  Thermodynamic efficiency limit for excitonic solar cells  The Shockley-Queisser limit for the efficiency of a single-junction solar cell under unconcentrated sunlight. This calculated curve uses actual solar spectrum data, and therefore the curve is wiggly from IR absorption bands in the atmosphere. This efficiency limit of about 34% can be exceeded by multijunction solar cells. Excitonic solar cells generates free charge by bound and intermediate exciton states unlike inorganic and crystalline solar cells. The efficiency of the excitonic solar cells and inorganic solar cells (with less exciton-binding energy) cannot go beyond 31% as explained by Shockley and Queisser.  Thermodynamic efficiency limits with carrier multiplication  Carrier multiplication facilitates multiple electron-hole pair generation for each photon absorbed. Efficiency limits for photovoltaic cells can be theoretically higher considering thermodynamic effects. For a solar cell powered by the Sun's unconcentrated black-body radiation, the theoretical maximum efficiency is 43% whereas for a solar cell powered by the Sun's full concentrated radiation, the efficiency limit is up to 85%. These high values of efficiencies are possible only when the solar cells use radiative recombination and carrier multiplication.

Early life and First World War Lind was born in South Yarra to bank manager Edmund Frank Lind and Emily Margaret, n√©e Harris, and educated at Camberwell Grammar School. He attended the University of Melbourne and received a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery in 1914, subsequently practising in Williamstown. On 20 August 1914 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, retaining the rank of captain he had achieved in the Melbourne University Rifles in 1910. He was posted as regimental medical officer to the 5th Battalion, and his criticisms of training conditions in Egypt were heeded. He arrived at Gallipoli on 28 May 1915, having been delayed by a fractured skull from a fall in April. Following the 5th Battalion's extensive campaign in Turkey, it was sent to Egypt on 11 December. Lind, who transferred to the 8th Field Ambulance on 2 April 1916, was promoted temporary major on 8 June and sailed for France, serving in the Battle of Fromelles before joining the 9th Field Ambulance training in England. He was promoted full major on 14 November. Returning to France on 23 November, Lind was involved in the Battle of Messines in June 1917 as a medical officer and on 22 August was appointed deputy assistant director of medical services (DADMS) for the II ANZAC Corps, serving at Broodseinde and Passchendaele. Appointed DADMS for the 4th Division on 11 January 1918 he served at the Battle of Hamel in July and was promoted temporary lieutenant colonel in September. His AIF appointment was ended in March 1919; he had been awarded the Distinguished Service Order and was twice mentioned in dispatches. Interbellum On 23 June 1920 at St Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne, Lind married Beulah Rotterdale McMinn. He practised medicine in Brighton and rejoined the Melbourne University Rifles, which he commanded from 1921 to 1926. In 1926 he became a staff officer on 4th Division Headquarters of the Australian Military Forces, and in 1929 was given command of the 29th and then the 29/22nd Battalions, and in 1934 the 4th Infantry Brigade. Promoted colonel in 1936 and brigadier in 1938, Lind led the Australian Military Contingent to King George VI's coronation in 1937. Second World War and later life Lind was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire and commander of the 23rd Brigade in July 1940 and deployed to the Northern Territory, where it was dispersed, with one battalion sent to Rabaul, another to Ambon and a third to Dutch Timor. Lind's protestations led him to lose favour with General Staff, and Lind, instead of commanding the Sparrow Force in Timor, was left to defend 28 miles of coastline near Darwin. Concern at the 1942 air raids and a general replacement of officers led Lind to be removed from command in March and retired in July. In 1943 Lind was appointed inaugural chairman of the Services and Citizens' Party and ran unsuccessfully for Henty in the 1943 federal election. He died of a heart attack in 1944 at South Yarra and was buried in Box Hill.

He then attended courses of medical instruction in the London schools, after which he went to Montpellier, where he took his doctor's degree in 1770. His name also appears, under date 5 October 1771, among the students who studied at Leyden. On completing his studies he returned to England, but on account of his health he subsequently removed to Genoa, where he obtained an extensive medical practice, and in 1774 was appointed professor of chemistry in the university. Previous to this the study of chemistry in the university of Genoa had been much neglected, but soon after his appointment the lectures were thronged with pupils. He also made a special study of botany, and gathered an extensive collection of rare plants. His wide and varied acquirements and his public spirit won him the general esteem of his fellow-citizens, which was greatly increased by his self-sacrificing attentions to the sick during the severe epidemic of 1800.

He is said to have been taken to Scotland by Edward I to sing his praises at the siege of Stirling (1304); and, according to Bale, he is Trivet's authority for his story of Edward's rash approach to the beleaguered garrison. But Trivet merely refers to a certain friar (religiosus quidam) as having related the incident. He is certain that he was taken on a similar errand by Edward II, when setting out on the expedition to relieve Stirling, that resulted in the Battle of Bannockburn. Coerced versification Scottish chroniclers gloat over the story of his capture by Robert the Bruce, and tell how this king forced his prisoner to sing the defeat of his own countrymen as the price of his freedom. Baston's verses on this occasion are rhymed hexameters, with the rhymes disposed very irregularly. One couplet, describing Robert Bruce before the engagement, may serve as an example:‚Äî : Cernit, discernit acies pro Marte paratas; : Tales mortales gentes censet superatas. Archibald Bower gives the verses in full as \\"worthy for their goodness to be set on a candlestick;\\" but the Scottish writers of the next century were fully alive to their faults, which the English ascribed to the fact of their author's having penned them with an unwilling muse and against his conscience. The Carmelites Anthony √† Wood tells us that it was owing to this Robert Baston that Edward II gave the Carmelites his mansion of Beaumont for their Oxford schools. As he narrates the story, Baston, when defeat was inevitable, assured the king of safety if he would only pray to the Virgin; and Edward thereupon promised to erect a house for the Carmelite brotherhood, if he reached home in safety ‚Äì a vow which was fulfilled at the parliament of York in 1317, when the king gave the brethren his Oxford mansion outside the walls, just by the north gate of the city, with a provision for twenty-four friars.Wood, Annals, ed. Gutch, i. 248 Tanner quotes from a manuscript register that in 1318 friar Robert Baston, the Carmelite, was admitted to hear confessions in the Diocese of Lincoln. Other writings According to Bale and Pitts, Baston was the author of various other poems besides the one just alluded to above, \\"De Striveliniensi obsidione.\\" His other works consisted of poems on the second Scottish war, on the various states of the world‚Äîdirected against popes, cardinals, and kings‚Äîworks against the luxury of priests, a disputation concerning Dives and Lazarus, a book against \\"artists\\" (Contra Artistas), poems and rhythms, tragedies and comedies, and a collection of \\"Orationes Synodales.\\" Several of Baston's poetical works are to be found in the British Museum.Cotton MSS., Titus A. xx. Biographical errors Pitts has committed several egregious mistakes in his account of this writer, making him die in 1310, four years before the battle of Bannockburn, which he celebrates in verse; and Bale's vaguer language leaves the impression that he too was labouring under a similar error. On the whole, it seems hard to escape from the conclusion that Robert Baston's biographers have made him present in Scotland on two occasions instead of one, and have confounded the siege of Stirling under Edward I with the siege of the same castle that, under Edward II, resulted in the battle of Bannockburn. Leland seems to have originated the mistake, and the rest have blindly followed him.

Biography Born at Padua, he joined the navy in 1907 and participated in the Italo-Turkish War and the First World War; during the latter, he commanded the small force that occupied the island of Pelagosa in the Adriatic Sea, and although the occupation ceased after a month due to several difficulties, he was promoted to Lieutenant. In the inter-war years he first commanded a gunboat in the Dodecanese, and then the river gunboat Ermanno Carlotto on the Yangtze in the Far East, from 1922 to 1925. In 1933, promoted to captain, he was slated to be the first commander of the modern cruiser Emanuele Filiberto Duca d'Aosta, commissioned two years later; from April 1937 he transferred on the cruiser Raimondo Montecuccoli, which was assigned to the Far East til November 1938. On 2 January 1939 he was promoted to rear admiral, and from April he became commander of the maritime command in newly occupied Albania. On Italy's declaration of war (10 June 1940), Da Zara was assigned to command two cruisers of the 4th Division (the da Giussano and the da Barbiano), and in such capacity he fought, albeit in a very minor role, in the Battle of Punta Stilo (also called the \\"Battle of Calabria\\"). Afterwards, he was assigned to some minor commands, such as commander of the La Spezia Naval Base. On 5 March 1942 he took command of the 7th Naval Division (replacing Raffaele de Courten), made of the four light cruisers of the Montecuccoli and D'Aosta classes; on 15 June 1942, his command fought the Battle of Pantelleria (\\"Operation Harpoon\\"), often considered one of the few squadron-sized Italian successes on the sea during the war. His division sailed again to contest Operation Pedestal, but its sortie was aborted and had to return to port. On 1 August 1943 Da Zara took command of the 5th Division, made up of the two old battleships Duilio and Andrea Doria, stationed at Taranto. When the Italian armistice with the Allies was proclaimed, he complied with the orders to sail to Malta and, on arrival, because of the death of Admiral Carlo Bergamini, took command of the whole Italian fleet. Da Zara remained in Malta until December 1943, when he returned to Italy, and after commanding the military department of the Ionian Sea and inspector of the naval forces, he retired from active duty in October 1946. After publishing a volume of memoirs (Pelle d'ammiraglio, \\"Admiral's skin\\") in 1949, Da Zara died at Foggia in 1951.  Family  Alberto's father was a former cavalry officer and his brother Guido died fighting in Croatia as a cavalry officer on 16 February 1943 while commanding the Cavalleggeri di Alessandria regiment.M.

Formed by individuals and institutions, IEF is dedicated to the conservation of African and Asian elephants worldwide. In 1998, Executive Director of Fort Worth Zoo Michael Fouraker envisioned an elephant foundation to provide funds and expertise to elephant related projects. Michael was a board member of International Rhino Foundation (IRF), and used the organizational structure and business plan of IRF as a template for multiple elephant holding facilities with diverse missions to come together for a shared common goal of contributing to the long-term preservation of elephants. In November 1998, Michael invited nine representatives from zoos, private elephant facilities, circuses and a university to Fort Worth, Texas, to discuss how a foundation could significantly enhance current conservation efforts. From this first organizational meeting the International Elephant Foundation was born. The IEF was incorporated in 1999. Mission The mission of the IEF is to support and operate elephant conservation and education programs both in managed facilities and in the wild, with an emphasis on management, protection and scientific research. Our organization is recognized by, among others, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), the Morris Animal Foundation and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) as a bona fide conservation organization. Since 1999, IEF has provided support to over 80 elephant conservation projects worldwide and over $5 million in direct financial assistance. Projects The International Elephant Foundation provides funding for a number of conservation projects every year both in Africa and Asia. Below are examples of projects that have been or are being funded. Africa * Actions to Minimize Illegal Killing of Elephants in Tsavo Conservation Area, Kenya: The Tsavo ecosystem consisting of the Tsavo East and West and Chyulu Hills National Parks, South Kitui National Reserve, Taita and Galana Ranches (Kenya) and Mukomazi National Park (Tanzania) has about 12,573 elephants and has suffered from poaching. This project will increase the presence of Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) security personnel through enhanced ground and aerial surveillance and enhanced intelligence information collection, identify sites that require new patrol bases and construct simple housing units at these bases. * Alleviating Human-elephant conflict in Nkala Game Management Area, Kafue National Park, Zambia: Human-elephant conflict has escalated in this region and communities have become increasingly disgruntled, which may directly relate to poaching of elephants. To develop new tools to alleviate human-elephant conflict, this project trials experimental fences that use flashing lights to deter elephants from maize crops and investigates options for new cash-crops that elephants find unpalatable. * Support to Joint Conservancy Anti-poaching Team of Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) to Protect African Elephants in Northern Kenya: The ongoing and increasing threat of elephant poaching in the Laikipia- Isiolo-Samburu ecosystem (with the second largest population of elephants in Kenya) is the primary conservation need addressed by this project. The increased effectiveness of the joint anti-poaching team supported by this project has led to significant declines in elephant poaching throughout NRT and reversed the trend which had been steadily increasing throughout 2012. The presence of the joint anti-poaching team has also helped improve the civil and government security response to the theft of livestock and highway banditry as the same people are frequently in all three activities. * Conservation of Elephants in Southern Murchison Falls Conservation Area, Uganda: Fifty years ago Murchison Falls had the most elephants per square kilometer in Africa. Today after decades of uncontrolled poaching, a mere 500 elephants remain plus thousands of snares and gin traps, and large gangs of armed poachers. This project will build the Bulya Ranger Post to create a permanent hub of anti- poaching rangers in the core area of Bulya. The rangers will be trained and equipped with Geolocation cameras to manage patrols and provide evidence for the prosecution of poachers. In addition, a small research team will join the rangers to find elephants in the area, obtain aerial photography via a drone to collect key demographic data. * Serengeti Human Elephant Conflict Mitigation Program: Poaching and destroying wildlife natural habitats by setting bush fires, cutting down trees for timber, firewood and charcoal has triggered critical human-elephant conflict involving over 30,000 people living in 16 villages that border the Serengeti National Park. This project addresses the root causes of the conflict - poverty and lack of conservation education - through village meetings about conservation and habitat utilization, strategies for repelling the elephants from the village crops, and the acquisition of a grain grinding machine. Asia * Development of Elephant Conservation Response Units, Myanmar: Based on IEF‚Äôs successful Sumatran elephant Conservation Response Unit project, IEF is developing a long-term relationship with Myanmar Timber Enterprise (MTE) to assist in developing a Conservation Center and Conservation Response Units that would use out-of-work elephants for eco-education and conservation patrols. This center will also be a base for mahout training and an elephant hospital. * Plantation of Elephant Food Plants and Natural Barrier Plants, Assam, India: Human-elephant conflict is a problem in many villages in Assam. In addition to food crops, forests are being logged for their timber, fuel or cleared to make space for cash crop plantations such as rubber. As elephant habitat diminishes, elephants leave the forest and enter human communities in search of food. This project, proposed by affected villagers, will revive the degraded habitat of wild elephants by planting elephant food plants in the existing elephant habitat, and planting natural barriers of thorny plants - Assam lemon and thorny bamboo - between the forest and fields to protect the cultivated areas. *Building National Consensus for Asian Elephant Conservation in Cambodia: Habitat loss and degradation is a significant issue for Asian elephant in Cambodia and there has been few targeted conservation efforts. The short-term goals of this project are to collect critical information to enable a monitoring program to be established, to improve human-Asian elephant coexistence and to inform the development of a comprehensive Asian elephant national action plan for Cambodia. The long-term is to develop a monitoring program for Asian elephants in the southern Cardamom Mountains. * Schools Awareness Program, Sri Lanka: Human- elephant conflict is a growing problem in Sri Lanka as elephants are forced to leave the forest looking for food and water. These conflicts lead to human and elephant deaths and damage to crops and property. The Schools Awareness Program has presented curriculum at 1,500 schools in the last 10 years and addresses the value of elephants, the causes of conflict, how to minimize the conflicts and stresses the need for conservation. * Finding Possibilities of Re-opening Elephant Corridors in Northwestern Wildlife Region, Sri Lanka: This project will seek strategies for reopening elephant corridors in the northwestern wildlife region, identify the locations of existing elephant corridors and isolated elephant habitats, and identify suitable areas for development that will not block the natural migration routes and does not harm the natural food sources of the elephants.  Ex Situ  * EEHV Viral Genomics and Pathogenesis: The three most common and useful techniques for studying viruses are not applicable for Elephant Endotheliotropic Herpesvirus (EEHV). By using PCR amplification and DNA sequencing directly from clinical samples this project will study the genetic make-up of each virus and the genes and pathways they utilize. The ultimate goal is to identify viral immediate-early genes, latency genes and immune evasion genes that will provide insights into the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis, and will also help for generating engineered attenuated vaccine strains or new targets and approaches for better antiviral drugs. Asian Elephant Range States Meeting On April 18-20, 2017, government representatives from Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam met at the Asian Range States Meeting (AERSM) in Jakarta Indonesia. These countries represent the 13 countries who still have extant populations of wild Asian elephants. This meeting was only the second time that all Asian countries with extant populations of wild Asian elephants have met with the first such meeting in 2006 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The purpose of the AERSM was to improve international collaboration and cooperation in order to protect the endangered species. These nations committed to implementing a \\"strategic Action Plan for Asian elephants\\" and codified that vision in ‚ÄúThe Jakarta Declaration for Asian Elephant Conservation.‚Äù Hosted by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Republic of Indonesia, the AERSM was also facilitated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Species Survival Commission (SSC) Asian Elephant Specialist Group (AsESG). The International Elephant Foundation facilitated this meeting and as well as provided support. Funding was also provided by the Asian Elephant Conservation Fund of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The European Union (Indonesia Office) and the Regain Foundation, a local Indonesian organization, provided additional support as well. The AERSM and the resulting Jakarta Declaration for Asian Elephant Conservation has been recognized by conservation organizations and authorities as a benchmark from which to guide future conservation action. The United States Department of Fish and Wildlife Asian Elephant Conservation Fund recognizes these guidelines in \\"Notice of Funding Opportunity and [Grant] Application Instructions\\". Controversy IEF has board members from all areas of elephant work and management and expertise. This includes zoo directors, veterinarians, private owners, and circuses. In recent years animal rights organizations have tried to target IEF because of their affiliation with those who manage captive elephants. Animal rights organizations have targeted IEF board members, making claims of animal mistreatment in their own businesses, but no court has accepted their claims and attempts at legal action have been dismissed. In 2011, a lawsuit brought by animal rights organizations against Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus (whose Vice President for Government Relations Tom Albert is a Past President of IEF) was dismissed in federal court with presiding Judge Sullivan saying Tom Rider, the key witness for the animal rights organizations, was \\"essentially a paid plaintiff.\\" Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company, has since filed suit against the collection of animal rights organizations under federal racketeering and conspiracy (RICO) statutes. In December 2012 the ASPCA settled their part of the RICO lawsuit out of court, agreeing to pay Feld Entertainment $9.3 Million. In May 2014 the remaining animal rights groups being pursued for RICO violations agreed to settle out of court and pay Feld Entertainment $15.7 Million. These groups included HSUS, Fund for Animals, Animal Welfare Institute, Born Free Foundation USA (formerly the Animal Protection Institute), the Wildlife Advocacy Project, the law firm of Meyer, Glitzenstein & Crystal, and several current and former attorneys of that firm.

It is a motif in the visual arts, the performing arts, poetry, prose and music. Skanderbeg gathered quite a posthumous reputation in Western Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. With much of the Balkans under Ottoman rule and with the Turks at the gates of Vienna in 1683, nothing could have captivated readers in the West more than an action-packed tale of heroic Christian resistance to the \\"Moslem hordes\\". Literature There are two literature works on Skanderbeg written in the 15th century. The first was written at the beginning of 1480 by Serbian writer Martin Segon who was Catholic Bishop of Ulcinj and one of the most notable 15th-century humanists. A part of the text he wrote under title Martino Segono di Novo Brdo, vescovo di Dulcigno. Un umanista serbo-dalmata del tardo Quattrocento is short but very important biographical sketch on Skanderbeg (). Another 15th-century literature work with Skanderbeg as one of the main characters was Memoirs of a janissary () written in period 1490‚Äî1497 by Konstantin Mihailoviƒá, a Serb who was a janissary in Ottoman Army. In Western Europe the books on Skanderbeg began to appear in the early 16th century. Raffaelo Maffei published in Rome in 1506 his \\"Commentariorum\\" in which he published a short biography on Skanderbeg. Two years later one of the earliest works, the Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi, Epirotarum Principis () (Rome, 1508), was published a four decades after Skanderbeg's death. This book was written by Albanian historian Marin Barleti (), who, after experiencing the Ottoman capture of his native Shkod√´r at firsthand, settled in Padua where he became rector of the parish church of St. Stephan. Barleti dedicated his work to Don Ferrante Kastrioti, Skanderbeg's grandchild, and to posterity. The book was first published in Latin.Minna Skafte Jensen, 2006,A Heroic Tale: Edin Barleti's Scanderbeg between orality and literacy Barleti is sometimes inaccurate in favour of his hero, for example, according to Gibbon, Barleti claims that the Sultan was killed by disease under the walls of Kruj√´. Barleti's inaccuracies had also been noticed prior to Gibbon by Laonikos Chalkokondyles.see Laonikos Chalkokondyles, l vii. p. 185, l. viii. p. 229 Barleti made up spurious correspondence between Vladislav II of Wallachia and Skanderbeg wrongly assigning it to the year 1443 instead to the year of 1444. Barleti also invented correspondence between Skanderbeg and Sultan Mehmed II to match his interpretations of events. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Barleti's book was translated into a number of foreign-language versions: in German by Johann Pincianus (1533), in Italian by Pietro Rocca (1554, 1560), in Portuguese by Francisco D'Andrade (1567), in Polish by Ciprian Bazylik (1569), in French by Jaques De Lavardin (, 1576), and in Spanish by Juan Ochoa de la Salde (1582). The English version was a translation made by Zachary Jones Gentleman from de Lavardin's French version, and was published at the end of the 16th century under the title, Historie of George Castriot, surnamed Scanderbeg, King of Albinie; containing his Famous Actes, his Noble Deedes of Armes and Memorable Victories against the Turkes for the Faith of Christ. The Serbian version is the major part and the first manuscript of the Cetinje chronicle. All these books, written in the panegyric style that would often characterize medieval historians who regarded history mostly as a branch of rhetoric, inspired a wide range of literary and art works. Gjon Muzaka, an Albanian nobleman from the Muzaka family, wrote his memoires Breve memoria de li discendenti de nostra casa Musachi [Brief Chronicle on the Descendants of our Musachi Dynasty] in 1510 which contains substantial text about Skanderbeg. In 1562 John Shute translated to English tract Two very notable commentaries: The one of the original of the Turcks and the empire of the house of Ottomanno, and the other of the warre of the Turcke against George Scanderbeg written by Andrea Cambini and Paolo Giovio at the beginning of the 16th century. Michel de Montaigne wrote an essay on Skanderbeg at the end of the 16th century. Luis V√©lez de Guevara, a Spanish dramatist and novelist, wrote three comedies about Skanderbeg referred to as \\"escanderbechas\\". The first comedy titled El jen√≠zaro de Albania [The janissary of Albania] was written in period 1608‚Äî1610, the second titled El principe Escanderbey [Prince Scanderbeg] in period 1620‚Äî1628 and the third titled El principe esclavo [The Slave Prince] in 1629. Skanderbeg was one of the heroes (Scannarebecco) of Pentamerone written by Giambattista Basile, published posthumously in 1634 and 1636. Frang Bardhi, an Albanian Catholic bishop born in Albania, also wrote Kastrioti's biography, prompted by writings of another Catholic bishop, Ivan Tomko Mrnaviƒá. His book \\"Georgius Castriotus, Epirensis vulgo Scanderbegh, Epirotarum Princeps Fortissimus\\" was published in Latin in 1636.Georgius Castriotus Epirensis, vulgo Scanderbegh. Per Franciscum Blancum, De Alumnis Collegij de Propaganda Fide Episcopum Sappatensem etc. Venetiis, Typis Marci Ginammi, MDCXXXVI (1636). French philosopher, Voltaire, in his works, held in very high consideration the hero from Albania. Ludvig Holberg, a Danish writer and philosopher, claimed that Skanderbeg is one of the greatest generals in history.Holberg on Scanderbeg by Bjoern Andersen Sir William Temple considered Skanderbeg to be one of the seven greatest chiefs without a crown, along with Belisarius, Flavius Aetius, John Hunyadi, Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, Alexander Farnese, and William the Silent. A number of poets and composers have also drawn inspiration from his military career. The French 16th-century poet Ronsard wrote a poem about him, as did the 19th- century American poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Gibbon, the 18th-century historian, holds Skanderbeg in high regard with panegyric expressions. Numerous poets and writers from Dubrovnik wrote about Skanderbeg, like Ivan Gunduliƒá in his greatest work Osman at the beginning of the 17th century and Junije Palmotiƒá in his work Glasovi where he mentions Skanderbeg among other heroes of Serbian epic poetry. Many authors from Croatia wrote about Skanderbeg, including Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá in 1682 and especially Andrija Kaƒçiƒá Mio≈°iƒá whose poems about Skanderbeg, published in 1756, were basis for tragedy Skenderbeg written by Ivan Kukuljeviƒá Sakcinski in the 19th century. Giammaria Biemmi, an Italian priest, published a work on Skanderbeg titled Istoria di Giorgio Castrioto Scanderbeg-Begh in Brescia, Italy in 1742.Frash√´ri, Kristo (2002) (in Albanian), Gjergj Kastrioti Sk√´nderbeu: jeta dhe vepra, p. 9. He claimed that he had found a work published in Venice in 1480 and written by an Albanian humanist from Bar, in modern-day Montenegro whose brother was a warrior in Skanderbeg's personal guard. According to Biemmi, the work had lost pages dealing with Skanderbeg's youth, the events from 1443‚Äì1449, the Siege of Kruj√´ (1467), and Skanderbeg's death. Biemmi referred to the author of the work as Antivarino, meaning the man from Bar.Frash√´ri, Kristo (2002) (in Albanian), Gjergj Kastrioti Sk√´nderbeu: jeta dhe vepra, p. 10. The \\"Anonymous of Antivari\\" was Biemmi's invention that some historians (Fan S. Noli, and Athanase Gegaj), Albanian writers had not discovered and used his forgery as source in their works. Notable works of Tripo Smeƒáa (1755‚Äî1812), a historian and writer from Perast in Boka Kotorska, include Italian language tragedy \\"Skanderbeg\\". Vuk Karad≈æiƒá was particularly interested in Skanderbeg's era as important period of joint Albanian-Serbian struggle against the Ottomans in the 15th century, so he paid for translation of one of Skanderbeg's biographies to Serbian language. In 1816 Sima Milutinoviƒá Sarajlija, Serbian poet and historian, wrote two poems about Skanderbeg. Milutinoviƒá considered himself as spiritual descendant of Skanderbeg. Mio≈°iƒá's poems about Skanderbeg from his most important work A Pleasant Discourse of the Slavic People were also basis for ≈Ωivot i vite≈°ka voevanja slavnog kneza epirskog ƒêorƒëa Kastriota Skenderbega written by Serbian playwright Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá in 1828. Ljudevit Gaj published in 1839 and 1840 in periodical Danica ilirska two texts about Skanderbeg, Juraj Skenderbeg and Muhammad and Juraj Skenderbeg and Amurat. Juraj Matija ≈†porer wrote a tragedy Kastriota ≈†kenderbeg: tragedija u pet izvedah published in Zagreb in 1849 and depicted Skanderbeg as Slav who gathered around himself all South Slavs from Istria to Kruj√´. Skanderbeg was a subordinate theme in epic poem written by Serbian 19th century academic Jovan Subotiƒá. Skanderbeg is also mentioned by Prince of Montenegro, Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈°, one of the greatest poets of Serbian literature, in his poem The Mountain Wreath (1847),The Mountain Wreath, Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈° (Serbian) and in False Tsar Stephen the Little (1851).False Tsar Stephen the Little, Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈° (Serbian) In 1855, Camille Paganel wrote Histoire de Scanderbeg, inspired by the Crimean War,Camille Paganel, 1855,\\"Histoire de Scanderbeg, ou Turcs et Chr√©tiens du XVe si√®cle\\" whereas in the lengthy poetic tale Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (1812‚Äì1819), Byron wrote with admiration about Skanderbeg and his warrior nation.. Girolamo de Rada-Jeronim de Rada, an Albanian-Italian writer (Arberesh), published poem in AlbanianScanderbeccu i pa-faan [Misfortunate Scanderbeg] in period 1872‚Äî1884. Paul Pisani, French historian and Franciscan friar, wrote La L√©gende de Skanderbeg in 1891. The first [Albanian poet] who wrote epic account about Skanderbeg's battles against the Ottoman Empire was Naim Frash√´ri, Albanian poet and writer in Histori e Sk√´nderbeut [History of Skanderbeg] published in 1898. A short story ƒêuraƒë Kastriotiƒá Skenderbeg written by the Serbian writer Stevan Sremac was published in 1909. Ismail Kadare wrote The Castle with Skanderbeg as one of the main characters In The Castle, work written in 1970 by Ismail Kadare, an Albanian writer who was several times candidate for Nobel prize, which refers to Skanderbeg though he is not a protagonist. Theatre Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá, author of Serbian ƒêorƒëe Kastriotiƒá, 1403‚Äì1468, the Greatest Strategian of the World Skanderbeg is the protagonist of three 18th-century British tragedies: William Havard's Scanderbeg, A Tragedy (1733), George Lillo's The Christian Hero (1735), and Thomas Whincop's Scanderbeg, Or, Love and Liberty (1747).Havard, 1733, Scanderbeg, A Tragedy; Lillo, 1735, The Christian Hero; Whincop, 1747, Scanderbeg, Or, Love and Liberty. Paul Ulrich Dubuisson, a French playwright, wrote a tragedy Scanderbeg, tragedie (en 5 actes en vers) [in five acts and in verse] performed in the theatre on May 9, 1786. In 1828 Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá, Serbian playwright of Serbian and Aromanian origin and one of the most famous dramatists to emerge from the Balkans in the 19th century, wrote a tragedy Serbian ƒêorƒëe Kastriotiƒá, 1403‚Äì1468, the Greatest Strategian of the World (). It was adapted for many different theatre plays. It was performed for the first time in 1848 in Belgrade. One of them was theatre play which had its premiere at the beginning of December 1906 in the theatre in Nik≈°iƒá, Kingdom of Montenegro. Theatre troupe of Serbian National Theatre performed adaptation of Sterija's tragedy Skanderbeg on April 26, 1956, during the first theatre festival Sterija Theater Festival () in Novi Sad, in honor of Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá and 100 years of his death. Cinema The Great Warrior Skanderbeg (, ), a 1953 Albanian-Soviet biographical film, earned an International Prize at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival. Music  Folkloric repertoire  The wars between the Ottomans and Skanderbeg along with his death resulted the in the migration of Albanians to southern Italy and creation of the Arb√´resh community (Italo- Albanians). The memory of Skanderbeg and his exploits was maintained and survived among the Arb√´resh through songs, in the form of a Skanderbeg cycle. \\"The memory of the Albanian national hero was maintained vividly among the Albanians of Italy, those who emigrated to Calabria and Sicily, following his death.... Living compactly in Christian territory, though in separate communities, the Italo-Albanians have preserved the songs about Skenderbeg and his exploits which their ancestors had brought from the mother country. Today one may even speak of the existence of a Skenderbeg cycle among them, if one takes into account also the songs on other Albanian heroes who surrounded him.\\"  Opera  The Italian baroque composer Antonio Vivaldi composed an opera entitled Scanderbeg (first performed 1718), libretto written by Antonio Salvi. Another opera, entitled Scanderbeg, was composed by 18th-century French composer Fran√ßois Franc≈ìur (first performed 1763).The Scanderberg Operas by Vivaldi and Francouer by Del Brebner Serbian choral conductor Kosta Manojloviƒá published in 1933 his collection of six choral songs based on folk songs from Albania and titled it The Songs from the Land of Skenderbeg (). In the 20th century, Albanian composer Prenk√´ Jakova composed a third opera, entitled Gjergj Kastrioti Sk√´nderbeu, which premiered in 1968 for the 500th anniversary of the hero's death. Other Skanderbeg's memory has been engraved in many museums, such as the Skanderbeg Museum next to Kruj√´ Castle. A palace in Rome in which Skanderbeg resided during his 1466‚Äì67 visits to the Vatican is still called Palazzo Skanderbeg and currently houses the Italian museum of pasta: the palace is located between the Fontana di Trevi and the Quirinal Palace. The Government of Macedonia is financing the building of Skanderbeg Square in Skopje which began on 17 January 2012. Statues and paintings In 1884 Paja Jovanoviƒá, one of the greatest Serbian Realist painters, painted one of his very valuable works titled The Poem of Skanderbeg (). Many monuments are dedicated to his memory in the Albanian cities of Tirana (in the Skanderbeg Square by Odhise Paskali), Kruj√´, and Peshkopi. Monuments or statues of Skanderbeg are built in the cities of Skopje and Debar, in North Macedonia; Pristina, in Kosovo; Geneva, in Switzerland; Brussels, in Belgium; and other settlements in southern Italy where there is an Arb√´resh√´ community. In 2006, a statue of Skanderbeg was unveiled on the grounds of St. Paul's Albanian Catholic Community in Rochester Hills, Michigan, the first Skanderbeg statue in the United States. Also in Rome, a statue is dedicated to the Albanian hero in Piazza Albania.

It is a 50th anniversary story for the character of Gyro Gearloose, as well as a sequel to A Christmas for Shacktown (Dell One Shot #367, January 1952) by Carl Barks, and tells of the creation of Gyro's Little Helper. Its INDUCKS story code is D 2001-143 . It first appeared in May 2002 as a two-part story in the issues #19 and #20 of Anders And & Co, a weekly published by Danish Disney licensee Egmont Group. Its first publication in its original English was in Uncle Scrooge #324, November 2003, by Gemstone Publishing. Plot Donald tells his nephews the story about how Gyro started his business despite the fact that they were there. The story starts when Scrooge was still living with Donald and his nephews. Scrooge and Donald got into an argument which led to Scrooge breaking Donald's lamp. Donald took the lamp to get it repaired by Fulton Gearloose but unfortunately Donald finds out that Fulton has just retired and turned the shop over to his son Gyro. Gyro agrees to fix Donald's lamp, but Donald suggests that he should find a way to get Scrooge's money out of the cavern that it was stuck in. Scrooge and Donald showed Gyro where the money was kept and explained the situation. When they went back to Gyro's shop he asked someone to turn on the light, but the lamp turned itself on. The lamp was hit by the unfinished think box that Gyro accidentally hit earlier. Gyro modified the lamp to have arms and legs and doll shoes. Donald put in a light bulb, and they created Gyro's Little Helper. Gyro's Little Helper went in the cavern and found some money. They found out how deep the cavern is and pumped up some helium gas as the money slowly went back up to the Money Bin. Unfortunately the gas worked too well as it made the Money Bin float into the air. Little Helper used his head to break the plastic cover to let the gas out and the Money Bin wound up on the statue of Cornelius Coot. Scrooge called for some rescue plans to his Money Bin off the statue. The construction workers covered the hole with cement and gravel and the Money Bin was restored to its original location. After that Gyro and his Little Helper cleaned up Gyro's workshop. Donald let Gyro keep Little Helper alive despite the fact that it was made from his lamp. The story ends with Gyro and Little Helper trying to sell inventions as Donald finishes telling the nephews his story. Background  \\"The problem of the lost money\\" Don Rosa is usually hesitant in using ideas that fans send him, because he knows that neither can he ever pay them for their ideas, nor is Disney ever likely to do so. Gyro's First Invention is special in that Rosa accepted a number of its key elements that were offered to him by Sigvald Gr√∏sfjeld Jr., owner and maintainer of the Norwegian Rosa fansite The D.U.C.K.man.See note \\"Idea by Sigvald Gr√∏sfjeld jr.\\" at INDUCKS entry for Gyro's First InventionGr√∏sfjeld Jr., Sigvald. The Story behind \\"Gyro's First Invention\\", published in Castagno, Paolo (ed.; 2011). Don Rosa: A Little Something Special, pp. 232-234, published as a bi-lingual (Italian and English) print-on-demand book by www.papersera.net (no ISBN, but see http://www.papersera.net/papersera/DonRosa.php for information) (Another notable exception is The Dream of a Lifetime! that Rosa created based on an idea by an anonymous fan from France only known by the initials F.S.M.) In his research for his website, Gr√∏sfjeld had come upon newsgroup exchanges between Rosa and his fans regarding \\"the problem of the lost money in A Christmas for Shacktown\\". In that classic Duck story by Carl Barks, Scrooge eventually loses all his money in a cave below his money bin, and the only access he has to it is by means of a little toy train (any other means would make the cave collapse and have Scrooge's money irretrievably fall into a reservoir of quicksand just below), bringing him a mere handful of coins and bills back on every trip in and out of the cave, which makes it clear for the characters at the end of the story that it will take Scrooge several hundreds years to regain his entire \\"three cubic acres of money\\". However, upon Scrooge's next appearances in the one-pager Osogood Silver Polish and the long adventure story Only a Poor Old Man (both in Dell One Shot #386, March 1952) he has somehow, magically relocated all his fortunes back into the bin, a mystery for which Barks had never given an explanation. Gr√∏sfjeld's solution On 11 January 1999, Gr√∏sfjeld sent Rosa an e-mail containing his thoughts he had for a potential sequel to A Christmas for Shacktown: > \\"Somewhere you say that many fans and several editors for many years have > asked you to do a sequel to the old Barks classic A Christmas for Shacktown > (1951), where you were supposed to tell how $crooge managed to save his > money from the deep pit much faster than he thought in the end of that > story. [...] Anyway, I think that [...] it would be interesting to see an > explanation of that mystery. If you ever decide to do that story (I know you > like sequels) I have some ideas: My idea is that, the problems $crooge faces > in the end of A Christmas for Shacktown cries out for a GEARLOOSE-MIRACLE. > Perhaps this story thus could also show the first meeting between $crooge > and Gyro? ...perhaps this could be a possible story for the first future > [50th] Gyro-anniversary?\\" - Sigvald Gr√∏sfjeld Jr., e-mail to Don Rosa, 11 > January 1999 Rosa immediately replied to Gr√∏sfjeld the very next day, 12 January 1999: > \\"That is a great story idea!!! I love it! I need to check when the first > Gyro story appeared in WDC&S;, but if Christmas for Shacktown predates it, > that is a GREAT idea! They want me to do a Christmas story AND a sequel to > that story AND they will probably ask me to do a 50th anniversary Gyro > story! I am going to write this idea down *immediately*!\\" - Don Rosa, e-mail > to Sigvald Gr√∏sfjeld Jr., 12 January 1999 Yet another day later, Gr√∏sfjeld had a few details worked out for Rosa: > \\"For some reason, Gyro [...] need[s] a little device to enter the pit the > same way [...] [Huey, Dewey, and Louie]'s train did (reasons could be to get > him/them samples of the soil in there, to help him/them drawing a detailed > map of the situation inside the pit, or perhaps to install some other > devices in there).

It held that it is an improper use of a directors' power to frustrate a takeover bid through issuing a poison pill. For public companies, the case is superseded by Rule 21 of the City Code on Mergers and Takeovers, which prohibits any action that frustrates a takeover bid. Facts The former managing director (Aubrey Glasner) of Stratford UK (a subsidiary of Oaktree Capital Management LLC, a Delaware institutional money manager) had entered the company into a poison pill contract. If the managing director or the chairman (Rolf Nordstrum) left office, or if there was a takeover, the company would owe a crippling payment to a Criterion Properties through a put option. Criterion and Oaktree were in a joint venture. When the board of Stratford learnt of the pill, it dismissed Glasner. Judgment High Court Hart J at first instance struck down the pill. Quoting from Megarry VC's judgment in Cayne v Global Natural Resources Plc, he argued that the refusal to consider such reasons must not be taken too far and that the board must have authority to interfere with these constitutional rights where the threat is big enough. A company cannot, he suggests, be incapable of acting where it is at risk of ‚Äòimpotence and beggary‚Äô. Court of Appeal Brooke LJ and Carnwath LJ held that the judge's conclusion that the directors' had improperly exercised their powers was correct and should not have gone on to consider the actual knowledge of the director. House of Lords The House of Lords held that the case should be remitted to trial, to determine whether the directors had the authority to issue a poison pill. Lord Nicholls held that there was no question of ‚Äòknowing receipt‚Äô. An agreement can be set aside if company assets have been misapplied ‚Äòand irrespective of whether B still has the assets in question, A will have a personal claim against B for unjust enrichment, subject always to a defence of change of position. B‚Äôs personal accountability will not be dependent upon proof of fault or ‚Äòunconscionable‚Äô conduct on his part. B‚Äôs accountability, in this regard, will be ‚Äòstrict‚Äô. Lord Scott held that the agreement would obstruct any takeover, not just the ‚Äòunwanted predator‚Äô. So the case turned on authority, actual, apparent or ostensible. See also *Cheff v.

The practice occurs mainly in rural parts of South Africa, in particular the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. The Basotho call it Tjhobediso. Among the Xhosa and Zulu people, ukuthwala, or bride abduction, was once an acceptable way for two young people in love to get married when their families opposed the match (and so actually a form of elopement). Ukuthwala has been abused, however, \\"to victimize isolated rural women and enrich male relatives.\\" While the practice of marriage by abduction or marriage by capture may be traced back to ancient times, however the abductees are often reported to be under- aged girls, including some as young as eight. The practice received negative publicity, with media reporting in 2009 that more than 20 Eastern Cape girls are forced to drop out of school every month because of ukuthwala.  Origins  The first known example of the practice can be traced to ancient Roman traditions. According to sources, The Rape of the Sabine Women was an incident in Roman history in which the men of Rome committed a mass abduction of young women from neighbouring tribes in the region. The Rape occurred in the early history of Rome, shortly after its founding by Romulus and his mostly male followers. Seeking wives in order to establish families, the Romans negotiated unsuccessfully with the Sabines, who populated the surrounding area. The Sabines feared the emergence of a rival society and refused to allow their women to marry the Romans. Consequently, the Romans planned to abduct Sabine women during a festival of Neptune Equester. According to Roman historians such as Livy, many people from Rome's neighboring towns attended, including folk from the Caeninenses, Crustumini, and Antemnates, and many of the Sabines. At the festival, Romulus gave a signal, at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men. The indignant abductees were soon implored by Romulus to accept Roman husbands. Livy claims that no direct sexual assault took place, albeit the fuller evidence, when compared with the later history, suggests a seduction based on promises by the Romans and then betrayal of those promises. Livy says that Romulus offered them free choice and promised civic and property rights to women. According to Livy, Romulus spoke to them each in person, declaring \\"that what was done was owing to the pride of their fathers, who had refused to grant the privilege of marriage to their neighbours; but notwithstanding, they should be joined in lawful wedlock, participate in all their possessions and civil privileges, and, than which nothing can be dearer to the human heart, in their common children.\\" In South Africa, the custom originated from the Xhosa people, though the practice has expanded into different ethnic groups. The act of ukuthwala traditionally required the culprit to pay one or more head of cattle to the father or legal guardian of the girl. Unsuspecting girls who had not consented to ukuthwala usually did not object to its purpose. Sometimes the girl genuinely did not wish to be married, although usually girls were conditioned from childhood to look forward to the day, and to believe that marriage and childbearing are the fulfilment of life. A modern interpretation of this practice encourages men to abduct young girls (commonly under 18) for the purpose of marriage. Prevalence In Lusikisiki in 2009, there were instances of young girls, from orphanages, being forced into marriages to older men. There have been instances of young girls being forced into illegal marriages to old widowed men (about 55 to 70 years). The practice of ukuthwalwa has been apologised as a mock abduction or an irregular proposal intended to achieve a traditional law marriage.(Bennett Customary Law in South Africa -2004) Even though the laws are not stringent enough to curb such a custom, The Parliament of The Republic of South Africa is focusing on preventive measures to empower women to report cases of exploitation and mobilizing community action for such incidents.

The events concerns two tenants of Chateau de la Motte during World War II in Lower Normandy, France. The first was the mayor of the commune of Joue du Plain, Emile Buffon, who owned an animal brokering business, and rented the Chateau's attached farm.Miniac,2008, Secondly there was Jacques Batchlier, who rented two buildings next to the main house, and had a dairy business. Batchlier lived in Chateau de la Motte with his wife, Denise. Emile Buffon lived at a rented farm about two kilometers away called Mancelaire.Miniac,2008, Up until 1944, Normandy had been less disturbed by the War. The rich farmland permitted locals to live much better than those living with chronic shortages in cities. Long lost cousins in the countryside suddenly found themselves with many new relatives wanting to rekindle their rural roots. German troops assigned to the Normandy often cooperated with locals in order not to attract unwanted attention from Nazi administrators. All this changed in 1944. Arms depot at Chateau de la Motte, Jou√© du Plain In spring of 1944, all of Europe knew that an Allied invasion was imminent, but the time and place were unknown. Germany buttressed its anti-r√©sistance forces and moved large numbers of the Gestapo into France in January 1944. The results were numerous arrests, killings and deportations to Nazi concentration camps. The Germans, in a chronic need for manpower, had discontinued the voluntary worker immigration for the Fatherland's war factories, and made it mandatory (STO Service du Travail Obligatoire), avoidance brought death. Eight young men in nearby R√¢ne, were shot by firing squad to be an example. April 27, 1944, a little over one month before D-day, the regional French R√©sistance chief, Jacques Foccart, with his lieutenant sitting behind him, drove an 8-cylinder Nervasport from the Chateau de la Motte. Jacques Batchlier sat in the passenger's seat. He owned the dairy, but rented the buildings at Chateau de la Motte, which he used as a base for the local Resistance. The car rode low, heavily loaded with weapons and explosives which were intended to be used as part of a ‚ÄúPlan Tortue‚Äù (turtle plan) to slow the German armored divisions from reinforcing their defenses wherever the Allies landed. Nervasport: vehicle used to smuggle arms for the Resistance in Jou√© du Plain. It was night and they slowed as they approached a German roadblock. Just as the driver reached the point of no return he accelerated, and crashed through the barricade, a blast of machine-gun fire ripped across the back of the vehicle. The man behind the driver slumped over with a bullet in his spine.Miniac,2008,page 158 The two partisans sped toward the town of √âcouch√© as German soldiers raced to catch them. They managed to elude their pursuers by passing in front of a scheduled train, as it passed through town. Just as the Germans were catching up with the Nervasport, the Frenchmen turned across the tracks narrowly missing the oncoming train, which blocked the pursuit.Miniac,2008,page 158 They had a few minutes of precious time, but a fatally wounded comrade, a now known vehicle, and a trunk load of weapons to hide. They drove to a crossroad and fired several shots, knowing that witnesses would be called on to verify the sound later in an investigation, which was sure to follow. They then drove to the farm, Vigani√®re, near Chateau de la Motte. Jules Christophe, a member of the Resistance hid them. Following hasty instructions they parked the car in a barn, Foccart borrowed a bike to pedal into Ecouche to find the doctor Pasquier, a member of the R√©sistance.Miniac,2008,page 158 Later the doctor told the Germans, that an unknown woman on a bike had informed him of finding a still living body on the roadside at the crossroads, where they fired the pistol. Disaster had been delayed for the immediate future.Miniac,2008,page 158 Cars were by permit only, and a Nervasport was more rare still. Only one was registered in the area. They Germans now knew what to look for it: the dairy at Chateau de la Motte had the only local car known.Miniac,2008,page 159 De Gaulle and the Resistance goals Neither the Allies nor General Charles de Gaulle, encouraged sabotage and armed resistance except just before the Invasion. Attracting Nazi attention with untrained amateur warriors would only jeopardize the more desirable intelligence gathering by the French underground, learning critical information on size, strength, and location of enemy troops. The arms depot consisted of mostly anti-tank weapons, which were intended to kink up the Nazi reaction time by delaying the Panzer divisions of tanks the Germans would send to the landing sites. A few days delay were critical. By the time of D-day two thirds of the Normandy rail lines were sabotaged and mostly useless to the Germans. Weapons consisted of mines, railway explosives, hand grenades, bazookas, and various small arms to protect the saboteurs.Schoenbrun, 1980,page 310 Collaborator Bernard Jardin What the local French didn't know was to come to stab them in the back over and over again. First a local Frenchman had been recently arrested for black market activities was converted to the German cause. The collaborator Bernard Jardin lived with his mother, a local caf√© owner. Smart, energetic and ambitious, he knew how to get the hard information, and cruelty came easily to him. He personally killed 4 Frenchmen he suspected of being Resistance. His conversion came in April 1944.Miniac,2008,page 200 May 10, a few weeks before D-day, June 6, the second jab came from Nazi breaking into an office in Angers, an hour to the south of Ecouche by car. There a list of names brought arrest and torture. Capture and torture bought more names and one was the name and description of a small man named Bachelier who ran a dairy in Jou√© du Plain. His dairy operated in the two buildings at Chateau de la Motte.Miniac,2008,page 159 May 12, M. Bachelier saw the Germans roar into the Chateau farmyard and he knew he had been found out. He jumped out of the bedroom window escaping across the road into a nearby forest.Miniac,2008,page 160 The soldiers didn't find the weapons, but took Yvonne,Bachelier's wife in for questioning, Bernard Jardin offered her dinner with champagne, but under the circumstances she declined. Five hours later she returned home.Miniac,2008,page 160 The Germans then went in search of Bachelier's sister and brother, Denise and Maurice. Finding the sister just as she arrived back from delivering rescued American pilot Charles Moore to a safer hideout after hiding him at the Chateau. Both brother and sister were sent to the death camp, Ravenstracht, near Berlin.Miniac,2008,page 164 Other names found in Angers brought the downfall of many of R√©sistants in the neighboring town of Argentan. Most of them soon died in Nazi concentration camps only months before the War's end, others died after the French liberation as a result of the inhuman conditions there. The Germans now knew about the ‚ÄúPlan Tortue‚Äù. The doctor's false excuse for finding the bullet ridden partisan died with the patient. The German autopsy revealed a German bullet in the spine. The Gestapo then knew that the dead man was from the suspected vehicle, and it was sure to be carrying weapons. An ‚Äúarmes despot‚Äù nearby seemed likely, and Chateau de la Motte had enough scattered buildings to hide anything.Miniac,2008,page 160 D-day June 6 followed days later: The Longest Day, D-day, began. One and half million men assaulted and crowded onto the beaches of Normandy. It took six weeks for the American forces to finally break out of the German containment at the battle of St.Lo on July 25. The Nazi machine cranked on even as Patton's army swept first west then south around and encircled the German army. Local French knew the occupiers‚Äô days were numbered and they grew braver, but German retaliation grew more desperate and cruel. Entire French communities were killed; the most famous being the massacre d'Oradour-sur- Glane. Vinen,2007,page 327 In Jou√© du Plain, within an easy two-hour drive from those landing beaches, Nazi power remained strong and tenacious. Meanwhile, the Germans found nothing at the Chateau.Miniac,2008,page 164 Emile Buffon, Mayor of Jou√© du Plain Plan of Chateau de la Motte. Individual captions appear with mouse role-over or touch. North is upper right hand corner. Mayor Buffon was an animal dealer. Part of his business consisted of gathering animals for the Germans. It was an unwelcome job, but mandated by the Germans as well as his unasked role as mayor. However, like many older patriotic French, he was Vichy supporter, a decorated World War I veteran. Although gassed in the Great War, he was a large, healthy man. As a well-liked community member he was trying to make the best of a difficult time.Miniac,2008,page 153-4 As part of the armistice with Germany, France had agreed to pay for their defeat. Much of that was providing farm animals and produce to the occupiers; personal trucks, cars and horses had all been confiscated several years before just after the French defeat in 1939. At the same time as he benefited from working with the Germans, he was in a position to know information when it was rare and valuable.Miniac,2008,page 167 Emile Buffoon had family besides his daughter and wife; his brother, Georges Buffon and his two sons Jean and Ren√©, had the Metz farm next to Emile's. However blood was all they shared. An unexplained animosity separated the two since childhood. Emile Buffon was in a position of knowing too much from all sides. His brother, Georges, along with his two sons were active members of the R√©sistance, and it was to them that Jacques Bachelier took his anger of his suspected betrayal.Miniac,2008,page 158 A few days before the first raid on Chateau de la Motte by the Gestapo, someone had hinted to Emile Buffon that he should check his pigs in the chateau barn. Mayor Buffon found a weapons hoard. He found Batchelier and insisted he move the weapons. Several days later the Germans tipped off by the Angers capture mentioned earlier, arrived in force. However, Bachelier believed he knew his traitor.Miniac,2008,page 163 Bachelier had already moved the munitions to another Chateau building; a day worker's house in the orchard. A long window where cows could put their head into and eat from a trough accessed the lower floor. Entry was difficult except for a small man who could crawl in and dig under the animal feed and pass the arms out through the window.Miniac,2008,page 163 During the night of July 14, 1400 kilograms, or one and half tons of weaponry, were hauled across country under the short night of the Norman summer. Later witnesses said the remainder was dumped in the Chateau's fishponds.Miniac,2008,page 164Sten gun used by the Resistance during World War II. From there the resistants moved the hidden cache south near R√¢ne. In later court testimony, Gabriel Ramier said that he drove the arms to Bachilier mother's farm, outside the region to the south. Ramier had a truck because he worked for a stonemason contracted with the German TODT Corporation, hired to build the Atlantic Wall, the thousand mile coastal fortress, designed to stop any Allied Invasion. M. Ramier said there was plenty of work if you would work for the Germans, and now his truck carrying weapons buried under the sacks of cement was the payoff.Miniac,2008,page 163 Timeline: Spring and summer 1944 Resistance activity, significant events, and assassination time line.

In 1981, it was granted university status, and a year later it was renamed after the singer and East German actor Ernst Busch. History The roots of the university go back to the Max Reinhardt drama school established in 1905 at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin. As was usual at that time, it was a private institution. The first training facility was the ground floor of the Palais Wesendonkschen, In den Zelten 21, where Reinhardt lived, near the Reichstag. Reinhardt emigrated in 1933 and the Nazis took over the theatre along with the acting school. The director of the Deutsches Theater, Heinz Hilpert, secured subsidies for the first time in the school's history, but struggled to keep the school open. His work has been considered comparable to that of Gustaf Gr√ºndgens. After 1945, Boleslaw Barlog was rebuilding the theater world in West Berlin; Gustav von Wangenheim, returned from exile in Russia, became director of the Deutsches Theater, shortly followed by Wolfgang Langhoff, who held the position for many years. Teaching was resumed from July 1946, subsidized by the city of Berlin. After the currency reform of 1948, the school used rooms of the destroyed Schiller Theater in the west of the city. State Drama School Berlin's State Drama School was legally and conceptually founded in September 1951 as a public sector body. In a conscious departure from previous practice, the somewhat remote training center known as the Old Boat House in Niedersch√∂neweide, in East Berlin, was chosen. Work on a new building started in 1979 and was completed in 1981. During this time, the school was in a school building in Marzahn. Major teachers were Rudolf Penka and Kurt Veth (both directors of the school), Wolfgang Engel, Thomas Langhoff, Ursula Karusseit, Hans-Georg Simmgen, and Jutta Hoffmann; others included dance teacher Hilde Buchenwald and, as a speech trainer, the poet Karl Mickel. In East Germany, the school was considered a hotbed of talent. Present day About 90 students are enrolled at the drama school in drama, puppetry, directing and dance. The university uses the Berlin Workers' Theatre as a venue. Every year, about 15 productions are staged. The Ernst Busch Academy of Dramatic Arts Berlin is a member institution of the Permanent Conference of actor training (SKS). In 2004, the university won the Berlin Art Prize and became widely known due to the long-term documentary Addicted to Acting by Andres Veiel (1997‚Äì2004). A political storm arose in June 2005 over the appointment of sociologist Wolfgang Engler as rector of the university. He succeeded Klaus V√∂lker, who had led the school since 1993. The institute was awarded the 2010 \\"Film Culture Award in Mannheim-Heidelberg\\", which the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg awards to companies, institutions, and individuals who have rendered outstanding service continuously over many years to film culture in Germany. , the academy has relocated to the former theatre workshops of Berlin, with purpose-built conversions and extensions of the building.Patrik Dierks Norbert Sachs, architects' website.

In commercial terms it never progressed beyond marginal viability and it withdrew from auto-making towards the end of 1953. The company was in no way connected and should not be confused with the earlier Paris based business A. Lambert & Cie which had produced cars between 1902 and 1906. History Lambert‚Äôs first car, in 1926, featured an engine bought in from Ruby. A front-wheel drive model with the same Ruby engine followed in 1931. From 1933 a front wheel drive single cylinder cycle car was offered. During the war Lambert may have worked on electric vehicles. Germain Lambert is remembered chiefly as a skilled mechanic and enthusiastic participant in motor racing. He produced a few cars between 1926 and 1936, after which he appears to have lost interest in auto-making for the rest of the decade. The M√¢con based Lambert business relocated in 1931 to Rheims which was a centre for motor racing in the 1930s. Soon after this Germain Lambert was running his own auto-repair workshop not too far away at Sainte-Menehould, and the business appears to have prospered allowing him in due course to return his attention to more exciting, if less financially stable, ventures. Lambert was still working out of his premises near Sainte-Menehould in 1940 at the time of the German invasion undertaking specialist jobs in connection with the auto- business and also components for saw-mills. Fuel for civilian use rapidly disappeared and Lambert found it inappropriate to travel the region on public transport to deliver small items to customers, so in 1940 he came up with a design for a cycle car and constructed two prototypes. The emphasis, necessarily, was on light weight construction, with a tubular frame and timber superstructure. Overall the device weighed only 150 kg when empty. However, it was necessary to add 75 kg for the 24 volt batteries in order to power the ¬Ω hp engine lurking somewhere under the bodywork. Rubber and tires being unavailable, the unsprung wheels were wrapped around with multiple layers of bandage which made for a firm ride. The vehicle could move only slowly, and managed a range of very roughly 20 kilometers (12 miles) between charges. These were troubled times, and Lambert was able to have his cycle car homologated for sale, but he soon rejected the idea, ostensibly because he could not bring himself to produce such a slow and ugly ‚Äúcar‚Äù. Lambert moved again, this time to Giromagny in 1946. In May 1948 he unveiled a strikingly original looking sports coupe which five months later he exhibited at the Paris Motor Show. The light sports coupe first seen at Paris was the first of a succession of similar cars powered by a 1,087 cc engine still supplied by Ruby. At the end of the war with volume production of fighter-planes less of a priority in western Europe, the newly developed aluminium business was looking for new opportunities. Steel was in short supply: the new Lambert model was one of a number of cars appearing in France at this time with an all-aluminium body embellished with large wings that covered the rear wheels. The transmission and mechanically operated brakes were conventional despite the car‚Äôs elaborate body-work. The Lambert that appeared at the 1948 motor show was itself never developed beyond prototype stage, but it provided the basis for a ‚Äúcompetition‚Äù version followed in 1951 by a cabriolet branded as the Simplicia and a Torino coupe. A Luxor cabriolet appeared in 1952 and several were sold, but by now the business was heavily indebted. Lambert found himself required by his bankers to sell his workshop near Belfort, his machine tools, his inventory of raw materials and even his house. By the end of 1953 the business had ceased to exist. Despite its commercial failure, the company‚Äôs final years were marked by notable competition successes, a Lambert 1100 being placed second in its class at the 1951 Bol d'Or race with further racing successes following in 1952 and 1953.

In 1978, the church's First Presidency declared in a statement known as \\"Official Declaration 2\\" that the restriction had been lifted. Before 1849, a few black men had been ordained to the priesthood under Joseph Smith. As part of this restriction, both black men and women of African descent at various times were prohibited from taking part in ceremonies in LDS temples, serving in certain leadership church callings, attending priesthood meetings, and speaking at firesides. Spouses of black people of African descent were also prohibited from entering the temple. Over time, the restriction was relaxed so that black people of non African descent could attend priesthood meetings and people with a \\"questionable lineage\\" were given the priesthood, such as Fijians, Indigenous Australians, Egyptians, as well as Brazilians and South Africans with an unknown heritage who did not appear to have any black heritage. During this time, the church taught that the restriction came from God and many leaders gave several race-based explanations for the ban, including a curse on Cain and his descendants, Ham's marriage to Egyptus, a curse on the descendants of Canaan, and that black people were less valiant in their pre-mortal life. They used LDS scriptures to justify their explanations, including the Book of Abraham which teaches that the descendants of Canaan were black and Pharaoh could not have the priesthood because he was a descendant of Canaan. In 1978, it was taught that the restriction was lifted as a result of a revelation. The 1978 declaration was incorporated into Latter-day Saint scripture. In December 2013, the LDS Church published an essay approved by the First Presidency which gave context to the restriction. In it, the church disavowed most race-based explanations for the past priesthood restriction and denounced racism.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Racial restrictions Under the racial restrictions that lasted from the presidency of Brigham Young until 1978, persons with any black African ancestry could not hold the priesthood in the LDS Church and could not participate in most temple ordinances, including the endowment and celestial marriage. Black people were permitted to be members of the church, and to participate in some temple ordinances, such as baptism for the dead.In her autobiography, Jane Elizabeth Manning James says she \\"had the privilege of going into the temple and being baptized for some of my dead.\\"http://www.blacklds.org/manning Life History of Jane Elizabeth Manning James as transcribed by Elizabeth J.D. Round The racial restrictions were applied to black Africans, persons of black African descent, and any one with mixed race that included any black African ancestry. The restrictions were not applied to Native Americans, Hispanics, Melanesians, or Polynesians. Priesthood Brigham Young taught that black men would not receive the priesthood until \\"all the other descendants of Adam have received the promises and enjoyed the blessings of the Priesthood and the keys thereof.\\" The priesthood restriction was particularly limiting, because the LDS Church has a lay priesthood and all worthy male members may receive the priesthood if they choose to do so. Young men are generally admitted to the Aaronic priesthood at age 12, and it is a significant rite of passage. Holders of the priesthood officiate at church meetings, perform blessings of healing, and manage church affairs. Excluding black people from the priesthood meant that they could not hold significant church leadership roles or participate in certain spiritual events such as blessing the sick or giving other blessings reserved for priesthood holders. Temple ordinances Between 1844 and 1977, most black people were not permitted to participate in ordinances performed in the LDS Church temples, such as the endowment ritual, celestial marriages, and family sealings. These ordinances are considered essential to enter the highest degree of heaven, so this meant that black church members could not enjoy the full privileges enjoyed by other Latter Day Saints during the restriction. Latter Day Saints believe that those marriages sealed in Mormon temples can become celestial marriages that bind the family together forever, whereas those marriages that are not sealed are terminated upon death. As church president, David O. McKay taught that black people \\"need not worry, as those who receive the testimony of the restored gospel may have their family ties protected and other blessings made secure, for in the justice of the Lord they will possess all the blessings to which they are entitled in the eternal plan of Salvation and Exaltation.\\".Complete text Brigham Young taught, \\"When the ordinances are carried out in the temples that will be erected, [children] will be sealed to their [parents], and those who have slept, clear up to Father Adam. This will have to be done ... until we shall form a perfect chain from Father Adam down to the closing up scene.\\"Chapter 41: Temple Ordinances, Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Brigham Young (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 1997) p. 299. An important exception to the temple ban for black members was that (except for the complete temple ban period from the mid-1960s until the early 70s under McKay) black members had been allowed a limited use recommend to act as proxies in baptisms for the dead. Additionally, black children who were legally adopted by white parents could be sealed to their parents. Church service Under the priesthood ban, black men and women could not hold any significant church callings, be leaders or serve missions. The LDS Church relies heavily on its unpaid members to fulfill leadership positions and serve in church callings. For men, the priesthood is required for many leadership and church callings and is given to virtually every Latter-day Saint male as early as age 11. For both men and women, a temple endowment is required or encouraged for other callings, such as missionary service. This limited the ability of black members to serve in various callings. When the priesthood was given to the blacks under Joseph Smith, they were also able to serve in a variety of callings. For example, Elijah Abel served a mission and was called to be a seventy. When Brigham Young instituted the priesthood restriction, black members were barred from many leadership and service positions, and, initially, from attending priesthood meetings. In 1952, McKay banned black people from speaking at priesthood meetings and firesides. Through the years, some exceptions were made to allow black members to serve without the priesthood. For example, Samuel Chamber was appointed to be an assistant deacon in 1873. He had the same duties as a deacon, but without being given the priesthood.William G. Hartley, \\"Samuel D. Chambers, The Improvement Era, Spring 1977; \\"Saint Without Priesthood: The Collected Testimonies of Ex-Slave Samuel D. Chambers,\\" Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 12: 2 (Summer 1979; Jessie L. Embry, Black Saints in a White Church: Contemporary African American Mormons (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1994.) In 1945, Abner and Martha Howell were called to serve a mission to establish segregated congregations in the southern states. Howell was given a letter signed by LeGrand Richards that allowed him to speak even though blacks were not permitted to attend services there. He was later given a card designating him as an \\"Honorary High Priest\\". By the 1960s, black men could serve in leadership roles in auxiliary organizations and attend priesthood meetings, including serving in the Sunday School or Young Men (organization)Young Men's presidency. In the 1960s, church president McKay began considering opening up a mission in Nigeria. After several difficulties with visas, LeMar Williams was in Nigeria preparing to open the mission. It was decided that only the auxiliaries would be set up in Nigeria, which could be operated without the priesthood. Nigerian men would be allowed to pass the sacrament, but white missionaries would need to bless it. However, the program was canceled after several members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles objected. In 1971, the Genesis Group was formed as an auxiliary to the church for black members. Black members were able to fill positions in the Relief Society, Young Men, and Young Women presidencies. Many Bankhead served as the first Relief Society president. Since the 1978 revelation on the priesthood, black people have been able to serve in church callings and fulfill leadership positions. However, service at general church levels has been limited. While there have been several black members of the Quorums of the Seventy and auxiliary general boards,Huffington Post article on September 2014 Women's MeetingFor example, Helv√©cio Martins, Joseph W. Sitati, and Edward Dube there has not been a member of the First Presidency, Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, or the general organizational presidencies (Relief Society, Young Women, Primary, Young Men, or Sunday School) that is black. Patriarchal blessings In the LDS Church, a patriarch gives patriarchal blessings to members to help them know their strengths and weaknesses and what to expect in their future life. The blessings also tell members which tribe of Israel they are descended from. Members who are not literally descended from the tribes are adopted into a tribe, usually Ephraim. In the early 19th and 20th centuries, members were more likely to believe they were literally descended from a certain tribe. In 1934, the Presiding Patriarch, James H. Wallis, stated that black people could not receive a patriarchal blessing because of the priesthood ban, but that they could receive a blessing without a lineage.\\" In Brazil, this was interpreted to mean that if a patriarch pronounced a lineage, then the member was not a descendant of Cain and was therefore eligible for the priesthood, despite physical or genealogical evidence of African ancestry. Actual patriarchs did not strictly adhere to Wallis's statement. After the 1978 revelation, patriarchs sometimes declared lineage in patriarchal blessings for black members, but sometimes they did not declare a lineage. Some black members have asked for and received new patriarchal blessings including a lineage. People who married black people The first time a church leader taught that a non-black person was cursed for having married a black person was on February 6, 1835. An assistant president of the church, W. W. Phelps, wrote a letter theorizing that Ham's wife was a descendant of Cain and that Ham himself was cursed for \\"marrying a black wife\\". Young expanded this idea, teaching that non-blacks who had children with a black person would themselves be cursed to the priesthood, and that the law of the Lord required the couple and their children to be killed. George Q. Cannon of the First Presidency reaffirmed this was the law of the Lord and explained it was to keep the descendants of Cain from getting the priesthood. Several white members were denied access to temple ceremonies after they had married a black person. One white woman was denied a temple sealing to her white husband because she had previously married a black man, even though she had divorced him. Cannon argued that allowing her access to the temple would not be fair to her two daughters, which she had with her black husband. Another white man was denied the priesthood because he had married a black woman. In 1966, a white woman who had received her endowments was banned by local leaders from going to the temple and was told her endowments were invalid because she had since married a black man. Church president McKay agreed with the ban on going to the temple, but said her endowments were still valid. After the 1978 revelation on the priesthood, husbands of black women could receive the priesthood and spouses of black people could perform temple rituals. Implementation Several black men received the priesthood after the racial restrictions were put in place, including Elijah Abel's son Enoch Abel, who was ordained an elder on November 10, 1900. Enoch's son and Elijah Abel's grandson‚Äîwho was also named Elijah Abel‚Äîreceived the Aaronic priesthood and was ordained to the office of priest on July 5, 1934. The younger Elijah Abel also received the Melchizedek priesthood and was ordained to the office of elder on September 29, 1935. One commentator has pointed out that these incidents illustrate the \\"ambiguities, contradictions, and paradoxes\\" of the issue during the twentieth century. As the church began expanding in areas of the world that were not so racially segregated, the church began having problems distinguishing who had black ancestry. In Brazil, which had a high proportion of people with mixed ancestry, LDS officials advised missionaries in the 1920s to avoid teaching people who appeared to have black ancestry, advising them to look for relatives of the investigators if they were not sure about their racial heritage. Despite the precautions, by the 1940s and 1950s some people with African ancestry had unwittingly been given the priesthood, which prompted an emphasis on missionaries scrutinizing people's appearances for hints of black ancestry and an order to avoid teaching those who did not meet the \\"one-drop rule\\" criteria. Additionally, starting in the 70s \\"lineage lessons\\" were added to determine that interested persons didn't have any Sub-Saharan African ancestry. An example of these missionary \\"lineage lessons\\" (in Portuguese) can be viewed at the Church History website here with a document translation found here and here Occasionally, members discovered they had African ancestry after being given the priesthood. In some cases, priesthood authority over-ruled genealogy research. For example, the First Presidency reinstated the president of the Ipiranga, Brazil branch, stating he was not of the lineage of Cain, despite genealogy research showing black ancestry. In other cases, members with black ancestry received patriarchal blessings giving lineage through one of the tribes of Israel, which allowed priesthood ordination. In South Africa, some mission presidents had not observed the ban, and ordained members with mixed blood. The First Presidency called Evan Wright and instructed him that no one could receive the priesthood unless they were able to trace their genealogy outside of Africa, even if they had no appearance of African descent. Wright called several missionaries full-time to assist in the genealogy work, but the lack of men who could fulfill the requirement proved difficult. In 1954, David O. McKay made a change to allowed men to be ordained who did not appear to have black heritage. During his time as church president in the 1950s, McKay made some decisions allowing peoples of \\"questionable lineage\\" to receive the priesthood when they previously would not have been allowed. This was one of the first decisions made to broaden access to the priesthood and relax certain aspects of the restrictions imposed because of the priesthood policies of the time. For example, Fijians were not given the priesthood until 1955 when McKay visited Fiji and told the president of the Samoa Mission that proselyting efforts with the Fijians could begin. Four years later, McKay informed his counselors that there was no evidence that the peoples of Fiji were of African descent. In 1964, the priesthood was extended to Indigenous Australians and in 1966 to Egyptians. Reasoning for the priesthood ban Church leadership officially cited various reasons for the doctrinal ban, but later leaders have since repudiated them.Mormon Black History Month - Beliefnet.com The curse of Cain and his descendants Some church members, including certain LDS leaders, used the curse of Cain to justify the racial restrictions. In the book of Genesis found in the Bible, God puts a mark on Cain after he kills his brother Abel. Brigham Young taught that Cain killed Abel to get advantage over him, so God cursed Cain's descendants to not receive the priesthood until all the rest of Adam's descendants received the priesthood. During Young's presidency this was the explanation and was consistently taught by all leaders. It was only after Brigham Young died that the Church began teaching that reason for the ban was unknown. Bruce R. McConkie, who was a seventy at the time and who later served as an apostle, wrote in his 1966 edition of Mormon Doctrine that those who were sent to Earth through the lineage of Cain were those who had been less valiant in the premortal life. He also said that because Ham married Egyptus and because she was a descendant of Cain, that he was able to preserve the \\"negro lineage.\\" The denial of the priesthood to certain men was then mentioned and he explained that in this life, black people would not hold the priesthood, but that those blessings would be available to them in the next life. Bruce R. McConkie said, \\"Of the two-thirds who followed Christ, however, some were more valiant than others ....Those who were less valiant in pre- existence and who thereby had certain spiritual restrictions imposed upon them during mortality are known to us as the negroes. Such spirits are sent to earth through the lineage of Cain, the mark put upon him for his rebellion against God and his murder of Abel being a black skin (Moses 5:16‚Äì41; 12:22). Noah's son Ham married Egyptus, a descendant of Cain, thus preserving the negro lineage through the flood (Abraham 1:20‚Äì27). Negroes in this life are denied the priesthood; under no circumstances can they hold this delegation of authority from the Almighty. (Abra. 1:20‚Äì27.) The gospel message of salvation is not carried affirmatively to them (Moses 7:8, 12, 22), although sometimes negroes search out the truth, join the Church, and become by righteous living heirs of the celestial kingdom of heaven. President Brigham Young and others have taught that in the future eternity worthy and qualified negroes will receive the priesthood and every gospel blessing available to any man. The present status of the negro rests purely and simply on the foundation of pre- existence. Along with all races and peoples he is receiving here what he merits as a result of the long pre-mortal probation in the presence of the Lord....The negroes are not equal with other races where the receipt of certain spiritual blessings are concerned, particularly the priesthood and the temple blessings that flow therefrom, but this inequality is not of man's origin. It is the Lord's doing.\\" In 1881, church president John Taylor expounded on the belief that the curse placed on Ham (who was of the lineage of Cain), was continued because Ham's wife was also of that \\"seed.\\"John Taylor said, \\"And after the flood we are told that the curse that had been pronounced upon Cain was continued through Ham's wife, as he had married a wife of that seed. And why did it pass through the flood? Because it was necessary that the devil should have a representation upon the earth as well as God; and that man should be a free agent to act for himself, and that all men might have the opportunity of receiving or rejecting the truth, and be governed by it or not according to their wishes and abide the result; and that those who would be able to maintain correct principles under all circumstances, might be able to associate with the Gods in the eternal worlds.\\" (Journal of Discourses, Vol. 22 page 304) In 1978, McConkie said the curse of Cain was no longer in effect. The curse of Cain is still taught in Old Testament student manual for LDS institute classes. Curse of Ham and Book of Abraham According to the Bible, Ham discovered his father Noah drunk and naked in his tent. Because of this, Noah cursed Ham's son, Canaan to be \\"servants of servants\\". Although the scriptures do not mention anything about skin color, many Americans during the 19th century believed that Ham had married a descendant of Cain, who was black, and that black people carried the curse of Ham. W. W. Phelps, a counselor in the presidency of the church, taught that Ham had married a black wife. The Book of Abraham, considered scripture in the LDS movement, denotes that an Egyptian king by the name of Pharaoh, was a descendant of Ham and the Canaanites, who were black, () that Noah had cursed his lineage so they did not have the right to the priesthood, and that all Egyptians descended from him. It was later considered scripture by the LDS Church. This passage is the only one found in any Mormon scripture that bars a particular lineage of people from holding the priesthood. While both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young referred to the curse of Ham as a justification for slavery, neither used the curse of Ham or the Book of Abraham to justify the priesthood ban. It wasn't until 1900 that George Q. Cannon, a member of the First Presidency, began using the story of Pharaoh as a scriptural basis for the ban. In 1912, the First Presidency responded to an inquiry about the priesthood ban by using the story of Pharaoh. By the early 1900s, it became the foundation of church reasoning for the priesthood ban. In a 1908 Liahona article for missionaries, an anonymous but church-sanctioned author reviewed the scriptures about blackness in the Pearl of Great Price. The author postulated that Ham married a descendant of Cain. Therefore Canaan received two curses, one from Noah, and one from being a descendant of Cain. The article states that Canaan was the \\"sole ancestor of the Negro race\\" and explicitly linked his curse to be \\"servant of servants\\" to black priesthood denial. To support this idea, the article also discussed how Pharaoh, a descendant of Canaan according to LDS scripture, could not have the priesthood, because Noah \\"cursed him as pertaining to the Priesthood\\". In 1978, when the church ended the ban on the priesthood, Bruce R. McConkie taught that the seed of Ham, Canaan, Egyptus and Pharaoh were no longer under the ancient curse. The 2002 Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual points to Abraham 1:21-27 as the reasoning behind the not giving black people the priesthood until 1978. Author David Persuitte has pointed out that it was commonplace in the 19th century for theologians, including Joseph Smith, to believe that the curse of Cain was exhibited by black skin, and that this genetic trait had descended through Noah's son Ham, who was understood to have married a black wife. Mormon historian Claudia Bushman also identifies doctrinal explanations for the exclusion of blacks, with one justification originating in papyrus rolls translated by Joseph Smith as the Book of Abraham, a passage of which links ancient Egyptian government to the cursed Ham through Pharaoh, Ham's grandson, who was \\"of that lineage by which he could not have the right of priesthood\\". Consequence of premortal existence Another reason for racial restriction advanced by church leadership was called \\"Mormon karma\\" by historian Colin Kidd, and refers to the idea that skin color is perceived as evidence of righteousness (or lack thereof) in the premortal existence. The doctrine of premortal existence is described in the Encyclopedia of Mormonism in this way: \\"to Latter-day Saints premortal life is characterized by individuality, agency, intelligence, and opportunity for eternal progression. It is a central doctrine of the theology of the Church and provides understanding to the age-old question 'Whence cometh man?'\\" This idea is based on the opinions of several prominent church leaders, including long-time apostle and later church president Joseph Fielding Smith, who held the view that the premortal life had been a kind of testing ground for the assignment of God's spiritual children to favored or disfavored mortal lineages. Bushman has also noted Smith's long-time teachings that in a premortal war in heaven, blacks were considered to have been those spirits who did not fight as valiantly against Satan and who, as a result, received a lesser earthly stature, with such restrictions as being disqualified from holding the priesthood. In the early 1930s, George F. Richards noted that there was no official position, but argued that God wouldn't have assigned some of his children to be black if they hadn't done something wrong in the pre-existence. According to religious historian Craig Prentiss, the appeal to premortal existence was confirmed as doctrine through statements of the LDS First Presidency in 1949 and 1969. Unknown reasons In 1969, the First Presidency said blacks did not have the priesthood \\"for reasons which we believe are known to God\\". When the ban was lifted in 1978, there was no official explanation for the racist language in Mormon scripture or whether the curse had been removed or had never existed. However, some church leaders made some statements. McConkie said that curse had been lifted and the previous statements made by himself and other church leaders on the subject were to be forgotten and that the focus of the gospel should be on current revelations. Church president Gordon B. Hinckley said the ban was not wrong, but there was a reason for it and that the revelation speaks for itself. Apostle Dallin H. Oaks said it wasn't the pattern of the Lord to give reasons. In 2003, black LDS Church member Darron Smith wrote in Sunstone that many members held onto previous explanations about the ban because church leadership had not addressed the ban's origins. Protection from Hell Brigham Young University Religious Studies professor, Randy L. Bott, suggested that God denied the priesthood to black men in order to protect them from the lowest rung of hell, since one of few damnable sins is to abuse the exercise of the priesthood. Bott compared the priesthood ban to a parent denying young children the keys to the family car, stating: \\"You couldn‚Äôt fall off the top of the ladder, because you weren‚Äôt on the top of the ladder. So, in reality the blacks not having the priesthood was the greatest blessing God could give them.\\" In 2012 the official LDS Newsroom responded to Randy Bott's controversial statements sharing \\"The positions attributed to BYU professor Randy Bott in a recent Washington Post article absolutely do not represent the teachings and doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\\" Human error Referring to the priesthood ban, apostle Spencer W. Kimball said in 1963, \\"The doctrine or policy has not varied in my memory. I know it could. I know the Lord could change his policy and release the ban and forgive the possible error which brought about the deprivation.\\" In 2013, the LDS Church put out an essay giving background on the racist environment in which the ban was formed and said the ban was based more on racism than revelation. Teachings about the priesthood ban Divinity of ban, Doctrine vs. Policy Church leaders taught for decades that the priesthood ordination and temple ordinance ban was commanded by God. Brigham Young taught it was a \\"true eternal principle the Lord Almighty has ordained.\\" In 1949, the First Presidency (under George Albert Smith) officially stated that it was \\"not a matter of the declaration of a policy but of direct commandment from the Lord\\". A second First Presidency statement (this time under McKay) in 1969 reemphasized that this \\"seeming discrimination by the Church towards the Negro is not something which originated with man; but goes back into the beginning with God\\". As president of the church, Kimball also emphasized in a 1973 press conference that the ban was \\"not my policy or the Church‚Äôs policy. It is the policy of the Lord who has established it.\\" On the topic of doctrine and policy for the race ban lifting the apostle Dallin H. Oaks stated in 1988, \\"I don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs possible to distinguish between policy and doctrine in a church that believes in continuing revelation and sustains its leader as a prophet. ... I‚Äôm not sure I could justify the difference in doctrine and policy in the fact that before 1978 a person could not hold the priesthood and after 1978 they could hold the priesthood.\\" When it was announced in the 1978 that the ban was reversed, Kimball wrote a letter saying that the Lord revealed \\"that the long-promised day has come\\". This was later canonized in LDS scripture as Official Declaration 2.Official Declaration 2, Doctrine and Covenants, a standard work of the LDS Church. McConkie said that the voice of God had said \\"that the time had now come\\", and that the entire First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve heard the same voice, and knew that the ancient curse had been lifted. In 1995, black church member A. David Jackson asked church leaders to issue a declaration repudiating that the ban was a direct commandment from the Lord. At first, the church refused. In 2012, the church changed the preface to Official Declaration 2 to include these sentences regarding the priesthood ban: \\"Church records offer no clear insights into the origins of this practice. Church leaders believed that a revelation from God was needed to alter this practice\\". However, it did not specifically say what parts of the ban came from God and which did not. In 2013, the church published an essay which said that the ban had its roots more in racism than revelation. A 2016 landmark survey of 1,156 self-identified Latter-day Saints found that almost two-thirds of surveyed members reported believing the pre-1978 temple and priesthood ban was \\"God's will\\". Duration of ban Brigham Young taught that black men would not receive the priesthood until \\"all the other descendants of Adam have received the promises and enjoyed the blessings of the priesthood and the keys thereof.\\" But that meant that those who had been denied the priesthood would one day receive the priesthood and its related blessings. At another time, he stated \\"that the time [would] come when they [would] have the privilege of all we have the privilege of and more.\\" In 1963, while discussing when the ban would be lifted, Joseph Fielding Smith told a reporter that \\"such a change can come about only through divine revelation, and no one can predict when a divine revelation will occur.\\"LOOK, Oct. 22, 1963, p. 79 Mormon apologetics author and lecturer John Lewis Lund wrote in 1967, \\"Brigham Young revealed that the negro will not receive the priesthood until a great while after the second advent of Jesus Christ, whose coming will usher in a millennium of peace.\\" When the restrictions were reversed in 1978, church president Kimball referred to it as \\"the long-promised day\\". Critics say that lifting the restriction before the resurrection is contrary to Young's 1854 and 1859 statements,Tanner, Jerald and Sandra Curse of Cain while church apologists say that Brigham Young's statements meant that Africans could receive the priesthood after all other races were eligible to receive it, not all other individuals. Start of the ban Under John Taylor's presidency (1880‚Äì87), there was confusion in the church regarding the origin of the racial restrictions. Zebedee Coltrin and Abraham O. Smoot provided conflicting testimony of whether or not Joseph Smith stated that Elijah Abel was allowed to hold the priesthood, though the veracity of their testimony is doubted. From this point on, many statements on the priesthood restriction were attributed to Joseph Smith; all such statements had actually been made by Brigham Young. The church taught that the ban originated with Joseph Smith, with the First Presidency declaring it so in 1947. In 2013, the church issued a statement saying the ban seemed to have started with Brigham Young instead of Joseph Smith. History Before 1847 During the time Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint Movement (1830-1844), was the leader, there were no official racial policies established by what is now known as the LDS Church. Black people were welcomed as members of the church and as evidence of the lack of official policy, in 1836, two black men were ordained priests: Elijah Abel and Walker Lewis. Before 1847 a handful of other black men were ordained to the priesthood. That same year, Abel went on to become a member of the Quorum of the Seventy and received a patriarchal blessing. Although there was no official policy, there is evidence that some black men were denied the priesthood during the Missouri period in order to appease slave owners in the area. Some researchers have suggested that the actions of Joseph T. Ball and William McCary led to Young's decision to adopt the priesthood ban in the LDS Church. Joseph T. Ball A native of Massachusetts, Joseph T. Ball was good friends with William Smith (Joseph Smith's younger brother). Because of his close connection to Smith, he began to engage in polygamy without the approval of the Brigham Young. Although he continued to be involved in the practice of polygamy, he served as the branch president in Boston for a time, making him the first black person to preside over an LDS congregation. In August 1845, Ball was separated from the church because Young found out about his previous involvement with polygamy. William McCary Because of events that transpired in both Cincinnati, Ohio and Winter Quarters, Nebraska, McCary lost the favor of Young. McCary was a half-African American convert who, after his baptism and ordination to the priesthood, began to claim to be a prophet and the possessor of other supernatural gifts.Larry G. Murphy, J. Gordon Melton, and Gary L. Ward (1993). Encyclopedia of African American Religions (New York: Garland Publishing) pp. 471‚Äì472. At one point, he also claimed to be Adam of the Bible. He was excommunicated for apostasy in March 1847 and expelled from Winter Quarters.Newell G. Bringhurst (1981). Saints, Slaves, and Blacks: The Changing Place of Black People within Mormonism (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press). After his excommunication, McCary began attracting Latter Day Saint followers and instituted plural marriage among his group, and he had himself sealed to several white wives. McCary's behavior angered many of the Latter Day Saints in Winter Quarters. Researchers have stated that his marriages to his white wives most likely had some influence on Young's decision to institute the priesthood and temple bans on black people.Connell O'Donovan, \\"The Mormon Priesthood Ban & Elder Q. Walker Lewis: 'An example for his more whiter brethren to follow' , John Whitmer Historical Association Journal, 2006. A statement from Young to McCary in March 1847 suggested that race had nothing to do with priesthood eligibility, but the earliest known statement about the priesthood restriction from any Mormon leader (including the implication that skin color might be relevant) was made by apostle Parley P. Pratt, a month after McCary was expelled from Winter Quarters. Speaking of McCary, Pratt stated that because he was a descendant of Ham, he was cursed with regards to the priesthood. 1847‚Äì1880 In 1847, Brigham Young became the second president of the LDS Church. Like many during that time, Young promoted the discrimination of black people. On February 13, 1849, an early statement by Young about the history of the priesthood ban in the LDS Church was made. The statement was given in response to Lorenzo Snow's inquiry about how redemption would come about with regards to black people. Young responded by mentioning the Curse of Cain and said that a similar hierarchy of power that was put in place on Earth because of the curse would remain in the afterlife.Young said that \\"the curse remained upon them because Cain cut off the lives of Abel, to prevent him and his posterity getting ascendancy over Cain and his generations, and to get the lead himself, his own offering not being accepted of God, while Abel's was. But the Lord had cursed Cain's seed with blackness and prohibited them the priesthood that Abel and his progeny might yet come forward and have their dominion, place, and blessings in their proper relationship with Cain and his race in the world to come.\\" Journal History, Vol. 26, 13 February 1849 Young would make many similar remarks during the rest of his presidency.\\"Any man having one drop of the seed of [Cain] ... in him cannot hold the priesthood and if no other prophet ever spoke it before I will say it now in the name of Jesus Christ I know it is true and others know it.\\"Bush & Mauss 1984: 70\\"You see some classes of the human family that are black, uncouth, uncomely, disagreeable and low in their habits, wild, and seemingly deprived of nearly all the blessings of the intelligence that is generally bestowed upon mankind. ... Cain slew his brother. Cain might have been killed, and that would have put a termination to that line of human beings. This was not to be, and the Lord put a mark upon him, which is the flat nose and black skin. Trace mankind down to after the flood, and then another curse is pronounced upon the same race‚Äîthat they should be the 'servant of servants'; and they will be, until that curse is removed; and the Abolitionists cannot help it, nor in the least alter that decree.\\" Journal of Discourses, 7:290. 1880‚Äì1950 Elijah Abel: black man who was given the priesthood during the times of Joseph Smith Under John Taylor's presidency (1880‚Äì87), there was confusion in the church regarding the origin of the racial restrictions. Elijah Abel, an African American, was ordained to the priesthood in the days of Joseph Smith. Apostle Joseph F. Smith argued that Abel's priesthood had been declared null and void by Joseph Smith, though this seems to conflict with Joseph F. Smith's teachings that the priesthood could not be removed from any man without removing that man from the church.Bush & Mauss 1984: 76‚Äì86 Zebedee Coltrin and Abraham O. Smoot provided conflicting testimony of whether or not Joseph Smith stated that Abel was allowed hold the priesthood, though the veracity of their testimony is doubted. From this point on, many statements on the priesthood restriction were attributed to Joseph Smith; all such statements had actually been made by Brigham Young. In 1947 the First Presidency, consisting of George Albert Smith, J. Reuben Clark, and David O. McKay, in a private communication with Dr. Lowry Nelson,First Presidency Letter of the First Presidency August 17, 1949 where Dr. Nelson questioned whether \\"there is no irrevocable church doctrine on this subject [of blacks and the priesthood]\\" the First Presidency stated: Later, reflecting on this exchange with the First Presidency, Dr. Nelson would say, \\"I believe I was the first Mormon to protest the church policy with regard to blacks in a letter to the First Presidency of the church in 1947\\" and in 1953 published the article \\"Mormons and the Negro\\", saying that \\"This was the first [time] the non-Mormon world knew of this policy, and it was widely publicized through the Negro press.\\" In 1949, the First Presidency under the direction of George Albert Smith made a declaration which included the statement that the priesthood restriction was divinely commanded and not a matter of church policy.The \\"Negro Question Declaration: \\"The attitude of the Church with reference to the Negroes remains as it has always stood. It is not a matter of the declaration of a policy but of direct commandment from the Lord, on which is founded the doctrine of the Church from the days of its organization, to the effect that Negroes may become members of the Church but that they are not entitled to the priesthood at the present time. The prophets of the Lord have made several statements as to the operation of the principle. President Brigham Young said: \\"Why are so many of the inhabitants of the earth cursed with a skin of blackness? It comes in consequence of their fathers rejecting the power of the holy priesthood, and the law of God. They will go down to death. And when all the rest of the children have received their blessings in the holy priesthood, then that curse will be removed from the seed of Cain, and they will then come up and possess the priesthood, and receive all the blessings which we now are entitled to.\\" The declaration goes on to state that the conditions in which people are born on Earth are affected by their conduct in the premortal existence, although the details of the principle are said not to be known. It then says that the privilege of mortal existence is so great that spirits were willing to come to earth even though they would not be able to possess the priesthood. The mentioning of the curse of Cain began during this time period and took the place of previous justifications for the priesthood ban. The older arguments included the idea that black people were not as valiant in the pre-mortal life and that they had \\"inherent inferiority.\\" 1951‚Äì1977 In 1954, church president David O. McKay taught: \\"There is not now, and there never has been a doctrine in this church that the negroes are under a divine curse. There is no doctrine in the church of any kind pertaining to the negro. We believe that we have a scriptural precedent for withholding the priesthood from the negro. It is a practice, not a doctrine, and the practice someday will be changed. And that's all there is to it.\\"Sterling M. McMurrin affidavit, March 6, 1979. See David O. McKay and the Rise of Modern Mormonism by Greg Prince and William Robert Wright. Quoted by Genesis Group In 1969, church apostle Harold B. Lee and member of the First Presidency Alvin R. Dyer blocked the LDS Church from rescinding the racial restrictions.Quinn, Michael D. The Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power Salt Lake City: 1994 Signature Books Page 14 The idea that a unanimous decision through revelation was needed to change the policy was and is a widespread belief among LDS church leaders. Although many desired a change in the racial policy, they continued waiting for revelation concerning the matter. David O. McKay told several people about his struggles with the restrictions, including Mildred Calderwood McKay, Marion D. Hanks, Lola Gygi Timmins, and Richard Jackson. Jackson quotes McKay as saying: \\"I'm badgered constantly about giving the priesthood to the Negro. I've inquired of the Lord repeatedly. The last time I did it was late last night. I was told, with no discussion, not to bring the subject up with the Lord again; that the time will come, but it will not be my time, and to leave the subject alone.\\" On December 15, 1969, members of the First Presidency, Hugh B. Brown and N. Eldon Tanner (President McKay was 96 years old and incapacitated at that time, passing away the next month), released a First Presidency Statement, \\"Letter of First Presidency Clarifies Church's Position on the Negro\\" stating In her book, Contemporary Mormonism, Claudia Bushman describes the pain that was caused by the racial restrictions of the church. This struggle was felt both to black worshipers, who sometimes found themselves segregated and ostracized, and white members who were embarrassed by the exclusionary practices and who occasionally apostatized over the issue. In 1971, three African-American Mormon men petitioned then‚Äìchurch president Joseph Fielding Smith to consider ways to keep black families involved in the church and also re-activate the descendants of black pioneers. As a result, Smith directed three apostles to meet with the men on a weekly basis until, on October 19, 1971, an organization called the Genesis Group was established as an auxiliary unit of LDS Church to meet the needs of black Mormons. The first president of the Genesis Group was Ruffin Bridgeforth, who also became the first black Latter Day Saint to be ordained a high priest after the priesthood ban was lifted later in the decade. Harold B. Lee, president of the church, stated in 1972: \\"For those who don't believe in modern revelation there is no adequate explanation. Those who do understand revelation stand by and wait until the Lord speaks .... It's only a matter of time before the black achieves full status in the Church. We must believe in the justice of God. The black will achieve full status, we're just waiting for that time.\\"Kimball, Lengthen Your Stride, working draft chapter 20, page 22; citing Goates, Harold B. Lee, 506, quoting UPI interview published November 16, 1972. Although not refuting his belief that the restrictions came from the Lord, apostle Spencer W. Kimball acknowledged in 1963 that it could have been brought about through an error on man's part. In 1963, he said, \\"The doctrine or policy has not varied in my memory. I know it could. I know the Lord could change his policy and release the ban and forgive the possible error which brought about the deprivation.\\" Racial restrictions end in 1978 LDS temple in S√£o Paulo, Brazil In the 1970s, LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball took General Conference on the road, holding area and regional conferences all over the world. He also announced many new temples to be built both in the United States and abroad, including one temple in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. The problem of determining priesthood eligibility in Brazil was thought to be nearly impossible due to the mixing of the races in that country. When the temple was announced, church leaders realized the difficulty of restricting persons with African descent from attending the temple in Brazil.Mark L. Grover, \\"The Mormon Priesthood Revelation and the S√£o Paulo Brazil Temple\\", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 23:39‚Äì53 (Spring 1990). On June 8, 1978, the First Presidency released to the press an official declaration, now a part of Doctrine and Covenants, which contained the following statement: > He has heard our prayers, and by revelation has confirmed that the long- > promised day has come when every faithful, worthy man in the church may > receive the Holy Priesthood, with power to exercise its divine authority, > and enjoy with his loved ones every blessing that follows there from, > including the blessings of the temple. Accordingly, all worthy male members > of the church may be ordained to the priesthood without regard for race or > color. Priesthood leaders are instructed to follow the policy of carefully > interviewing all candidates for ordination to either the Aaronic or the > Melchizedek Priesthood to insure that they meet the established standards > for worthiness.Official Declaration 2. According to first-person accounts, after much discussion among the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on this matter, they engaged the Lord in prayer. According to the writing of Bruce R. McConkie, \\"It was during this prayer that the revelation came. The Spirit of the Lord rested upon us all; we felt something akin to what happened on the day of Pentecost and at the Kirtland Temple. From the midst of eternity, the voice of God, conveyed by the power of the Spirit, spoke to his prophet. The message was that the time had now come to offer the fullness of the everlasting gospel, including celestial marriage, and the priesthood, and the blessings of the temple, to all men, without reference to race or color, solely on the basis of personal worthiness. And we all heard the same voice, received the same message, and became personal witnesses that the word received was the mind and will and voice of the Lord.\\"Priesthood, pp. 127‚Äì128, Deseret Book Co., 1981. Immediately after the receipt of this new revelation, an official announcement of the revelation was prepared, and sent out to all of the various leaders of the Church. It was then read to, approved by, and accepted as the word and will of the Lord, by a General Conference of the Church in October 1978. Succeeding editions of the Doctrine and Covenants were printed with this announcement canonized and entitled \\"Official Declaration 2\\". Joseph Freeman, Jr.: first black man to receive priesthood after the ban was lifted in 1978 Apostle Gordon B. Hinckley (a participant in the meetings to reverse the ban), in a churchwide fireside said, \\"Not one of us who was present on that occasion was ever quite the same after that. Nor has the Church been quite the same. All of us knew that the time had come for a change and that the decision had come from the heavens. The answer was clear. There was perfect unity among us in our experience and in our understanding.\\"Gordon B. Hinckley, \\"Priesthood Restoration\\", Ensign, October 1988. On June 11, 1978, three days after the announcement of the revelation, Joseph Freeman, a member of the church since 1973, became the first black man to be ordained to the office of elder in the Melchizedek priesthood since the ban was lifted, while several others were ordained into the Aaronic priesthood that same day. Later in 1978, McConkie called to repentance all those who questioned the revelations received by the prophet with regards to the priesthood ban. He went on to clarify that previous statements made by himself and other church leaders on the subject were to be forgotten and that the focus of the gospel should be on current revelations.Bruce R. McConkie said, \\"There are statements in our literature by the early brethren which we have interpreted to mean that the Negroes would not receive the priesthood in mortality. I have said the same things, and people write me letters and say, \\"You said such and such, and how is it now that we do such and such?\\" And all I can say to that is that it is time disbelieving people repented and got in line and believed in a living, modern prophet. Forget everything that I have said, or what President Brigham Young or President George Q. Cannon or whomsoever has said in days past that is contrary to the present revelation. We spoke with a limited understanding and without the light and knowledge that now has come into the world.... We get our truth and our light line upon line and precept upon precept. We have now had added a new flood of intelligence and light on this particular subject, and it erases all the darkness and all the views and all the thoughts of the past. They don't matter any more .... It doesn't make a particle of difference what anybody ever said about the Negro matter before the first day of June of this year.\\" Bruce R. McConkie, 1978. All Are Alike Unto God, A SYMPOSIUM ON THE BOOK OF MORMON, The Second Annual Church Educational System Religious Educator's Symposium, August 17‚Äì19, 1978. Critics of the LDS Church state that the church's 1978 reversal of the racial restrictions was not divinely inspired as the church claimed, but simply a matter of political convenience, as the reversal of restrictions occurred as the church began to expand outside the United States into countries such as Brazil. These countries have ethnically mixed populations, and the reversal was announced just a few months before the church opened its new temple in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. 1978 to 2013 Since the Revelation on the Priesthood in 1978, the church has made no distinctions in policy for black people, but it remains an issue for many black members of the church. Alvin Jackson, a black bishop in the LDS Church, puts his focus on \\"moving forward rather than looking back.\\"Page Johnson Alvin B. Jackson, Jr‚ÄîThe Bishop is Always In Meridian Magazine In an interview with Mormon Century, Jason Smith expresses his viewpoint that the membership of the church was not ready for black people to have the priesthood in the early years of the church, because of prejudice and slavery. He draws analogies to the Bible where only the Israelites have the gospel.Ken Kuykendall, Past racial issues and the Church today Mormon Century In a 1997 TV interview, President Gordon B. Hinckley was asked whether the church was wrong to deny the priesthood. He responded, \\"No, I don't think it was wrong. It, things, various things happened in different periods. There's a reason for them.\\" In April 2006 in a general conference talk President Gordon B. Hinckley, the president of the LDS Church, had called racism \\"ugly\\" and a sin that any guilty of needed to repent from.Nicole Warburton, \\"President Hinckley calls racism ugly and unacceptable'\\", Deseret news, April 2, 2006 In 1995, black church member A. David Jackson asked church leaders to issue a declaration repudiating past doctrines that denied various privileges to black people. In particular, Jackson asked the church to disavow the 1949 \\"Negro Question\\" declaration from the church Presidency which stated that \\"the attitude of the church with reference to negroes ... is not a matter of the declaration of a policy but of direct commandment from the Lord ... to the effect that negroes ... are not entitled to the priesthood.\\" The church leadership did not issue a repudiation, and so in 1997 Jackson, aided by other church members including Armand Mauss, sent a second request to church leaders, which stated that white Mormons felt that the 1978 revelation resolved everything, but that black Mormons react differently when they learn the details. He said that many black Mormons become discouraged and leave the church or become inactive. \\"When they find out about this, they exit... You end up with the passive African Americans in the church.\\" Other black church members think giving an apology would be a \\"detriment\\" to church work and a catalyst to further racial misunderstanding. African-American church member Bryan E. Powell says, \\"There is no pleasure in old news, and this news is old.\\" Gladys Newkirk agrees, stating, \\"I've never experienced any problems in this church. I don't need an apology. . . . We're the result of an apology.\\" The large majority of black Mormons say they are willing to look beyond the previous teachings and remain with the church in part because of its powerful, detailed teachings on life after death. Church president Hinckley told the Los Angeles Times: \\"The 1978 declaration speaks for itself ... I don't see anything further that we need to do.\\" Apostle Dallin H. Oaks said: > It's not the pattern of the Lord to give reasons. We can put reasons to > commandments. When we do we're on our own. Some people put reasons to [the > ban] and they turned out to be spectacularly wrong. There is a lesson in > that .... The lesson I've drawn from that, I decided a long time ago that I > had faith in the command and I had no faith in the reasons that had been > suggested for it ....

Oaks, Interview with Associated Press, in > Daily Herald, Provo, Utah, June 5, 1988. 2013 to present On December 6, 2013 the LDS Church published an essay entitled Race and the Priesthood on its official website. The essay stated that \\"there is no evidence that any black men were denied the priesthood during Joseph Smith's lifetime,\\" but that the priesthood restrictions were first publicly introduced by Brigham Young, noting the racism of the era that influenced his thinking. The essay went on to declare that \\"Today the Church disavows the theories advanced in the past that black skin is a sign of divine disfavor or curse, or that it reflects actions in a premortal life that mixed- race marriages are a sin; or that blacks or people of any other race or ethnicity are inferior in any way to anyone else. Church leaders today unequivocally condemn all racism, past and present, in any form.\\" While the essay was approved by the First Presidency,Tad Walch, \\"LDS blacks, scholars cheer church's essay on priesthood\\", Deseret News, June 8, 2014 it was not written by them. As of 2015, it has never been mentioned, alluded to, or footnoted in speeches by LDS authorities at the faith's semiannual General Conferences. Many members remain unaware of the essays and some hold to racist beliefs that had been taught in the past. According to Richard Bushman, a Mormon historian, the essay removes the revelatory significance of the ban. He states that it requires a reorientation of Mormon thinking, since \\"it brings into question all of the prophet's inspiration.\\" Critics of the church argue that it could call into question other revelations of the prophets. Although the priesthood restrictions existed historically, the LDS Church reports continued significant growth in church membership in Africa, with growth from 318,947 members in 2010 to 578,310 in 2018. As of 2019, there are two church general authorities of African descent, and another general authority of Melanesian (Fijian) descent.[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/leaders?lang=eng|}} See also *1978 Revelation on Priesthood *Black people and early Mormonism *Black people and Mormonism *Interracial marriage and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints *Criticism of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints *Genesis Group *Joseph Freeman (Mormon) *Mormonism and Pacific Islanders References Footnotes Primary sources    .

As a young man he teamed up with Sydney Downey to create Ker and Downey Safaris Ltd., one of the first guide companies to transition from hunting to photographic safaris. He is also known for leading two long expeditions with Edgar Monsanto Queeny for the American Museum of Natural History which resulted in the production of several nature documentaries and in Ker's own dedication to conservation. Early years When Ker was six years old his family moved to a coffee plantation in Kenya. He took to hunting early in his life and killed his first lion when still in his teens. Not much later he accompanied Denys Finch Hatton on a safari for the Prince of Wales. He soon joined the safari company Shaw and Hunter Ltd. It was while he worked for Shaw and Hunter that he first encountered Sydney Downey in the Masai Mara. In the beginning the two hunters developed a feud stemming from an incident when both were in the Mara at the same time, and felt the other's hunting party was encroaching on theirs. As time passed the hunted together many times. Throughout the 1930s, the two hunters, Ker and Downey, opened up much of the Masai Mara to hunting. Their first paying safari as Ker and Downey Ltd. was outfitting The Macomber Affair, an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber. Ker and Downey Ltd. When WWII broke out in 1939 Ker enlisted with British army where he became a scout and partook in campaigns against the Italians in the Ethiopian theatre. After the city of Addis Ababa was reclaimed by the British, he met Downey at a bar, and made plans to form their own safari company after the war. Shortly after, they announced their decision during an \\"impromptu meeting of the East African Professional Hunters\\" Association. Ker and Downey was eventually created after the war in 1946, making it now the world's longest running safari company. Offshoots of the original company were set up in Tanzania, Botswana and the United States. The original main partners were Jack Block, Sydney Downey (Syd) and Donald Ker. Jack Block who owned the Norfolk and Stanley Hotel, Nairobi was the business brain who saw it as his role to keep Downey and Ker out on safari for as many days as possible. The Botswana operation was set up by new partner Harry Selby (hunter), who joined after the huge success of Robert Ruark's Horn of the Hunter which was based on a safari they took together. Often credited for leading the move from hunting to photographic safaris out, Ker and Downey is famous for having outfitted many movies - from Out of Africa to Gorillas in the Mist and The Constant Gardener. Ker and Downey's first safari, the Macomber Affair had many scenes at Nairobi's oldest hotel, the Stanley Hotel, Nairobi where Ker and Downey had its first offices and was based for many years. Both quiet men, Ker and Downey were nonetheless attractive to both royalty and celebrity. Charles, Prince of Wales and Anne, Princess Royal first saw the Maasai Mara on Ker and Downey safaris, as did Paul Simon, Carrie Fisher and millionaire Constantine Niarchos. Films the company has worked on include Mogambo, with Clark Gable, Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly; King Solomon's Mines with Stewart Granger; The Snows of Kilimanjaro with Gregory Peck, Susan Heyward and Ava Gardner, Hatari! starring John Wayne, Out of Africa with Robert Redford and Meryl Streep. Cry Freedom, Gorillas in the Mist and The Constant Gardener were also outfitted by the Nairobi-based firm. One of Ker's most notable clients was the businessman and naturalist Edgar Monsanto Queeny for whom he led two expeditions also associated with the American Museum of Natural History. Queeny's intent was to audio record and film African wildlife and native culture, and produced several documentaries from the footage he took while with Ker, including Indicator Indicator and the Pagan Sudan. Ker and Queeny also worked hard to record the various sounds that lions make by playing back to the lions other lion and hyena sounds to illicit novel responses. In doing this Ker realised that the practice of playing recorded animal sounds to lions and other game \\"could be misused in hunting,\\" and upon his return to Nairobi managed to get the Game department to amend the hunting laws banning such practices. This event exemplifies Ker's own growing conservationist tendencies. At that point, he and Downey were already leaning towards photographic safaris. Neither had enjoyed killing animals all that much to begin with, preferring instead the thrill of the chase. Like other Kenyan safari companies, Ker and Downey is closely involved with conservation, donating time and funds to organisations like Olgulului Olorashi in Amboseli and Koiyaki Group Ranch in the Masai Mara.

It connects Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Kirchenlaibach and Bayreuth. History  Irrenlohe station, left the tracks from Weiden in 2009 The Bavarian Eastern Railway Company (Bavarian Ostbahn) gained the concession to build the line was on 3 January 1862. Construction began later that year and was completed on 1 December 1863. From Schwandorf station to Irrenlohe station its single track ran parallel with the also single-track Regensburg‚ÄìSchwandorf‚ÄìAmberg‚ÄìNuremberg line of the Eastern Railway. It ended in its own station in Bayreuth south of the former Brandenburger Thor (Brandenburg Gate, the location of the station of the state railway, the current Bayreuth Hauptbahnhof), which had a roundhouse, a goods shed, a carriage shed and a residential block for railway officials. To reduce costs, however, passenger traffic was handled from the beginning at the platform of the Bayreuth‚ÄìNeuenmarkt-Wirsberg railway. With the commissioning of the Eastern Railway line, the former Bayreuth terminus became a through station on the Hof‚ÄìBayreuth‚ÄìWeiden‚ÄìRegensburg‚ÄìMunich route, which at first required changes in Bayreuth and Irrenlohe. As a result, the line from Bayreuth to Munich was 40 Bavarian miles long, 12.5 miles shorter than via Augsburg (a Bavarian mile equalled 7,420.4 or 7,414.9 metres). Train crossings were scheduled at Parkstein-H√ºtten, Kemnath-Neustadt, Kirchenlaibach and Seybothenreuth. Initially, three pairs of passenger trains operated between Bayreuth and Irrenlohe. In international traffic, a passenger train (Courierzug‚Äîcourier train‚Äîwith exclusively first class carriages) running without changing carriages between Cologne and Vienna was added in the 1860s. On 1 January 1876, the Bavarian Eastern Railway Company was nationalised and the line was taken over by the Royal Bavarian State Railways (K√∂niglich Bayerische Staats-Eisenbahnen). The two Bayreuth stations were merged at the same time, requiring a change to the track layout. The Schwandorf‚ÄìWeiden section is now considered to be part of the Regensburg‚ÄìWeiden railway. Route  Kirchenlaibach station with class 610 set, 2003 Class VT 98 railbus in front of the former Ostbahn carriage shed in Bayreuth, 1986 The line branches from the Regensburg‚ÄìWeiden railway at Weiden station and proceeds along the B 470 highway through the Weiden suburbs of Rehb√ºhl and Weiden-West and past the Seltmann porcelain factory. Near the Brandweiher estate the route swings to the southwest and then runs northwest through the Manteler forest and from Schwarzenbach along the Haidenaab to Pressath. In Pressath a branch line to Kirchenthumbach branched off until 1962 and there is still a siding to the Grafenw√∂hr training camp. Next, the line runs along the Haidenaab, passing to the east side of Rauher Kulm and meets the Nuremberg‚ÄìCheb railway at Kirchenlaibach station. After Kirchenlaibach station the line runs to the northwest along the B 22 through the Seybothenreuth forest and between the Pensenberg and Schlehenberg mountains to Bayreuth. The line passes through the Bayreuth districts of Grunau, Colmdorf and Neue Heimat and then reaches the line from Schnabelwaid. The two lines run parallel across the valley of the Red Main river on a nearly 1.5 km long embankment; the line from Weiden runs on the eastern track. Coming from the south the two lines cross the B 22 (Wieland-Wagner-Strasse), then the Bayreuth mill canal and finally, just before the entrance to Bayreuth station, it crosses the B 2 (Albrecht-D√ºrer- Stra√üe) and immediately afterwards the Red Main.

Black people have been members of Mormon congregations since its foundation, although the church placed restrictions on proselytization efforts among black people. Before 1978, black membership was small. It has since grown, and in 1997, there were approximately 500,000 black members of the church (about 5% of the total membership), mostly in Africa, Brazil and the Caribbean. quoting Deseret News 1999-2000 Church Almanac. Deseret News: Salt Lake City, UT (1998); pg. 119. Black membership has continued to grow substantially, especially in West Africa, where two temples have been built.The Church Continues to Grow in Africa By 2018, an estimated 6% of members were black. In the United States, 3% of members are black. Black Mormons in early Mormonism The initial mission of the church was to proselytize to everyone, regardless of race or servitude status.D&C; When the church moved its headquarters to the slave state of Missouri, they began changing its policies. In 1833, the church stopped admitting free people of color into the Church for unknown reasons. In 1835, the official church policy stated that slaves would not be taught the gospel without their master's consent, and the following year was expanded to not preach to slaves at all until after their owners were converted. Some blacks joined the church before the restrictions, such as Joseph T. Ball, Peter Kerr, and Walker Lewis, and others converted with their masters, including Elijah Abel and William McCary. Jane Manning James had been born free and worked as a housekeeper in Joseph Smith's home.Jerel Harris and Brian Passey, The History of Black Pioneers: Slaves, Free Blacks Among the First Utah Settlers When she requested the temple ordinances, John Taylor took her petition to the Quorum of the Twelve, but her request was denied. When Wilford Woodruff became president of the church, he compromised and allowed Manning to be sealed to the family of Smith as a servant. This was unsatisfying to Manning as it did not include the saving ordinance of the endowment, and she repeated her petitions. She died in 1908. Church president Joseph F. Smith honored her by speaking at her funeral.Embry 1994: 40-41. Other notable early black LDS Church members included Green Flake, the slave of John Flake, a convert to the church and from whom he got his name. He was baptized as a member of the LDS Church at age 16 in the Mississippi River, but remained a slave. Following the death of John Flake, in 1850 his widow gave Green Flake to the church as tithing. Some members of the black side of the Flake family say that Brigham Young emancipated their ancestor in 1854, however at least one descendant states that Green was never freed. Samuel D. Chambers was another early African American pioneer. He was baptized secretly at the age of thirteen when he was still a slave in Mississippi. He was unable to join the main body of the church and lost track of them until after the Civil War. He was thirty-eight when he had saved enough money to emigrate to Utah with his wife and son. Black Mormons in the United States Before 1978, relatively few black people who joined the church retained active membership. Those who did, often faced discrimination. LDS Church apostle Mark E. Petersen describes a black family that tried to join the LDS Church: \\"[some white church members] went to the Branch President, and said that either the [black] family must leave, or they would all leave. The Branch President ruled that [the black family] could not come to church meetings.\\"Race Problems;‚Äî As They Affect The Church, Convention of Teachers of Religion on the College Level, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, August 27, 1954 Discrimination also stemmed from church leadership. Under Heber J. Grant, the First Presidency sent a letter to stake president Ezra Taft Benson in Washington D.C. advising that if two black Mormon women were \\"discreetly approached\\" they would be happy sit in the back or side so as not to upset some white women who had complained about sitting near them in Relief Society. On October 19, 1971, the Genesis Group was established as an auxiliary unit to the church. Its purpose was to serve the needs of black members, including activating members and welcoming converts. It continues to meet on the first Sunday of each month in Utah. Don Harwell is the current president.Genesis Group When asked about racism in the church, he said \\"Now, is the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints racist? No, never has been. But some of those people within the church have those tendencies. You have to separate the two.\\"Rosemary Winters, \\"Black Mormons Struggle for Acceptance in the Church\\", Salt Lake Tribune, November 4, 2004 From 1985 to 2005, the church was well received among middle-class African- Americans, and African American membership grew from minuscule before 1978 to an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 in 2005. A 2007 study by the Pew Research Center found that 3% of American Mormons were black. African Americans accounted for 9% of all converts in the United States. A 1998 survey by a Mormon and amateur sociologist, James W. Lucas, found that about 20 percent of Mormons in New York City were black. Melvyn Hammarberg explained the growth: \\"There is a kind of changing face of the LDS Church because of its continuing commitment to work in the inner cities.\\" Sociology and Religious Studies Professor Armand Mauss says African Americans are particularly attracted by the focus on promoting healthy families. However, these numbers still only represent a fraction of total church membership in the United States, suggesting that African Americans remain comparatively hesitant to join, partly because of the church's past. Still, Don Harwell, president of the Genesis Group, sees it as a sign that \\"People are getting past the stereotypes put on the church.\\" LDS historian Wayne J. Embry interviewed several black LDS Church members in 1987 and reported that \\"all of the interviewees reported incidents of aloofness on the part of white members, a reluctance or a refusal to shake hands with them or sit by them, and racist comments made to them.\\" Embry further reported that one black church member \\"was amazingly persistent in attending Mormon services for three years when, by her report, no one would speak to her.\\" Embry reports that \\"she [the same black church member] had to write directly to the president of the LDS Church to find out how to be baptized\\" because none of her fellow church members would tell her. In the United States, researchers Newell G. Bringhurst and Darron T. Smith, in their 2004 book Black and Mormon, wrote that since the 1980s \\"the number of African American Latter-day Saints does not appear to have grown significantly. Worse still, among those blacks who have joined, the average attrition rate appears to be extremely high.\\" They cite a survey showing that the attrition rate among African American Mormons in two towns is estimated to be between 60 and 90 percent. In 2007, journalist and church member, Peggy Fletcher Stack, wrote, \\"Today, many black Mormons report subtle differences in the way they are treated, as if they are not full members but a separate group. A few even have been called 'the n-word' at church and in the hallowed halls of the temple. They look in vain at photos of Mormon general authorities, hoping to see their own faces reflected there.\\"Peggy Fletcher Stack, \\"New film and revived group help many feel at home in their church\\", Salt Lake Tribune, July 6, 2007. Wynetta Willis Martin In 1970, Wynetta Willis Martin gained the distinction of being the first African-American member of the faculty at Brigham Young University (BYU) and one of the first two black members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. She accepted it as her personal mission to prove to the world that there were in fact African-American Mormons and that the Mormons were not racist. She toured with the choir for two years before accepting her appointment on the faculty at BYU. She was employed in the training of nurses and tried to help them become more culturally aware.Martin, 1972.\\" About the racial restriction policy, she said: \\"These two things: baptism and the Holy Ghost are the only requirements, contrary to popular belief, for entering the Celestial Kingdom and being with God for eternity if one is worthy. Therefore, the Priesthood covenants of the Temple which we are not allowed at this point are not really so crucial as popular belief dictates.\\"Martin 1972: 56, emphasis her own. Joseph Freeman, Jr. Joseph Freeman, Jr. was the first African American to receive the Melchizedek priesthood after the 1978 revelation.Salt Lake Tribune, 1978-06-24. Freeman was also the first black member ever to receive church temple ordinances.\\"Mormonism Enters a New Era\\", Time, 1978-08-07. On June 23, 1978, Freeman was sealed to his wife and five children in the Salt Lake Temple by then-apostle Thomas S. Monson. Black Mormons in South Africa The church began proselyting to white English- speaking people in 1853, but very few black South Africans joined the LDS Church before 1978. Dunn, who was the son of a Scottish father and a Zulu mother, is believed to be the first black African convert baptized in Africa in 1905, though he did not remain an active member for long. Another early convert of African descent was William Paul Daniels, who joined the LDS Church in 1915 while visiting relatives in Utah. He met on multiple occasions with Joseph F. Smith before returning to South Africa.LDS Church Almanac, 2010 Edition, p. 576 In 1930, the Church established a genealogy program to help male members trace their genealogy to a European country to determine their eligibility for the priesthood, with final approval for receiving the priesthood given by the mission president. Evan P. Wright served as mission president over the South Africa Mission 1948‚Äì1953. Wright repeatedly expressed to the First Presidency the difficulty in establishing the church in the region caused by the church-wide ban on ordaining men of black African descent to the priesthood. This was especially problematic because previous general authorities required even men who appeared white to prove a total lack of black African ancestry before they could be ordained and records were often unavailable or incomplete. Two missionaries had been given the duty to work on genealogy research for the purposes of establishing which people were eligible for the priesthood. David O. McKay was the first general authority to visit South Africa in 1954,H. Dean Garrett, \\"South Africa\\", in Arnold K. Garr, Donald Q. Cannon and Richard O. Cowan, ed., Encyclopedia of Latter Day Saint History, (Salt Lake City:Deseret Book, 2000), p. 1160-1161 and during his visit to the mission, he changed the policy to allow mission presidents to approve men to be ordained without any genealogical research in cases where \\"there is no evidence of his having Negro blood in his veins.\\" While other congregations would allow black and white members to worship together, the South African government requested that LDS black and white congregations meet separately. Apartheid laws restricted black people's attendance in white churches only if church authorities thought they would make a disturbance. Since blacks did not meet with white members and could not run their own meetings without the priesthood, black membership remained low. There were some black South Africans, like Moses Mahlangu, who were closely affiliated with the Church but not baptized. Mahlangu held regular worship meetings teaching from the Book of Mormon and spent large amounts of time teaching of the Book of Mormon to people in the African townships starting in the late 1960s. He was also in regular contact with the mission presidents. After the 1978 Revelation on Priesthood, Mahlangu, his family, and many other people still waited to be baptized, likely because of lingering feelings of racism among some members of the church. Finally, they were baptized September 6, 1980.Turley, Richard E., Jr. and Jeffrey G. Cannon, \\"A Faithful Band: Moses Mahlangu and the First Soweto Saints,\\" BYU Studies Quarterly 55, no. 1 (2016): 31‚Äì36 After the 1978 revelation, the South African government revoked its limits on visiting LDS missionaries, and the LDS church started actively proselyting to blacks. In the early 1990s, the majority of Latter-day Saints in South Africa were English-speaking white people, mainly of British origin. At some point between 2000 and 2005 the LDS Church reached a point where half the members in South Africa were black, and the percentage of blacks in the membership has continued to rise since then. Two black South Africans have been called as mission presidents. One, Jackson Mkhabela, was called to serve as mission president in Zimbabwe. He had previously been an area seventy and his wife Dorah had been a member of the Young Women General Board. Mkhabela had become the first black man to serve as a stake president in South Africa in 2005. The other, Thabo Lebethoa, was called to preside over the South Africa Cape Town Mission. He was serving as stake president of the Soweto Stake at the time of his call. Black Mormons in Brazil Church leaders were initially hesitant to expand the church in Brazil because of the high percentage of people with mixed ancestry. Missionaries arrived in 1928 but were instructed to only work with German people living in the southern part of the country, since they were less likely to be black. When the Brazilian government outlawed the use of non-Portuguese languages in public meetings in 1938, the mission switched from a German language mission to a Portuguese speaking one. In the 1940s, mission president Rulon S. Howells began requiring potential converts to provide their genealogy, with the goal of establishing \\"racial purity\\" among converts. Howells and travelling general authorities instructed missionaries to avoid teaching black people. Missionaries were only supposed to approach people who did not look black. During the visits, they were supposed to discuss family history and look for evidence of black ancestry. Finally, they presented a lineage lesson were they taught about the Curse of Cain and specifically asked if they had black ancestry. If at any time during the lessons, it was discovered they had black ancestry, they were discouraged from investigating the church. Occasionally, members who did not appear black were baptized, but were later discovered to have black heritage. In these cases, their records were marked and they were denied the priesthood. Because of these strict rules and regulations, very few people with black ancestry joined the church. While missionaries were given significant teaching and instruction on the priesthood ban, church leadership purposely avoided talking to Brazilians about the priesthood ban, which left many Brazilians confused about the ban. Brazilian members often did not share American views on race, and did not want to implement the priesthood ban on blacks. This created significant friction between the Brazilian membership and the American leadership. This was partially alleviated in 1967 when the church allowed members who did not appear to be black to have the priesthood even if they could not trace their genealogy out of Brazil. In 1978 the priesthood was extended to all male members, and the lineage lesson was dropped. Helv√©cio Martins Helv√©cio Martins was the first person of African descent to be a general authority (a leadership position) of the church. Martins was born in Brazil to parents descended from African slaves. He had found success in his professional life but felt unfulfilled with the religious life he was pursuing. The missionaries visited his home in 1972 while he was going through a difficult spiritual crisis. The missionaries visited his home late one night and were worried about how to teach an African since the church had not yet reversed its policy. Indeed, Martins' first question upon inviting the missionaries into his home concerned the church's attitude toward race. The spiritual experiences that the Martins family had while investigating the church superseded their concerns for the racial policy of priesthood restriction, and they were baptized. They experienced much resistance from members of their extended family and former church friends, but eventually found peace with them. Martins served in his ward as a Sunday school teacher. He was not troubled by the priesthood restriction, but others were. Often, members of the ward would ask him how he could remain a member of the church without the priesthood. It was never an issue for him. He had resolved the issue in his own mind and never expected to receive the priesthood. When the announcement came, he describes his reaction and that of his wife as unbelieving. It was something for which they had not dared to hope. Martins then served as a member of a stake presidency, as a bishop, a mission president, and finally as a seventy. His son was one of the first three people of black African descent to serve a full-time mission for the church in nearly 100 years.Martins & Grover, 1994. Black Mormons in West Africa The church began receiving letters from West Africa requesting information about the church in the 1940s. As the church began sending back literature, two LDS bookstores were formed. Because the Africans could not receive the priesthood, leaders hesitated sending missionaries.LeBaron, E. Dale, Church Pioneers in Africa LDS Living November 2001 In 1960, David O. McKay sent Glen G. Fisher on a fact-finding mission to Africa, where he found thousands of people waiting for him.LaMar Williams, interview by E. Dale LeBaron in Salt Lake City, February 12, 1988. McKay decided to send missionaries, but the Nigerian government delayed issuing the necessary visas. After the Nigerian government agreed to issue the visas, several members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles expressed their opposition to teaching black people and voted to cancel the program. Five months after the 1978 revelation, the first missionaries arrived in Nigeria. Anthony Obinna was one of the first to be baptized.Larry Morris Obinna Brothers to the First Presidency LDS Living April 2007 Within one year there were more than 1,700 members in 35 branches in West Africa.Mabey and Allred, Brother to Brother, p. vii Growth in black membership Plan of salvation in Swahili. Dieter F. Uchtdorf visiting the Accra, Ghana LDS mission in 2007 The church had an increase in membership upon repealing the ban by experiencing rapid growth in predominately black communities while other mainstream sects have been losing members. After 1978 LDS Church growth in Brazil was \\"especially strong\\" among Afro-Brazilians, especially in cities such as Fortaleza and Recife along the northeast coast of the country.Mapping Mormonism: An Atlas of Latter-day Saint History (Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 2014) 2nd Edition, p. 223 By the 2010s, LDS Church growth was over 10% annually in Ghana, Ivory Coast, and some other countries in Africa. This was accompanied by some of the highest retention rates of converts anywhere in the church. At the same time, from 2009 to 2014, half of LDS converts in Europe were immigrants from Africa.Tad Walch, \\"Major LDS Growth in Africa unaffected by priesthood restriction, Elder Sitati says\\", Deseret News, October 9, 2015. In the Ivory Coast LDS growth has gone from one family in 1984 to 40,000 people as of early 2017. This growth lead to well over 30 congregations just in Abidjan by the early 2010s. The revelation also helped pave the way for the church's exponential growth in areas like Africa and the Caribbean. The church has been more successful among blacks outside the United States than inside, partly because there is less awareness of this past historic discrimination. In 2005, the church had some 120,000 members in West Africa,Pres. Hinckley dedicates the Aba Nigeria Temple and the Aba Nigeria and Accra Ghana temples. Regarding the LDS Church in Africa, professor Philip Jenkins noted in 2009 that LDS growth has been slower than that of other churches. He cited a variety of factors, including the fact that some European churches benefited from a long-standing colonial presence in Africa; the hesitance of the LDS church to expand missionary efforts into black Africa during the priesthood ban, resulting in \\"missions with white faces\\"; the observation that the other churches largely made their original converts from native non-Christian populations, whereas Mormons often draw their converts from existing Christian communities. The church also has had special difficulties accommodating African cultural practices and worship styles, particularly polygamy, which has been renounced categorically by the LDS Church, but is still widely practiced in Africa. Commenting that other denominations have largely abandoned trying to regulate the conduct of worship services in black African churches, Jenkins wrote that the LDS Church \\"is one of the very last churches of Western origin that still enforces Euro-American norms so strictly and that refuses to make any accommodation to local customs.\\" Black people in church leadership No member of the two highest governing bodies, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, has ever been black. There have been several black members of the Quorums of the Seventy;For example, Elder Christopher Chukwurah , Elder Kapumba Kola and more . and, as of 2013, Brazilian Helv√©cio Martins (a member of the Second Quorum of the Seventy from 1990 to 1995), Joseph W. Sitati (from Kenya) and Edward Dube (from Zimbabwe), both members of the First Quorum of the Seventy, have served as general authorities. Other black members have served as area seventies, particularly in the Third Quorum of the Seventy, which includes the church's Africa Southeast, Africa West, Europe, and Europe East areas. There has never been a black member of the general presidencies of the Relief Society, Young Women, Primary, Young Men, or Sunday School. The first African member of the Relief Society general board was chosen in 2003, and she shared her testimony at the general meeting of the Relief Society in September 2003. In February 2014, Dorah Mkhabela, a black South African, was made a member of the Young Women General Board. She became the first black woman to give a prayer at the Women's Meetings of General Conference in September 2014.Huffington Post article on September 2014 Women's Meeting Mauss commented \\"As far as leadership is concerned, the role of the various minorities in Mormonism as a whole is not yet very great, but it is growing, and it is crucial in parts of the world outside the U.S.\\" Approximately 5% of church members have African ancestry (mostly in congregations in Africa, South America, and the Caribbean).

The CD was accompanied by a series of fifteen screenprints by Daniel Vincent and Guillaume D√©g√©, printed in a limited, numbered edition. On 17 November 2006, Didier Maes, producer of the label, was a guest in the France Musique programme \\"Par ici les sorties!\\" (Releases over here!), to present a selection of four Hortus disks. In the spring of 2010, backed by the Conseil G√©n√©ral du Loiret, √âditions Hortus joined the \\"Amis de l'Orgue de Lorris\\" to record 17th-century Iberian and Flemish music, interpreted by organist Damien Colcomb in the communal 12th-century church.

Etymology  Originally a Norse greeting, ‚Äúheil og s√¶l‚Äù had the form ‚Äúheill ok s√¶ll‚Äù when addressed to a man and ‚Äúheil ok s√¶l‚Äù when addressed to a woman. Other versions were ‚Äúver heill ok s√¶ll‚Äù (lit. be healthy and happy) and simply ‚Äúheill‚Äù (lit. healthy).Heggstad 2012:254. The Norwegian adjective heil (also hel) is related to the English adjective whole/hale. The Norwegian verb heile (also hele) is related to the English verb heal through their common origin, the Germanic word stem *haila-, from which also the German verb heilen and the adjective ‚Äûheile‚Äú, i.e. functioning / not defect descends. The Norwegian adjective s√¶l, meaning happy or glad, is in Old English documented only in the negated variant uns«£le, meaning evil.Bjorvand & Lindemand 2001:900.  20th- century use  According to Store norske leksikon, the originally Norse greeting ‚Äúheill ok s√¶ll‚Äù was--adjusted to modern orthography and pronunciation --adopted as ‚Äúheil og s√¶l‚Äù by the political party Nasjonal Samling.Store norske leksikon: heil According to Bokm√•lsordboka, the adoption was inspired by Germany's ‚ÄúHeil Hitler‚Äù and similar.Bokm√•lsordboka: heil During the 1940‚Äì1945 German occupation of Norway, Nasjonal Samling, being the governing and only legal political party, sought to introduce all parts of society to a greeting combining ‚Äúheil og s√¶l‚Äù and a raised right hand. Whilst the attempt was not successful, the said greeting remained compulsory for party members and police. It has subsequently remained closely associated with nationalism.

Well known members included Philip Percival, Harry Selby, Sydney Downey and Donald Ker. Their motto was nec timor nec temeritas, or \\"neither fear nor foolhardiness\\". The Association formed out of a desire to regulate hunting in the wake of technological developments like the safari vehicle, which had made accessing remote hunting areas much easier. During its existence it was able to accomplish much to conserve East African wildlife and become perhaps one of the most respected societies in the world of its kind. The Association was disbanded in 1977 when Kenya outlawed all big game hunting. History Early years EAPHA was founded on April 12, 1934 by a group of white hunters who had gathered at the Norfolk Hotel in Nairobi Kenya. The founders were worried about the effects of technological developments on the wildlife populations of Kenya and sought to regulate the hunting industry there. For instance, the advances in automobile technology had enabled created access to remote wildlife areas. Within the first few years of its existence, the Association managed to get East Africa the most stringent game laws in the world. These laws included protecting the females of each species and banning night hunting and the use of dogs. The sale of game meat was also prohibited, as was the shooting of animals within proximity of watering holes or of safari vehicles. In its early years, it also continued to press authorities to create conservation areas for East African wildlife. 1970s By the 1970s, individual countries had started forming their own hunters' associations, but none rivaled EAPHA in the extremity of its conservationism. EAPHA's members had become quite powerful in local affairs and began pushing even harder at that time to create conservation areas. Two of its members, Sydney Downey and Donald Ker, began to lobby for the establishment of a game reserve that would include the entire Masai Mara triangle, a proposal that Kenya's chief game warden supported. The two also lobbied for a similar reserve across the border in the Serengeti of Tanganyika. Yet despite its work in conservationism, the association was disbanded on the September 26, 1977 when Kenya officially outlawed all hunting within its borders.

The painting and its companion piece, A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts, originally decorated the walls of Villa Lemmi, a country villa near Florence owned by Giovanni Tornabuoni, uncle of Lorenzo de' Medici and head of the Roman branch of the Medici Bank. They were probably commissioned for the wedding in 1486 of Giovanni's son Lorenzo to Giovanna of the Albizzi family, and are therefore thought to depict the two. Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman shows a young woman, probably Giovanna Tornabuoni, being received by Venus and the three Graces. Giovanna holds open a white cloth, into which Venus is laying roses symbolizing beauty and love.

It generally takes place in the United States one year, and an international location the next. President Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter helped Habitat volunteers renovate the 19-unit building, and media coverage brought attention to Habitat, which had been founded in 1976 in Americus, Georgia, a short distance from Carter's hometown of Plains, Georgia. Even though President Carter has said repeatedly he never intended to start an annual project, the following year the Carters returned to the same site to finish the renovation work. On Oct. 10, 2013, as part of the 30th annual project, the Carters returned to the building and met with families living there. By 2019, the Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project had helped 4,390 families move into safe, affordable shelter in 14 countries. Over the years, more than 104,000 volunteers from all over the world have signed up to build alongside the Carters. The Carter Work Projects started modestly and built slowly. Early projects were held in the United States, and were relatively small compared to later years. 1986 Chicago, Illinois: Following the first two trips to New York City, the Carters moved on to Chicago, where they helped build a four-unit complex on the city's West Side. They were joined by their daughter, Amy, and celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary ‚Äî July 7, 1986 ‚Äî on the build site. In years to come, Carter children and grandchildren would frequently volunteer. 1987 Charlotte, North Carolina: Habitat founder Millard Fuller called Charlotte \\"The Miracle on 19th Street,\\" and comedian Bob Hope was among the volunteers who came to build 14 houses in Charlotte's Optimist Park area. This marked the first year the project was held in tandem with a worldwide Habitat House-Raising Week, in which an additional 300 homes were begun. 1988 Atlanta, Georgia, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: The 1988 build was the first held in two separate locations ‚Äî a 200-volunteer, 10-unit renovation project in North Philadelphia, and a 1,000- volunteer, 20-house project in Atlanta's Edgewood neighborhood. 1989 Milwaukee, Wisconsin: Plagued with steady, chilly rain, the Milwaukee build was in danger of falling behind schedule. During a live TV interview, President Carter asked for help from local roofers, who started showing up in droves the following morning. They roofed all the houses in one day, and the Milwaukee affiliate received a huge boost in donations and attention that carried it forward. More than 1,000 volunteers finished six homes, and renovated eight others. The broader House-Raising Week in 1989 involved the startup, completion, or rehab of 500 homes. 1990 Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, California: By venturing across the border, the Carter Work Project became international for the first time. Nearly 2,000 volunteers lived in a four-acre tent city and divided their time between Tijuana and San Diego; the construction site in Tijuana lacked electricity and running water. President Carter called the build \\"the most complicated and the most gratifying\\" so far. The project raised 100 homes in Tijuana and seven in San Diego. 1991 Miami, Florida: Miami's Liberty City erupted in violent riots in 1980 that decimated the neighborhood, and President Carter toured the devastation while in office. More than a decade later he came back to personally rebuild, working on 14 houses and a day care center. \\"I really enjoyed how all the volunteers, both white and black, came together and helped build for the project,\\" said homeowner Virginia Marshal, who was still living in her Habitat home more than 20 years later. 1992 Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland: \\"Habitat is not a charity organization. We don't believe that the best way to help people is to give them a Santa Claus gift,\\" President Carter said at the groundbreaking ceremony in Washington, D.C. After five days of blitz building, with an international pool of volunteers hammering away, 20 new homeowners in Baltimore and Washington were ready to move in. 1993 Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Canadians from more than 50 communities poured into Winnipeg and Waterloo to build 28 new homes in the first completely international Carter Work Project. 1994 Eagle Butte, South Dakota: President Carter specifically asked to build on a Native American reservation, so the 11th Carter Work Project headed to rural South Dakota. Volunteers slept in tents pitched on the local high school's football field, while the Carters stayed nearby in a traditional teepee provided by the Sioux Indians. Emmanuel Joseph Red Bear II said it was \\"a dream come true\\" to build his own home alongside the Carters. Despite heavy storms, the volunteers built 30 new homes on the reservation. 1995 Watts, Los Angeles, California: Although the Carters concentrated as always on building one home ‚Äî for Max and Toni Nettles ‚Äî they hammered ceremonial nails into all 21 houses along East Santa Ana Boulevard in Watts. More than 1,500 volunteers from 39 states and five countries worked at the project, which was accompanied by an accelerated build at five other southern California affiliates. 1996 Vac, Hungary: As President, Carter had returned Hungary's national crown jewels, which had been taken by the Nazis and later confiscated by U.S. forces to keep them out of Soviet hands. When the project looked toward expanding into Europe, he suggested Hungary. The picturesque small town of Vac (pronounced \\"Votz\\"), in a bend of the Danube River a little north of Budapest, was the \\"most beautiful\\" project site, he would later say. An international team of 500 volunteers built 10 houses. 1997 Eastern Kentucky and Tennessee: The Appalachian project \\"Hammering in the Hills\\" had beautiful backdrops, but the poverty there ran deep. Households in the eight communities served had an average income of less than $13,000 a year, and more than 16 percent lacked indoor plumbing. Among the volunteers participating during the week: First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. The JCWP and affiliated construction around the region built more than 200 new homes, some in partnership with the Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises. 1998 Houston, Texas: The heat soared well into triple digits ‚Äî a thermometer read 110 degrees on the house where Rosalynn Carter was working in Houston. But the building went on. \\"I think just the fact that people have a home does something for their self-esteem,\\" she said at the site. President Carter added, \\"They often get new ambition. They have seen success, and they have seen a promise kept at least one time in their lives.\\" About 6,000 volunteers built 100 homes. That included 25 local prison inmates, six of whom were hired by the local Habitat affiliate after the completion of their sentences. 1999 The Philippines: The theme in Tagalog was \\"Magbayanihan Tayo ‚Äî \\"Let us build together\\" ‚Äî for the largest and most complicated Carter Work Project ever, with 293 houses at six sites and 14,000 volunteers. Filipino media covered the project relentlessly; more than 150 journalists jockeyed behind a fence to get shots of the Carters as they built simple homes made of concrete blocks with galvanized metal roofs and louvered glass windows. 2000 New York, New York; Jacksonville, Florida; and Sumter County, Georgia: \\"I didn't think we'd come a second year. I never had any concept it would expand,\\" President Carter told volunteers when the project returned to New York. The Carters and volunteers built 157 houses, including Habitat's 100,000th house in Harlem, and then its 100,001st house in Plains, Georgia, their hometown. Among the celebrities lending a hand: actress Susan Sarandon, who said, \\"It's a gift to participate in something like this.\\" 2001 South Korea. President Carter first visited South Korea in 1950 as a young submarine officer, and later returned as president and humanitarian. The project's main location, Asan, was dubbed Reconciliation Village, and Carter, in his remarks to volunteers, spoke to that theme: \\"One word I've heard in South Korea more than any other word is 'reconciliation.' I look on Habitat for Humanity as a movement for reconciliation, a breaking down of barriers‚Ä¶ between the rich and the poor.\\" Nine thousand volunteers ‚Äî including South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung ‚Äî built 136 houses. 2002 Durban, Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa: Less than a decade after the end of legalized racism in South Africa, blacks and whites built side by side in a neighborhood that had been gutted by the government during apartheid. At the opening ceremony, President Carter said he, too, had grown up in a segregated society, and felt a connection to South Africa. \\"Our family has always been close to this great country,\\" he said. \\"We'll be working hand in hand together.\\" Volunteers at the first African project included the presidents of Kenya, Mozambique and Malawi, and Gracia Machel, wife of former South African president Nelson Mandela. 2003 LaGrange and Valdosta, Georgia; and Anniston, Alabama: Heavy rains created ankle-deep mud and alternated with a brutal summer sun as the Carters worked at three build sites, all of them less than 200 miles from their home in Plains, Georgia. Volunteers built 92 houses in 2003. 2004 Puebla and Veracruz, Mexico: About 4,000 volunteers built 150 homes in the two Mexican cities. 2005 Benton Harbor and Detroit, Michigan; and Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Volunteers built 280 homes on this dual-country build, which was documented by the DIY Network in the series \\"Habitat Homes: Jimmy Carter Work Project\\". When volunteers showed up Monday morning at the Benton Harbor build site, they found a Labrador mix puppy with no owner. The whole crew adopted her and named her Rosy, for Rosalynn Carter; a volunteer eventually gave her a permanent home. 2006 Lonavala, Maharashtra, India: In a village not far from where Lillian Carter had once volunteered for the Peace Corps, her son welcomed 2,000 volunteers to build. Among them: actor Brad Pitt, actor John Abraham, cricket star Steve Waugh, and former Miss World Diana Hayden. \\"I think it's been fun for everyone to have such high-profile people on site,\\" said HFHI CEO Jonathan Reckford. \\"But their participation helps draw more attention to what Habitat is doing, not only in India, but all across the world.\\" 2007 Los Angeles and San Pedro, California: Although known for new home construction, the Carter Work Project, like Habitat, has embraced new ways of helping people and of mobilizing against poverty housing. In 2007, volunteers repaired 35 Los Angeles homes as part of Habitat's A Brush With Kindness program, in addition to building 30 townhomes and condos. 2008 U.S. Gulf Coast: During the 25th annual build, nearly 20 Habitat affiliates along the Gulf Coast built new housing in areas that had been hit by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 2,000 volunteers helped build houses with 250 families. The project was officially renamed the Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project. \\"That's how it always should have been,\\" said President Carter. \\"She's been my life partner, she's been on every one of these builds right along with me.\\" 2009 Mekong River Region(China, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam): The Mekong River begins in China and flows south through Laos, Thailand and Cambodia before finding the sea in Vietnam; in 2009 the Carter Work Project built 166 homes throughout all five countries simultaneously. Temperatures in Vietnam climbed into the 90s and many volunteers suffered from the heat, while the weather in Sichuan, China, was so cold that volunteers clustered around portable heaters to get warm. 2010 Washington, D.C.; Baltimore, Maryland; Twin Cities, Minnesota; and Birmingham, Alabama: In honor of President Carter's 86th birthday, volunteers built and rehabbed 86 homes in four locations in 2010. Among the volunteers was President Carter's former vice president, Walter Mondale, who joined him in Minnesota. The President also joined the Blind Boys of Alabama onstage at the opening ceremony on World Habitat Day to sing \\"If I Had a Hammer.\\" 2011 L√©og√¢ne, Haiti: Following the devastating 2010 earthquake, the Carters committed to two consecutive projects in Haiti, a country that even before the earthquake was the poorest in the Western hemisphere. Families had been living in flimsy shelters in a sugar cane field in stifling heat, and were excited as their simple, sturdy new homes went up. Volunteers stayed at a camp called Christianville and were joined by country stars Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood, who not only swung hammers but also entertained the volunteers. At a Veterans Day ceremony on the site, President Carter, a U.S. Navy veteran, held his hard hat over his heart during the playing of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner.\\" 2012 L√©og√¢ne, Haiti: The Carters and even more volunteers returned to Christianville and L√©og√¢ne to build houses alongside workers from Haven, an Irish nonprofit. On Sunday morning, President Carter held Sunday school in the mess tent for the volunteers, just as he has for years in Plains. At the worksite, many volunteers from 2011 had tearful reunions with Haitian homeowners they had worked with. Habitat and Haven together built 155 new homes in Haiti during the 2012 project. 2013 Oakland and San Jose, California; Denver, Colorado; New York, New York; and Union Beach, New Jersey: For their 30th project, the Carters worked coast to coast, winding up where it all started, at the Mascot Flats apartment building on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. In Oakland on Oct. 7, 2013, 300 volunteers sang \\"Happy Birthday\\" to President Carter, who had turned 89 on Oct. 1. 2014 The 31st annual work project will be held in the Dallas/Fort Worth area of Texas, beginning October 5. 2015 The 32nd annual work project was scheduled to be held in Pokhara, Nepal, November 1‚Äì6, 2015. It was cancelled on October 8, 2015 because of fuel shortages and civil unrest after the announcement of a new constitution. 2016 Habitat for Humanity's 33rd Carter Work Project was in Memphis, Tennessee, Aug. 21-26, 2016. 2017 Habitat for Humanity's 34th Carter Work Project was in Edmonton, Alberta and Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, July 9‚Äì14, 2017. 2018 Habitat for Humanity's 35th Carter Work Project was in St. Joseph County, Indiana, August 26-31st. 2019 Habitat for Humanity's 36th Carter Work Project was held in Nashville, Tennessee, Oct. 6-11. 2019 President Carter announced on Oct. 11, 2019 that the 37th Carter Work Project would be held in the Dominican Republic in November 2020.

This led to the closure of the News of the World on 10 July 2011, an apology by Rupert Murdoch in an advertisement in most British national newspapers, and the withdrawing of News Corporation's bid to take over the majority of BSkyB shares it did not own. Investigations continued into what the company and individuals at the company knew of the phone hacking and when, as well as into other issues, including questions around police bribery. Since police renewed investigations in 2011, 90 people have been arrested and 16 charged with crimes in conjunction with illegal acquisition of confidential information, many if not most of them employees or agents of News Corp. United Kingdom Phone hacking Police corruption In a September 2010 interview broadcast on 7 July 2011, on the BBC Radio 4 news programme The World at One, former News of the World features editor Paul McMullan made an admission relating to police corruption. He told of having used material obtained by a colleague's bribery of a police officer as the basis of a series of articles published over several years on Jennifer Elliott, the daughter of the actor Denholm Elliott. He stated, 'The going rate for that kind of thing might have been two to five hundred pounds and that would have been authorised, and he [i.e. the police officer] would have been paid... and he would have been on the lookout for another story...' The articles described Ms Elliott's destitute situation and stated that she had worked as a prostitute. Jennifer Elliott killed herself in 2003. In Mr McMullan's opinion the News of the World ‚Äì specifically, his own articles ‚Äì contributed significantly to her suicide. In 2011, the paper knowingly used private investigators to gain stories from corrupt police officers.Murder trial collapse exposes News of the World links to police corruption, The Guardian, 11 March 2011 Operation Elveden In July 2011, the Metropolitan Police launched Operation Elveden, a probe examining illicit payments to police officers. On 11 February 2012, the BBC reported that a number of people, including five Sun employees, were arrested by police regarding allegations of corrupt payments to police and public officials. On 20 November 2012, it was reported that several individuals were to be charged with conspiring to commit misconduct in public office‚Äîformer CEO Rebekah Brooks, Andy Coulson, Clive Goodman, and Bettina Jordan-Barber. United States News Corporation owns a multitude of news outlets in the United States, including the New York Post, The Wall Street Journal, and the Fox News Channel. Several media critics have called for investigations into whether they too engaged in phone hacking activities. In addition to any possible illegal activities in the U.S., News Corporation and/or its executives might also face civil and criminal liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. On 24 February 2011, The New York Times reported that court documents in another, unconnected case revealed that the senior executive at News Corporation that Judith Regan referred to in her 2007 wrongful termination case against HarperCollins was Roger Ailes, the chairman of Fox News. Regan claimed that Ailes had previously encouraged her to lie to federal investigators who were vetting Bernard B. Kerik, who had been nominated for Secretary of Homeland Security by President George W. Bush. Ailes allegedly gave the orders to protect his close friend, Rudy Giuliani, who was running for president at the time. HarperCollins settled their case for $10.75 million.Russ Buettner, Fox News Chief, Roger Ailes, Urged Employee to Lie, Records Show, The New York Times, 24 February 2011 According to a former New York City police officer who spoke to The Mirror in 2009, the News of the World also attempted to retrieve private phone records of victims of the 11 September attacks. In light of the suspected hacking, Senate Commerce Committee chairman Jay Rockefeller suggested that a U.S. investigation of News Corporation should be launched. On 14 July, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced it was launching an investigation into alleged hacking by News Corporation. New investigations might also consider issues which had been raised in the past. In 2008, Dan Cooper, one of the co-founders of Fox News, alleged that network president Roger Ailes had threatened to ruin his long-time agent's business if Cooper wasn't dropped as a client. This followed an interview Cooper had given to David Brock for New York magazine shortly after his Fox contract ended in June 1997.

Ailes knew I had given Brock the interview. Certainly Brock didn't tell him. Of course. Fox News had gotten Brock's telephone records from the phone company, and my phone number was on the list. Deep in the bowels of 1211 Avenue of the Americas, News Corporation's New York headquarters, was what Roger called the Brain Room. Most people thought it was simply the research department of Fox News. But unlike virtually everybody else, because I had to design and build the Brain Room, I knew it also housed a counterintelligence and black ops office.

The shareholders' attorney said that the phone hacking which took place in the UK was \\"part of a much broader, historic pattern of corruption at News Corp., under the acquiescence of a board that was fully aware of the wrongdoing, if not directly complicit in the actions.\\" News Corp has yet to issue a statement on the new allegations. In November 2012, it was reported that agents of News Corp had illegally bribed a member of the US military to obtain a photograph of an imprisoned Saddam Hussein wearing only his underwear. The photo was subsequently published in a News Corp outlet. Bribing public officials is a violation of the US's Foreign corrupt practices act. Australia In light of News Corporations global review, John Hartigan the boss of News Corps Australian company News Limited, announced a review of all payments in the previous three years, and that he was personally willing to co-operate with any Australian Government led inquiry. On 22 July, it was reported that two former Victorian Supreme Court judges, Frank Vincent and Bernard Teague, will act as independent assessors of how the review is run and will also assess its outcome. In a recent action of wrongful dismissal by the editor in chief of the highest read daily newspaper against The Herald Sun newspaper, published by a subsidiary of the defendant, News Limited, accusations about the reliability of Mr Hartigan as a witness under oath have been made. During the period relevant to the proceedings, Mr John Hartigan was the chairman, and chief executive officer, of News Limited. Justice J Kaye deliberated in his 2010 findings against him in his role as boss of NewsCorp. Specifically Justice Kaye found Hartigan's evidence to be unreliable. Justice Kaye further commented that \\"were aspects about his evidence, which lead him to be cautious about accepting a number of critical features of it.\\" Guthrie v News Limited 2010 VSC 196 (14 May 2010) The Australian Greens called for a parliamentary inquiry into News Limited, but Hartigan directly denied allegations by both the Greens and the governing Labor party that News Limited has been running a campaign against them, describing his group's journalism as \\"aggressive but fair.\\" The administration of Prime Minister Julia Gillard stalled a ruling by an independent panel for Sky's bid to run the Australia Network, imposing a \\"national interest\\" bar on the process. After the Murdochs had appeared in front of the UK Culture, Media and Sport Committee on 19 July, Gillard commented that: \\"When people have seen telephones hacked into, when people have seen individuals grieving having to deal with all of this, then I do think that causes them to ask some questions here in our country.\\" On 13 September 2011, the government announced an inquiry into the country's media. Areas of scrutiny include the protection of privacy and the role of the Australian Press Council. On 21 September 2011, documents were leaked to the news website Crikey detailing a proposed rebranding of News Limited as News Australia. In 2012 following a BBC Panorama report, allegations were made that News Corp subsidiary, News Datacom Systems (NDS) had used hackers to undermine pay TV rivals in Australia and elsewhere. Some of the victims of the alleged hacking, such as Austar were later taken over by News Corp. NDS had originally been set up to provide security to News Corp's pay TV interests but emails obtained by Fairfax Media revealed they had also pursued a wider agenda by distributing the keys to rival set top box operators and seeking to obtain phone records of suspected rivals.Chenoweth, Neil Pay TV Piracy Hits News, The Financial Review 28/03/2012, online accessed 04/05/2012 The emails were from the hard drive of NDS European chief, Ray Adams.

The regiment was present for but not engaged during the Battle of Pea Ridge. At the Battle of Arkansas Post, the regiment became split, with part of the regiment surrendering with the garrison when the post capitulated. The captured portion of the regiment was eventually exchanged and released on the east side of the Mississippi and served the remainder of the war with the Confederate Army of Tennessee. The un-captured portion of the regiment was consolidated with the remnants of the 24th Arkansas and served the remainder of the war in the Department of the Trans-Mississippi.  Organization  19th (Dawson's) Infantry Regiment completed its organization at Nashville, Arkansas, in November 1861. The field officers were Colonel C. L. Dawson; Lieutenant Colonels A. S. Hutchison and P. R. Smith; and Majors Joseph Anderson, David H. Hamiter, and John G. McKean. The unit was inducted into Confederate Service at Nashville, Arkansas, on November 21, 1861. The 19th Arkansas Regiment was organized from seven companies from Hempstead, Pike, Polk and Sevier counties. Three additional companies from Hempstead, Scott and Sevier were later added, the last (Company K) on March 3, 1862. Several Companies contained officers and men who had previously served in the 5th Regiment, Arkansas State Troops, which had disbanded rather than enter Confederate service following the Battle of Wilson's Creek.

Jones, organized March 3, 1862, in Sevier County. The 19th (Dawson's) Arkansas Regiment had strong support among the population where it was recruited. Even though there was a certain degree of pro-Union sentiment in the mountains of southwest Arkansas, the region continued to supply huge numbers of recruits to the 19th Arkansas, and civilians kept up a steady supply of clothing, equipment and other supplies to the men. In fact, the 19th Arkansas started off as one of the largest (in terms of number of men), best clothed (their unique frock coats and Australian-style hats were unmistakable), and best equipped (though marginally armed) Arkansas regiments. Additionally, the regiment was blessed with some of the best company commanders in the business. The company officers were mostly men who had been active in the prewar militia, and many were veterans of the Arkansas State Troops and had seen combat close up and personal at the Battle of Wilson's Creek. The officers were highly literate, mostly professional men, and familiar with infantry drill and tactics. Many of the staff officers were former businessmen who were used to keeping up with records and reports. The privates of the regiment were also a pretty literate bunch of men who wrote home frequently, providing many insights to modern researchers.  Service  Pea Ridge Campaign Still unsupplied with sufficient arms, the 19th Arkansas was present, but not engaged, at the Battle of Pea Ridge, where it was detailed to guard the army's train. After the battle, the 19th Arkansas was stationed on the border for a few months, and was ordered to conduct a long, difficult and pointless march through the Indian Territory. The regiment was ravaged by disease during this period. Today, the graves of some of the soldiers of the 19th Arkansas can still be found in the Confederate Cemetery at Atoka, Oklahoma. Many other men were left behind sick at various places, and were never heard from again. Returning to Arkansas, the regiment was reorganized for the war on August 13, 1862, and was issued new arms and equipment. Recruiting details from the 19th Arkansas had been busy in May and June, bringing a large number of new recruits back with them to Camp White Sulphur Springs, near Pine Bluff. The 19th Arkansas did not receive many of these recruits, however. Many of the new recruits died of disease before they were mustered into service, and were buried in untold numbers of unmarked graves at White Sulphur Springs. Others were shamelessly \\"shanghaied\\" and assigned to other units. The 24th Arkansas Regiment received a large number of men recruited by the 19th Arkansas, and Hart's Arkansas Battery was reconstituted by the addition of many of the 19th Arkansas recruits. Arkansas Post Assigned to the garrison of Fort Hindman at Arkansas Post, a large part of the regiment was captured when the fort was surrendered on January 11, 1863. Some of the men were absent from Arkansas Post, and they were subsequently organized into a new regiment (Hardy's). The men who were captured were sent to prisons in the North, and when exchanged in April were assigned to the Army of Tennessee, where they spent the rest of the war. Of the 633 men of the 19th Arkansas Regiment who were captured at Arkansas Post, 185 died of disease in prison, another 58 died in hospitals in Virginia after being released from prison, and 24 had taken the oath of allegiance; so the regiment entered upon its service east of the Mississippi River with only 306 men. As a result, the 19th Arkansas was field-consolidated with the survivors of the 24th Arkansas Regiment and Crawford's Arkansas Battalion (also captured at Arkansas Post), under command of Lieut. Col. Augustus S. Hutchinson of the 19th Arkansas. Chickamauga Campaign This consolidated unit fought together at the Battle of Chickamauga where they reported casualties of 16 killed or mortally wounded, 80 wounded, and one captured. At Chickamauga, the unit fought in a brigade made up entirely of the Arkansas Post prisoners, and commanded by General James Deshler who was killed during the battle.Dark, Jim \\"History of the 19th (Dawson's) Arkansas Infantry Regiment\\", Accessed 22 November 2011, http://www.pcahs.org/pcaolr/civil01/cvl-0026.htm After Chickamauga, the unit's consolidation was changed. The Arkansas units were moved into the Arkansas Brigade of Cleburne's division, and were destined to remain there for the rest of the war. On November 15, 1863, the 24th Ark. was removed from its attachment to the 19th and combined the 2nd and 15th Arkansas. The 8th Arkansas was then united with the 19th, to form the 8th - 19th Arkansas, which organization was to remain in place until the middle of April, 1865. However, it appears that these two units maintained separate unit structures inside the newly reorganized regiment. The ten companies of the 19th were then reorganized by combining them into five as follows:Pence, Merrill Theo; \\"THE 19TH ARKANSAS INFANTQRY REGIMENT, VOLUNTEERS, C.S.A.\\" 2nd edition, revised 19 May 1994, Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Accessed 23 November 2011, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=15029 *Company A merged with B; *Company C merged with H; *Company D merged with K; *Company E merged with F; and *Company I merged with G. Colonel George Baucum of the 8th Arkansas assumed command of the consolidate unit. The units remained consolidated for the rest of the war. The unit saw light action at the decisive victory by General Cleburne over Sherman at Tunnel Hill on November 25, 1863, and was in reserve most of the day at the thrashing of the Union pursuit forces at Ringgold Gap, Georgia, on November 27, 1863. Atlanta Campaign The 8th-19th played a part in all of Cleburne's actions in the Atlanta Campaign, but particularly distinguished itself at the Battle of Pickett's Mill, when it was sent across a cornfield to counter a Union thrust which was about to turn the Confederate right flank. Cavalry General John Kelly, a former commander of the 8th Arkansas, appeared before the men, and in an electrifying charge, led them into the corn to stop the Union attack cold. Baucum and the unit were cited in General Cleburne's report on the battle. Casualties for the 19th portion of the regiment were 8 killed and 5 wounded. The unit saw heavy action in the Battle of Atlanta, where it lost many men. Colonel Baucum was shot in the face, while Lt. Col. Hutchison was wounded in the arm. Both being lost for many months, command devolved upon Major David H. Hamiter of the 19th Arkansas, who was to command the regiment until the final days of the war. At Jonesboro, 49 men of the 19th, and 77 men of the 8th were captured when Govan's Brigade was overrun by a massive Union attack. Only heroic fighting by the remainder of the men and the rest of Cleburne's division saved the Confederate position from being destroyed. The flag of the consolidated 8th-19th was captured by Medal of Honor winner, 2nd LT Jeremiah Kuder of the 74th Indiana Infantry Regiment during this fight. Franklin‚ÄìNashville Campaign The 8th-19th saw action with the remainder of Cleburne's Division during the Tennessee Campaign, and was one of the few Confederate infantry units to become engaged at Spring Hill, before the curious collapse of the Confederate high command that day. On November 30, 1864, Govan's Brigade, the 19th among them lost over 60% of their men during the fateful Confederate assault at Franklin, Tennessee. Charging into the vortex of the battle around the Carter House, the unit fought hand to hand until driven into the ditch outside the second line of works. General Cleburne was one of six Confederate Generals killed during this attack. The 8th-19th was part of the contingent of the Army of Tennessee that traveled to the Carolinas to resist the army of General Sherman. It saw action one last time at the Battle of Bentonville. At least five members of the 19th are known to have been wounded in this battle, but exact casualty figures are unknown. The 18th/24th lost thirty-eight percent of the 226 engaged at Chickamauga, and the 8th/19th reported 16 casualties at Ringgold Gap and totaled 363 men and 285 arms in December 1863. At the Battle of Atlanta the 8th/19th had 97 men disabled.National Park Service, Civil War Soldiers and Sailors System , Confederate Arkansas Troops, 19th (Dawson's) Regiment, Arkansas Infantry.

Battle Flags  right There is one surviving battle flag of the Combined 8th/19th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. The flag is a Hardee Battle flag pattern, Cleburne's Division 1864 issue. It was produced and decorated specifically for the combined unit, displaying battle honors of each. The poorly dyed blue field, now faded to pea green, is typical of the 1864 flags. When it was captured at Jonesboro, Georgia, on 1 September 1864, the flag was identified as that of an artillery battery. The honor of crossed cannon, as well as the unit's position on the battle field in support of Key's Battery, caused the confused attribution. The flag is made of cotton with black and white paint and currently measures 35\\" x 34 1/2\\". The flag was marked with War Department Capture Number 206. It is currently located at the Old State House Museum, Little Rock Arkansas.Battle Flags Collection, The Hardee Pattern, Old State House Museum, Accessed 7 May 2012, http://www.oldstatehouse.com/collections/flags/flagDetail.asp?g=3&img;=4  Consolidation and Surrender  The remnants of ten depleted Arkansas regiments, along with one mostly-Arkansas regiment, in the Army of Tennessee were consolidated into a single regiment at Smithfield, North Carolina, on April 9, 1865. The 19th Arkansas, was lumped together with the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 15th, 19th, 24th Arkansas Infantry Regiments and the 3rd Confederate Infantry Regiment as the 1st Arkansas Consolidated Infantry. Of the 1,200 men who served in the 19th at various times, only 5% were present at the end. The men of the 19th had only enough people to fill one company in the 1st Arkansas Consolidated Infantry. Company I of the 1st Consolidated Arkansas was made up of the 49 survivors of the 19th Arkansas. The unit was commanded at the surrender of the army by Captain William B. Cone, originally of Company E. On April 26, 1865, the 1st Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment was present with the Army of Tennessee when it surrendered in Greensboro, North Carolina.

The bid was launched in June 2010, but was withdrawn in July 2011 following the News International phone hacking scandal. News Corporation already owned 39.1% of BSkyB, and held on to its stake following the collapse of the takeover bid. The takeover was an essential part of News Corporation's business strategy, not least as it would have made possible integration with other entities such as Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia.Nils Pratley, The Guardian, 12 July 2011, News Corp needs all of BSkyB The Guardian went so far as to say that, \\"Without a full takeover of BSkyB, News Corp's global satellite strategy would look an unco-ordinated mess.\\" The first key turning point in the planned takeover was the removal in December 2010 of regulatory approval from Vince Cable, who had told undercover reporters from The Daily Telegraph he had \\"declared war\\" on Murdoch. When these comments were made public, the final say on the deal went instead to Jeremy Hunt. Cable's comments on this matter were not published by the Telegraph, but were instead leaked to BBC journalist Robert Peston, most likely (according to a later Telegraph investigation) by two former Telegraph employees who had moved to News International, a News Corporation subsidiary. Hunt was much more sympathetic to the takeover bid than Cable. The second turning point was the series of revelations in early July of the hacking of the phones of non- celebrity victims by the News of the World, a tabloid newspaper published by News International. Details of the activities, especially regarding the paper's hacking into the voicemail of murder victim Milly Dowler, sparked widespread outrage against News Corporation. Attempts to defuse the scandal by closing the News of the World and publishing an apology by Murdoch both failed. In the face of a planned motion in the House of Commons calling on News Corporation to abandon the bid, News Corporation acquiesced. Offer On 15 June 2010, BSkyB announced that it had rejected an offer from News Corporation to take full control of the company. News Corp had offered 700p per share for the remaining 60.9% of shares that it did not own. BSkyB said that it would only consider offers of at least 800p per share. Regulatory issues Although the two companies had not agreed on a revised takeover proposal, News Corporation announced its intention to seek regulatory approval from the European Commission in November. The Commission unconditionally approved the proposal the following month. The proposal was also reviewed by the British government. On 4 November 2010 Business Secretary Vince Cable referred the takeover bid to Ofcom to consider issues of media plurality. In July 2011 it was reported that around this time News Corp's News International subsidiary had \\"bullied\\" the Liberal Democrats. The Observer said that \\"According to one account from a senior party figure, a cabinet minister was told that, if the government did not do as NI wanted, the Lib Dems would be 'done over' by the Murdoch papers.\\"The Observer, 24 July 2011, News International 'bullied Liberal Democrats over BSkyB bid' In late December 2010, undercover reporters from The Daily Telegraph, posing as constituents, set up a meeting with Cable, in which he made some unguarded remarks about the coalition, including a description of the coalition's attempt at fast, widespread reforms (including the health service and local governments) as being a \\"kind of Maoist revolution\\". When his comments appeared in the press on 21 December, Cable stated, \\"Naturally I am embarrassed by these comments and I regret them\\", before reaffirming his commitment to the coalition government, stating that \\"I am proud of what it is achieving\\". In May 2011 the Press Complaints Commission upheld a complaint regarding the Telegraph's use of subterfuge: \\"On this occasion, the commission was not convinced that the public interest was such as to justify proportionately this level of subterfuge.\\"The Guardian, 10 May 2011, Daily Telegraph censured by PCC over Vince Cable tapes In an undisclosed part of the Telegraph transcript, Cable stated in reference to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation takeover bid for BSkyB, \\"I have declared war on Mr Murdoch and I think we are going to win.\\" This was given to the BBC's Robert Peston by a whistleblower unhappy that the Telegraph had not published Cable's comments in full, and also published on 21 December. Following this revelation Cable had his responsibility for media affairs ‚Äì including ruling on Murdoch's takeover plans ‚Äì withdrawn from his role as business secretary that same day.Patrick Wintour, \\"Humiliated Vince Cable stripped of Sky role after 'war with Murdoch' gaffe\\", The Guardian, 21 December 2010. Retrieved 23 January 2011. In July 2011 a firm of private investigators hired by the Telegraph to track the source of the leak concluded \\"strong suspicion\\" that two former Telegraph employees who had moved to News International, one of them Will Lewis, had gained access to the transcript and audio files and leaked them to Peston.The Guardian, 23 July 2011, News Corp boss 'linked' to leak of Vince Cable's Rupert Murdoch comments After the business secretary Vince Cable was stripped of his jurisdiction over the deal, the proposal was referred to Jeremy Hunt, the Secretary of State for culture, media and sport. Hunt initially elected not to refer to the deal to the Competition Commission, announcing on 3 March 2011 that he intended to accept a series of undertakings given by News Corporation, paving the way for the deal to be approved. The undertakings would have led to Sky News being severed from BSkyB. On 23 June it was reported that News Corp had reached an agreement with Ofcom to approve the takeover, on the basis of Sky News becoming a separate company.The Independent, 23 June 2011, Hunt set to give go-ahead to BSkyB deal next week By early July, despite public opposition to the deal, \\"Government says its ready to give clearance to deal. Jeremy Hunt gives opponents one final week to raise objections. However, he has provisionally agreed to proposals that will see Sky News be spun off as an independent company to allay fears the deal would give Mr Murdoch's News Corporation too much control of the media. After the consultation ends on July 8, Mr Hunt is expected to wave the merger through once and for all. He is keen to give final confirmation by July 19 when the summer parliamentary recess begins.\\" Several days later, with the News of the World phone hacking scandal exploding, Ofcom intervened, saying that it has \\"a duty to be satisfied on an ongoing basis that the holder of a broadcasting licence is 'fit and proper'\\". Bid withdrawn It was in the wake of the Milly Dowler phone hacking allegations that a significant number of people, including former deputy prime minister John Prescott and other politicians, began to seriously question whether the takeover of BSkyB by News Corporation ought to be blocked. The Media Standards Trust formed the pressure group Hacked Off, to campaign for a public inquiry. Soon after launch, the campaign gained the support of suspected hacking victim, the actor Hugh Grant, who became a public spokesperson, appearing on Question Time and Newsnight. In July 2011, during the News International phone hacking scandal, BSkyB shares plummeted and Hunt received well over 150,000 submissions from members of the public, driven by efforts by campaign groups Avaaz.org and 38 Degrees. Most submissions were opposed to News Corp taking full control of BSkyB. News Corp subsequently withdrew undertakings made as part of negotiations with the government, triggering an immediate referral of the proposal to the Competition Commission. Numerous analysts and commentators suggested that as a result of the phone hacking scandal, it would be politically difficult or impossible for News Corp to proceed with its takeover plans. In addition to public pressure for the deal to be withdrawn or for the Government to halt the proposal, Britain's major political parties all expressed the view that the deal should not go ahead. The Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives both indicated that they would support an opposition day motion from Labour calling on News Corp to rescind its offer. On 13 July, shortly before the House of Commons was due to debate the motion, News Corporation announced that it would be withdrawing its proposal to take complete ownership of BSkyB. Chase Carey, the corporation's deputy chairman, stated that it was \\"too difficult to progress\\" with the proposed takeover given the phone hacking controversy. In a symbolic gesture, the House later passed the opposition day motion unanimously by acclamation. In 2018 when Comcast Corporation has attempted to purchased Sky plc.

The Children's Farm Home School was listed in 2008 on the National Register of Historic Places for Benton County; the listing was one of the first steps taken as part of a restoration effort that ended up taking five years. History The Children's Farm Home School was built in 1925 by volunteers from among the local Woman's Christian Temperance Union membership, for the purpose of providing homes for orphans, neglected children, and children whose families could not otherwise take care of them in the years leading up to the Great Depression. Its pupils would go on to attend Corvallis High School. It supported itself through proceeds from a cannery, dairy and slaughterhouse, as well as the sale of produce and nuts, grown on the property. The school closed in the 1980s. In 1998, Children's Farm Home School merged with the Parry Center for Children and Waverly Children's Home (aka Waverly Baby Home) in Portland to form Trillium Family Services. Restoration Restoration efforts began in 2008, after $4.5 million was raised from donors including Dave and Penny Lowther of Philomath. Bill Ryals of Modern Organic Architecture in Corvallis designed the improvements, assisted by Endex Engineering. T. Gerding Construction Co. were the general contractors, helped by volunteers. In 2011, an \\"unanticipated septic system upgrade\\" required Trillium Family Services to raise another million dollars. In July 2013, Children's Farm Home School reopened, with a basement converted to a family center and rooms where families can spend time together. A restaurant was also opened on the first floor. Classrooms have become conference rooms available to rent. The renovation also features a banquet room, administrative offices, and a museum.

Although his course did not touch on watercolour in the first year as he was being trained in other mediums including acrylic and gouache, he practised using watercolours in his spare time. Early influences were established international artists including the American, Winslow Homer, who had lived at Cullercoats in the North east of England, not far from where Alan lives now. He also admired the work of Rowland Hilder, who he described as a master of cityscapes, John Singer Sargent and Sir William Russell Flint.http://www.ne4me.co.uk/culture-4/watercolour-artist-paints-29.html. He left college with an HND in Applied Design and became self-employed in 1984 http://www.axisweb.org/seCVPG.aspx?ArtistID=3233 . using the Enterprise Allowance Scheme. He also commenced a series of lecturing jobs at Newcastle College of Art and Technology, South Tyneside College, Derwentside College and Cleveland College of Art, covering a 20-year timescale. He opened his own Gallery of Fine Art in Eldon Garden, Newcastle in 1998 to 2002 and then went on to open his own studio in Ponteland.http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north- east-news/news-archive/2006/07/20/artist-s-brush-with- hospital-72703-17418438/.

Val d'Orcia, Italy Italy In 1991 Alan was introduced to Italy by Susan; the holiday was to have a lasting effect on him. Impressed by the landscape, Alan subsequently travelled to various regions throughout the country from the Veneto to Piedmont, Tuscany, Umbria, the Amalfi Coast and Abruzzo. He has completed several commissions to paint famous towns and cities including San Gimignano, Florence and Venice. In 2005 he held an exhibition of his work entitled \\"The Light\\" in Marostica, which was featured on Italian television and local press. Barka, Oman Middle East Also in 2005 Reed was commissioned to paint two watercolours for a client in Oman. This became the catalyst for regular painting trips to the Persian Gulf region, including Dubai and Kuwait as well as Oman.http://www.nebusiness.co.uk/business- news/latest-business-news/2011/08/03/north-east-firms-looking-east-in-search- of-new-markets-51140-29163925/. common feature of his work in this region has been the dhows at rest in calm harbour waters, the distinctive Arabic architecture and the activity in the life of the Souks. Alan has enjoyed an ongoing relationship with the Bait Muzna Gallery in Muscat since 2007. He had a joint exhibition with landscape photographer Malcolm MacGregor titled \\"Mystical Oman\\" in April 2010 opened by his Highness Sayyid Tarik Al Said.http://main.omanobserver.om/node/5240 . sketch book studies of Oman have attracted significant interest and have been printed as a handmade leather bound limited edition reproduction sketch book featuring watercolours to celebrate Oman's 40th Renaissance. Personal life Alan was born in Corbridge, Northumberland, England, eldest son of Kenneth and Gillian Reed. Kenneth Reed is also an artist, specialising in paintings of golf courses.http://www.axisweb.org/seEventDetails.aspx?EventID=360242&TYPE;=0 . Alan's grandfather, Thomas Reed also painted and his great grandfather carved ship figureheads. Alan now lives in Ponteland, Northumberland where his gallery and studio are based within his own home. He married his wife Susan in 1993 and they have two children and three grandchildren. They both share strong family ethics and a Christian faith along with a unique bond following an operation on 27 June 2001 at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital. Susan needed a kidney transplant and although her mother was tested she was not compatible.http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/evening-chronicle- news/2001/05/12/gift-husband-can-save-desperately-ill-wife-72703-11051565/.

Two adult and more than 20 larval fossils of Mickoleitia have been scientifically described from Mesozoic outcrops, mainly from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil (in total, around 40 fossil larvae have been found). Coxoplectoptera belong to the stem group of mayflies. Both the winged adults and the aquatic larvae were predators with raptorial forelegs, which are reminiscent to those of praying mantids. The larvae had a peculiar freshwater shrimp-like habitus.  Etymology  The genus Mickoleitia and family Mickoleitiidae was named in honor of German zoologist Gerhard Mickoleit from the University of T√ºbingen, who was among the first proponents of Willi Hennig's \\"Phylogenetic Systematics\\". The scientific name of the order Coxoplectoptera refers to the prolonged coxal segment of the larval and adult legs, and the old scientific name Plectoptera for mayflies (not to be confused with Plecoptera for stoneflies). The common name \\"chimera wings\\" was coined in reference to the strange combination of characters in the morphology of the adult animal, which looks like a kind of chimera built from unrelated insects, with their oblique thorax and broad hind wing shape like a dragonfly, their wing venation like a primitive mayfly ancestor, and their raptorial forelegs like a mantis.  History of discovery  The fossil larvae of the genus Mickoleitia are not especially rare in the limestones of the Crato Formation; the local brick workers even have a common Brazilian name for them (\\"Abacaxi\\" = pineapple). These larvae were scientifically discovered and first mentioned by Bechly (2001: fig. 36), who also pointed to their strange morphology. Staniczek (2002, 2003) discussed the larvae as well and claimed that they arguably had been a kind of living fossil in the Lower Cretaceous. The German biologist Rainer Willmann described the larvae in a chapter in Martill, Bechly & Loveridge (2007) and erroneously attributed them to the extinct stem group mayfly family Cretereismatidae that he described based on adult specimens from the same locality. During the work for this monograph on the Crato Formation the German palaeoentomologist G√ºnter Bechly and entomologist Arnold H. Staniczek discovered in the fossil collection of the Stuttgart State Museum of Natural History the very adult specimen that later would become the holotype of Mickoleitia longimanus. They figured this fossil in Martill, Bechly & Loveridge 2007 (Fig. 11.90i,j) as undescribed stem group mayfly and indicated in a brief figure legend the possible relationship to the erratic larvae. The detailed scientific description of Coxoplectoptera and the demonstration of the relationship of fossil adult and larvae was finally published by Staniczek, Bechly & Godunko (2011) in a special issue on Cretaceous insects of the journal \\"Insect Systematics & Evolution\\". The authors also determined that two fossil larvae (Mesogenesia petersae = Archaeobehnigia edmundsi) that had been erroneously described by Tshernova (1977) as modern mayfly larvae from the Middle or Upper Jurassic of Transbaikals, can be attributed the order Coxoplectoptera. The discovery of Coxoplectoptera represented one of the more spectacular findings of paleontology in 2011 and was heavily covered by news media around the globe.  Description   Adult  The adult stage of the type species Mickoleitia longimanus had a wing length of 28‚Äì29 mm and a probable body length of ca. 35‚Äì40 mm (the abdomen is not preserved in the single known fossil holotype specimen). A second unnamed species of the genus Mickoleitia was only of half this size, and is only known by a single adult specimen from a private fossil collection in Japan. The head of Mickoleitia was provided with large compound eyes and functional mouthparts (preserved are 3-segmented labial palps). The thoracic segments are obliquely tilted backwards as in dragonflies, so that the raptorial forelegs are shifted forwards. All legs have a strongly prolonged and free coxal segment. The forelegs are developed as subchelate raptorial devices with a single-segmented tarsus with an unpaired claw. Most likely the abdomen was provided with three caudal filaments (two lateral cerci and the median epiproct) as in modern mayflies and their Permian stem group representatives (Permoplectoptera, e.g. Protereismatidae). Since males of modern mayflies and of Permoplectoptera have gonopods on the 9th abdominal segment that are developed as genital claspers to grip the female for copulation, such a character state and behavior is also likely for Coxoplectoptera, who have an intermediate position as phylogenetic link between these two groups.  Larva  Mickoleitia spec., larva The more than 20 described larvae of different stages have a body length of . Their laterally compressed body is unique among all known fossil and Recent aquatic insect larvae, and rather resembles the body of gammarid freshwater shrimps. Many of the fossil larvae are preserved in a characteristic posture with arched back, erect antennae and terminal filaments, and forelegs always in catching position similar to a praying mantis. The head was strongly armored and provided with horn- or shovel-like projections. Of the mouthparts only the crossed, sabre-like mandibles and the spoon-shaped labium are known. All legs have a strongly prolonged and free coxal segment as in the adult. Likewise, the forelegs are developed as slender subchelate raptorial legs with nearly identical segment proportions as in the adult stage, but with a shorter tibia that may have been fused with the single-segmented tarsus, which ended in an unpaired claw. Styliform and ventrally directed abdominal gills are developed on abdominal segments 1-7. These gills are composed of a broader, more strongly sclerotized basal part and a slender and rather membranous distal part. The gills articulate dorsally within the abdominal tergites that are distinctly separated from the ventral sternites. The caudal filaments are formed by the two lateral cerci and the slightly longer medial terminal filament. All three appendages are lined with dense rows of long and thin setae.  Ecology and behavior   Adult  Because in the adult holotype specimen well-preserved mouthparts (palps) are visible, the adult animals almost certainly were able to feed. In direct contrast, the adult form of modern mayflies has dramatically reduced, non-functional mouthparts, and lives solely to reproduce. The raptorial forelegs and oblique thorax indicate that Mickoleitia was a predator. The large and broad hinds suggest that they were ecologically similar to dragonflies, in that they were swift, flying predators of other flying insects.  Larva  The abundance of fossils, the circumstances of preservation and special anatomical adaptations (7 pairs of abdominal gills, 3 caudal filaments with dense rows of swimming hairs) prove that the larvae have been living in freshwater of streams and rivers, just like those of modern mayflies. They were washed in as allochthonous elements into the brackish Crato lagoon, were the limestones were deposited. The raptorial forelegs, sabre-like mandibles, large eyes and long antennae indicate that the larvae were predators like the adults. On the other hand, the strong, shortened and broadened mid- and hind legs, the strong body armature, and shovel-like projections on the head all suggest that the animals were burrowing. Staniczek, Bechly & Godunko (2011) therefore assumed that the larvae were ambush predators that were hiding, partly burrowed in the river bed, and waiting for small prey passing by.  Evolution and phylogeny  The larvae of Coxoplectoptera provided new clues to the disputed question of the evolutionary origin of insect wings. Before this discovery the paranotal- hypothesis and the leg-exite-hypothesis have been considered as incompatible alternative explanations, which have both been supported by a set of evidences from the fossil record, comparative morphology, developmental biology and genetics. The expression of leg genes in the ontogeny of the insect wing has been universally considered as conclusive evidence in favour of the leg-exite- hypothesis, which proposes that insect wings are derived from mobile leg appendages (exites). However, the larvae of Coxoplectoptera show that the abdominal gills of mayflies and their ancestors, which are generally considered as corresponding structures to insect wings, articulated within the dorsal tergite plates. This cannot be seen in modern mayfly larvae, because their abdominal tergites and sternites are fused, without any traces of separation left even in embryonic development. If larval gills and wings are corresponding (\\"serial homologous\\") structures and thus share the same evolutionary origin, the new results from Coxoplectoptera demonstrate that also wings are of tergal origin, as proposed by the classical paranotal- hypothesis. Staniczek, Bechly & Godunko (2011) therefore suggested a new hypothesis that could reconcile the apparently conflicting evidence from paleontology and developmental genetics: wings originated as stiff outgrowths of tergal plates (paranota), and only later in evolution became mobile, articulated appendages through secondary recruiting of leg genes. Within pterygote insects the Coxoplectoptera represent the sister group of modern mayflies (Ephemeroptera). This relationship is indicated by several synapomorphies, such as: adult wing venation with costal brace (absent in other winged insects), larvae with 7 pairs of abdominal gills (compared to still 9 pairs in Permoplectoptera like Protereisma larvae), and with single- segmented tarsus with unpaired claw (compared to 3-segmented tarsus with paired claw in Permoplectoptera like Protereisma larvae). Together with mayflies and dragonflies they belong to the clade Palaeoptera, which is characterized by a derived wing articulation with fused sclerites, a vertical resting position of the wings in the groundplan, and a wing venation with intercalary veins between the main longitudinal veins (esp. IR1+ between RP1- and RP2-, and IR2+ between RP2- and RP3/4-). Because of some very primitive character states, the Coxoplectoptera rather looked like early Paleozoic ancestors of mayflies, e.g. in the wing venation of the adult stage they still had the elongate costal brace that is not fused to the costal margin, and in the larval stage they still had articulated lateral wing pads. The large and broad hind wings are a further plesiomorphy compared to the small hind wing of modern mayflies, and even compared to the slender hind wing of Permian stem group mayflies like Protereisma. The monophyly of Coxoplectoptera is demonstrated by several autapomorphic characters in the adult stage, such as the raptorial forelegs and single-segmented tarsi with unpaired claw, as well as in the larval stage by the laterally compressed body, the body armature, the raptorial forelegs and burrowing mid- and hind legs, and the styliform shape of the ventrally directed abdominal gills. Coxoplectoptera are only known from the Jurassic and the Lower Cretaceous. It is not yet known why and when they went extinct.

The grid is constructed of a series of alternating parallel strips of lead and a radiolucent substance such as a plastic, carbon fibre, aluminium, even paper. The grid is placed between the patient and the detector during the exposure. Primary beam radiation passes through the radiolucent strips as it travels roughly parallel to them, but scattered radiation which has, almost by definition, deviated from the parallel beam, cannot easily pass through the grid as it encounters the lead strips at an angle, and is attenuated, or lost, from the beam. Grids are used particularly in examinations where a large quantity of scatter is created, i.e., those involving a large volume of tissue being irradiated and those requiring low energy i.e. voltage. The scatter would otherwise degrade the image by reducing the contrast and resolution. Use of a grid, however, requires a greater radiation exposure to the patient as a good deal of primary beam is also attenuated by the lead slats, and for this reason grids are not used for all examinations. The single most important parameter that influences the performance of an anti-scatter grid, is the grid ratio. The grid ratio is the ratio of the height to the width of the interspaces (not the grid bars) in the grid. Grid ratios of 8:1, 10:1, and 12:1 are most common on radiography. A 5:1 grid is most common for mammography. The grid is essentially a one-dimensional Collimator and increasing the grid ratio increases the degree of collimation. Higher grid ratios provide better scatter cleanup, but they also result in greater radiation doses to the patient.

Education, Professor and Judicial Career Papa graduated cum laude at the University of Federico II di Napoli in 1990 with a thesis on trade law. In 1991, Mr. Papa was an assistant for Professor Gianfranco Campobasso and Professor Carlo Di Nanni. He taught as a professor of Criminal Law at the L.U.M. University in Bari and as a professor of ‚ÄúThe History of Criminal Organizations‚Äù at the Universitarian Institute ‚ÄúSuor Orsola Benincasa‚Äù in Naples. In 1993 Papa started his eight-year judiciary career as a judicial prosecutor being first assigned in Naples where he worked on cases related to drugs, terrorism, organized crime and public administration. In Rome, Papa covered the position of Deputy Chief of Cabinet for the Minister of Justice Roberto Castelli and subsequently General Director of Civil Justice with Minister of Justice Clemente Mastella. Papa was very active in the Italian National Association of Judges, becoming a member and serving as Vice Secretary General from 1999 to 2001. Papa, who was 23 years old in 1993, is still the youngest-ever holder of an Italian judgeship. International Work During his career, Papa has worked on behalf of the Italian government for the achievement of multilateral agreement inside the United Nations, the European Commission and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OCSE). From 2001 to 2007 he was Head of the Italian delegation for both the UN Convention against corruption signed at M√©rida, Mexico and the Working Group on Bribery at OCSE. Papa also served as an Italian representative to the Multi-Disciplinary Group of the European Commission in Brussels, the Central European Initiative (CEI) in Trieste, the High Commissioner of the Balkan Stability Pact in Sarajevo, and the Data Joint Supervisory Group of EuroJast in The Hague. Member of the Italian Parliament representing The People of Freedom Party (Il Popolo della Libert√†, PdL) Papa was elected as a Member of the Chamber of Deputies in the Italian Parliament in 2008. He was a member of several parliamentary committees: Justice and Simplification of the Public Administration. He was also chosen to sit on a committee that investigated organized crime. During his committee work, he proposed several bills in the penal justice field. As a member of the Justice Committee, Papa sponsored a number of provisions including the establishment of auditors in remote locations and the ‚Äúempty- prisons‚Äù bill. Papa was also a member of the Committee of Transportation and Telecommunications, with a focus on the shipping industry.

Commitment for Prison Reform As a direct result of Papa's experience from the false charges levied against him, he has embarked on a campaign to fight for justice and prison reforms, including prison overcrowding in Italy. From time to time Papa does Italian prison inspection visits and in carrying on other initiatives aimed at raising awareness about an issue the Italian Head of State defined as \\"overbearing urgency\\". With the support from Italy's Libertarian Party of Marco Panella, Papa has been supporting the need for amnesty because \\"who opposes amnesty also opposes the hope of reforming justice\\".http://roma.corriere.it/roma/notizie/politica/12_aprile_25/radicali- marcia-per-amnistia-2004220008114.shtml During Alfonso Papa's tenure as a member of the Italian Parliament, he proposed a bill to limit the use of pre- trial detention to violent crimes and serious social crimes, setting out a number of safeguards for detainees awaiting trial, including the separation of spaces for convicted prisoners and those who are not, the maximum duration of six months of detention without trial and the mandatory presence of a judge during interrogations. The founding of a new Movement In July 2012, immediately following his being cleared of all charges, Papa became the president of the self-funded ‚ÄúAmnesty Now‚Äù commission with the goal of raising public awareness for the issues of amnesty, pre-trial confinement without due process, abysmal Italian prison conditions, as well as being an activist for civil liberties in Italy.

The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. (March 1, 1983). History The Congregationalists of Corvallis were formed as a splinter group from the First Presbyterian Church in 1883. Originally occupying a church building at 3rd Street & Jefferson, members of the church began to discuss their need for a new building as early as 1909. Under the direction of the new Reverend Edwin T. Sherman, a formal campaign was launched in 1912. In 1913, the church requested $10,000 from the Church Building Society and finally purchased the lot off of Madison St. & 8th in 1916. At a total cost of $15,000, construction was completed in 1917 and the church held its first service on April 5, 1918. The First Congregational Church sponsored Boy Scout Troop One, the oldest troop in the Oregon Trails Council, who were organized at the church in October 1919, and continued to meet there until the change of ownership. The building continued to be used by members of the Congregationalist church for 17 years, before being sold to J. B. Hollingsworth and his business partner Raymond A. DeMoss, Corvallis funeral home directors, in 1935. They renamed the building DeMoss‚ÄìDurdan Mortuary, and operated the building as a mortuary until Mr. DeMoss's death in 1978.

Humans Eben Olemaun Eben Olemaun, the primary protagonist of 30 Days of Night, is the sheriff of the small town of Utqiagvik, Alaska (formerly Barrow). When the vampires attack Utqiagvik, Olemaun leads a small group of survivors including his wife Stella and young teenage brother, Jake. Eben saves the town by injecting vampire blood into his veins and uses his enhanced strength to fight the vampire elder Vicente. Suffering the same weakness as all vampires, Eben dies and turns to ash when the sun rises. In the sequel, Dark Days, Stella learns that there may be a way to bring back Eben. Stella exchanges proof of the existence of vampires for her husband's remains, in the hope of bringing him back from the dead. She double crosses the vampire party, blowing up a large number of them in a house, before successfully resurrecting Eben, who goes for her neck, turning her into a vampire. The two are reunited. They return to save the son of new Utqiagvik sheriff Brian Kitka in 30 Days of Night: Return to Barrow. In the 30 Days of Night film adaptation, the character's name was changed from Eben Olemaun to Eben Oleson. Eben was portrayed by American actor Josh Hartnett and in 30 Days of Night: Dark Days was portrayed by Canadian film and television actor Stephen Huszar. Stella Olemaun Stella Olemaun is the wife of Eben Olemaun, the sheriff of the small town of Utqiagvik, Alaska. When the vampires attack Utqiagvik, Stella is among a small group of survivors led by Eben. In the sequel, Dark Days, Stella publishes a book about the events in Utqiagvik. This gets the attention of the Los Angeles vampire population. Learning that there may be a way to bring back Eben, Stella strikes a deal with a vampire named Dane. The two form a brief romantic relationship. Stella exchanges proof of the existence of vampires for her husband's remains, in the hope of bringing him back from the dead. She double crosses the vampire party, blowing up a large number of them in a house, before successfully resurrecting Eben. She is reunited with her husband, who goes for her throat (Stella's fate after her husband's resurrection is unknown). In the 30 Days of Night film adaptation, the character's name was changed from Stella Olemaun to Stella Oleson. In the movie, she was a fire marshal in Utqiagvik and the estranged wife of sheriff Eben Oleson. During the attack, she worked with Eben to survive the month. She was portrayed by actress Melissa George. In the film adaptation of Dark Days, she was played by Kiele Sanchez. Brian Kitka Brian Kitka is a character from the 30 Days of Night comic series. He first appears in the second comic sequel, Return to Barrow. His brother was William \\"Billy\\" Kitka, the deputy sheriff of Utqiagvik, Alaska from the original comic. Both Billy and the full sheriff, Eben Olemaun, were killed in the vampire attack on the town that took place there. In Return to Barrow, set three years later, Brian goes to Utqiagvik to both become the new sheriff and to try to find answers about what really happened to the town. Charlie Keating Charlie Keating was the main protagonist in 30 Days of Night: Red Snow. Vampires Marlowe Marlowe (alternatively spelled Marlow) is a vampire who organizes the attack on Utqiagvik, Alaska, during the polar night in winter. His plan is to have a month of uninterrupted killing and feeding without the burden of sunlight. The premise of the story is that vampires live all over the world, hidden in the shadows and coming out at night to prey on humans. The novel Immortal Remains identified his first name as being Roderick. Upon learning of Marlowe's plan, Vicente, the ruler of all vampires, becomes enraged at having spent decades trying to convince humans that vampires are not real only to have Marlowe's plan risk exposing them. He comes to Utqiagvik and kills Marlowe himself before determining to eradicate all the humans in the village to eliminate potential witnesses. The film version of Marlowe played by Danny Huston is much the same as the graphic novel, but is combined with the character of Vincente as well. Vicente Vicente is a character from the 30 Days of Night franchise, first appearing in the original comic. He is the husband of Lilith, and together they are referred to as the \\"elders\\". In Dark Days, Lilith claimed that they were the parents of all other vampires. However, Vicente stated that he had outlived both his \\"brothers and fathers\\". In addition to Lilith, Vicente had at least two other female vampire consorts, although Lilith seemed to be his real wife. He lived in Norway. During the course of the original comic, Vicente was invited to witness and participate in the raid on Utqiagvik, Alaska organized by Marlowe. Vicente was angry that Marlow would so casually arrange a situation that could destroy the cover that Vicente had helped establish over the previous thousand years, and killed him, taking command of the vampires in Utqiagvik. He decided to destroy the town by killing any other survivors of the town and breaching the Alaskan pipeline, making it look like the town had been destroyed by accident. However, Vicente's plan was defeated by Sheriff Eben Olemaun, who turned himself into a vampire and killed Vicente in hand-to-hand combat. The plot of Dark Days and Immortal Remains centers around Lilith's plans to avenge Vicente's death on Eben's widow, Stella Olemaun. In the movie adaptation, Vicente is absent, the film's version of Marlowe has more in common with Vicente. Lilith Lilith is a character from the 30 Days of Night franchise, first appearing in the original comic sequel, Dark Days. She is the wife of Vicente, and together they are referred to as the \\"elders\\". She claims to be the mother of all other vampires. She was presumably named after, and could be intended to be, the mythological Lilith. She lives in the mountains of Norway. After Vicente is killed in Utqiagvik, Alaska by Eben Olemaun in the events of the first comic, Lilith came to Los Angeles to confront Stella Olemaun, who had become a vampire hunter. She traded the remains of Eben to Stella in return for the visual records of the vampire attack on Utqiagvik. Dark Days ended with Stella destroying the house that Lilith was in, with her fate left unsaid. However, Lilith survived, and was a major character in the spinoff novel Immortal Remains, which dealt with her parentage and backstory as an elder. In the film adaptation of Dark Days, she was played by Mia Kirshner. Dane Dane is a vampire that appears in 30 Days of Night: Dark Days and 30 Days of Night: Return to Barrow as well as the tie-in novel 30 Days of Night: Immortal Remains. He had a romantic affair with Stella and was a friend of Marlowe's. Though he joins the group of vampires preparing to attack Utqiagvik, he did not participate in killing the humans. He's apparently killed by vampire Agent Norris when it is revealed he was Stella's former lover. The Immortal Remains novel however reveals that he somehow survived the encounter, going on to save other humans from his ilk. His character does appear in 30 Days of Night: Dark Days film, though his role greatly altered. Instead of being her lover, he becomes a temporary ally along with a group of human survivors and is killed by Norris with a shotgun. Lilly Lilly first appeared in 30 Days of Night unnamed as one of the 19 vampires that attacked Utqiagvik. She was seen in the initial attack and later encountered Eben while she was feeding on a man in the street. She later laughed when Vicente killed Marlowe. She was the main antagonist in 30 Days of Night: Red Snow where her name was revealed to be Lilly. She is the sister of Zurial. In the film version, she is played by Abbey-May Wakefield Zurial The vampire brother of Lilly that appeared in 30 Days of Night: Red Snow.

Most common perkedel are made from mashed potatoes, yet there are other popular variants which includes perkedel jagung (peeled maize perkedel) and perkedel tahu (tofu perkedel) and perkedel ikan (minced fish). Throughout most of Indonesia it is called perkedel; however, it is called begedil in Javanese, and also called that way in Malaysia and Singapore, which could suggest that this fried food was introduced by Javanese immigrants to Malaysia and Singapore. Origin Perkedel is believed to be derived from Dutch frikadeller, which is actually a Danish meatball or minced meat dish. This was owed to Indonesian historical and colonial link to the Netherlands. Unlike frikadeller, the perkedel's main ingredient is not meat, but mashed potato. Ingredients Prior to mashing, the potato slices, however, are not boiled as that can cause the perkedel to be too mushy, but deep fried or baked instead. The mashed fried potato is mixed, as much as 1:1 ratio, with ground meat or corned beef. However, sometimes common perkedel contains less or no meat at all. The mixture is then mixed with chopped scallion and seasoned with white pepper powder, then shaped into flat round patties and dipped in egg yolk or beaten egg, before being deep fried. Other than mashed potato, cabe rawit, spring onion, shrimp, peeled corn, or mashed tofu fritters are also common as perkedel ingredients. Corn perkedel.

Pratt would have completed his apprenticeship in 1824. He stayed in Derby until 1830. After that he worked for Mintons from 1831 to November 1836 as a painter. Six months before he left Mintons he married Margaret Windsor of Stoke on Trent. Henry and Margaret had children with the first in 1837 and the first five in Stoke. A son was born in 1839 who was given his father's full name, causing confusion when he also became an artist. In 1841 Pratt described his profession as artist in the census and in 1844 he started taking an interest in oil painting. He was then employed to sketch baronial halls in nearby counties. He enjoyed painting and was keen on landscapes and particularly the valley of Dovedale on the Derbyshire and Staffordshire border. Patrons of his art included the Dukes of Devonshire and Queen Victoria who bought a dinner service with views of Windsor Castle that Pratt had painted.

During the 1980s she became famous in the United Kingdom for staging a series of spectacular car stunts. Along with her husband, de Creed was killed in an air crash while flying through dense fog en route from Italy to the French town of Troyes. Career She began her stunt- performing career in the 1970s, appearing on television on numerous occasions, including the BBC television series Disaster Squad, but she was to become a household name after getting into the Guinness Book of Records with a 1983 car ramp jump at Santa Pod Raceway in a 1969 Ford Mustang which had been specially adapted for the occasion. De Creed set the record for Long Distance Car Ramp Jump at having approached the jumping ramp at 140 mph. Her career was defined by a series of dramatic stunts. On one notable occasion while attempting to jump a line of vehicles in a Chevrolet Camaro (also at Santa Pod), she fell short of the target, wrecking the car and almost killing herself. She later recalled in her biography that it was \\"probably the most spectacular car crash ever filmed from which the female driver lived to tell the tale\\". The Daily Telegraph reports that in a short biography on her website, de Creed is said to have been \\"one of only a few people in Britain\\" who could drive a car on its side, balanced on two wheels. She also made television commercials for Bovril and Heinz and, according to the Birmingham-based Sunday Mercury newspaper, gave driving lessons to a number of television presenters before retiring in 2005 to become a drama teacher. According to BBC News, she later worked as a presenter and became an after-dinner speaker. At the time of her death, de Creed was at work on an autobiography, entitled Close to the Edge, with her long term stunt partner Dick Sheppard. Death On the morning of 17 June 2011, de Creed and her husband, James Balmer, took off in their twin engine Piper PA-39 aircraft shortly after 0800 UTC (1000 CET), for a flight from Lucca, Italy, to Troyes, France, following a holiday. Both were experienced pilots, and usually flew separately, but had decided on this occasion to travel together. Flying through an area enveloped by dense fog, the plane, piloted by James Balmer, lost radar contact at 0928 UTC (1128 CET). A full scale search and rescue operation was launched shortly after midday local time after a resident reported a plane flying at \\"very low altitude\\". The wreckage of the aircraft - together with the bodies of the couple - was subsequently found on Mont Agel, north of Monaco later the same day at 1345 UTC. Their identities were established through mobile phone records. Personal life Jacquie de Creed was married to James Balmer, a former rally driver who owned a menswear shop, and lived in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. Together they had two daughters, Charlotte and Lucy.

The theater featured a Wurlitzer organ touted as \\"unsurpassed in tone and quality by any organ in the state\\" and was decorated with luxurious draperies and attractive murals, as well as floral decorations. The organ was of particular importance in this era of silent film, with a Seattle movie theater owner named Winstock observing to the crowd on opening night that \\"pictures can not be produced without fitting music\\" and noting that film companies took great care in providing \\"suitable music for picture plays.\\" The new Whiteside Theatre provided \\"the best of facilities for enjoying such music,\\" Winstock declared. Construction of the theater on behalf of the Whiteside brothers, Sam and George, who did business as the Corvallis Amusement Company, was said to have cost $120,000. The Whitesides were natives of Iowa who had spent a quarter century in Corvallis prior to the opening of their namesake theater. The pair had been active in the movie business in Corvallis since about 1910 as owners and operators of the Crystal Theatre, the town's first venue for motion pictures. A year after the opening of the Crystal, the Whitesides constructed a second theater in Corvallis, the Majestic Theatre, a building which was itself surpassed in size and quality with the launch of the Whiteside. The Crystal Theater was closed during the summer of 1922. 1927 fire In October 1927 the Whiteside was badly damaged by a fire which was determined to have started in a paint room at the back of the stage.\\"Investigate Cause of Whiteside Theatre Fire,\\" Corvallis Gazette-Times, Oct. 27, 1927, pg. 4.

Some $35,000 had been invested by the Whitesides in new Vitaphone equipment developed by Warner Brothers, the installation of which took about six weeks. The Vitaphone system made use of a turntable adjacent to the movie projector, both of which were driven by the same motor, which kept the speed constant. An electric pick-up and amplifier located in the projection room transmitted the sound to multiple horns spread out throughout the theater. A new set of rates accompanied the costly upgrade, with the Whiteside initially charging 50 cents for adult admission and 15 cents for children, with loge seats selling for 75 cents ‚Äî although midweek and afternoon matinees were offered with reduced entrance fees. The Jazz Singer, a 1927 film starring Al Jolson, was slated to debut in Corvallis at the Whiteside on New Year's Day of 1929, with a steady stream of \\"talkies\\" booked for subsequent weeks.

The final movie shown in the theater during its initial commercial incarnation was the Peter Jackson epic The Fellowship of the Ring. Failed sewer lines necessitating a costly remodel and lack of profitability of the giant 800 seat movie palace in an era of multiplex theaters were cited as reasons for the closure by the national theater chain. Regal chose not to gut the facility at the time of the theater's shuttering, thereby making future restoration feasible.

The term Westfailure is a portmanteau (West + failure) and a pun on the term Westphalian system. Commonly used in international politics, the Westphalian system refers to the system of state sovereignty that emerged out of treaties signed during the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. Strange describes the Westphalian system as one that perpetuates non-intervention, the universal recognition of state sovereignty, and the \\"legitimate use of violence within a given territory.\\" Put simply, the Westphalian system promotes a system where each individual state has the inalienable authority to govern their own internal affairs (laws, market, resources, etc.) without interference from other states or non-governmental actors. The principal aim of Strange's article is to highlight how this system of international governance is failing and does not \\"satisfy the long-term conditions of sustainability.\\" General outline of the 'Westfailure' argument While Susan Strange's work has been expanded upon since, her original work still acts as a clear and concise outline of the argument for the 'Westfailure' system. One of the foundational problems she identifies with the Westfailure system is that it has become inseparable from the market-driven, capitalist economy that it emerged under in 17th century Europe. She argues that global capitalism, in conjunction with a state-based 'Westfailure system', has created a political climate wherein \\"...those with political authority are inherently unable to see that socio- economic polarisation is not in anyone‚Äôs long-term interest.\\" Under these conditions, Strange warns that there is little accountability for environmental degradation and that the socioeconomic polarization of rich and poor countries has intensified. To support her claims, the author breaks down her argument into three parts: Financial, Environmental, and Social Failure.  Financial failure  The first failure Strange identifies in relation to the Westphalian model of global governance is financial failure. Overall, Strange takes the position that the Westphalian model of state sovereignty is failing capitalism as a whole. For this portion of her analysis, Strange critiques the efficiency and sustainability of a two-tier international regulation system composed of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Essentially, a two-tiered system was designed to predict, offset, and regulate any irregularities in the market that could lead to or prolong a financial crisis. However, this understanding was challenged by the 1997 Asian financial crisis when, despite the implementation of national banking regulations and aid from both the IMF and BIS, Asian markets still did not recover as initially predicted. Asian financial crisis Strange argues that the solutions implemented by national regulatory bodies, in-tandem with the IMF and BIS, during the Asian financial crisis were short-term, and \\"ill-considered\\". She elaborates on this point, stating that: \\"The common factor in all the stricken economies was an influx of mobile short-term capital, too much of which went in ill-considered speculative loans or in unproductive real-estate investments.\\" However, the author does not put all of the fault on the IMF and BIS, but rather distributes it equally between national and international regulatory bodies‚Äîarguing that a two-tiered financial regulation system is simply inadequate in a globalized world. She then highlights some of the many obstacles that financial regulators face in an age of globalization, technological innovation, and Westphalian sovereignty. Some of these include: * Tax Havens * Technological Advancements: Instant mobility of capital across borders and currencies is making it harder for national regulators to trace funds as they move throughout the financial system. (350) Advancements in financial technology have also created a gap between those proficient in technology, and those not. Put simply, the financial system has become so complicated that only a select few understand and master it. This creates more risk for the misuse of funds by gatekeepers. * Coercion: National regulators may feel pressured by international regulators to reform their financial systems in a way that challenges their sovereignty. As well, international regulators may be unable to force creditor governments into the necessary economic conditions that would allow them to repay their debt. Beyond Strange's analysis Other scholars have expanded upon the idea that global capitalism is undermining the power that states wield over their financial sectors. In one example, Dr. Inakshi Chaturvedi illustrates the problem posed by multinational corporations in a system of Westphalian sovereignty combined with globalized labour, trade, and production. Put simply, if the corporate tax rate in one state is too high, multinational corporations have the authority to retract their corporation from that area in-order to seek lower rates in another territory. Under these conditions, the state no longer has the same amount of weight or leverage surrounding the employment and revenue opportunities in their country.  Environmental failure  The second failure identified by Strange is environmental failure. While financial failure is mentioned first, Strange argues that this aspect of her argument requires the most immediate attention from international relations scholars and political actors. Strange argues this is because, historically, market economies have been able to endure and 'bounce back' from several decades of slow economic growth, but the same cannot be said for the environment. Strange argues that unless something is done to combat environmental degradation on a global- scale, long-term or even irreversible damage will be done to the Earth's environment. From Strange's perspective, states should consider threats to the environment just as they would consider conventional threats, like invasion. To further illustrate her point, the author identifies some of the major environmental issues that have been overlooked by modern states and their industries:  The three types of environmental danger  # Destruction of the ozone layer # Air pollution # Depletion of natural resources However, this problem has not emerged out of an inability to create comprehensive and proactive policies regarding the environment, but rather from \\"...the territorial principle which lies at the heart of it [that] proclaims that the territorial state is responsible for its own land‚Äîbut not for anyone else‚Äôs.\\" Strange argues that the non-intervention method of sovereignty employed by the Westphalian system reduces accountability for states when it comes to respecting the environment, and also limits the ability of other political actors to intervene in countries where environmental degradation is occurring. Essentially, the Westphalian system fragments the environment into territorial limits, but does not take into consideration how degradation within those territorial limits affect the global environment as a whole, similar to a domino effect. Strange argues that this is exasperated under capitalism, as states pursue self-interest, short-term financial gain often takes precedent over solutions that call for systematic change‚Äîsolutions that could require more time and funds than states are willing to invest, especially when short- term solutions typically provide immediate results.  Social failure  The final failure of the Westphalian system that Strange notes is social failure. Strange suggests that the gap between rich and very poor countries is widening. However, the author feels as though the solution to this problem has already been suggested by Keynesian thinkers in the form of redistributive tax and welfare measures. Despite this, Strange also argues that enforcing Keynesian remedial policies transnationally would be \\"practically inconceivable\\" under the Westphalian system. From Strange's perspective, global socio-economic reform will never be possible under the Westphalian system because, by definition, the states within this system pursue self- interest. In a world where all states are competing for their own self- interests, it makes sense that states are generally complacent about augmenting the socio-economic status of the states around them. This can be readily explained by the balance of power in international relations theory.

It is the headquarters of Kapoeta East County. Location Narus is north of the Kenyan border on the road from Kapoeta to Lokichoggio in Kenya. Narus lies on the Narus River, which originates in the Didinga Hills to the west and discharges into the swampy area northeast of the community. The river floods during the rainy season, but ceases to flow at other times. During the rainy season, the river virtually cuts the town of Narus in two as the riverbed fills and sometimes floods. The small market area is also cut into two-halves, one on each side of the riverbed. During the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983‚Äì2005) Narus remained reliably accessible for transport of supplies and personnel by road, being a one-hour drive from Northern Kenya. The trip still had hazards of rough roads and risk from bandits, cattle rustlers and factional fighters. In 2004 the first phase of an upgrade to the gravel road from Narus to the border town of Nadapal South Sudan was completed. There were plans to further upgrade the road through earthworks, grading, construction of drifts and installation of culverts. People The local people around Narus belong to the Toposa community, a pastoral people. Cattle, goats and sheep play a central role in their society, and the Toposa have always been engaged in cattle raids and counter-raids with the Turkana people across the border in Kenya. During the civil war the Narus schools became refuges for orphans of Internally Displaced People (IDPs) from other communities. As of 2008 there were about 10,000 IDPs in Narus. Schools St. Bakhita's Day and Boarding Girls' Primary School was established in Narus in 1994 with the goal of helping girls of Southern Sudan whose schooling had been disrupted by the civil war. The school is named after Josephine Bakhita, the first Sudanese to be declared a saint by the Roman Catholic Church. As of 2002 St. Bakhita's, run by the Sisters of Mary Mother of the Church of the Torit Catholic diocese, was the only girls' boarding school in southern Sudan, with 600 primary school students and 33 secondary students. Narus is also home to the Comboni Boys' School, which was opened in 1997 by the Torit diocese after the Sudan People's Liberation Movement had given assurances that they would not recruit the pupils. Civil war During the civil war, boys were used as soldiers by both sides. Many were orphaned or were no longer accompanied by family members. Thousands had found their way to Ethiopia, where they fought for the Mengistu regime in late 1990 and early 1991. After this regime collapsed, the boys and other refugees returned to South Sudan, gathering at large camps at border towns such as Nasir, Pochalla, and Pakok. In its 1992 dry season offensive the government of Sudan attacked Pochalla. The boys moved southwest into Greater Kapoeta, through difficult country combining marshy and desert terrain, harassed by Toposa bandits. By 22 April 1992 there were 12,241 boys and 6,600 \\"teachers and dependents\\" in Narus. Kapoeta town was re-captured by the Government of Sudan in 1994 and many people were displaced to Narus. Refugees already in Narus moved south into Kenya, with about 12,000 boys reaching Lokichokio in late May 1992. The Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Torit left his official residence in Torit and moved to Narus during the civil war. Narus later suffered from bombing raids by the government. In one raid in December 1998 a government plane dropped 14 bombs over a period of three days, killing six people and wounding sixteen. In September 2000 a Sudanese government plane dropped a dozen bombs on a Catholic mission in Narus. A medical dispensary was destroyed and six people were injured including a nurse and children. In April 2001 the government dropped two bombs near St. Bakhita School, injuring one student and damaging buildings.

The goal was to create a strong advocate for the Potomac Watershed--which includes the Potomac River, Shenandoah River, and Upper Potomac River--and enforce existing federal and state laws governing the Potomac watershed and protecting it from exploitation. The President Emeritus, Ed Merrifield, was hired in 2003 and Jeff Kelble was hired as the Shenandoah Riverkeeper in 2006. In 2014, Brent Walls became the Upper Potomac Riverkeeper, adding a third formal Riverkeeper program to Potomac Riverkeeper, Inc.. in 2014, Jeff Kelble became President of the organization, leaving behind his former role as the Shenandoah Riverkeeper. In 2015, Mark Frondorf joined the organization as the new Shenandoah Riverkeeper, as well as Dean Naujoks as the new Potomac Riverkeeper. The three Riverkeeper branches call home to Potomac Riverkeeper Network, although operating within their specific regions. Potomac Riverkeeper is a member of the Waterkeeper Alliance, one of the fastest growing environmental organizations in the world. The Waterkeeper movement began on New York's Hudson River in 1966 when commercial and recreational fishermen united to save the river. The early successes of Hudson Riverkeeper spurred an explosive growth of similar grassroots programs across the globe. Mission statement Potomac Riverkeeper's mission is to stop pollution and to restore clean water in the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers and tributaries through enforcement and community engagement. Current work In addition to its dedication to monitoring and enforcement of point source and non-point source pollution, Potomac Riverkeeper currently focuses on four main issues: *Major Polluters *Agricultural Pollution *Resource Extraction *Storm Water *Sewage *Water Quality Standards Shenandoah Riverkeeper and Upper Potomac Riverkeeper In 2006, Potomac Riverkeeper, Inc. added a second Riverkeeper program for the Shenandoah River. The Shenandoah River is the largest river that flows into the Potomac River. Shenandoah Riverkeeper uses community action and enforcement to protect and restore water quality in the Shenandoah Valley for people, fish, and aquatic life. Jeff Kelble, the Shenandoah Riverkeeper, patrols the water, educates the community, and advocates for a healthier Shenandoah River. Jeff knows how an unhealthy river can hurt the local economy and the health of the local residents. In 2005, after fish kills ruined his fishing guide business, Jeff closed his 6-year old business and joined up with Potomac Riverkeeper. Shenandoah Riverkeeper's job is to investigate pollution in the Shenandoah and start a dialogue with the polluters. If the polluters do not listen, or do not stop polluting, Shenandoah Riverkeeper is ready to use the citizen suit provisions of the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and other environmental laws. In 2014, Potomac Riverkeeper, Inc. added a third Riverkeeper program for the Upper Potomac. Potomac Riverkeeper, Inc. is now made up of three active Riverkeeper programs: Potomac Riverkeeper, Upper Potomac Riverkeeper, and Shenandoah Riverkeeper. Together, the three Riverkeepers watch over almost the entire Potomac watershed, stretching through Maryland, DC, Virginia, West Virginia and southern Pennsylvania. In 2019, water analysis by the Upper Potomac Riverkeeper group found toxic substances consistent with black liquor from the kraft papermaking process, including arsenic, boron and methyl mercury, originating from the Luke Mill in Luke, Maryland.

He was a native of Pratovecchio and studied with the Accademia della Crusca in Florence, where he contributed to its first Vocabolario della lingua italiana, published in 1623, in particular adding an index of Greek words. A passion for words Monosini had one craze which consumed all his intellectual energies: that of proving the Greek origins of the Florentine idiom, which would one day develop into modern Italian. He was reacting to French writers of the period who took great pains to relate their own language directly with Ancient Greek, bypassing the inheritance of Latin and Italian and Alpine Humanism. The relationships that Monosini develops between Greek and his contemporary vernacular rather suffer from his unconditional enthusiasm, with the result that the associations proposed are often cumbersome and sometimes quite bizarre.

History The Musician series was introduced in 1979 with the MC-800 and MC-900 models, which were available in natural (NT) and \\"dark-stain\\" (DS) finishes. List price for the MC-800 was $655.00 USD for the NT finish and $665.00 USD for the DS finish. List price for the MC-900 was $775.00 USD for the NT finish and $785.00 USD for the DS finish. The MC-800 was a single-pickup design, while the MC-900 had two pickups and a three-band EQ. The 1980 price list retains the MC-800 and MC-900, in both NT and DS finishes, but adds the MC-824, MC-924, MC-940, and MC-980 (8-string), all of which were DS models. The 1981 catalog lists four models: MC-824, MC-924, MC-924L, and MC-940. All four models were DS models, as the natural (NT) finish was no longer an option. The MC-824 was the base model, the MC-924 added a three-band EQ. The MC-924L was a left-handed version of the MC-924. The MC-940 was a fretless version of the same. The 1983 catalog retains only two models, the MC-924 and MC-940, but introduces a new finish option, polar white (PW). The 1983-1984 catalog shows a reintroduction of the MC-824DS and an additional finish option, metallic black (MB), for the MC-924 and MC-940 models. The 1984 price list retains the 1983 models and introduces the MC-888, sometimes referred to as the \\"bean bass,\\" which featured a smaller body. In 1986, only two models remain. The MC-924 is renamed MC2924 and the MC-940 is renamed MC2940. Their body shape is redesigned and looks more like what would eventually become the SoundGear line. These are the only two Musician models in the 1987 price list. Features The Musician Bass featured a 34\\" scale neck-through design. The neck was 5-piece neck, constructed of three pieces of rock maple, with two strips of walnut in between them. The body was initially made from a sandwich of mahogany and ash - a mahogany core, with ash on the front and back. The mahogany core was discontinued in '82, leaving it with a solid ash body. From '79 to '81 they used Ibanez Super 4, single coil 'soapbar' pickups, which were also used in the Roadster basses of the same period. Starting in '82 they change to Ibanez Super P5 and Super J5 pickups, which were Precision and Jazz Bass style pickups in Ibanez' own covers. The MC824 model used a single J6 humbucking pickup with the Ibanez Tri-Sound switch, allowing series, parallel and single coil operation. All Musicians were passive basses, but the majority of models included an active equalizer circuit that could be switched in or out. From '79 to '81 they used a 3-way selector switch to change between the pickups. From '82 onward the two pickup models lost the switch and gained a blend control. Endorsees The various Musician models were endorsed and/or used by several high-profile musicians, including Sting of The Police,Sting can be seen playing an Ibanez Musician in the original video to \\"Message in a Bottle.\\" His image also appears in several Ibanez catalogs from the period. Adam Clayton of U2, Fleetwood Mac's John McVie, The Who's John Entwistle, Mark Egan, Dee Dee Ramone, Mike Porcaro of Toto, Victor Bailey and James Freud of Australian band The Models. Sting's fretless Musician is said to be the instrument he used most in The Police. Adam Clayton used his Musicians as his main instruments from around 1981 through to 1984. He owned an MC824DS, which he favoured, as well as a MC924DS. Commemorative model In 2009, Ibanez produced a limited run of 15 MC30TH 30th anniversary Musician basses. The instruments were supposed to be the same as the original pre 1982 models, although differed in some significant ways. The body was ash, which they'd changed to in 1982, rather than the original ash/mahogany sandwich, but the biggest difference was with the electronics. The Ibanez advertising claimed they had reproduced the original Super 4 single coil pickups and EQ-B preamp/eq. The pickups, which featured wooden covers, were actually humbuckers that sounded nothing like the original single coil models and the preamp was a completely different circuit to the advertised EQ-B. Cosmetically they looked very similar to the pre 1982 models, with the addition of very ornate inlays on the fretboard and headstock and the wooden pickup covers. Built by their best craftsmen, the construction was outstanding. With a list price of US$10,666.65 in 2009, it took a long time for all the basses to sell.

It occurred just a few months after the destructive 1930 Irpinia earthquake, which had caused over 1400 casualties in the southern part of the country. Geology The coastline in the area around Senigallia is controlled by active thrust faulting at the leading edge of the North Apennines fold and thrust belt. Movement on a blind thrust, the Senigallia Fault, has caused folding in the area around the port forming an anticline that extends about parallel to the coast. The rupture area for the 1930 earthquake is thought to have measured about along strike and down dip. Earthquake A foreshock preceded the main earthquake by a few minutes. Its loud rumble was heard by many, although the shock caused little damage. After hearing this warning noise, people fled the buildings they were in, flooding out onto the streets. Shortly after this the main shock came, at 8:10 a.m., with a magnitude of 5.9 on the Richter scale. The earthquake affected the whole central and northwestern part of the Italian peninsula, with its epicenter near the city of Senigallia. Other major cities, such as Ancona and Fano, were damaged too, as were other settlements such as Montemarciano, Mondolfo, San Costanzo and some forty other small towns. The quake was assessed at level VIII (Severe) to IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The earthquake was felt from Istria to Apulia, along the whole of Italy's Adriatic shoreline, and as far across as Naples on the opposite coast of Italy. The aftershocks which followed lasted for over a month. A small tsunami struck the harbour at Ancona, but only one moored steamship was damaged. Casualties The earthquake took only 18 lives (14 in Senigallia, 4 in Ancona), but many more were injured. Thanks to the foreshock alerting the people, casualties were quite low, but many were wounded by debris falling from the damaged buildings. Many families became refugees, and had to live in tents and makeshift shelters. The region's tourist industry experienced much trouble in the following years, despite government assistance. Whole districts of Ancona, such as Capodimonte and San Lazzaro, were abandoned; the residents left for the countryside. People from Senigallia built encampments in the town's outskirts and occupied summer camps and rail coaches. Damage Many towns reported severe damage. In San Costanzo, 25 houses collapsed, and twice as much were damaged beyond repair. 450 buildings needed restoration work, but luckily no one perished, and only one inhabitant was wounded. In Mondolfo, the damage was worse. The 15 second shock destroyed 60 houses, and 39 were severely damaged. Another 540 displayed cracks in the walls, while 20 people were injured. In Fano, the shock was much shorter (due to the different composition of the ground), about five seconds, but 86 houses suffered critical, 1197 severe and 2880 light damage, while six people required medical assistance. Marotta, Mombaroccio, Cartoceto, Saltara, Candelara, Sant'Ippolito, Sorbolongo, Urbino, Fossombrone and Sant'Andrea di Suasa all reported some damage. More severely affected were Monteporzio, Fratte Rosa, Serrungarina and Urbania. The old town of Senigallia, rich in monuments and businesses, was practically destroyed: the city lost its importance as a harbor and trade hub of the Adriatic Sea, along with its cultural heritage. The stone building decorations were mostly replaced by concrete or plaster fillings, compromising the look of the city center. The Misa River, used as a harbor channel, had to have new concrete embankments and lost its scenic attractiveness. Rebuilding worsened the damage; most repairable buildings were demolished to make way for new construction. The outcome was a decline in city population, importance and tourist appeal. The population shrank 70% over the next five decades.

His father was David Rumsey (New York), a prominent lawyer, politician and judge. He attended Williams College from 1858‚Äì61, departing for military service in his senior year. Due to his military service, the College eventually awarded him a diploma. A member of the New York State Militia, he was pressed into service immediately upon the outbreak of the Civil War. From April 19, 1861 until his discharge in October 1865, he served in four different posts: as an Adjutant-General in a recruiting office in Elmira, as an Adjutant with the New York Light Artillery (with which unit he was wounded), as an aide to General Averell (with the rank of Colonel) and in another position in West Virginia. From 1866 to 1868 Rumsey was employed as the private secretary to the United States Minister to Japan. Upon his return home in February 1868, he began the study of law in his father's office. He was admitted to the bar on December 9, 1868. During this time of his study he was also a public speaker for the Republican Party. He practiced law in partnership with his father from his admission to the latter's elevation to the Supreme Court in January 1873 and with a cousin from that time to his own elevation to the bench in 1881. Rumsey's candidacy for the Supreme Court for the Seventh District in 1880 generated considerable bitterness within the Republican Party. The elder Rumsey had reputedly cut a deal with Steuben County Judge Guy McMaster in 1873 that entailed that he, McMaster, would Succeed Rumsey Sr. Upon the later's retirement. In addition, several factions had grown up in the district Republican bar which had come to a tacit arrangement to rotate the nominations for election to judicial vacancies between them. Rumsey Jr's nomination violated both principles. The opposition press in Rochester, New York was not impressed \\"Little is known of the younger Rumsey\\" wrote the Union & Advertiser, \\"and the less of that little said, the better.\\" Rumsey captured the fall election in the heavily Republican Seventh District. Rumsey sat as a trial judge for fifteen years. In 1896, he was dispatched to Manhattan as an Associate Justice of the Appellate Division for the First Department, on which court he remained until the close of 1900. He was then appointed to the Appellate Division for the Fourth Department, on which he remained for nine months.

She ran aground on a reef in November 1872, and was subsequently wrecked in a storm. The Vessel The Mary Ward was built in 1865 for service on the Great Lakes, carrying goods and passengers between Montreal and Chicago. The ship caught fire on Lake St. Clair and had to be repaired. She soon returned to active service and continued to ply the Lakes for a few more years without incident. In 1872, the Mary Ward was purchased by businessmen in Owen Sound for a sum of around $18,000. On November 22 of that year, the ship left Sarnia for Collingwood, her new home port, with a cargo of coal, oil, and salt. At a stop-off in Tobermory, passengers were picked up from the Cumberland, whose captain had decided it was too late to brave the waters of Lake Superior as originally planned. At around 9 p.m. on November 24, for reasons that were never established, the captain of the Mary Ward erred from the correct course, and the ship ran aground on Milligan's Reef, four kilometres off Northwinds Beach in Craigleith. Since the damage was not substantial, and the waters were calm, the passengers and crew decided to remain aboard and wait for help to arrive. Shortly after midnight, however, the weather began to turn, and by morning a fierce storm was blowing. Increasingly desperate, eight men made for shore in a lifeboat, but were quickly engulfed by the waves. The direction of the wind was deterring any rescue attempts from Collingwood, but eventually three fishing boats from nearby Thornbury were able to reach the stranded vessel. The surviving 19 people were rescued, with the only further casualty being the ship's dog. The Mary Ward eventually broke up and sank. The rescuers were rewarded for their efforts by the Canadian government. On the 100th anniversary of the disaster, a plaque commemorating the Mary Ward was unveiled in Craigleith Provincial Park.

It was painted between about 1634 and 1636 as a commission for Giulio Rospigliosi (later Pope Clement IX), who according to Gian Pietro Bellori dictated its detailed iconography. The identity of the figures remains uncertain, with differing accounts.Wallace. The date is purely based on style, and Ingamells, 310 thought \\"1639-40 or perhaps slightly earlier\\". The painting is well known for giving its name to the A Dance to the Music of Time novel cycle, though this title is first seen in a Wallace Collection catalogue of 1913. Before that it was given titles referring to the Four Seasons. In the 1845 sale it was called La Danse des Saisons, ou l'Image de la vie humaine.Ingamells, 311 Description There are four figures, holding each other by the hand, dance in a circle, as Time plays a lyre on the right. The scene is set in the early morning, with Aurora, goddess of dawn, preceding the chariot of Apollo the sun-god in the sky behind; the Hours accompany him and he holds a ring representing the Zodiac. According to Bellori, the subject was devised by Rospigliosi. The four dancers represented, beginning with the one at the back seen mostly from behind: Poverty, Labour, Riches, and Pleasure or Luxury. These represent a progression in human life, completed by Pleasure or Luxury leading to Poverty again. As the Four Seasons Poverty would be Autumn, Labour Winter, and so on. The suggestion of Anthony Blunt that, unusually for a group of the seasons, Autumn/Poverty at the rear of the group was male is now generally accepted, and the museum now describe him as Bacchus. This follows the story invented by Boitet de Frauville in his Les Dionysiaques that, responding to complaints from the Seasons and Time, Jupiter gave the world Bacchus and his wine in order to compensate for the miserable living conditions mortals must endure.Ingamells, 309-310; Wallace Andr√© F√©libien, the friend and biographer of Poussin, explained the picture in the same terms, except that where Bellori identified Summer with Luxury, F√©libien said that it represented Pleasure.Ingamells, 309-310 These identifications are disputed by Malcolm Bull, at least as the original intention. He traces the iconography of the painting to the Late Greek poet Nonnus, reflected in the Hymne de l'Automme of Pierre de Ronsard. Nonnus' descriptions of the four seasons, as translated into French, are closely followed by Poussin: \\"on the left is Spring, with a garland of roses in her hair; at the back is Autumn, whose hair has been cropped by the winds but whose brow is wreathed with olive branches; Winter is next, with her bound hair and shadowed face, and at the front is Summer, dressed in white with ears of corn in the braids of her hair.\\"Bull, 258 Bacchus himself appears, in his double aspect as a young and old figure, in the herma at left.Bull, 258-259 Bull suggests that Rospigliosi, an intellectual and author with a taste for allegory, invented the other interpretation \\"during or after its completion\\",Bull, 260 while Ingamells feels that \\"Poussin was not unduly concerned with the precise identification of the figures\\".Ingamells, 310 There are several pentimenti, including the removal of a second, larger, tree on the right between Winter/Labour and Time. The painting is in generally good condition, but has been retouched in places, including over the repair of a large L-shaped tear running right through the central group.Ingamells, 307-309 Anthony Powell At the start of Anthony Powell's series of novels named after the painting, the narrator, Nicolas Jenkins, reflects on it in the first two pages of A Question of Upbringing: :These classical projections, and something from the fire, suddenly suggested Poussin's scene in which the Seasons, hand in hand and facing outward, tread in rhythm to the notes of the lyre that the winged and naked greybeard plays. The image of Time brought thoughts of mortality: of human beings, facing outward like the Seasons, moving hand in hand in intricate measure, stepping slowly, methodically sometimes a trifle awkwardly, in evolutions that take recognisable shape: or breaking into seemingly meaningless gyrations, while partners disappear only to reappear again, once more giving pattern to the spectacle: unable to control the melody, unable, perhaps, to control the steps of the dance. Provenance It passed from the Rospigliosi family to the Joseph Fesch collection in 1806, when it was taken to France for a period. It was then bought, along with several other paintings, by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford, in the great Fesch sale in Rome in 1845. It then passed to his son, Sir Richard Wallace. It was exhibited in the Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857.Ingamells, 311 Notes References *Bull, Malcolm, The Mirror of the Gods, How Renaissance Artists Rediscovered the Pagan Gods, Oxford UP, 2005, *Ingamells, John, The Wallace Collection, Catalogue of Pictures, Vol III, French before 1815, London: Wallace Collection (1989) (online via museum - PDFs under \\"Images\\" tab) * \\"Wallace\\": Wallace Live - catalogue entry Further reading * Beresford, Richard, A Dance to the Music of Time.

The LTTD process may also take advantage of the temperature gradient available at power plants, where large quantities of warm cooling water are discharged from the plant, reducing the energy input needed to create a temperature gradient. The principle of LTTD has been known for some time, originally stemming from ocean thermal energy conversion research. Some experiments were conducted in the U.S. and Japan to test low-temperature- driven desalination technology. In Japan, a spray flash evaporation system was developed by Saga University.Haruo Uehara and Tsutomu Nakaoka Development and Prospective of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion and Spray Flash Evaporator Desalination In the U.S. Hawaiian Islands, the National Energy Laboratory tested an open-cycle OTEC plant with fresh water and power production using a temperature of 20 ¬∞C between surface water and water at a depth of around 500 m.

Regjeringskvartalet (the Government Quarter) is a collection of buildings located in the centre of Norway's capital city Oslo, housing several offices for the Norwegian Government. The complex is situated approximately 300m northeast of the Parliament Building, and consists of nine buildings with about 1,960,000 sq f (182,000 m¬≤) of office space for approximately 4,430 people.Five suggestions for a new government complex, page 21. Renewal-, administration- and church- department, 27 June 2013 (visited 27 June 2013) History The current site was originally occupied by a district, named Empirekvartalet for its numerous neoclassical buildings, constructed in Empire style. As early as 1885, plans existed for constructing a governmental district in central Oslo. After numerous attempts were made to finalise plans, the Empirekvartalet was finally razed in the early 1950s. The destruction of the district was widely opposed by many members of the citizenry and conservator authorities. Select wooden buildings were deconstructed and placed in storage and were later re-assembled at other sites in the city. The new Regjeringskvartalet was subsequently established and constructed in a contemporary modernist style. On 22 July 2011, Regjeringskvartalet was the site of a car bombing in connection with the 2011 Norway attacks. Eight people were killed and over 200 others injured, and several buildings were heavily damaged. Following the damage, the decision was taken by the government to demolish and reconstruct the Regjeringskvartalet to meet updated standards for security, working space and environmental regulations. Overview Regjeringskvartalet consists of the following buildings: Map of Regjeringskvartalet. *Akersgata 40 (G-blokken - \\"The G-Building\\") from 1905, the first phase of development from the original plan; now the Ministry of Finance. *Akersgata 42 (Regjeringsbygget \\\\- \\"The Cabinet Building\\" a.k.a. h√∏yblokken - \\"the highrise\\") from 1958, designed by Erling Viksj√∏ in the modernist style; until 22 July 2011 the Office of the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Justice and the Police. *Akersgata 44 (Y-blokken - \\"The Y-Building\\"), from 1969, another modernist building by Erling Viksj√∏; until 22 July 2011 the Ministry of Education and Research. *Akersgata 59 (R5)‚Äîdepartementsg√•rden from 1996 designed by Torstein Ramberg; houses the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, the Ministry of Government Administration, Reform and Church Affairs, the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development, and the Ministry of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion. *Einar Gerhardsens plass 1 (R4); housed the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy and the Ministry of Trade and Industry. *Einar Gerhardsens plass 3 and M√∏llergata 19 (S-block); housed the Ministry of Health and Care Services and the Ministry of Labour. *The Government Administration Services, centred in M√∏llergata 19, provides administrative services to other Government departments.

He is best known for his time in Juggalo Championship Wrestling (JCW). He primarily wrestled for several Midwest independent promotions, including JCW. Career Blue Collar Wrestling Alliance (2007‚Äì2011) Lewis first became involved in the wrestling business in 2007. He started wrestling for the Blue Collar Wrestling Alliance out of Detroit, MI. At this point he started working with Mathew Priest in a faction called Ascendency. Together they teamed up and called themselves Super Team. The two learned from one another with Priest in the mentor role initially. Priest and Martel would later both be assistant trainers to Breyer Wellington in his wrestling school. After a couple months in the business, Lewis won his first championship, the BCWA Midwest Championship which he later renamed the National Championship. From there he was able to win the companies Heavyweight Championship a record 7 times over the next 4 years. His last match with the company took place on July 24, 2011 where he was defeated in a Fatal Fourway defending the Heavyweight Championship against Cyrus Parker, The Darkstar Logan, and Tony Banks. Over the 4 years and near 200 shows with the company he became a decorated wrestler by having Match of the Year, Feud of the Year, and Wrestler of the Year awards. He worked several other promotions throughout Michigan during this time as well, but his primary home was in BCWA.  Main-Event Championship Wrestling (2010-Present)  Lewis took his talents to MCW in Alliance, OH in the summer of 2010. After several months of hard work he caught the eye of Minka Murder who recruited him to team with Big Hurt in the inaugural MCW Tag Team Championship Tournament. Murder Inc, lost in the semifinals of the tournament but have become quite the force in MCW. As Murder Inc, has dominated MCW and started a rivalry with former member Christian Vaughn. Martel has challenged Tommy Dreamer and Carlito during the fall months of 2011. In March 2012, Martel challenged Matt Hardy at the MCW XII Anniversary show.  Juggalo Championship Wrestling (2011-Present)  In March 2011, Corporal Robinson, Violent J, and 2 Tuff Tony scouted Lewis at a BCWA show. They recruited and signed him to be a part of the growing JCW roster. He made his debut on March 12, against Sal The Man of 1000 Gimmicks at Hardcore Hell. Two weeks later he found a partner to take on JCW Tag Team Champions Necro Butcher and Mad Man Pondo. Martel and his partner Trainwreck took their talent to Milwaukee coming up short against the Ring Rydas at Hatchet Attacks. After these events Martel was becoming upset at the antics he saw in the company. Martel called himself a \\"serious professional\\" and the \\"Superstar\\" would become upset with foul language and graphic obscenities. He was looking to clean up JCW's act for iPPV's and bring a PG feel to the company. Eventually, Martel became a mainstay in the company wrestling Sal The Man of 1000 Gimmicks at the annual Gathering of the Juggalos. Martel wrestled his final match as a professional wrestler in February 2013. He was defeated by former WWE Intercontinental Champion The Honky Tonk Man in a Guitar Match.

It is popular in the American fiddle canon, in which it is touted as \\"an American classic\\" but traces its origin to Scottish fiddling traditions. It has been played in Scotland for over 200 years, and Robert Burns used it for the first song of his cantata 'The Jolly Beggars'. According to documentation at the United States Library of Congress, it is \\"one of the oldest and most widely distributed tunes\\" and is rated in the top ten most-played old time fiddle tunes. According to the Illinois Humanities Center, the tune dates as early as the 1760s. In spite of its upbeat tempo and catchy melody, the term \\"soldier's joy\\" has a much darker meaning than is portrayed by the tune. This term eventually came to refer to the combination of whiskey, beer, and morphine used by Civil War soldiers.

Robert Burns wrote lyrics for the tune in which a dismembered, homeless veteran sarcastically recounts his delight with battle. Civil War era and post-bellum cultural references According to the Illinois Humanities Council (IHC), the tune came to represent substance abuse during the Civil War.

It is often regarded as the realm of the sea god Manann√°n Mac Lir and identified with either the Isle of Man or the Isle of Arran. According to the medieval Irish poem Baile Suthain Sith Eamhna, the god Lug Lamfada was reared in Emain Ablach. In another poem from the 14th century, Emain Ablach is described as being filled with swans and yews.  Etymology  \\"Emain/Emne\\" is of uncertain etymology, though it may be compared with the place name Emain Macha in Ireland, recorded as \\"Isamnion\\" in Ptolemy's 2nd-century AD Geography, which Celticist Heinrich Wagner would translate as \\"what is moving by itself rapidly, the stream\\", derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *eis- \\"to move rapidly\\".Wagner, p. 13. \\"Ablach\\" means \\"of the apples/fruits\\" in Old Irish.  Influence  In medieval Arthurian literature, Geoffrey of Monmouth's island paradise Insula Avallonis (Avalon), where the sword Caliburnus (Excalibur) was forged, and where King Arthur was taken to be healed by the sorceress Morgen and her eight sisters after the Battle of Camlann, could have been influenced by Irish legends of Emain Ablach. The medieval Welsh equivalent of Avalon, Ynys Afallach (\\"Isle of Afallach\\"), may also be related to - if not derived from - Emain Ablach.

Jamal wrote From the Dead Level, a memoir of his life and memories of Malcolm X. Jamal was romantically involved with several high-profile women, notably Jean Seberg, Diana Athill, and Gale Benson. Early life Donaldson was born in Roxbury, Boston, in 1931. His father was an alcoholic, and his mother abandoned him when he was 6. Donaldson started regularly drinking alcohol when he was aged 10 and became a heroin user at 14. In his early 20s he spent four years in prison. Donaldson's violent temper led to his committal to a mental asylum, after two attempted murders. He later underwent a conversion to the teachings of the Nation of Islam and renamed himself Hakim Jamal. He became a spokesman for the movement and contributed articles to various newspapers promoting Black Power. After Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam, Jamal supported his decision and was outspoken in his criticism of Elijah Muhammad. Founding US After Malcolm X's death, Jamal joined with Maulana Karenga and others to found \\"US\\", an organization to promote African-American cultural unity. He had already circulated a self-produced magazine entitled \\"US\\", a pun on the phrase \\"us and them\\" and the accepted abbreviation of \\"United States\\". This promoted the idea of black cultural unity as a distinct national identity. Jamal and Karenga published a magazine Message to the Grassroot in 1966, in which Karenga was listed as chairman and Jamal as founder of the new group. Jamal argued that the ideas of Malcolm X should be the main ideological model for the group. However, Jamal's views increasingly differed from Karenga's. Jamal continued to emphasise his cousin's radical politics, while Karenga wished to root black Americans in African culture. Jamal saw no point in projects such as teaching Swahili and promoting traditional African rituals. He left \\"US\\" to establish the Malcolm X Foundation, based in Compton, California. Relationships Though married to fellow-activist Dorothy Jamal, Jamal had several significant affairs. He had a brief relationship with actress Jean Seberg. His wife phoned Seberg's father to try to bring an end to the affair.Janet Maslin, \\"Star and Victim\\", The New York Times, July 12, 1981. Jamal moved to London during the late 1960s where he met Gale Benson, daughter of the British MP Leonard Plugge. The writer V. S. Naipaul described Benson as Jamal's \\"white-woman slave.\\" Jamal and Benson traveled in America seeking funds for a project to create a Montessori school for black children. They later joined West Indian Black Power leader Michael X in his commune in Trinidad, where Jamal wrote articles supporting the commune.  Gale Benson murder Benson traveled to America to raise funds, but was unsuccessful. Shortly after her return to Trinidad in 1972, she was murdered by Michael X and his associates. Jamal was not a suspect, but it was alleged that Michael X had ordered her death because she was causing \\"mental strain\\" to Jamal. In 1971, Jamal wrote his autobiography, From the Dead Level: Malcolm X and Me. It was published in the UK by Andr√© Deutsch and at this time Jamal became involved in a relationship with his London editor, Diana Athill. She later wrote about their romance in her memoir Make Believe, recording his increasing mental instability and his repeated assertions that he was God. Jamal eventually returned to his wife and moved back to Boston, where he revived his role as director of the Malcolm X Foundation. Death On May 1, 1973, Jamal was killed when four men burst into his apartment in Boston and shot him repeatedly. Police attributed the crime to a factional dispute, linked to Jamal's attacks on Elijah Muhammad. It was blamed on a group known as De Mau Mau. Five members of the group were convicted of involvement in the murder. Jamal is a character in the 2008 film The Bank Job, in which he is played by Colin Salmon. In the Jean Seberg biopic Seberg from 2019 he is played by Anthony Mackie. Notes Further reading  External links *\\"Hakim Jamal (centre), Portobello Road\\", 1971 photograph by Charlie Phillips.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Trysull, the archdeaconry of Walsall, and the diocese of Lichfield. Its benefice is united with that of St Anne, Lower Penn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The presence of the base and stem of an Anglo-Saxon churchyard cross, and the circular shape of the churchyard, show that a church was present on the site before the Norman conquest. The next church on the site was built by Sir Hugh de Bushbury in 1200 and was dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. It is not known when the dedication was changed to Saint Bartholomew. The earliest fabric in the present church is part of the north arcade dating from the 14th century. The west part of the arcade and the tower are from the 15th century. The tower was encased in brick in 1765. An annexe was added to the northwest of the church in 1826, and the south aisle was built by W. Evans in 1845. This aisle was too short for the congregation to see the altar, and further alterations were made in 1871‚Äì72 by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin. At this time the incumbent of the church was Revd Francis Henry Paley, the younger brother of E. G. Paley. The alterations made at this time consisted of adding a bay to the east end of the south aisle, extending the nave, and rebuilding the chancel. The organ loft was added in 1901 and a vestry in 1958. The interior of the church was re- ordered in the 1970s, and in 2000 a new wing with modern facilities was added to the north of the church. Architecture Exterior The church is constructed in ashlar stone and brick, with tiled roofs. The plan consists of a five-bay nave, north and south aisles, an annexe to the west of the north aisle, a three-bay chancel with a vestry to the north and a chapel to the south, and a west tower. The brick-encased tower is in four stages standing on an ashlar plinth, and has quoins at the corners. In the bottom stage is a west doorway, above which is an oval panel, and there is a roundel on the south side. The second stage contains a large west window with a pointed arch. In the third stage is a clock face on the west side above an inscribed panel; on the north and south sides are quatrefoils. The top stage has louvred bell openings. The tower is surmounted by a cornice, an embattled parapet, and pinnacles. The wall of the north aisle contains 19th-century lancet windows, and the head of a blocked round-headed window. Pevsner suggests that this may be Norman. The south aisle has a two-light window with Decorated tracery, and lancets in the south wall. The chancel has a five-light east window and a two- light north window; the chapel has a three-light east window and a two-light south window. The vestry is gabled and has a two-light window. The northwest annexe has a west window above which is an oval panel inscribed with the date 1826. Interior The nave arcades are carried on octagonal piers. At the west end of the church is a gallery that dates from 1765. The chancel is floored with encaustic tiles, whose design is copied from the original medieval tiles. The alabaster reredos has arcades containing mosaics. The wooden pulpit stands on an ashlar base. The octagonal font dates from the 15th century. The wall memorials include one dated 1802 by John Flaxman. The two- manual organ was built in 1974 by Nicholson, which replaced an earlier organ of 1872 by J. W. Walker and Sons. There is a ring of eight bells, all cast in 1929 by Gillett & Johnston. External features Base of a Saxon Cross at St Bartholomew's Church, Penn at the time owned by Lady Godiva In the churchyard are the remains of two ancient crosses. One of these, to the south of the church, is known as Lady Godiva's cross. It was rediscovered in 1912 when the other cross, dating from the medieval period, was being restored; the medieval cross was found to be standing on an Anglo-Saxon cross base. The medieval cross has been moved to a different position to the west of the church. It is considered that Lady Godiva's cross was built by Leofric, Earl of Mercia, the husband of Lady Godiva, when he was lord of the manor. All that remains of it consists of three round steps and part of a round shaft. A plaque on the wall of the church states that it was used by the itinerant priests of Dudley Priory. It is designated as a Grade II listed building and a scheduled monument. The medieval cross is also listed at Grade II and is a scheduled monument. It is constructed in sandstone, and consists of three steps, a socket stone, and a shaft. The carved head was added in the 20th century. There are four further items associated with the church that are listed at Grade II. Against the west wall of the annexe is a carved headstone dated 1700. Another headstone dated 1711 is to the southeast of the church. The churchyard walls and the gate piers to the west of the church, and those to the south and southwest of the church, are listed separately at Grade II.

The statue of a woman on top of the Capitol dome is named \\"Wisconsin,\\" though it is often misidentified as \\"Forward\\" (another statue depicting a woman, a replica of which was on the Capitol grounds at the top of State Street). Perhaps that‚Äôs because, according to the Wisconsin Historical Society, the statue was ‚Äúplaced on the Capitol dome as a symbol of the state‚Äôs motto, ‚ÄòForward‚Äô‚Äù and to represent ‚Äúthe spirit of Wisconsin progress.‚Äù The statue was sculpted by Daniel Chester French, who also created the Abraham Lincoln statue for the Lincoln Memorial. \\"Wisconsin\\" looks toward Lake Monona with her right hand outstretched, while her left hand cradles a globe with an eagle perched on it. On top of her helmet are clusters of grapes and the state animal, the badger. French sculpted the 15 foot, five inch, more than three- ton statue in 1914 for a cost of $20,325. The statue is 23 1/2 caret gold- gilded bronze. Description This work, Wisconsin, consists of an allegorical figure reminiscent of Athena, dressed in Greek garb, her right arm outstretched to symbolize the state motto, \\"Forward\\", and wearing a helmet topped by a badger, the Wisconsin state animal.

Shatner's subjects discuss their lives and careers before, during, and after their tenure with Star Trek. They explore the pressures, stigmas, and sacrifices that accompanied their roles and their larger careers. The film makes use of conversations, personal observations, interviews, and archival footage. Cast Main * William Shatner, who portrayed James T. Kirk in Star Trek: The Original Series, and conducts the interviews that make up The Captains * Scott Bakula, who portrayed Jonathan Archer in Star Trek: Enterprise * Avery Brooks, who portrayed Benjamin Sisko in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine * Kate Mulgrew, who portrayed Kathryn Janeway in Star Trek: Voyager * Chris Pine, who portrays an alternate timeline version of James T.

Shatner encountered him by chance and did not recognize him. Huxley is uncredited. * Garrett Wang, who portrayed Harry Kim in Star Trek: Voyager Synopsis The film consists of a series of interviews conducted by William Shatner, who portrayed Captain James T. Kirk in the original Star Trek with the various other actors who have portrayed Star Trek Captains: Sir Patrick Stewart, Avery Brooks, Kate Mulgrew, Scott Bakula, and Chris Pine. The Captains delves into each actor's life and career leading up to their film or television performances. The film devotes attention to Shatner's own acting roots, tracking his journey from his beginnings at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival and CBC Radio and CBC Television, to headlining Broadway shows, and eventually getting his break in Hollywood at the helm of Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek series. Shatner's travels take him from Los Angeles to Oxfordshire, England; to Toronto and Stratford, Ontario; Las Vegas, New York City, and Princeton, New Jersey. While in Stratford, Shatner sits down with his friend Christopher Plummer, who was instrumental in Shatner's young career, and who would eventually play the role of bloodthirsty Klingon General Chang in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. The documentary also chronicles Shatner's own six-decade career and reveals the embarrassment he felt over his role within the Star Trek franchise. During the process of the film, with help from the other Captains, Shatner overcomes his disdain and learns to embrace his best known character, Captain James T. Kirk. Production The Captains is produced by Le Big Boss Productions in association with Movie Central, a Corus Entertainment Company, The Movie Network, an Astral Media Network; Les Chaines Tele Astral - a division of Astral Broadcasting Group Inc. and Epix-HD, and in association with Ballinran Entertainment, 455 Films and Love Lake Productions with the participation of the Canada Media Fund, the Canadian Film or Video Production Tax Credit, and the Ontario Media Development Corporation Film and Television Tax Credit. Reception On July 21, 2011, Mike Hale of the New York Times wrote, \\"The Captains turns out to be largely about William Shatner. That's not a criticism. Mr. Shatner's genial, relaxed self-absorption is a large part of his charm, along with his odd cadences and his unparalleled knack for blurring the line between pomposity and sincerity. He has a kind of reverse Midas effect: everything he touches should turn creepy, but somehow it doesn't.\\" Hale goes on to say in his review that the film is, \\"pretty tolerable as vanity projects go. And it should be catnip for Trekkers and Trekkies\\". TrekMovie.com's reviewer Anthony Pascale had mixed feelings claiming, \\"The Captains is overly long, a bit self-indulgent, and possibly overly ambitious. The direction and editing are trying a bit too hard with Shatner not really letting the core content of his interviews stand out.\\" Pascale concludes with saying that The Captains \\"is still a must-watch for any Trekkie. You will learn, you will laugh, and you may even cry watching The Captains. Sure there is an element of being an ego-trip for the director, but what else would you expect from The Shatner. It is still a delight to spend almost two hours with these six outstanding actors who have entertained us for decades.\\" Popular culture/Science fiction website UGO Networks reviewer Jordan Hoffman gave the film a B-rating declaring, if you like this film, \\"You recognize that William Shatner may be a fool, but he's our fool.\\" Gregory Weinkauff of The Huffington Post wrote of The Captains that the production was \\"elegant, enlightening, expansive, and, by turns, hilarious and moving.\\" See also * William Shatner's Gonzo Ballet References External links  Category:2011 films Category:2011 documentary films Category:Canadian films Category:Documentary films about actors Category:Documentary films about films Category:Canadian documentary television films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by William Shatner Category:Documentary films about Star Trek ","title":"The Captains (film)"},{"id":"32498249","text":"The Castleton Baronetcy, of St Edmundsbury in the County of Suffolk, was a title in the Baronetage of England.

It was established as of October 1, 2013 from the former 78th Homeland Response Force. It is formally designated the \\"'Region IV HRF / 201st RSG\\"'. On November 1, 2010, the 201st RSG became the 201st Homeland Response Force. On October 1, 2013, it took its current designation. Once home-stationed in Decatur, it has, since Jan. 11, 2011, occupied the former headquarters of Naval Air Station Atlanta at what has become the Clay National Guard Center since late September 2009. As 2011 progressed, many of the units that make up the Region IV HRF have been relocated from their present armories to facilities at Clay.  Mission  The Region IV HRF / 201st RSG mission is to man, train and equip a homeland response force that can provide a response capability to assist civil authorities in saving lives and mitigating suffering in response to a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives incident. At the same time, the 201st must provide trained and ready troops to support overseas contingency operations. The HRFs are designed to foster a dialogue between regional first responders and other agencies. The Region IV HRF plays an important role at the regional level in terms of helping develop and build regional plans and in working with southeastern emergency managers to build a functioning and cohesive connective tissue at the regional level. One of the important concerns the HRF construction seeks to alleviate is the need to respond to multiple, simultaneous disasters. Through these HRFs, the Georgia Department of Defense has the federal capacity to command and control response to multiple disasters or emergencies throughout the nation, simultaneously.  Deployments  Colonel Alexander McLemore, 201st Regional Support Group brigade commander, talks to Atlanta Police Department SWAT during the George Floyd protests of 2020 Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, every unit assigned to the Region IV HRF has mobilized and deployed in support of Overseas Contingency Operations, serving in Iraq, Afghanistan and various military bases across the United States. On February 8, 2009, The 110th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion prepared to deploy to Iraq for a year-long mission. While there, the 110th acted as higher headquarters for active, Guard and Reserve units, while also upgrading and repairing the equipment destined for return stateside as part of the draw-down of forces from Iraq. In Spring 2011, the 201st Regional Support Group-Agriculture Development Team 1 deployed to Southeastern Afghanistan. It is the first of three such Georgia Teams that are part of the National Guard Program to help the Afghans improve their farming and agribusiness techniques, thereby enhancing the country's agricultural economy and steering Afghan farmers away from growing poppy, which is used for making heroin. In July of 2018, the Headquarters / Headquarters Company (HHC) of the 201st RSG deployed to Iraq for a 9 month deployment. The mission was to conduct Base Operations in three separate locations in Iraq. Each location had a Base Operational Support - Integrator (BOS-I) staff that managed daily base operations and security. In addition to the BOS-I mission, the Brigade Commander and the Senior Enlisted Advisor of the 201st RSG deployed to Iraq to serve as the base command team for Al Asad Air Base.  Units  *201st Regional Support Group, Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Marietta. *170th Military Police Battalion, Decatur, Georgia. *190th Military Police Company, Kennesaw, Georgia (Deactivated - September 20th, 2019) *178th Military Police Company, Monroe, Georgia *179th Military Police Company, Savannah, Georgia * 4th Civil Support Team, Marietta. *Joint Task Force 265th CHEM BN. *116th Medical Group ANG, Robins AFB, Georgia *248th Medical Company, Marietta, Georgia *165th Services Squadron ANG, Savannah, Georgia *138th Chemical Company, Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Marietta. *810th Engineer Company, Swainsboro, Georgia *202nd Explosive Ordnance Detachment, Marietta. *870th Engineer Detachment, Decatur, Georgia. *1177th Transportation Company, LaGrange, Georgia *283rd Combat Communication Squadron, Marietta  Other HRF locations  There are ten HRFs in the National Guard throughout the nation, one per FEMA region. This allows closer and more familiar correspondence with regional and civilian responders. As a result, the reaction time to disasters will be much faster due to geographical locations.

According to this view, Wimble Toot was probably built by the Norman lord Robert of Mortain to protect the River Cary and the nearby settlement of Ilchester.Prior, pp. 88, 93.

The group was described by Karen J. Greenberg, executive director of the Center on Law and Security at New York University School of Law as a Kurdistan-based affiliate of Al-Qaeda led by Abu Suleiman al-Nasser. Prior to 2011 Norway attacks The Middle East Observatory reported on 3 May 2011 that the organisation \\"sent an urgent message on jihadist forums, to all jihadists around the globe to mobilize and prepare to wage jihad operations against the Zionist-crusader alliance\\" after the death of Osama bin Laden. The individual who reportedly made this statement is Abu Suleiman al-Naser. Another mention of the group includes a report published by the European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center (ESISC) in April 2011, in which it is noted that in early December 2010, \\"a previously unknown terrorist group, Ansar Al- Jihad Al-Alami, published a statement on several Jihadist website, in which it threatened to carry out attacks against Western interests in Morocco during the Christmas holidays.\\" 2011 Norway attacks On 22 July, in the hours following the 2011 Norway attacks, the group was said by Will McCants to have claimed responsibility for the attacks by means of a statement to the internet forum Shmukh that he says was eventually removed. The New York Times reported that the group claimed responsibility for the attacks, citing a statement identified by a terrorism analyst that said they were a response to the presence of Norwegian forces in Afghanistan and \\"unspecified insults to the Prophet Muhammad.\\" Giving its source as a report on Norway TV, The Wall Street Journal noted the statement from Ansar al-Jihad al-Alami said, \\"This is just the beginning of what will come\\"; while also noting that, \\"It's unclear that the group has taken responsibility.\\" The Times said that Norwegian television reports indicated that Ansar al-Jihad al-Alami had denied involvement in the attacks. On the same day of the attacks, police arrested and identified Anders Behring Breivik, a Norwegian with extreme-right views, as the shooter in Ut√∏ya and responsible for the Oslo bombings, and he was subsequently charged with terrorism. In his writings, Breivik suggests far-right militants should adopt Al-Qadea's methods, learn from their success, and avoid their mistakes, and described Al-Qaeda as the \\"most successful revolutionary force in the world\\" and praised their \\"cult of martyrdom\\". According to his defender Geir Lippestad, Breivik has acknowledged that he is responsible for both the bomb and the shooting during interrogation. After his arrest Breivik claimed he acted with accomplices, but later changed his statements to him acting alone, giving several unrealistic demands for him to tell about accomplices. Will McCants said someone identifying as Abu Sulayman al-Nasir who had posted the first claim of responsibility later made a further statement to Shmukh retracting it, stating that the attacker \\"must surely be known to all\\".

Initial formation  The army was formed first in June 1941 from the Arkhangelsk Military District. It included the 30th and 33rd Rifle Corps, 69th Motorised Division, artillery and several other units. The Army Commander was Lieutenant General Vladimir Kachalov (previously commander of the Arkhangelsk Military District). Members of the army's Military Council were Brigade Commissioner Vasily T. Kolesnikov, and Army Chief of Staff Major General Pavel G. Egorov. On 14 July 1941, the order creating the Reserve Front gave the 28th Army's composition as nine divisions, one gun, one howitzer, and four corps artillery regiments, and four anti-tank artillery regiments.STAVKA Order 003334, Collection of Combat Documents of the Great Patriotic War, ('SBDVOV'), Moscow, Voenizdat, 1958(?), Issue 37, p.13, cited in David Glantz, Stumbling Colossus, p.215 It participated in the Battle of Smolensk. The army was encircled in the Smolensk Pocket and destroyed. Army headquarters was disbanded on 10 August. Subordinate units that broke out were used to form the Reserve Front, along with units from other armies. General Kachalov was killed by artillery fire on 4 August 1941 during the breakout from the encirclement. He was buried in the village of Stodolische, Pochinkovsky District, Smolensk Oblast.Cooperative database ¬´Memorial¬ª , via Russian wikipedia, Ruwiki accessed August 2014. Lacking accurate information regarding his death, Stalin allowed him to be named as a traitor and sentenced to death in absentia in accordance with Order ‚Ññ 270. Only on 23 December 1953, well after the war ended, did the Supreme Court overturn the order. Second and third formations The army was subsequently reformed again in November 1941 and September 1942. The third formation began on 9 September, from forces assigned to the Stalingrad Military District and Southeastern Front, and was tasked with defending the port city of Astrakhan on the Caspian Sea's northern coast, as well as the lower reaches of the Volga. The army was under the command of Lt. Gen. Vasyl Herasymenko, with Corps Commissar A.N. Melnikov and chief of staff Mjr. Gen. S.M. Rogachevsky making up the rest of the army's Military Council. On its formation it was under the direct command of the STAVKA, but on 30 September it was subordinated to Stalingrad Front. On 19 November, just before Operation Uranus began south of Stalingrad, the army was comprised as follows: * 34th Guards Rifle Division * 248th Rifle Division * 52nd, 152nd and 159th Rifle Brigades * 78th and 116th Fortified Regions * A separate cavalry regiment (or battalion) * 6th Guards Tank Brigade * 565th Separate Tank Battalion * 35th Separate Armored Car Battalion * 30th, 33rd and 46th Separate Armored Train Battalions As of 19 November, the army's ration strength was 64,265 men, with 47,891 men assigned to its combat forces. It fielded 1,196 guns and mortars and 80 tanks (10 heavy, 26 medium and 44 light).David M.

From 1945 to 1947, the number of rifle units were reduced, and their qualitative composition increased. In September 1954, the 12th Guards Mozyrskaya Mechanised Division and the 50th Guards Stalino Rifle Division, part of the troops of the 128th Gumbinnenskogo Rifle Corps, were used to form the test units utilised at Totskoye during the test of a 40-kiloton nuclear bomb. In 1957, rifle corps headquarters were abolished, rifle divisions reorganized into motor rifle, and mechanized divisions into tank divisions: *8th Mechanized Division ‚Äì 28th Oleksandriia Red Banner Order of Kutuzov Tank Division (Slonim); *12th Guards Mechanized Division ‚Äì the 33rd ( became the 15th in 1965) Guards Mozyr Red Banner Order of Suvorov Tank Division (Brest). In August 1968, the 15th Guards Tank and 30th (up to 1965 ‚Äì 55th) Guards Motor Rifle Division of the 28th Army were sent to Czechoslovakia to participate in Operation Danube, where they remained as part of the Central Group of Forces. To replace these divisions, the 76th Tank Division was created at Brest and the 84th Motor Rifle Division at Grodno as mobilization divisions. On 15 January 1974, the army was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. The 6th Guards Kiev-Berlin Tank Division transferred to Grodno in March 1980 from East Germany. To make room for the 6th Division, the 84th Motor Rifle Division was moved to the 7th Tank Army. During the 1980s, the army was composed of the 6th Guards, 28th and 76th Tank Divisions and the 50th Guards Motor Rifle Division. During the late 1980s, the 28th was disbanded and became the 6314th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base and the 76th Tank Division reorganized as the 5356th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base. On the dissolution of the Soviet Union the 28th Army, headquartered at Grodno, included the 6th Guards Tank Division (Grodno), 6314th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base (Slonim), 50th Guards Motor Rifle Division (Brest), and the 5356th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base, also at Brest. In 1993 the army was disbanded by being redesignated the 28th Army Corps. The corps was redesignated the Western Operational Command in 2001.

This notion can be formalized as follows. Let G=(E,V) be an undirected graph and let S=(E_S,V_S) be a subgraph of G . Then the density of S is defined to be d(S) = {|E_S|\\\\over|V_S|} . The densest subgraph problem is that of finding a subgraph of maximum density. In 1984, Andrew V. Goldberg developed a polynomial time algorithm to find the maximum density subgraph using a max flow technique. Densest subgraph There are many variations on the densest subgraph problem. One of them is the densest k subgraph problem, where the objective is to find the maximum density subgraph on exactly k vertices. This problem generalizes the clique problem and is thus NP-hard in general graphs. There exists a polynomial algorithm approximating the densest k subgraph within a ratio of n^{1/4 + \\\\epsilon} for every \\\\epsilon > 0,. while it does not admit an n^{1/{\\\\text{polyloglog } n}}-approximation in polynomial time unless the exponential time hypothesis is false.. Under a weaker assumption that NP subseteq \\\\bigcap_{\\\\epsilon > 0} BPTIME(2^{n^\\\\epsilon}), no PTAS exists for the problem.. The problem remains NP-hard in bipartite graphs and chordal graphs but is polynomial for trees and split graphs.. It is open whether the problem is NP-hard or polynomial in (proper) interval graphs and planar graphs; however, a variation of the problem in which the subgraph is required to be connected is NP-hard in planar graphs.. Densest at most subgraph The objective of the densest at most k problem is to find the maximum density subgraph on at most k vertices. Anderson and Chellapilla showed that if there exists an \\\\alpha approximation for this problem then that will lead to an \\\\Theta(\\\\alpha ^2) approximation for the densest k subgraph problem. Densest at least subgraph The densest at least k problem is defined similarly to the densest at most k subgraph problem. The problem is NP-complete, but admits 2-approximation in polynomial time. Moreover, there is some evidence that this approximation algorithm is essentially the best possible: assuming the Small Set Expansion Hypothesis (a computational complexity assumption closely related to the Unique Games Conjecture), then it is NP-hard to approximate the problem to within (2 - \\\\epsilon) factor for every constant \\\\epsilon > 0. -clique densest subgraph Charalampos Tsourakakis introduced the k-clique densest subgraph problem. This variation of the densest subgraph problem aims to maximize the average number of induced k cliques d_{k}(S) = {|C_k(S)|\\\\over|V_S|} , where C_k(S) is the set of k-cliques induced by S. Notice that the densest subgraph problem is obtained as a special case for k=2. This generalization provides an empirically successful poly-time approach for extracting large near-cliques from large-scale real-world networks. Locally top- densest subgraph Qin et al. introduced the problem of top-k locally densest subgraphs discovery in a graph, each of which achieves the highest density in its local region in the graph: it is neither contained in any supergraph with the same or larger density, nor it contains subgraphs with density being loosely connected with the rest of the local densest subgraph. Note that the densest subgraph problem is obtained as a special case for k=1. The set of locally densest subgraphs in a graph can be computed in polynomial time.

Its goal is to reduce pain, anxiety, loneliness and fear when children are hospitalized or diagnosed with a debilitating medical condition. Pediatric massage therapy takes into consideration each child's individual physical development, cognitive development and health care needs. Evidence Infant massage Infant massage is a type of complementary and alternative treatment that uses massage therapy for human infants. This therapy has been practiced globally, and has been increasingly used in Western countries as a treatment for infants, though the scientific evidence supporting its use is limited. Research into the effectiveness of massage therapy on full term infants has found some tentative evidence for some benefits such as gross motor skills, fine motor skills and psychomotor development, though the evidence is not strong enough to recommend universally, and more research is needed. Research in pre-term infants and low birth weight infants have found weak evidence that massage might improve weight gain, but these results are based on possibly biased studies and therefore no recommendation can be made for universal use.

The Touch Research Institute at the University of Miami School of Medicine is a primary medical research provider for massage and touch therapy, including pediatric massage and infant massage. Pediatric massage also can help manage chronic conditions such as asthma by providing relaxation and reducing muscle tone in the chest, back and neck, nausea, constipation and muscle aches (myalgia). Immediately after receiving massage, children with mild to moderate juvenile rheumatoid arthritis notice decreased anxiety and stress hormone (cortisol) levels. For young patients with autism or ADHD, pediatric massage has been found to reduce their aversion to touch, while increasing their ability to focus. Pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis report feeling less anxious, and their ability to breathe and pulmonary functions improved. Pediatric massage was also found to have benefit in relieving post-traumatic stress. Limitations in research Like many other complementary and alternative medicine modalities, many research studies reporting benefit from pediatric massage have been small in scale and vulnerable to bias. Comprehensive medical reviews of the existing pediatric massage research reinforce the benefits, but ask for larger-scale, scientifically rigorous studies. Physicians are recommended to educate themselves and their patients about the empirically validated benefits and precautions associated with pediatric massage.Beider S, Mahrer NE, Gold JI. \\"Pediatric massage therapy: an overview for clinicians\\" Pediatr Clin North Am. 2007 Dec;54(6):1025-41; xii-xiii.

Eastern Orthodoxy, or more specifically Eastern Orthodox Christianity, is mostly practiced within Estonia's Russian ethnic minority and minority within native population. According to the 2000 Estonian census, 72.9% of those who identified as Orthodox Christians were of Russian descent. Today, there are two branches of the Eastern Orthodox Church operating in Estonia: the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church, an autonomous church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and the Estonian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate, a semi-autonomous church of the Russian Orthodox Church. History Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Tallinn, built at the end of the 19th century. Orthodoxy was most likely first introduced in the 10th through 12th centuries by missionaries from Novgorod and Pskov active among the Estonians in the southeast regions of the area close to Pskov. The first mention of an Orthodox congregation in Estonia dates from 1030.Toom, Tarmo. \\"Estonia, Orthodox Church in\\", The Encyclopedia of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, p.226-8, Wiley-Blackwell Publishing, 2011. Around 600 AD on the east side of Toome Hill (Toomem√§gi) the Estonians established the town Tarbatu (modern Tartu). In 1030, the Kievan prince, Yaroslav the Wise, raided Tarbatu and built his own fort called Yuryev, as well as, allegedly, a congregation in a cathedral dedicated to his patron saint, St. George. The congregation may have survived until 1061, when, according to chronicles, Yuryev was burned to the ground and the Orthodox Christians expelled. As a result of the Baltic Crusades in the beginning of the 13th century, northern Estonia was conquered by Denmark and the southern part of the country by the Teutonic Order and later by the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, and thus all of present-day Estonia fell under the control of Western Christianity. However, Russian merchants from Novgorod and Pskov were later able to set up small Orthodox congregations in several Estonian towns. One such congregation was expelled from the town of Dorpat (Tartu) by the Germans in 1472, who martyred their priest, Isidor, along with a number of Orthodox faithful (the group is commemorated on January 8).Historical background of Orthodoxy in Estonia, Estonian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate website. Little is known about the history of the church in the area until the 17th and 18th centuries, when many Old Believers fled there from Russia to avoid the liturgical reforms introduced by Patriarch Nikon of the Russian Orthodox Church.Russian Old Believers in Estonia , Estonia.eu website. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Estonia was part of the Imperial Russian Empire, having been ceded by the Swedish Empire in 1721 following its defeat in the Great Northern War. During the 1800s, a significant number of Estonian peasants converted to the emperor's Orthodox faith in the (unfulfilled) hope of being rewarded with land.\\"Orthodoxy\\", Estonica - Encyclopedia about Estonia, Estonian Institute. This led to the establishment of the diocese of Riga (in modern Latvia) by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1850. In the late 19th century, a wave of Russification was introduced, supported by the Russian hierarchy but not by the local Estonian clergy. The Cathedral of St. Alexander Nevsky in Tallinn and the P√ºhtitsa Convent in Kurem√§e were built around this time. The road to autonomy As Estonian nationalism grew steadily through the 19th century, the Estonian clergy also aspired for greater independence, starting with an Estonian diocese having a see in Tallinn headed by an Estonian bishop.A Brief History of the Orthodox Church of Estonia , Orthodox Church of Estonia website.

Following the Russian recognition of an independent Estonian state, the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, St. Tikhon, in 1920 recognized the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church (EAOC) as autonomous in economic, administrative and educational concerns, and granted it temporary autocephaly. Archbishop Alexander Paulus was elected and ordained Metropolitan Alexander of Tallinn and All Estonia, head of the EAOC. Prior to this, Soviet Russia had adopted a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist ideology which held as an ideological goal the elimination of religion and its replacement with state atheism.Lenin, Vladimir Ilyich. \\"The Attitude of the Workers' Party to Religion\\", Proletary, No.45, May 13 (26), 1909. In response, Patriarch Tikhon had excommunicated the Soviet leadership in 1918, leading to a period of intense persecution of the Russian Orthodox Church.Pospielovsky, Dimitry V. The Russian Church Under the Soviet Regime, 1917-1983, ch.2, St Vladimir's Seminary Press, Crestwood NY, 1984. In April 1922, Tikhon was imprisoned,\\"Glorification of St Tikhon, the Apostle to America\\", Orthodox Church in America website. and the Estonian clergy lost contact with the Moscow Patriarchate. In September 1922 the Council of the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church petitioned the Patriarch of Constantinople, Meletius IV, to (1) transfer control of the Estonian church from the Russian Orthodox Church to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and (2) clarify the Estonian church's canonical status. In 1923 the Patriarchate of Constantinople issued a tomos (ecclesiastical edict) which brought the EAOC under Constantinople's jurisdiction and granted it autonomy, but not full autocephaly.Ringvee, Ringo. \\"History of the controversy\\", Estonica - Encyclopedia about Estonia, Estonian Institute. In 1935 the church legally registered its statute with the state under the name Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church.Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople. \\"Patriarchal and Synodical Act Concerning the Reactivation of the Patriarchal and Synodical Tomos of 1923 Regarding the Orthodox Metropolitanate of Estonia\\", February 20, 1996. This would have important legal ramifications later. The Estonian church remained a subject of the Constantinople Patriarchate until World War II. By that time, roughly one fifth of the total Estonian population were Orthodox Christians, including Konstantin P√§ts, Estonia's first President.Huang, Mel. \\"Estonia\\", Eastern Europe: an introduction to the people, lands, and culture, Volume 1, p.65, ABC-CLIO Inc., 2006. There were over 210,000 adherents (mostly ethnic Estonians), three bishops, 156 parishes, 131 priests, 19 deacons, and a Chair of Orthodoxy in the Faculty of Theology at the University of Tartu. Notable Orthodox institutions included the Pskovo-Pechersky Monastery in Petseri, two convents--in Narva and Kurem√§e, a priory in Tallinn and a seminary in Petseri.\\"The Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church\\" , Catholic Near East Welfare Association website. Soviet occupation In 1940, Estonia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union, as part of a secret territory-dividing agreement in the German‚ÄìSoviet Nonaggression Pact of August 1939. During the Soviet era, the Estonian church's decision to break with Moscow in favor of Constantinople was ruled illegal. Consequently, the church lost its autonomy and was merged into the Russian Orthodox Church on 28 February 1941. More than half of the Estonian Orthodox clergy resigned in protest. This arrangement proved to be short-lived, as Nazi Germany invaded Estonia in July 1941. This triggered the first schism in the history of Estonian Orthodoxy; in 1942 the church declared its autonomy and renewed relations with the Constantinople Patriarchate, but the Estonian diocese of Narva, mostly populated by ethnic Russians, maintained its connection to the Russian Orthodox Church. In time, Germany's fortunes changed. By early 1944, Russia's Red Army had pushed the invading German troops back to the Estonian border. With Soviet reoccupation imminent, an estimated 100,000 people fled Estonia. Among these were Metropolitan Alexander, who along with roughly 20 priests established the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church in Exile at Stockholm. There, the EAOC in Exile served about 10,000 Estonian Orthodox Christians worldwide. Despite stiff resistance from retreating German troops and Estonian nationalists, the Soviet Union reasserted control over Estonia by autumn of 1944. In 1945, the Moscow Patriarchate liquidated the EAOC, dismissing the remaining clergy and bringing all Estonian congregations into a single diocese within the Russian Orthodox Church. The Estonian Orthodox church remained split as long as Estonia was a member state of the Soviet Union, nearly half a century. Before his death in 1953, Metropolitan Alexander established his congregation as an exarchate under Constantinople. A synod was organized in Sweden in 1958 to maintain the continuity of the church in exile. Within Estonia, the church continued as a diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church.Mite, Valentinas. \\"Estonia: Two Branches of Orthodox Church Seeking to Live in One Country\\", Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty archives, May 10, 2002. In 1978, at the request of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople ruled the 1923 autonomy-granting tomos \\"inoperable\\", meaning Constantinople acknowledged the impossibility of an autonomous Orthodox church operating within the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. Estonian independence and property reform On 20 August 1991, Estonia proclaimed its independence from a disintegrating Soviet Union, restoring the pre-1940 parliamentary government. Divisions within the Orthodox community soon arose; some wanted to remain under the Moscow Patriarchate, while others wished to reinstate the autonomous church in the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. There was a legal aspect to the question as well. Once independent, Estonia began a program of property reform - that is, restoring property expropriated by the Soviets during the occupation. But which church - the one in exile, under Constantinople, or the one in Estonia, under Moscow - was the rightful Estonian Orthodox Church? Early in 1993, the Estonian parliament passed the Churches and Congregations Act, which required all religious institutions to re-register with the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In August of the same year, the church in exile registered the 1935 statute, meaning it considered itself the continuation of the original Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church. In November, the Moscow-led diocese attempted to register the same 1935 statute, but was refused. In response, the diocese sued, attempting to establish that it, and not the church in exile, had maintained continuity of the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church during Soviet occupation. The court rebuffed this effort, ruling that the church in exile was indeed the legitimate successor of the Orthodox church in post- Soviet Estonia, making the EAOC the sole legal heir of all pre-1940 Orthodox church properties in Estonia.Ringvee, Ringo. \\"The Eastern Orthodox Church in the newly independent Estonia ‚Äî the second act of the controversy\\", Estonica - Encyclopedia about Estonia, Estonian Institute. The Moscow Patriarchate strongly opposed this ruling. Of particular concern were about 20 churches - built before the 1940s, and therefore legally the property of the EAOC - run by the Moscow-led diocese. In February 1996, the Constantinople Patriarchate reinstated the 1923 tomos that granted the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church's autonomy and established canonical subordination to the Ecumenical Patriarchate, stating that while the tomos had been declared inoperable in 1978, it \\"was not regarded as being void, invalid or revoked\\". The Moscow Patriarchate, whose Estonian-born Patriarch Alexei II regarded his native Estonia as part of his canonical territory, abruptly severed relations with Constantinople, including a break of communion between the churches. Relations between the conflicting Patriarchates were restored three months later, after meetings in Zurich reached the following agreement: both the autonomous church and the Russian diocese could operate in parallel within Estonia, and individual parishes and clergy would be allowed to choose which jurisdiction to follow. A referendum was held, and a majority of parishes (54 of 84, generally along ethnic lines) chose the autonomous Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church, even though a majority of the parishioners supported the Moscow Patriarchate.Rimestad, Sebastian. \\"Estonian Orthodoxy in the 1990s\\" , Orthodox Church of Estonia website. The Russian diocese continued its campaign to claim legal succession until 2001, when it dropped attempts to register the 1935 statute, and instead applied to the Ministry of Internal Affairs with the name \\"Estonian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate\\". The EAOC protested, saying it was too similar to \\"Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church\\". At first, the government sided with the EAOC, who suggested instead names such as the \\"Russian Orthodox Church in Estonia\\" or the \\"Russian Orthodox Church diocese\\". The Estonian Business Association soon lobbied on behalf of the Moscow Patriarchate, because statements by Russian officials led them to believe a favorable registration would lead to reduced customs tariffs on Estonian- Russian trade. The effort succeeded, and on 17 April 2002 the Russian diocese was registered as the Estonian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate (EOCMP). This did not bring about any of the hoped-for tariff reductions, though.Ringvee, Ringo. \\"Possible solutions to the conflict\\", Estonica - Encyclopedia about Estonia, Estonian Institute. The church today The Orthodox community in Estonia, which accounts for about 16.5% of the total population as of 2011, which has become largest Christian denomination in the country over Lutheranism for the first time in country's modern history, remains divided, with the majority of faithful (mostly ethnic Russians) remaining under Moscow. As of a government report in 2004, about 20,000 believers (mostly ethnic Estonians) in 54 parishes are part of the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox autonomous church under Constantinople, while 150,000 faithful in 30 parishes, along with the monastic community of P√ºhtitsa, are with the Moscow Patriarchate.Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. \\"Estonia\\", Annual Report on International Religious Freedom, 2004, p.324, Government Printing Office, 2005. The issues around property ownership have been mostly settled. In 2002, the EAOC agreed to transfer ownership of churches used by the EOCMP to the state, who in turn would issue 50-year leases on the properties to the EOCMP. In return, the state agreed to renovate EAOC churches.

This work has led to a series of projects ‚Äî so-called parallel actions ‚Äî which seek to blur the boundaries between art and life. During the Presidency of George W. Bush, his work would often make use of political forms as conceptual readymades. Altheimer works in the Situationist tradition with d√©tournement as a key tactic. In recent years the impact of several legal proceedings has foregrounded questions of fictionalisation and identity in his work. He has exhibited and performed internationally in artist-run spaces like Alma Enterprises in London and municipal art spaces like the ICA in London, Angel's Gate in San Pedro and Nikolaj, Center of Contemporary Art in Copenhagen. His films have been broadcast by ZDF, Arte, DR and ORF and screened at several international film festivals. In 2007 Wiener Festwochen commissioned work from Altheimer in combination with performances on the theme of democracy. He currently lives and works in Los Angeles. Biography Ticket to Denmark (2002) In the spring of 2002, as a low-ranking employee of the newly formed Ministry of Refugee, Immigration and Integration Affairs, Altheimer conceived and launched an online dating service called \\"Ticket to Denmark\\" with software similar to that of match.com and graphics by Dennis Orneborg. Danish citizens and immigrants were invited to upload dating profiles. The site listed two main profile options: \\"marry out of love\\" and \\"marry out of convenience\\". The latter option was an opportunity for immigrants for a fast-track citizenship via marriage with Danish citizens, who on their side offered to marry out of convenience. The matching service was put in place to bypass new laws enacted by the Danish parliament and the right-wing Government, under the leadership of Anders Fogh Rasmussen, to curb immigration. The first marriage via Ticket to Denmark was announced in May 2002 ‚Äì between a woman from Africa and a man from Denmark. Altheimer announced that his ambition was to fill the biggest stadium in Copenhagen in a \\"transnational festival of love\\" ‚Äì with throngs of happy couples in the manner of the moonie mass weddings. The first profile on the site was Altheimer's own, as he offered to marry an immigrant despite having a family of his own. The matter was discussed in the Danish Folketing's question time. Altheimer was reported to the police by Morten Messerschmidt, member of the European Parliament for the Danish People's Party.
